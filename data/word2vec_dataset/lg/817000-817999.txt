 In June 2010 , the EyeTV HD product for recording high @-@ definition cable and satellite programming was introduced . Because cable and satellite signals are encoded , the device must be connected to a tuner from a television provider . Then it provides remote controls , recording and DVR @-@ functionality from a connected computer . A Macworld review gave the product four out of five stars . A review in Laptop Magazine gave EyeTV HD 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars . It said the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good , but noted it was only compatible with Macs . 
 The EyeTV <unk> <unk> has four satellite tuners , allowing four channels to be watched simultaneously from different devices . It was introduced in 2014 . A review in Macworld gave it 5 out of 5 stars . The review said Elgato had addressed some of the limitations of prior EyeTV satellite tuners like <unk> Sat / DTT . Pocket @-@ Lint gave it 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars CNET gave it five stars . The EyeTV Sat product , which receives free @-@ to @-@ air television , was introduced in Europe in late 2009 . The Register gave it an 80 % rating , saying that it " works well " and that the documentation did not make it clear how to install the Apple and Windows versions of the software .

 The EyeTV W was introduced in November 2013 . It is a small 44 gram device that receives free digital over @-@ the @-@ air television broadcasts and makes it available to portable devices through a wireless hot spot . A review in Macworld said it was portable , easy to use and had good battery life , but noted that users can 't connect to other wi @-@ fi networks and watch TV at the same time . It gave the product 4 out of 5 stars . An EyeTV Mobile device for iPads was announced at the 2011 International Franchise Conference as the first tuner for the new Freeview system in the United Kingdom . 
 Subsequently the EyeTV Mobile and EyeTV Micro products were released for iPhones and Android respectively . The Micro and Mobile allow users to watch or record free over @-@ the @-@ air television programming from their smartphone . Reviews of the mobile products ranged from 2 out of 5 stars by CNET 4 out of 5 stars in Macworld and 3 out of 5 stars in PC Magazine .

 = Hurricane Juliette ( 1995 ) = 
 Hurricane Juliette was the strongest hurricane and final tropical cyclone of the inactive 1995 Pacific hurricane season . The tenth named storm of the season , Juliette formed on September 16 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico . For the majority of its track , the storm moved toward the west @-@ northwest , and Juliette quickly intensified to major hurricane status . On September 20 , the hurricane reached peak winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . Later it turned toward the northeast , briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula , although the hurricane never affected land . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31 . Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave , and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 12 . Convection increased as it moved through the Gulf of Tehuantepec , and the cloud pattern organized sufficiently to warrant Dvorak classifications for the system on September 15 . Based on the development of a low @-@ level circulation , it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E on September 16 while located around 290 miles ( 465 km ) south of Manzanillo , Mexico . Due to the tropical depression moving over an area of warm water temperatures with favorable upper level outflow , the National Hurricane Center forecast the tropical depression to slowly intensify to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) winds within 72 hours the forecast early on September 16 . 
 The tropical depression was small in size , and moving to the west @-@ northwest , intensified into a tropical storm on September 17 . Juliette quickly organized with a well @-@ defined band of convection drawn into the circulation . The storm quickly intensified , and subsequent to the development of a small eye Juliette attained hurricane status on September 18 , just 42 hours after developing . The eye became better defined as the hurricane moved to the west @-@ northwest , a motion caused by a weak ridge to its north , and Juliette attained major hurricane status early on September 19 . Possibly due to increased northeasterly wind shear from an upper @-@ level trough , Juliette stopped its intensification trend , though as it turned to the west it again re @-@ organized . On September 20 , while located 420 miles ( 680 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas , Juliette attained a peak strength of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) , the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and a Category 4 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . 
 After maintaining its peak intensity for less than 12 hours , Juliette began to weaken due to an eyewall replacement cycle . After turning to the west @-@ northwest , the winds of the hurricane dropped to 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) by September 22 , and the eyewall expanded to about 80 miles ( 130 km ) in diameter . The eyewall contracted to about 40 miles ( 65 km ) , and as a result Juliette re @-@ strengthened to attain winds of 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) . An eastward moving trough of low pressure turned the hurricane to the north @-@ northeast into an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear . Juliette quickly weakened to a tropical storm late on September 24 . The eastward moving trough moved past the storm , resulting in the motion of Juliette turning to a southeast drift . The convection waned and disappeared on September 25 , and on September 26 Juliette dissipated while located 450 miles ( 730 km ) west of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 When the motion of Juliette turned to the northeast , some computer models predicted it to continue northeastward and strike Baja California Sur . As a result , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch as a precautionary measure for portions of the state . When the storm weakened rapidly and turned from the coast , the watch was canceled . Juliette remained away from land masses for its lifetime , and as a result there were no reports of damage or deaths . In southern California , however , the hurricane produced high waves that created dangerous surfing conditions . These waves wiped out a fishing derby . The remnants of Hurricane Juliette moved into New Mexico and western Texas , producing scattered showers and thunderstorms . 
 = Debut ( Björk album ) = 
 Debut is the first international solo studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk . The album was released in July 1993 on One Little Indian and Elektra Records , and was produced by Björk in collaboration with artist Nellee Hooper . Her first recording following the dissolution of her previous band the Sugarcubes , the album departed from the from the rock @-@ oriented style of her previous work and instead drew on an eclectic variety of styles across electronic pop , house music , jazz and trip hop . 
 Debut received widespread critical acclaim from British music critics , though United States reviewers doled out more mixed reviews . Upon its initial release , the album sold far greater than her label predicted , charting at number three in the United Kingdom and 61 in the United States . It was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the United States , where it remains her best @-@ selling album to date . 
 Five singles were released from Debut : " Human Behaviour " , " Venus as a Boy " , " Play Dead " , " Big Time Sensuality " and " Violently Happy " . All five singles charted in the United Kingdom with only " Human Behaviour " , " Violently Happy " and " Big Time Sensuality " charting on dance and modern rock charts in the United States . 
 = = Background and production = = 
 While still performing as the vocalist of Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes , Björk approached both <unk> Jónsson of Bad Taste and producer Derek Birkett of One Little Indian Records with a demo cassette of her own songs on which she had been working . These demos included versions of songs that would appear on Debut , including " The Anchor Song " and " Aeroplane " . After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus , she moved to London , England , where she and Birkett worked on the details of what would become Debut . Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube 's music was not her taste , and that her contact with London 's underground club culture of the late 1980s / early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity . She said : " ... as a music nerd , I just had to follow my heart , and my heart was those beats that were happening in England . And maybe what I 'm understanding more and more as I get older , is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me . Brian Eno . Acid . Electronic beats . Labels like Warp . " 
 Many of the songs on the album were written years before Björk moved to London , including " Human Behaviour " which was written when the singer was a teenager . Björk had put aside these songs stating that " I was in punk bands and [ the songs ] weren 't punk . " Björk had already written half the songs for Debut in some form , but had nothing recorded . With no producer in line to work with , she continued to compose songs with 808 State member Graham Massey in a friend 's home in Manchester where she would write songs that would be included on later albums , including " Army of Me " and " The Modern Things " . 
 While creating more electronic based tracks with Massey , Björk developed a desire to work with a jazz producer . Wanting to work with a harpist , producer Paul Fox who had previously worked with the Sugarcubes , introduced her to jazz harpist Corky Hale . Hale was going to politely refuse to work with Björk until her stepson , who was a Sugarcubes fan , insisted that she take the job . Björk recorded a handful of jazz standards with Hale including " I Remember You " and an early version of " Like Someone in Love " . Fox also introduced Björk to Oliver Lake and the pair recorded another jazz standard , " Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries " , with Lake 's jazz group for the John Hughes film Curly Sue . Hughes turned down the idea of the recording for the film , but it led to the idea of Debut being produced by Fox and arranged by Oliver Lake . Björk contracted Lake for working with some session saxophonists in London for Debut . Lake 's contributions to the album are heard on tracks including " Aeroplane " and " The Anchor Song " . 
 Björk was intending to have several producers work on the album , but this idea never came to fruition . Björk was then going to have the album produced with Paul Fox until she was introduced to producer Nellee Hooper by her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp . Hooper had previously produced albums by Soul II Soul , Sinéad O 'Connor and Massive Attack , which made Björk skeptical about working with him , stating that " I thought Nellee was too ' good taste ' for my liking . But then I met him , got to know him , [ and ] got to hear about his fabulous ideas ... " Björk and Hooper 's recording ideas were very similar , which led to the decision to end production work with Massey and Fox . Hooper introduced Björk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries who gave Debut a modern style with the use of keyboards and synthesizers . Hooper produced the first ten tracks on the album , while Björk co @-@ produced " Like Someone in Love " with Hooper and produced " The Anchor Song " solely herself . Björk and Hooper spent many sessions in the studio working on Debut until the album was finished in early 1993 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The music of Debut draws on an eclectic variety of sources . <unk> described the album as " [ melding ] alternative dance and electronic with a graceful flow . " It is said that the album " [ shook ] the status quo " of the contemporary musical climate , in the sense that its eclectic experimental pop leanings distanced it from the music " primarily being made by men with guitars " that was popular at the time , like grunge and the burgeoning <unk> . Michael Cragg of The Guardian has described it as an " indefinable conflation of electronic pop , trip @-@ hop , world music and otherworldly lyrics " . AllMusic described the album 's style as " creative , tantalizing electronic pop . " The The New York Times review stated that " Debut often recalls the early 70 's jazz @-@ fusion of bands like Weather Report . But where these fusionists combined jazz harmony with funk and acid rock , Björk marries her scat @-@ vocalese and off @-@ kilter melodies with the futuristic textures and programmed percussion of today 's techno and acid house . Furthermore , The Face 's Mandi James felt Debut was " a delightful fusion of thrash metal , jazz , funk and opera , with the odd dash of exotica thrown in for good measure . " The singer also took influence from the music of Bollywood and " the buzz of London nightlife . " 
 A main element of Debut 's sound is its incorporation of dance music , reflecting the contemporary styles of London 's club culture , with which the singer had established close ties . While the echoes of subgenres such as Euro @-@ house , acid jazz , worldbeat and IDM can be noted , " they hadn ’ t yet broken free from the primal thump of four @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor house music . " Tom Breihan of Stereogum asserts that " even as dance music took on all these new sounds , that basic pulse was still the most important thing about it , and that pulse reverberates all through Debut . " Björk said : " A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats , but I think they ’ re beats that are more reflective of daily life — like life in the middle of the day in a city , as opposed to the night life of the clubs . " The " four @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor " style — typical of house music — is mostly evident in songs such as " Human Behaviour " , " Crying " , " Big Time Sensuality " , " There 's More to Life Than This " and " Violently Happy " . Björk felt house music was " the only pop music that [ was ] truly modern , " stating in 1993 that it was " the only music where anything creative is happening today . " 
 Her departure from the guitar @-@ driven rock of her previous works stemmed from the feeling that it was outdated , arguing that " as soon as any form becomes traditional , like the guitar , bass and drums , then people start to behave traditionally , " and that " it 's really difficult to get a band to stay on the edge using typical bass , guitar and drums set @-@ up because it tends to lapse into a predictable form . " Being a fan of dance music since the early days of acid house , she thus used it as the framework for her songs . However , in a Rolling Stone interview she also stated that " [ she ] was more influenced by ambient music than what you 'd call dance music , and by things that were happening way back in Chicago and Detroit that were sensual and daring and groundbreaking in their time ; " also adding : " Ninety @-@ five percent of the dance music you hear today is crap . It 's only that experimental five percent that I 'm into — the records that get played in clubs after 7 o 'clock in the morning , when the DJs are playing stuff for themselves , rather than trying to please people . " Björk 's <unk> of England 's dance culture also extended to her looks , with her style at the time now considered a representative of 1990s acid house fashion . 
 Björk 's adoption of " the contemporary musical environment of London " also included the burgeoning trip @-@ hop scene of bands like Portishead and Massive Attack . Co @-@ producer Nellee Hooper had been a member of Bristol 's " Wild Bunch " collective , a group that took from acid jazz , funk and hip hop and catalyzed the appearance of trip @-@ hop . Thus , the electronically backed songs of the album that are not dance @-@ oriented have a more trip @-@ hop style sound . These non @-@ dance tracks have been described as having a " more delicate atmosphere " . i @-@ D noted that Debut — and Björk 's following album , Post — also integrate ambient techno and jungle , stating that they " couldn 't have existed without Aphex Twin , Black Dog , A Guy Called Gerald , LFO and all the other producers who reshaped the language of music since 1988 . " Also present are elements of jazz , with WUOG stating that " while many see Debut as Björk ’ s <unk> album , it may also be her <unk> . " Likewise , Brad Shoup of Stereogum wrote that " though her electronic bent gets the most attention , it 's her interest in jazz that courses through the set . " Tim Perlich of Now felt Debut " bridges jazz and pop " , and Simon Reynolds characterized it as " jazzy love songs tinged with an oceanic feeling . " 
 = = = Songs = = = 
 For the most part , the lyrics of Debut are concerned with love . The love themes range from " flesh @-@ and @-@ blood passion " for another person to the love of life itself . According to i @-@ D , with a couple of exceptions , the songs of Debut fell into two types : " those where Björk addressed the listener as someone in pain and told them fireworks would light their nights and all would be well ; " and " songs where she sang about her own pain . " The Face stated that the album 's lyrics " [ consolidated ] her love affair with language , " while The Sunday Times felt that Björk " rigorously [ avoided ] the obvious " by using lyrics that do not rhyme . 
 Album opener " Human Behaviour " features a " bouncing riff " sampled from Antônio Carlos Jobim , with " its syncopated beat consigned to a venerable orchestral instrument , the timpani . " Its lyrics refer to Björk 's experience as a child , finding the behaviour of adults " rather chaotic and nonsensical , " instead finding harmony with other children , nature and animals . Inspired by naturalist David Attenborough , she sings from the point of view of an animal , with its opening line being " If you ever get close to a human / And human behaviour / Be ready , be ready to get confused " . Following track " Crying " shows a contradiction between its " bubbly , shiny @-@ surfaced acid disco @-@ pop " sound and lyrics that describe the turmoil of feeling alienated in a big city . " Venus as a Boy " — considered an ambient track by Rolling Stone — reflected Björk 's newly found interest in Bollywood , having befriended people of Indian origin in London , most notably <unk> Singh . In a spontaneous fashion , the song 's strings — and also those of " Come to Me " — were recorded by a <unk> studio orchestra in India . The lyrics of the track are about the sensitivity of her then boyfriend Dominic Thrupp , with lyrics that have been described as " sweet and just the slightest bit naughty . " In the dancefloor @-@ oriented " There 's More to Life Than This " , Björk leaves romance behind , with " her mischievous side [ coming ] to the fore " . Its lyrics were inspired by a party she attended and promptly left . " Like Someone in Love " is one of the several jazz standards the singer recorded with Corky Hale , with her voice " cradled in harp and swoony strings . " 
 " Like Someone in Love " is followed by the techno @-@ tinged " Big Time Sensuality " in an " intentionally startling " leap . An " anthem to emotional bravery , " it contains lyrics described as " simple but passionate " , concerning Björk 's relationship with her co @-@ producer Nellee Hooper . The songs " The Anchor Song " , " One Day " , and " Aeroplane " draw on what Björk refers to as her more " academic , clever side " . " One Day " also presents a sudden shift of mood , featuring a " gently pulsing bass " that builds into an " <unk> impassioned , <unk> pop euphoria . " " Aeroplane " is one of Debut 's most musically complicated pieces with off @-@ kilter arrangement from Oliver Lake ; its backdrop is inspired by exotica music . This song is also about Thrupp , written when he was living in the United Kingdom and Björk still lived in Iceland . " Come to Me " features a " hazy musical backdrop of raindrop synths , padded drums and sweeping strings " ; lyrically , it explores a " sensually intense need to nurture . " " Violently Happy " is the most hardcore techno track on the album . In the song , over " brisk house beats " Björk sings in a stammering fashion , as she " struggles to express feelings of excitement so intense she seems on the brink of leaping out of her skin . " As a gesture to inexpressible feelings , the song samples one syllable and " [ turns ] it into a stuttering vocal tic . " Closing track " The Anchor Song " is the only one in the album solely produced by Björk . One of the three songs to appear on her first demo cassette of 1990 , it features Oliver Lake playing the saxophone , in an arrangement that replicated the " ebb and tide of an ocean 's peaking tops , an image reinforced by Björk 's fiercely patriotic lyrics .

 At the 1994 Grammy Awards , Michel Gondry 's music video for " Human Behavior " was nominated for best Best Short Form Music Video , but lost to Stephen Johnson 's video for the Peter Gabriel song " Steam " . At the 1994 Brit Awards , Björk won awards for " Best Newcomer " and " Best International Female " . Shortly after the Brit Awards , Björk was sued by Simon Fisher , a musician she collaborated with in 1990 . Fisher 's claim stated that he had co @-@ written " Human Behaviour " , " Venus as a Boy " , " Crying " , and " Aeroplane " and sought damages of over ₤ 20 @,@ 000 . Hooper and Björk went to court with Fisher shortly after the release of Björk 's album Post . Judge Robin Jacob found Fisher only seeking credit for one song instead of four and cleared Hooper and Björk of all charges stating that Fisher 's charges rendered him " unreliable , diffuse , and vague " . 
 Critical reaction to Debut was generally positive . The British music press spoke positively about the album , with Q giving it four out of five stars calling it " a surprising , playful collection " while the NME wrote that Debut was " an album that believes music can be magical and special . " The Independent gave Debut a favorable review noting that Björk had " fashioned an amazing array of contrasting arrangements , whose musical diversity never interferes with their clarity of vision . " American reception was more mixed . Musician magazine praised the vocals of the album , stating " what makes [ Björk 's ] singing memorable isn 't the odd assortment of growls , moans and chirps she relies upon , but the emotions those sounds convey . " The New York Times described Debut as " an enchanting album " . American critic Robert Christgau gave the album a " neither " rating , indicating an album that " may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two . Then it won 't " . A negative review came from Rolling Stone who gave the album two stars out of five calling the album " utterly disappointing " blaming producer Nellee Hooper , suggesting he " sabotaged a ferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry . " Michele Romero of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C , saying , " On a few songs , [ Björk 's ] breathy <unk> is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical drone of Sugarcube @-@ like techno @-@ tunes . But most of Debut sounds annoyingly like the monotonous plinking of a deranged music box . Wind it up if you like -- eventually it will stop . " Debut rated highly in British end of year polls . The NME ranked Debut at number one on their list of " Top 50 LPs of 1993 " . Melody Maker placed the album at number six on their list of " Albums of the Year for 1993 " calling it " a fantastic debut " . In 1994 , Q included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993 . Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly , stating that if she 'd " delivered exactly the same album and I came from Nottingham , I 'd have got completely different reviews , normal down @-@ to @-@ earth ones " and that Debut " was a bit of a rehearsal and it 's really not that good . I can do much better . " 
 Later reception was also positive . In Spin magazine 's alternative record guide , the album received a rating of nine out of ten stating that the choice of Nellee Hooper as producer was a " stroke of genius " and Björk 's vocals were " awe @-@ inspiring " . Heather Phares of AllMusic gave the album a five @-@ star rating , stating that Debut is " Possibly her prettiest work , Björk 's horizons expanded on her other releases , but the album still sounds fresh , which is even more impressive considering electronic music 's whiplash @-@ speed innovations . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Debut is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of 1993 and the 1990s in general . In 2013 , John Hamilton of Idolator called the album " highly influential " , and wrote " in spite of its advancing age , Debut ’ s futurism has aged exquisitely . " The album has also been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop . Stereogum 's Tom Breihan wrote : " House music didn 't quite have critical respect before Björk came along , and plenty of American writers didn ’ t know what to make of the sound of Debut when it came out . [ ... ] Debut didn 't just establish Björk ; it helped make sounds like that cool to a segment of the music @-@ dork universe that might ’ ve remained deaf to its charms otherwise . At this point , it 's virtually impossible to imagine a big publication slamming an adventurous dance @-@ pop album for " cheap electronic gimmickry , " and Debut is a big part of that change . Celebrating the album 's twenty @-@ year anniversary , Emily Mackay of NME wrote the album " put the lie to the post @-@ grunge assumption that heartfelt , passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak , creating a new breed of singer @-@ songwriter . " Dubbing it an " influential masterpiece " , she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A. , Grimes , These New Puritans and Tune @-@ Yards , writing : " It 's in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you 'll find [ Björk 's ] influence — not , as many would have you believe , in every pretty @-@ faced girl with a big voice . " Mackay also noted that the album 's legacy echoes through dance @-@ pop artists like Lady Gaga and Robyn . 
 Furthermore , in 2013 Michael Cragg of The Guardian pointed out that " two decades after its release , the Icelandic artist 's first album has never sounded more relevant . " He argued that Debut " reconstructed pop music " , also writing that " while pop in 2013 looks back to the early 90s for inspiration , Björk 's ability on Debut to innovate by using disparate genres without losing a sense of her own identity should be the blueprint for any new artist with desires to break the mould . " In the album 's entry in their list of " The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " — where the album was included at number 46 — , NME claimed that " Debut achieved the remarkable feat of turning an idiosyncratic vocalist from a feted cult band into a significant global pop star , without losing one iota of the experimental mindset and creative cool that made her so special . " In 2005 , Björk stated that she thought the album wasn 't as strong as her later efforts : " It 's hard to judge yourself but I don 't think [ Debut and Post are ] my best . Debut was the album that went the highest up there in terms of what is ' Bjork music ' . But I think that the persona I created , which was entirely accidental , is better captured on the later albums " .

 = M @-@ 11 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 11 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area . The highway runs through the western and southern sides of the metro area , starting over the border in Ottawa County at an interchange with Interstate 96 ( I @-@ 96 ) . It runs through both rural woodlands and busy commercial areas before it terminates at another interchange with I @-@ 96 in Cascade Township . Locally known as Wilson Avenue and 28th Street , the trunkline is listed on the National Highway System , M @-@ 11 carries between 8 @,@ 000 and 42 @,@ 000 vehicles on average each day . 
 When the original state trunklines were designated , an M @-@ 11 ran the length of the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Indiana state line to Mackinaw City . That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then @-@ newly created US Highways . A second highway was given the M @-@ 11 designation at that time in the Saline area . This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954 . The current M @-@ 11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of US Highway 16 ( US 16 ) in Michigan . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The western terminus is at exit 24 on I @-@ 96 , one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east of Marne . In Ottawa County , the road is called Ironwood Drive . Beginning at the Kent County border , the street is called Remembrance Road ( in honor of those who died in battle ) . From its western terminus , the road angles southeast – northwest for about a mile and a half ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) . Then M @-@ 11 turns south on Wilson Avenue to run north – south through Walker . Wilson Avenue intersects M @-@ 45 ( Lake Michigan Drive ) in the <unk> Business District . South of Lake Michigan Drive , the trunkline continues on Wilson Avenue through the edge of a rural area . The highway runs through forest land near Millennium Park until it crosses the Grand River at I @-@ 196 . 
 Past I @-@ 196 , M @-@ 11 curves to run east – west and becomes 28th Street . Wilson continues southwards as a local road and 28th Street is the route through Grandville and Wyoming . Chicago Drive runs under 28th Street in Grandville ; there is a ramp from eastbound Chicago Drive to eastbound 28th Street , but all other connections are through the " 28th Street Cutoff " to the east of the grade @-@ separated junction . Continuing eastward through Wyoming , M @-@ 11 passes through that city 's central business district . The highway intersects US Highway 131 and crosses into Grand Rapids at Division Avenue . Near Kalamazoo Avenue , 28th Street passes the Indian Hills Golf Course . From Breton Avenue eastward , 28th Street is dominated by retail establishments as it continues into Kentwood . M @-@ 11 meets an intersection with East Beltline Avenue near the Woodland Mall . East Beltline carries M @-@ 37 through the eastern side of the Grand Rapids metro area , and M @-@ 44 north of 28th Street . M @-@ 11 continues eastward to its terminus at exit 44 on I @-@ 96 while 28th Street continues farther east to Cascade Road . 
 M @-@ 11 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 11 were the 41 @,@ 214 vehicles daily between Kalamazoo and Breton avenues in Grand Rapids ; the lowest counts were the 8 @,@ 153 vehicles per day in Ottawa County . All of M @-@ 11 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 The first M @-@ 11 originally ran along Lake Michigan between the Indiana state line near New Buffalo and Mackinaw City on July 1 , 1919 . On November 11 , 1926 , the New Buffalo – Benton Harbor segment was used for US 12 and the Watervliet – Mackinaw City section was used for US 31 ; between Benton Harbor and Watervliet , M @-@ 11 was used for a concurrent US 12 / US 31 . Streets are still designated as Old M @-@ 11 in places such as <unk> Township . 
 Immediately after the debut of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , M @-@ 11 was designated from M @-@ 50 at Napoleon to US 112 in Saline . The last section of this highway was fully paved between Bridgewater and Saline in late 1948 or early 1949 . In the middle of 1954 , M @-@ 92 was extended southward from Chelsea to Manchester . From there , that highway replaced M @-@ 11 west to Bridgewater before turning south to Clinton ; at the same time , the remainder of M @-@ 11 was removed from the state highway system and the designation was decommissioned . 
 = = = Current designation = = = 
 The modern M @-@ 11 was added to the state highway system as a component of M @-@ 114 c . 1930 . By 1942 , the trunkline was completed and reassigned a Bypass US 16 designation , until the mainline US 16 was rerouted over the bypass in 1953 . In the latter half of 1961 , the M @-@ 11 designation was first assigned in the Grand Rapids area along the current routing when US 16 was moved to the newly opened I @-@ 96 freeway . The routing has remained unchanged since . 
 = = = Memorial designations = = = 
 The current M @-@ 11 follows Remembrance Road , Wilson Avenue and 28th Street . The first two of these names were chosen to memorialize the roadway in honor of local people . Remembrance Road was dedicated in 1923 on the initiative of the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution . They planted 231 elms in a double row on each side of the highway and erected a boulder bearing a bronze plaque dedicated to the veterans of Kent County . Wilson Avenue was named for Samuel H. Wilson , a local realtor . He had developed a series of local residential subdivisions in the area up until his 1931 death , In 1942 , the county road commission named Wilson Avenue in his honor to comply with a state law requiring roads that benefitted from state funds to have proper names .

 = Wessagusset Colony = 
 Wessagusset Colony ( sometimes called the Weston Colony or Weymouth Colony ) was a short @-@ lived English trading colony in New England located in present @-@ day Weymouth , Massachusetts . It was settled in August 1622 by between fifty and sixty colonists who were ill @-@ prepared for colonial life . The colony was settled without adequate provisions , and was dissolved in late March 1623 after harming relations with local Native Americans . Surviving colonists joined Plymouth Colony or returned to England . It was the second settlement in Massachusetts , predating the Massachusetts Bay Colony by six years . 
 Historian Charles Francis Adams , Jr. referred to the colony as " ill @-@ conceived , " ill @-@ executed , [ and ] ill @-@ fated " . It is best remembered for the battle ( some say massacre ) there between Plymouth troops led by Miles Standish and an Indian force led by Pecksuot . This battle scarred relations between the Plymouth colonists and the natives and was fictionalized two centuries later in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's 1858 poem The Courtship of Miles Standish . 
 In September 1623 , a second colony led by Governor @-@ General Robert Gorges was created in the abandoned site at Wessagusset . This colony was rechristened as Weymouth and was also unsuccessful , and Governor Gorges returned to England the following year . Despite that , some settlers remained in the village and it was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The colony was coordinated by Thomas Weston , a London merchant and ironmonger . Weston was associated with the Plymouth Council for New England which , fifteen years earlier , had funded the short @-@ lived Popham Colony in modern Maine . During the period when the Pilgrims were in the Netherlands , Weston helped to arrange the colonists ' passage to the New World with help from the Merchant Adventurers . Historian Charles Francis Adams , Jr. writing in the 1870s glowingly called him a " sixteenth century adventurer " in the mold of John Smith and Walter Raleigh and that his " brain teemed with schemes for deriving sudden gain from the settlement of the new continent " . In later years , Plymouth Governor William Bradford called him " a bitter enemy unto Plymouth upon all occasions . " 
 The primary purpose of Weston 's new colony was profit , rather than the religious reasons of the Plymouth settlers , and this dictated how the colony would be assembled . Weston believed that families were a detriment to a well @-@ run plantation and so he selected able @-@ bodied men only but not men experienced in colonial life . In total , there were several advanced scouts and fifty to sixty other colonists . The final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer . The party was outfitted with enough supplies to last the winter . 
 = = First Wessagusset colony = = 
 An advance team of several settlers arrived at the Plymouth Colony in May 1622 . They had voyaged to the new world on board the Sparrow , an English fishing @-@ vessel which was sailing to the coast of modern @-@ day Maine . After arriving at the coast of Maine , they traveled the final 150 miles ( 240 km ) in a shallop with three members of the Sparrow 's crew . These colonists stayed only briefly in Plymouth before scouting the coast in their shallop to find a site for their colony . After finding one , they negotiated with the sachem <unk> for the land and returned to Plymouth , sending the shallop and her small crew back to the Sparrow , and awaited the remainder of the colonists . 
 The main body of colonists set off from London in April 1622 on board two ships , the Charity and the Swan . Richard Greene , Thomas Weston 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , was the initial leader of the group . The group arrived in Plymouth in late June and moved into their settlement the following month . By the end of September , the colony was established , the Swan moored in Weymouth Fore River , and the Charity returned to England . 
 At first , the relationship between the two groups was cordial and the men of the Wessagusset assisted Plymouth with their harvest , but they were accused of stealing from the elder colony . Shortly after relocating to Wessagusset , angry Indians complained to Plymouth that the colonists were stealing their corn . In response , Plymouth could only send a " rebuke " to the new colony . Because of the disorder of the colony , as subsequently reported by Plymouth 's Governor Bradford , Wessagusset was consuming food too quickly and it became apparent that they would run out before the end of the winter . In addition , Plymouth was also low on supplies due to spending additional time during the growing season building fortifications , rather than growing crops . To prevent hunger or famine for both colonies , Plymouth and Wessagusset colonists organized a joint trading mission with the natives with goods brought by the Wessagusset colonists . That trading mission was somewhat successful and the two colonies split the proceeds . In November , Greene died and John Sanders was made governor of the colony . By January , the colonists continued to trade with the natives for food , but at a severe disadvantage . This drove up the barter @-@ price of corn and they were forced to trade their clothes and other needed supplies . Some colonists entered a form of servitude , building canoes and performing other labors for the natives , in exchange for food . Ten colonists died . After an incident where one settler was caught stealing by the natives , the colonists hanged him in their view as a show of good faith . However , sources disagree whether the man hanged was the culprit and the colonists may have hanged an older , possibly dying man , instead . The legend that the Wessagusset colonists hanged an innocent man was later popularized by a satirical depiction of this event in Samuel Butler 's 1660s poem <unk> . In February , Sanders petitioned to Plymouth for a joint attack on the natives , but this was rejected by Plymouth 's governor . 
 = = = Killings at Wessagusset = = = 
 Throughout the winter , tensions continued to build between the settlers at Wessagusset and Plymouth and the natives . Perhaps in response to the Wessagusset thefts against them , there was at least once instance where a native was caught stealing from Plymouth . Near the end of the winter , the natives near Wessagusset moved some of their huts to a swamp near the colony . At least some of the colonists felt that they were under siege . 
 One colonist at Wessagusset , seeing these signs and other indications of hostility , fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack . Adding to his desperation and the perception of imminent hostility , he was pursued by natives during his flight . Arriving at Plymouth on March 24 , he met with the Governor and town council . It is unclear whether this colonist 's report was the tipping point , or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack . Plymouth 's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit , a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine , of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth . The threatening tribes , he was told , was led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> tribes from as far away as Martha 's Vineyard . In either case , Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset . They arrived there on March 26 . 
 Standish called all of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense . The following day , several natives including the local chief , Pecksuot , were at Wessagusset . Historical sources give different accounts of the killings . In some manner , four of the natives , including the local chief , were in the same room as Standish and several of his men . One source , from the 1880s , suggests that it was the natives that arranged to be alone with Standish to allow them to attack the colonist . Others sources state that it was Standish who had invited the natives into the situation on peaceful pretenses . When four of them , including the local chief , were in a room within the village , Standish gave the order to strike , quickly killing Pecksuot with his own knife . Several other natives in the village were attacked next ; only one escaped to raise the alarm . As many as five Englishmen were also killed in the brief battle and one native 's head was cut off , to be displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others . 
 In 1858 , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow included a fictionalized depiction of the killings in his epic poem , The Courtship of Miles Standish . In his version , the Indians are depicted as begging for weapons to use against other tribes . Standish responds by offering them bibles . After being the target of boasts and taunts by the Indians , Standish attacks first : 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Following the brief conflict , Standish offered to leave several soldiers to defend the colony , but the offer was rejected . Instead , the colonists divided : some , including John Sanders , returned to England in the Swan , while others remained behind and joined the Plymouth colony . By spring of 1623 , the village was empty and the colony was dissolved . Thomas Weston arrived in Maine several months later , seeking to join his colony , only to discover that it was already failed . Some of his former settlers apparently had gone north to Maine , and were living on House Island in Casco Bay in a home built by explorer Capt. Christopher Levett , who had been granted land to found an English colony . ( Levett 's settlement also failed , and the fate of Weston 's men is uncertain . ) 
 Due to the fighting at Wessagusset , Plymouth trade with the Indians was devastated for years . Local tribes which had previously been favorable to Plymouth , began to forge bonds with other tribes in defense against the English . This latent hostility would eventually boil over during the Pequot War and later , King Philip 's War . Historians differ on whether the conflict could have been avoided or the colony saved . Some historians saw the preemptive strike as a necessary one , " saving the lives of hundreds " , while others see it as a sad misunderstanding . Speaking shortly after the 150th anniversary of the colony , historian Charles Francis Adams summarized the Wessagusset experience as " ill @-@ conceived , " ill @-@ executed , [ and ] ill @-@ fated " . 
 = = Second Wessagusset colony = = 
 At approximately the same time , the Plymouth Council for New England was sponsoring a new colony for New England . A patent for a settlement covering 300 square miles ( 780 km2 ) of what is now north @-@ east of Boston Bay was given to an English captain and son of Sir Ferdinando Gorges , Robert Gorges . This settlement was intended to be a spiritual and civil capital of the council 's New England colonies . Gorges was commissioned as Governor @-@ General with authority over Plymouth and presumably future colonies . His government was also to consist of a leadership council , of which Plymouth 's Governor Bradford would be a member . Unlike Weston , who had brought only working men , Gorges brought families intending for a permanent settlement . And unlike the Puritans , Gorges brought the Church of England with him , in the form of two clergymen who would oversee the spiritual health of the region . 
 Gorges arrived in Massachusetts in September 1623 , only four months after Weston 's colony collapsed . Instead of founding his colony at the location described in the patent , he instead chose the abandoned settlement at Wessagusset for his site . It was rechristened Weymouth after Weymouth , Dorset , the town where the expedition began . Over the following weeks , he visited Plymouth and ordered the arrest of Thomas Weston who had arrived in that colony in the Swan . This was his only official act as Governor @-@ General . Weston was charged with neglect in his colony and with selling weapons were supposed to have been used for the defense of the colony . Weston denied the first charge , but confessed to the second . After consideration , Gorges released Weston " on his word " and he eventually settled as a politician in Virginia and Maryland . 
 After wintering in Weymouth , Gorges abandoned his new colony in the spring of 1624 due to financial difficulties . Most of his settlers returned to England , but some remained in as colonists in Weymouth , Plymouth , or Virginia . The remaining Weymouth settlers were supported by Plymouth until they were made part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 . Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop visited the settlement in 1632 . In time , the location of the original settlement was lost to history and development . The location of the original fort was not rediscovered until 1891 .

 = Sitric Cáech = 
 Sitric Cáech , also known as Sitric <unk> , ( Old Norse : <unk> , died 927 ) was a Viking leader who ruled Dublin and then Viking Northumbria in the early 10th century . He was a grandson of Ímar and a member of the Uí Ímair . Sitric was most probably among those Vikings expelled from Dublin in 902 , whereafter he may have ruled territory in the eastern Danelaw in England . In 917 , he and his kinsman Ragnall ua Ímair sailed separate fleets to Ireland where they won several battles against local kings . Sitric successfully recaptured Dublin and established himself as king , while Ragnall returned to England to become King of Northumbria . In 919 , Sitric won a victory at the Battle of Islandbridge over a coalition of local Irish kings who aimed to expel the Uí Ímair from Ireland . Six Irish kings were killed in the battle , including Niall Glúndub , overking of the Northern Uí Néill and High King of Ireland . 
 In 920 Sitric left Dublin for Northumbria , with his kinsman Gofraid ua Ímair succeeding him as king . That same year he led a raid on Davenport , Cheshire , perhaps as an act of defiance against Edward the Elder , King of the Anglo @-@ Saxons . In 921 Ragnall ua Ímair died , with Sitric succeeding him as King of Northumbria . Though there are no written accounts of conflict , numismatic evidence suggests there was a Viking reconquest of a large part of Mercia in the following few years . An agreement of some sort between the Vikings of Northumbria and the Anglo @-@ Saxons was achieved in 926 when Sitric married a sister of Æthelstan , perhaps Edith of Polesworth . Sitric also converted to Christianity , though this did not last long and he soon reverted to paganism . He died in 927 and was succeeded by his kinsman Gofraid ua Ímair . Sitric 's son Gofraid later reigned as King of Dublin , his son Aralt as King of Limerick , and his son Amlaíb Cuarán as king of both Dublin and Northumbria . 
 = = Background = = 
 The ruling Vikings of Dublin were expelled from the city in 902 by a joint force led by Máel <unk> mac Flannacán , overking of Brega and Cerball mac Muirecáin , overking of Leinster . Those Vikings that survived the capture of the city split into different groups ; some went to France , some to England , and some to Wales . Archaeological evidence suggests Dublin remained occupied in the years immediately following this expulsion , perhaps indicating only the ruling elite were forced to leave . However , Viking raids on Irish settlements continued , and in 914 , a large Viking fleet travelled to Waterford . The arrival of this fleet marked the re @-@ establishment of Viking rule over parts of Ireland , and was followed by more Vikings settling in Limerick the following year . 
 The main historical sources for this period are the Norse sagas and the Irish annals . Some of the annals , such as the Annals of Ulster , are believed to be contemporary accounts , whereas the sagas were written down at dates much later than the events they describe and are considered far less reliable . A few of the annals such as the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland and the Annals of the Four Masters were also complied at later dates , in part from more contemporary material and in part from fragments of sagas . According to Downham : " apart from these additions [ of saga fragments ] , Irish chronicles are considered by scholars to be largely accurate records , albeit partisan in their presentation of events " . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Sitric is presumed to have left Dublin with the rest of the ruling Vikings in 902 . Coins dating from the period bearing the legend " Sitric Comes " ( Earl Sitric ) , and the mintmark " <unk> " ( Shelford ) , have been found as part of the <unk> Hoard , perhaps indicating that he ruled territory in the eastern Danelaw during his exile from Ireland . The Anglo @-@ Saxons conquered all of the Danelaw south of the Humber by 918 , but there is no mention of Earl Sitric in English sources , suggesting he was no longer ruling there at the time . 
 The earliest mention of Sitric in the Irish Annals is in 917 when he and Ragnall , another grandson of Ímar , are described as leading their fleets to Ireland . Sitric sailed his fleet to Cenn Fuait in Leinster , and Ragnall sailed his fleet to Waterford . Niall Glúndub , overking of the Northern Uí Néill saw these Vikings as a threat , and he marched an army south to repel them . The Vikings fought against the men of the Uí Néill at Mag <unk> in County Tipperary and claimed victory , though only through timely reinforcement by Ragnall and his army . This was followed by another at the Battle of <unk> ( also known as the Battle of Cenn Fuait ) , against Augaire mac Ailella , overking of Leinster , who died in the battle . Augaire 's death marked the end of effective opposition to the Vikings ' return to Ireland . Sitric led his men on a triumphant return to Dublin , where he established himself as king , while Ragnall returned to England and soon became King of Northumbria . 
 According to Downham , the departure of Ragnall and his contingent of warriors may have emboldened Niall Glúndub to try to expel the Uí Ímair from Ireland once again . In 919 Niall led a coalition of northern Irish kings south to Dublin . The forces of Sitric and Niall met near Islandbridge in modern @-@ day County Dublin ( dated 14 September by the Annals of Ulster ) . The resulting Battle of Islandbridge was an overwhelming victory for Sitric and his forces , with Niall falling in battle alongside one of his kinsmen . Five other kings , and a kinsman of the ruler of the Southern Uí Néill also died fighting against Sitric 's army . 
 In 920 the Annals of Ulster report that Sitric left Dublin " through the power of God " . Sitric travelled to Northumbria where he assumed the kingship of Northumbria , succeeding his kinsman Ragnall who died the following year . Sitric was followed as King of Dublin by his brother or cousin Gofraid ua Ímair . In 920 Ragnall had submitted to Edward the Elder , King of the Anglo @-@ Saxons . That same year , following his departure from Dublin , Sitric led a raid in Davenport , Cheshire , in violation of the terms of submission agreed between Ragnall and Edward . Smyth has suggested that this was an act of defiance by Sitric , indicating to Edward that he would not submit to him like Ragnall . 
 Neither the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle nor Æthelweard 's Chronicon makes mention of Sitric in the years 921 – 924 , i.e. between his installation as King of <unk> and the death of Edward the Elder . However , there are coins in existence which were minted at Lincoln during the period that bear Sitric 's name . These are an important piece of evidence since they suggest Sitric ruled a large area south of the Humber , a claim contradicted by the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle which says that all the ' Danes ' in Mercia ( i.e. south of the Humber ) submitted to Edward in 918 . These coins might indicate Viking reconquest of a large area in the years 921 – 924 , which if it did happen went unremarked upon by the Chronicle . Edward 's control of Mercia likely stretched the kingdom 's resources to breaking point , allowing Sitric to exploit the ill @-@ will towards Edward that existed among the populace there , with Edward being unable to effectively oppose Sitric . Downham suggests that the silence of the Chronicle might be due to Edward 's failing power in the latter years of his reign , and its tendency to only record successes and not failures . His death in 924 is not recorded by a number of important Frankish , Welsh and Irish annals , suggesting a fall in importance and standing from the zenith of his power in 920 . 
 Edward the Elder 's successor , Æthelstan , met with Sitric at Tamworth in 926 . The Chronicle does not mention the reason for the meeting , but it reports that an unnamed sister of Æthelstan was married to Sitric . Several years previously , in 918 , Æthelstan 's predecessor had used a royal marriage to bring Mercia under Wessex control . According to Smyth , the fact the marriage between Sitric and Æthelstan 's sister occurred at the old Mercian royal centre at Tamworth reinforces the suggestion that this marriage was supposed to perform as a similar function to the one in 918 . The agreement reached at Tamworth seems to have necessitated Sitric 's conversion to Christianity , though he soon reverted to paganism . Sitric died the following year and was succeeded by his kinsman Gofraid ua Ímair . The Annals of Ulster describe his death : 
 = = Family = = 
 In the annals Sitric is sometimes identified by the use of one of his epithets , or by the use of " ua Ímair " , meaning " grandson of Ímar " , but never with a patronymic . As such , it is not possible to identify which of the three known sons of Ímar ( Bárid , Sichfrith or Sitriuc ) - if any - was the father of Sitric . One possible reason for the lack of a patronym might be that Sitric was the child of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin , or who spent most of his time outside Ireland , thus making Sitric 's legitimacy to rule Dublin dependent the identity of his grandfather , not his father . Another possibility is that Sitric was a grandson of Ímar through a daughter , again with his right to rule dependent on his grandfather . Sitric 's kinsmen Ímar , Ragnall , Amlaíb and Gofraid are the other known grandsons of Ímar identified by the use of " ua Ímair " . All except for Amlaíb ruled as either King of Dublin or King of Northumbria at one time or another . 
 The Annals of Clonmacnoise mention two sons of Sitric , Auisle and Sichfrith , falling at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937 . Another son , Aralt , ruled as King of Limerick for an unknown length of time until his death in battle in 940 . Sitric 's son Amlaíb Cuarán ( d . 981 ) reigned twice each as King of Dublin and King of Northumbria , and may have been the basis of the Middle English romance character <unk> the Dane . Gofraid ( d . 954 ) may have been another son though his father his only named as " Sitric " so it is not possible to say conclusively he was a son . According to the Orkneyinga saga , a daughter of Sitric named Gytha was married to Olaf Tryggvason , King of Norway . According to Hudson , this is unlikely to be correct , since the marriage is said to have occurred sixty @-@ three years after Sitric 's death . It is much more likely that Gytha was actually a granddaughter of Sitric through his son Amlaíb Cuarán . 
 Sitric married an unnamed sister of Æthelstan in 926 . Historians generally describe her as Æthelstan 's only full sister , but Maggie Bailey points out that this rests on the late testimony of William of Malmesbury , and the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle makes no such distinction when recording her marriage to Sitric . William did not know her name , but traditions first recorded at Bury in the early twelfth century identify her as Saint Edith of Polesworth . The truth of his identification is debated , but regardless of her name but it is likely that she entered a nunnery in widowhood . According to some late sources , such as the chronicler John of Wallingford , Amlaíb Cuarán was the son of Sitric and this West Saxon princess .

 Mykola <unk> Leontovych ( LE @-@ ən @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , Ukrainian : Микола <unk> <unk> ; sometimes spelled <unk> ; Dec 13 [ O.S. Dec 1 ] 1877 – January 23 , 1921 ) was a Ukrainian composer , choral conductor , and teacher of international renown . His music was inspired by Mykola Lysenko and the Ukrainian national music school . Leontovych specialized in a cappella choral music , ranging from original compositions , to church music , to elaborate arrangements of folk music . 
 Leontovych was born and raised in the Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire ( present @-@ day Ukraine ) . He was educated as a priest in the Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Theological Seminary and later furthered his musical education at the Saint Petersburg Court Capella and private lessons with Boleslav Yavorsky . With the independence of the Ukrainian state in the 1917 revolution , Leontovych moved to Kiev where he worked at the Kiev Conservatory and the Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama . He is recognized for composing " Shchedryk " in 1904 ( which premiered in 1916 ) , known to the English @-@ speaking world as " Carol of the Bells " or " Ring , Christmas Bells " . He is known as a martyr in the Eastern Orthodox Ukrainian Church , where he is also remembered for his liturgy , the first liturgy composed in the vernacular , specifically in the modern Ukrainian language . He was assassinated by a Soviet agent in 1921 . 
 During his lifetime Leontovych 's compositions and arrangements became popular with professional and amateur groups alike across Ukraine . Performances of his works in western Europe and North America earned him the nickname " the Ukrainian Bach " in France . Apart from his very popular Shchedryk , Leontovych 's music is performed primarily in Ukraine and the Ukrainian diaspora . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 Mykola Leontovych was born on Dec 13 [ O.S. Dec 1 ] 1877 in the <unk> community , near the village of <unk> , in the Podolia region of Ukraine ( then a part of the Russian Empire ) . His father , grandfather , and great grandfather were village priests . His father , Dmytro <unk> Leontovych , was skilled at singing and playing cello , double bass , harmonium , violin , and guitar , in addition to directing a school choir . Leontovych received his first musical lessons from him . His mother , Mariya <unk> Leontovych , was also a singer . 
 Other members of Leontovych 's family also grew up to have careers in music . His younger brother became a professional singer , his sister Mariya studied singing in Odessa , his sister <unk> studied fortepiano at the Kiev Conservatory , and his sister <unk> also knew how to play several musical instruments . 
 In the summer of 1879 Dmytro Leontovych was moved to a new parish located in the village <unk> where he would spend his childhood . Then in 1887 Leontovych was admitted to <unk> gymnasium . Due to financial problems a year later , however , his father transferred him to the <unk> Spiritual Beginners School , whose pupils received full financial support . At the school Leontovych mastered singing , and was able to freely read difficult passages from religious choral texts . 
 = = = Theological seminary = = = 
 In 1892 , Leontovych began his studies at the theological seminary in Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi , which both his father and grandfather had attended . His younger brother Oleksandr was enrolled as well , graduating two years after Mykola . 
 During his studies there , Leontovych continued to advance his skills on the violin and learned to play a variety of other instruments . He also participated in the seminary ’ s choir , and when an orchestra was formed during his third year of study , Leontovych joined , playing the violin until his graduation . Leontovych studied music theory and started writing choral arrangements as a student at the seminary . 
 When the seminary ’ s choir director died , the school administration requested that Leontovych take over this position . As the conductor of the choir , Leontovych added secular music to the repertoire of traditional church music . This included Ukrainian folk songs arranged by Mykola Lysenko , <unk> <unk> , and himself . Leontovych graduated from the Kamianets @-@ <unk> Theological Seminary in 1899 and broke the family tradition by becoming a music teacher instead of a priest . 
 = = = Early musical career and family = = = 
 At the time , a career in music in Ukraine meant having an unstable income , causing Leontovych to seek employment wherever he could find it . Leontovych worked in Kiev , Yekaterinoslav , and Podolia <unk> over the next few years in order to remain gainfully employed . His first position after graduating was in a secondary school in the village of <unk> ( present @-@ day Vinnytsia Oblast ) as a vocal and math teacher . During this time Leontovych continued to transcribe and arrange folk songs . He completed his " First compilation of songs from Podolia " and began working on his second compilation . He also inspired the children at the school to sing in the choir and play in the orchestra . He would later write a book about this as a professor at the Kiev Conservatory , titled " <unk> я <unk> <unk> у <unk> <unk> " ( How I organized an orchestra in a village school ) . 
 After several conflicts with the school 's administration , Leontovych got a new job as a teacher of church music and calligraphy at the Theological College in <unk> . Besides working with the college choir , Leontovych organized an amateur orchestra that often performed at college events . As he did earlier with choirs , Leontovych included arrangements of folk songs among the usual religious works sung in theological schools . These included arrangements by Mykola Lysenko , his own choral arrangements of folk songs , and entirely original works . One such work was based on a poem by Taras Shevchenko titled “ <unk> <unk> <unk> ” ( Oh my evening star ) . 
 During this period Leontovych met a <unk> girl named Claudia <unk> <unk> , whom he married on March 22 , 1902 . The young couple 's first daughter , Halyna , was born in 1903 . They later had a second daughter named <unk> . 
 Financial hardships prompted Leontovych to accept an offer to move to the city of Vinnytsia to instruct at the Church @-@ Educators ' College . Again he organized a choir and , later , a concert band , with which he performed both secular and spiritual music . In 1903 he published his “ Second compilation of songs from Podolia ” which he dedicated to Mykola Lysenko . 
 In 1903 and 1904 , during his vacation from the Church @-@ Educators ' College , Leontovych traveled to Saint Petersburg . There he attended lectures held at the St. Petersburg Court Capella , which was associated with composers Maksym Berezovsky , Dmytro <unk> , and Mikhail Glinka . He studied music theory , harmony , and polyphony with Semen <unk> , and choral performance with <unk> , both of whom were well known at the time . On April 22 , 1904 , he earned his credentials as a choirmaster of church choruses . 
 Again , disputes with the administration of the college resulted in Leontovych seeking new employment . In the spring of 1904 , he left Podolia and moved to the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine , where he became a teacher of vocal and instrumental music in a school for railroad workers ' children . During the Russian Revolution of 1905 , Leontovych organized a choir of workers that performed in meetings . These works included arrangements of Ukrainian , Jewish , Armenian , Russian , and Polish folk songs . Leontovych 's activity caught the attention of local authorities , and in the spring of 1908 he was forced to move back to his native Podolia region to the city of Tulchyn . 
 = = = Tulchyn period = = = 
 Leontovych 's move to Tulchyn marked the beginning of a period of compositional maturity and major artistic achievements in the life of the composer . 
 In Tulchyn , Leontovych taught vocal and instrumental music at the Tulchyn <unk> Women 's college to the daughters of village priests . There he met composer Kyrylo Stetsenko who was a student of Mykola Lysenko and also specialized in choral music . Stetsenko lived in a nearby village at the time where he was working as a priest , and their acquaintance developed into a lasting friendship that influenced Leontovych 's music . Stetsenko was the first critic of Leontovych 's music , saying , " Leontovych is a famous music expert from Podolia . He recorded many folk songs ... These songs are harmonized for mixed choir . These <unk> have revealed the author to be a great expert of both choral singing and theoretical studies " . Leontovych also transitioned to more renowned music during his choir performances , such as Russian composers Mikhail Glinka , Alexey <unk> , and Peter Tchaikovsky in addition to Ukrainian composers Mykola Lysenko , Kyrylo Stetsenko , and Petro <unk> . 
 From 1909 , he studied under musical theoretic Boleslav Yavorsky , whom he periodically visited in Moscow and Kiev over the next twelve years . Leontovych also became involved with theatrical music in Tulchyn and its community life by taking charge of a local organization called " <unk> " , meaning " <unk> " . 
 This period in his career was among the most productive , as he created numerous choral arrangements . These included his famous " Shchedryk " , as well as " <unk> <unk> " ( The roosters are singing ) , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( A mother had one daughter ) , " <unk> " ( Little Dudka player ) , " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( Oh , the star has risen ) , and others . In 1914 Stetsenko convinced Leontovych to have his music performed by the student choir of the Kiev University under the leadership of Alexander Koshetz . On December 26 , 1916 , the performance of his arrangement of " Shchedryk " brought Leontovych great success from the public in Kiev and raised the interest of intellectuals . 
 = = = Career in Kiev = = = 
 During the October Revolution and the establishment of the Ukrainian People 's Republic in 1918 , Leontovych relocated without his family to Ukraine 's capital Kiev , where he was active as both a conductor and composer . Several of his pieces gained popularity among professional and amateurs groups alike , who added them to their repertoire . In the beginning of 1919 the rest of his family also relocated to Kiev . During this period Leontovych also began teaching choir conducting alongside Hryhoriy <unk> at the Kiev Conservatory , and also taught at the Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama . Leontovych was one of the organizers of the first Ukrainian State Orchestra . He participated in the founding of the Ukrainian Republic Capella of which he was the commissioner . 
 = = = Move back to Tulchyn and assassination = = = 
 During the conquest of Kiev on August 31 , 1919 , the Denikin Army persecuted the Ukrainian intelligentsia . Because of this , Leontovych returned to Tulchyn with his family . There he started the city 's first music school , since the college where he had worked was closed down by the Bolsheviks . He also began to work on his first major symphonic work , the opera Na <unk> <unk> ' ( On the water nymph 's Great Day ) . 
 During the night of January 22 – 23 , 1921 , Mykola Leontovych was murdered by <unk> ( Soviet state security ) agent Afanasy <unk> . Leontovych was staying at the home of his parents , whom he was visiting for the Orthodox Feast of the Nativity ( December 25 of the Julian calendar – which on the Gregorian calendar , adopted by the USSR only in 1918 , falls in January ) . The undercover <unk> had also asked to stay the night at the house and shared a room with Mykola . At dawn he shot the composer ( who died of blood loss a few hours later ) after robbing his family . 
 Several facts point to a political motive behind the assassination . Leontovych 's participation in the independence movement , such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella , aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state , earned him many enemies . His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying , shortly before his death , that he had documents to leave the country to Romania , and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert . However , after returning from tea following the concert , Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers . His plans to leave the country , along with the fact that he was killed by a Soviet agent , also indicate political reasons for his death . 
 = = Character = = 
 Mykola Leontovych was highly critical of himself . According to his first biographer <unk> ' Chapkivskyi , a contemporary of the composer , Leontovych would sometimes work on one choral setting without letting anyone else see it for up to four years . After the publication of his " Second Compilation of Songs from Podolia " , he changed his mind and was not fully satisfied with it , and as a result he bought all 300 copies and had them destroyed . 
 Chapkivskyi also described <unk> as having a shy personality , saying " He abstained from fame , feared attention and advertisement . " On the other hand , Chapkivskyi claimed that Leontovych 's jealousy , fear of competition , and fear of non @-@ acceptance from the established musical society , caused the music of Leontovych to be little known . 
 <unk> <unk> of the Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi State Pedagogical University writes that " all of [ Leontovych 's ] contemporaries called him a quiet , gentle person . He was not an active leader of the national @-@ revolutionary movement , which revealed in the years of 1917 @-@ 1921 a whole handful of prominent fighters for the Ukrainian republic , " revealing that the composer was politically quiet , but not indifferent . 
 Leontovych 's friend , O. <unk> , recalls that the composer was " always full of humor ; spoke so that everyone was laughing to tears , but he remained serious and stayed calm . " Stetsenko also described Leontovych to be a " witty storyteller " and that his students at the Church Educator 's School in Tulchyn were " in love with him " because of his storytelling . 
 = = = Religious views = = = 
 Mykola Leontovych grew up in a highly religious environment . He was a member of the Orthodox Church , descended from a line of village priests . He was also a graduate of the <unk> Theological Seminary in Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi , which for the most part trained Orthodox Christian clergy . 
 As a person with a professional theological education , Leontovych kept up with the movement of the establishment and recognition of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church , which was reestablished in 1918 . The composer 's output during this period became rich in new sacred music , following the examples of Kyrylo Stetsenko ( a close friend of Leontovych , also an orthodox priest and composer ) and Alexander Koshetz . Leontovych 's works form this time included " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( On the Resurrection of Christ ) , " <unk> <unk> ’ я <unk> " ( Praise ye the name of the Lord ) , and " <unk> <unk> " ( Oh quiet light ) , among others . A milestone in the development of Ukrainian spiritual music was the composition of his liturgy , which was first performed in the Mykolaiv Cathedral at the Kiev <unk> Lavra on May 22 , 1919 . 
 = = Commemoration = = 
 On February 1 , 1921 , nine days after Leontovych 's death , a large number of artists , professors , and students of the Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama in Kiev gathered to commemorate him , as is expected according to Christian tradition . They established the Committee for the Memory of Mykola Leontovych , which later became the All @-@ Ukrainian Mykola Leontovych Music Society , and promoted Ukrainian music until 1928 . 
 Ukrainian writer and politician of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , Pavlo <unk> , was an admirer of Leontovych and wrote about the composer 's death in prose . Poets Maksym <unk> and Mykola <unk> also dedicated poetry to him . 
 The name of Leontovych is carried by musical groups , such as the Leontovych <unk> Capella , and by educational institutions such as the Vinnytsia College of Arts and Culture . Streets in Kiev and other cities have been named after him . There is a memorial museum dedicated to him in the city of Tulchyn , and another was established in 1977 in the village of <unk> where he was buried . 
 In 2002 , to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the composer 's birth , the city of Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi held an all @-@ Ukrainian scientific conference entitled " Mykola Leontovych and modern education and science , " with guests from the Ukrainian ministry of education and science , the Ukrainian composers ' Union , and many local authorities . During this event the city held a ceremonial opening of a memorial plaque to the composer , placed next to the old building formerly used by the <unk> Theological Seminary . 
 = = Music = = 
 Mykola Leontovych specialized in a cappella choral music . He is remembered today mostly through the musical works he left behind , which include over 150 choral compositions . These range from artistic arrangements of folk songs , religious works ( including his liturgy ) , cantatas , and choral compositions set to the words of various Ukrainian poets . His two most famous works are the choral miniatures " <unk> " and " <unk> " . 
 Leontovych also commenced work on an opera ( Na <unk> <unk> ’ - On the Water Nymph 's Easter ) based on Ukrainian myths and the works of Borys <unk> . By the end of 1920 he had finished the first of three acts . However , Leontovych was murdered before he could complete the opera . Attempts to complete and edit the opera were made by Ukrainian composer Mykhailo <unk> . Composer <unk> <unk> and poet <unk> <unk> used the musical material of the unfinished opera to make a one act operetta ; this premiered in 1977 at the Kiev State Opera and Ballet Theatre , one hundred years after Leontovych 's birth . The North American premiere took place in Toronto on April 11 , 2003 . 
 One of the largest influences in Mykola Leontovych 's music is that of Mykola Lysenko who is considered " the father of Ukrainian classical music " . Leontovych admired Lysenko 's music ever since he was a student at the Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Theological Seminary , when he had the seminary 's choir perform the composer 's music . Since then he would perform Lysenko 's music in concerts wherever he worked . 
 = = = Shchedryk / Carol of the Bells = = = 
 Mykola Leontovych 's " Shchedryk " is the composer 's most well @-@ known piece . In its English version as a Christmas carol , it is known as the holiday favorite " Carol of the Bells " . It is famous for its four @-@ note ostinato motif and has been arranged over 150 times since 2004 . The original Ukrainian text of " Shchedryk " used <unk> , a shifting of accents within each measure between 6 / 8 and 3 / 4 , which is lost in the English versions . The most popular English adaptation was composed in 1936 by Peter J Wilhousky who was influenced by the culture of his Eastern European parents and the traditional Christian story of carols ringing out at the birth of Jesus , although other English adaptations of the song were also made in 1947 by M. L. Holman , 1957 and 1972 . 
 The song has been used many times in the soundtracks for films and television . For example , it was used in the box office hits The Santa Clause and Home Alone , Will Vinton 's award @-@ winning A Claymation Christmas Celebration , and as a parody called " Carol of the <unk> " in The O.C. show 's " The <unk> That Almost Wasn 't " . It has also been arranged and performed by many groups , regardless of singing style or genre , ranging from classical ( Vienna Boys Choir ) , to traditional music groups ( Celtic Woman ) , to pop singers and groups ( Jessica Simpson , Destiny 's Child ) . 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 Leontovych had an original style . Many of his works have " deft use of imitative counterpoint " and impressionistic harmony . He had a strong desire for his music to arouse the senses , especially sight , saying , " I 'm interested in which colors you used for high tones , and which for the low ones . I myself often think about that , to combine sound and color . " 
 His choral compositions feature rich harmony , vocal polyphony , and imitation . His earlier choral arrangements of folk songs were primarily strophic arrangements of the melody . As the composer gained more experience , the structure of his choral compositions and arrangements of folk songs became more frequently intertwined with text . 
 Leontovych arranged many Ukrainian folk songs , creating artistically independent choral compositions based on their melodies and lyrics . He followed the traditions of improvisation of Ukrainian <unk> , who would interpret every new strophe differently . He also employed humming and the variability in timbre of singers ' voices as techniques in reaching a desired emotional or sensual effect . 
 A central topic of Leontovych 's work is choral music about everyday life . His music frequently reflect actual actions and events . An example of this is his <unk> “ <unk> <unk> за <unk> ” ( Oh there behind the mountain ) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo and the rest of the voices of the choir gradually come in , reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in . Then , a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir , recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year 's Eve . 
 = = = Reception and popularity = = = 
 For most of his career , Leontovych kept his music to himself , only performing it during his own concerts . This was because of the composer 's highly self @-@ critical and shy personality . Leontovych 's first critic was his friend and fellow priest and composer Kyrylo Stetsenko , who described him to be " a great expert of both choral singing and theoretical studies " . He also convinced Leontovych to publish his music and have it performed by the Kiev University . 
 The successful debut of " Shchedryk " earned Leontovych popularity among specialists and fans of choral music in Kiev . Leontovych 's mentor @-@ turned @-@ coworker at the Kiev Conservatory , Boleslav Yavorsky , also positively evaluated his newly written works . During another concert , Leontovych 's " <unk> " , set to a poem by Mykola <unk> , gained great popularity . 
 After reviewing Leontovych 's " Second Compilation of Songs from Podolia " , Lysenko wrote : " Leontovych has an original , illustrious gift . In his arrangements I found separate passages , movement of voices , which later developed in a <unk> weaved musical network . " 
 The increase in popularity of Leontovych 's music was aided by the head of the Ukrainian National Republic , Symon Petliura , who created and sponsored two choirs that would promote the awareness of and the culture of Ukraine . One choir headed by Kyrylo Stetsenko toured across Ukraine , while the Ukrainian Republic Capella headed by Alexander Koshetz toured Europe and the Americas . Performances by the Ukrainian Republic Capella made Leontovych known throughout the western world . In France Leontovych earned the nickname , " Ukrainian Bach " . On October 5 , 1921 the Capella performed " Shchedryk " in the Carnegie Hall in New York City . In 1936 , ethnically Ukrainian Peter J. Wilhousky , who worked for radio NBC , wrote his own lyrics for the song , which became known as the " Carol of the Bells " . 
 Apart from " Shchedryk " , or the Carol of the Bells , Leontovych 's music is currently performed mostly in Ukraine and few recordings are dedicated to him exclusively .

 = The Boat Race 1964 = 
 The 110th Boat Race took place on 28 March 1964 . Held annually , the event is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . The Oxford crew was the heaviest in Boat Race history . The race was won by Cambridge by six @-@ and @-@ half lengths . Cambridge won the Women 's Boat Race . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities , followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the previous year 's race by five lengths , while Cambridge led overall in the event with 60 victories to Oxford 's 48 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . This year 's women 's race was the first to be held since 1952 . 
 Writing in the Financial Times , Joseph <unk> noted that the Boat Race was subsidised by The Varsity Match every year . Despite Oxford being " firm favourites " upon their arrival at the Tideway , Cambridge put in better performances in training , and by the time of the race were considered the favourites themselves . The main race was umpired for the eighth and final time by the former Olympian Kenneth Payne who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races . 
 = = Crews = = 
 Although it was the heaviest Cambridge crew ever , they weighed an average of 13 st 4 @.@ 75 lb ( 84 @.@ 5 kg ) , almost 3 pounds ( 1 @.@ 4 kg ) per rower less than Oxford , who were the heaviest crew in Boat Race history . Oxford saw two former Blues return in Miles Morland and Duncan Spencer , while Cambridge 's crew included four Boat Race veterans in Donald Legget , Mike Bevan , John Lecky and Christopher Davey . Lecky was a Canadian international rower who had won a silver medal in the men 's eight at the 1960 Summer Olympics . Six of Oxford 's crew came from Keble College , five of those schooled at Eton College .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . With a " calm , following wind " , the race commenced at <unk> , and within a minute , Cambridge had a quarter @-@ length lead before Oxford closed the gap at Craven Cottage . The Light Blues reached the Mile Post three seconds ahead and crossed over to the midstream . By Harrods Furniture Depository they had extended their lead out to two lengths and passed below Hammersmith Bridge a further half @-@ length ahead . Despite a surge from Oxford , Cambridge were sixteen seconds ahead at Chiswick Steps and increased the gap to twenty seconds by Barnes Bridge . Cambridge won by six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 18 seconds , 23 seconds ahead of Oxford . 
 The victory was Cambridge 's 61st in the contest , taking the overall score to 61 – 48 . The Cambridge boat club president and stroke Christopher Davey said : " Everything went as planned , but Oxford hung on more than I would have liked at the end . I would have liked to have taken it to 10 lengths if possible but Oxford kept going splendidly at the end . " 
 In the 20th running of the Women 's Boat Race , Cambridge triumphed , their third consecutive victory . 
 = Social Credit Board = 
 The Social Credit Board was a committee in Alberta , Canada from 1937 until 1948 . Composed of Social Credit backbenchers in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta , it was created in the aftermath of the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers ' revolt . Its mandate was to oversee the implementation of social credit in Alberta . To this end , it secured the services of L. Dennis Byrne and George Powell , two lieutenants of social credit 's British founder , C. H. Douglas . 
 After requiring all Social Credit Members of the Legislative Assembly ( MLAs ) to sign loyalty oaths to it , the Social Credit Board proceeded to recommend radical legislation regulating banking , taxing banks , and restricting freedom of the press and access to courts . Most of this legislation was either disallowed by the federal government or ruled ultra vires ( beyond the powers of ) the province by the Supreme Court of Canada ; these defeats and the advent of World War II made the Social Credit Board increasingly irrelevant . In its later years it became highly anti @-@ Semitic , and it was dissolved by the government of Ernest Manning in 1948 . 
 = = Beginnings = = 
 William Aberhart 's Social Credit League won the 1935 Alberta general election on a platform of ending the Great Depression by implementing social credit , a new economic theory that posited that poverty could be ended by increasing citizens ' purchasing power . By 1937 , many Social Credit backbenchers in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta were becoming frustrated with the government 's lack of progress . This frustration became the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers ' revolt . As a condition of regaining the rebels ' support , Aberhart agreed to create the Social Credit Board , to be composed of five Social Credit MLAs and responsible for the implementation of social credit in Alberta . The chair of the Social Credit Board was Glenville MacLachlan ; he and three other members had been insurgents during the revolt , while the fifth member , Floyd Baker , had remained loyal to Aberhart . 
 The Social Credit Board was tasked with the appointment of a Social Credit commission , composed of experts on social credit , to advise on the implementation of social credit in Alberta . Most Social Crediters hoped that C. H. Douglas , the British founder of the social credit movement , would agree to head this commission . Douglas refused MacLachlan 's entreaties to do so , but sent two representatives , George Frederick Powell and L. Dennis Byrne , in his stead . One of Powell 's first acts was to demand that all Social Credit MLAs sign an oath of loyalty to the Social Credit Board , which almost all did . 
 = = Proposals , disallowance , and judicial defeat ( 1937 – 1938 ) = = 
 The first round of legislation recommended by the commission and subsequently passed by the legislature included the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act , which required every bank and all their employees to be licensed by the provincial government and to be overseen by a Social Credit Board @-@ appointed directorate , the Bank Employees Civil Rights Act , which prohibited unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating legal proceedings , and amendments to the Judicature Act prohibiting court actions alleging that any of Alberta 's legislation was unconstitutional . Lieutenant @-@ Governor of Alberta John Campbell Bowen , asked to give royal assent to these bills , asked Attorney @-@ General John Hugill if he considered them to be valid under the Canadian constitution . Hugill responded in the negative and , after being asked to do so by Aberhart , resigned . Aberhart appointed himself Attorney @-@ General and told Bowen that it was his opinion that the laws were constitutional . Bowen provided royal assent , but all three acts were subsequently disallowed by the federal government . 
 In 1937 's Bankers ' Toadies incident , Powell ( along with Social Credit whip Joe Unwin ) was convicted of criminal libel , sentenced to six months hard labour , and deported to the United Kingdom . The charges stemmed from a pamphlet listing nine men as " bankers ' toadies " and advocating their " extermination " . 
 The Social Credit Board 's second round of bills included a rewritten version of the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act . The previous version had been disallowed partly on the basis that , under the British North America Act , 1867 , banking was a responsibility of the federal government , and the government of Alberta therefore lacked the authority to regulate it . In an attempt to address this concern , the new version substituted the words " credit institutions " for " banks " . The Social Credit Board 's proposals also included the Bank Taxation Act , which imposed extremely high taxes on banks operating in Alberta , and the Accurate News and Information Act , which severely restricted freedom of the press . All of these bills were passed by the legislature . Bowen , not wishing to have more laws to which he had assented disallowed , reserved assent from all three until the Supreme Court of Canada could comment on their constitutional validity . It did so in 1938 's Reference re Alberta Statutes , which found all three to be unconstitutional . The Social Credit Board 's major initiatives had failed . 
 = = Decline and dissolution ( 1939 – 1948 ) = = 
 World War II further reduced the Social Credit Board 's importance , as implementation of social credit took a backseat to the war effort . Instead of proposing new policy , the board devoted itself to propaganda ; its members spoke across the province about social credit , and it distributed vast numbers of pamphlets and leaflets ( 272 @,@ 900 in 1939 ) . When Aberhart died in 1943 , he was replaced by Ernest Manning , who was by this time considerably less open to radical social credit proposals than Aberhart had been . He soon transferred many of the Social Credit Board 's responsibilities to the new department of Economic Affairs , of which L. D. Byrne was the deputy minister . 
 Byrne , the remaining Douglas lieutenant after Powell 's deportation , shared both Douglas 's economic theories and his antisemitism . Under his influence , the Social Credit Board began to propagate anti @-@ Jewish conspiracy theories , including those espoused by the Russian forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion . Its 1943 report alleged " a plot , world @-@ wide in scope , deliberately engineered by a small number of ruthless international financiers " , most of whom were Jewish . Its 1947 report repeated these allegations , and also proposed a new voting system in which voters would state their choices publicly , and be taxed only for those government programs they supported during the election . Political parties were to be abolished in favour of " leagues of electors " , and all farmland was to be appropriated by the government . Manning , <unk> neglectful of the Social Credit Board to this point , took this as " a direct challenge to his leadership , a shot across the bow " . He quickly introduced a resolution in the legislature to " condemn , repudiate , and completely dissociate " the legislature from " any statements or publications which are incompatible with the established British ideals of democratic freedom , or which endorse , excuse , or incite anti @-@ Semitism or racial or religious intolerance in any form " . In November 1947 he announced that the Social Credit Board would cease to exist effective March 1948 , and in February 1948 he asked for and received Byrne 's resignation as deputy minister of Economic Affairs . 
 Despite its beginnings as a vehicle of intended economic revolution , the board achieved nothing of lasting importance . Once its early efforts were foiled by the federal government and the courts , it ceased to have much influence . By 1948 , the dire conditions that had sparked Albertans ' enthusiasm for radical economic reform had vanished , and with it their interest in social credit . While the Social Crediters remained in government until 1971 , the revolutionary spirit of the 1930s was all but forgotten : as Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel notes , post @-@ war Social Credit " had been transformed from a mass , eclectic movement for social reform led by monetary reformers to a relatively small government party that enjoyed considerable support from various sectors of the Alberta population for its judicious combination of right @-@ wing rhetoric and social service and road @-@ building programs . " The Social Credit Board , with its reform mandate and its direct pipeline to Douglas , was no longer needed . 
 = Farewell ( Rihanna song ) = 
 " Farewell " is a song by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna , from her sixth studio album Talk That Talk ( 2011 ) . The song was written by Ester Dean and Alexander Grant , with production helmed by Grant under his production name Alex da Kid . Instrumentation consists of a piano . 
 Music critics were divided in their response to " Farewell " . Rihanna 's vocal performance was praised and criticized alike , with some critics citing the song as her best vocal performance to date , while others wrote it lacked any sense of feeling . It also received comparisons to Beyoncé 's " Halo " and Adele 's " Someone like You " , as well as Rihanna 's own " Fire Bomb " ( from her album Rated R ) .

 The song was written by Ester Dean and Alexander Grant , with production helmed by Grant under his production name Alex da Kid . " Farewell " contains lyrics that revolve around saying goodbye to a lover who is not able to be physically present in the relationship for long periods of time . Instrumentation consists of a piano . The song was composed in the key of G major and set in common time signature , and has a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute . Rihanna 's vocals span from the low note of G3 to the high note of D5 . Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine noted that the song 's structure was similar to Beyoncé Knowles ' song " Halo " , while Priya Elan for NME wrote that the song was reminiscent of Rihanna 's song " Fire Bomb " , from her fourth studio album , Rated R ( 2009 ) . Lipshutz also noted that Rihanna delivered the bridge with " powerhouse " vocals . A reviewer for Flavour Magazine wrote that Rihanna displayed " great vocals " in the lyric " Somebody 's gonna miss you ... Farewell .

 Music critics were divided on " Farewell " ; Rihanna 's vocal performance was praised as well as criticized . Kyle Jamon for <unk> Magazine wrote that " Farewell " is a " fitting finish to an album that presents a brand new Rihanna . " He praised the song for not incorporating a " morbid " feel or " dark " tones , which were prominent on Rated R. T 'Cha Dunlevy for The Montreal Gazette described the song as " epic , " and is a " stark contrast " to the songs which appear before it on the album , specifically " Roc Me Out " and " Watch n ' Learn " . A reviewer for Flavour Magazine described the song as " epic " and " heart @-@ curdling " . The reviewer concluded by writing that " Farewell " is a " winning end " to Talk That Talk . Pip Ellwood for Entertainment @-@ Focus wrote that the song " puts paid to any criticism concerning Rihanna 's vocal ability . " Claire Suddath for Time Entertainment did not praise nor criticize " Farewell , " but simply wrote that it is an " obligatory torch ballad that every female pop singer is required to include on an album these days . " 
 Andy Kellman from Allmusic was critical of the ballads " Farewell " and " We All Want Love " , labeling the former as " bombastic " and the latter " drippy . " Jon Caramanica for The New York Times called " Farewell " the most " bombastic " song on Talk That Talk , and cited his reason as " it 's tough to tell if the words have feeling , because Rihanna 's voice doesn 't . " Nathan Slavik for DJ Booth was critical of the song , writing that it lacked any originality . Slavik continued to write that the song is not necessarily bad , but it is " not good in any meaningful way .

 = Octopus card = 
 The Octopus card is a reusable contactless stored value smart card for making electronic payments in online or offline systems in Hong Kong . Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory 's mass transit system , the Octopus card system is the second contactless smart card system in the world , after the Korean <unk> , and has since grown into a widely used payment system for all public transport in Hong Kong , leading to the development of Oyster Card in London . 
 The Octopus card has also grown to be used for payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong , from convenience stores , supermarkets , fast @-@ food restaurants , on @-@ street parking meters , car parks , to other point @-@ of @-@ sale applications such as service stations and vending machines . 
 The Octopus card won the Chairman 's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance 's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for , among other things , being the world 's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system . According to Octopus Cards Limited , operator of the Octopus card system , there are more than 20 million cards in circulation , nearly three times the population of Hong Kong . The cards are used by 95 % of the population of Hong Kong aged 16 to 65 , generating over 12 million daily transactions worth a total over HK $ 130 million . 
 Octopus Card Limited 's and the cards ' slogan is Making Everyday Life Easier , which is also part of the corporation 's mission statement . 
 = = History = = 
 Previously , Hong Kong 's Mass Transit Railway ( MTR ) adopted a system to recirculate magnetic plastic cards as fare tickets when it started operations in 1979 . Another of the territory 's railway networks , the Kowloon @-@ Canton Railway ( KCR ) , adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984 , and the stored value version was renamed Common Stored Value Ticket . In 1989 , the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to Kowloon Motor Bus ( KMB ) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations and to Citybus , and was also extended to a limited number of non @-@ transport applications , such as payments at <unk> and for fast food vouchers . 
 The MTR Corporation eventually decided to adopt more advanced technologies , and in 1993 announced that it would move towards using contactless smartcards . To gain wider acceptance , it partnered with four other major transit companies in Hong Kong to create a joint @-@ venture business to operate the Octopus system in 1994 , then known as Creative Star Limited . 
 The Octopus system was launched after three years of trials on 1 September 1997 . Three million cards were issued within the first three months of the system 's launch . The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete , which drove commuters to switch quickly . Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997 . With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule , there was a belief that the older Queen 's Head coins in Hong Kong would rise in value , so many people hoarded these older coins and waited for their value to increase . 
 The Octopus system was quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners , and KMB reported that by 2000 , most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card , with few coins used . Boarding a bus in Hong Kong without using the Octopus card requires giving exact change , making it cumbersome compared to using the Octopus card . By November 1998 , 4 @.@ 6 million cards were issued , and this rose to 9 million by January 2002 . 
 In 2000 , the Hong Kong Monetary Authority granted a deposit @-@ taking company license to the operator , removing previous restrictions that prohibited Octopus from generating more than 15 percent of its turnover from non @-@ transit @-@ related functions . This allowed the Octopus card to be widely adopted for non @-@ transit @-@ related sales transactions . On 29 June 2003 , the Octopus card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18 @,@ 000 parking meters with a new Octopus card @-@ operated system . The replacement was completed on 21 November 2004 . 
 = = Etymologies and logo = = 
 The Cantonese name for the Octopus card , Baat <unk> <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ) , translates literally as " eight @-@ arrived pass " ( though in Chinese it was accepted as " go @-@ everywhere pass " ) , where Baat <unk> may translate as " reaching everywhere " . It was selected by the head of the MTR Corporation , the parent company of Octopus Cards Limited , in a naming competition held in 1996 . The number eight refers to the cardinal and ordinal directions , and the four @-@ character idiom sei <unk> <unk> daaht ( Chinese : <unk> ) , a common expression loosely translated as " reachable in all directions " . It is also considered a lucky number in Chinese culture , and the phrase <unk> daaht can possibly be associated with the similar @-@ sounding <unk> daaht , which means " getting wealthy " ( Chinese : <unk> ) in Cantonese . 
 The English name Octopus card was also selected from the naming competition . Coincidentally , the English name coincides with the number eight in the Chinese name , since an octopus has eight tentacles . The logo used on the card features a Möbius strip in the shape of an infinity symbol . 
 The slogan of Octopus Card Limited and its products ( the cards ) is Making Everyday Life Easier , which is part of the mission statement of the corporation . 
 = = Card usage = = 
 The Octopus card was originally introduced for fare payment on the MTR ; however , the use of the card quickly expanded to other retail businesses in Hong Kong . The card is now commonly used in most major public transport , fast food restaurants , supermarkets , vending machines , convenience stores , photo booths , parking meters , car parks and many other retails business where small payments are frequently made by customers . With over 20 million Octopus cards in circulation in 2010 , the card has become very popular among Hong Kongers . 
 Notable businesses that started accepting Octopus cards at a very early stage include <unk> , Wellcome , Watsons , 7 @-@ Eleven , Starbucks , McDonald 's , and Circle K. As of 21 November 2004 , all parking meters in Hong Kong were converted . They no longer accept coins and Octopus became the only form of payment accepted . 
 Octopus cards also double as access control cards in buildings and for school administrative functions . At certain office buildings , residential buildings , and schools , use of an Octopus card is required for entry . 
 = = = Payments = = = 
 Making or recording a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus @-@ enabled retailers can be done by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away . The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep , and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card . Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0 @.@ 3 seconds , while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second . When using the MTR system , the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters , and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point . 
 The MTR usually charges less for journeys made using an Octopus card instead of conventional single @-@ journey tickets . For example , the adult fare of a single journey from Chai Wan to Tung Chung is HK $ 25 @.@ 20 with an Octopus card , and HK $ 28 with a single journey ticket . Other public transport operators also offer intermittent discounts for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round @-@ trip transits on select routes . 
 On 6 November 2005 , Octopus Cards Limited launched Octopus Rewards , a program that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program . Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor @-@ made offers and privileges . The rewards that the program offers are in the form of points , or reward dollars , stored on the card . Once a card is registered for the program , the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants , and payments may be made in the form of cash , credit cards , or Octopus cards themselves . The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar @-@ amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made . At Wellcome , for example , one point is earned for every purchase of HK $ 200 ; and at Watsons , points are earned at a rate of 0 @.@ 5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase . Once these reward dollars are accumulated , they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK $ 1 per reward dollar . To redeem the accumulated reward dollars , cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole , and may not elect to use it partially . If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available , the amount difference remains stored on the card . Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC , UA Cinemas and Wellcome . 
 = = = Balance enquiries , reloading and refunds = = = 
 In MTR stations , enquiry machines can be found where cardholders can place their Octopus cards on the machines and the machines will display the balance along with a history of last ten usages . 
 Money can be credited to the card through a number of ways . " Add Value Machines " , located at MTR stations , can be used to top up the balance of the cards . The machines accept cash , and selected machines are also able to accept the electronic transfer of funds . Alternatively , cards may be topped up with cash at authorised service providers such as <unk> , Wellcome , Watsons , 7 @-@ Eleven , Circle K , and Café de Coral , and also at customer service centres and ticketing offices at other transport stations . 
 An Octopus card may store a maximum value of HK $ 1 @,@ 000 , with an On @-@ Loan card having an initial deposit value of HK $ 50 and a Sold card having no initial deposit value . Negative value is incurred on a card if it is used with insufficient funds — both types of cards may carry a maximum negative value of HK $ 35 before value needs to be added to them again for use . At the time , the maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line was HK $ 34 @.@ 8 , the cost of travelling between East Tsim Sha Tsui Station and Lo Wu Station ; the current maximum cost is HK $ 55 @.@ 3 , the cost of travelling between Disneyland Resort Station and either Lo Wu Station or Lok Ma Chau Station . 
 The Octopus " Automatic Add Value Service " ( AAVS ) is another method by which cardholders may reload their cards . This service allows for money to be automatically deducted from a credit card and credited to an Octopus card when the value of the Octopus card is less than zero dollars . The credit card used must be one offered by one of 22 financial institutions that participate in AAVS . Participating banks include HSBC , Bank of China , and Hang Seng Bank . HK $ 150 / 250 / 500 is added to the card each time value is automatically added . 
 An Octopus card may be returned to any MTR Customer Service Centre for a refund of the remaining credit stored on it . A handling fee may be charged for the refund — HK $ 7 for an anonymous On @-@ Loan card that had been in use for fewer than three months , and HK $ 10 for a Personalised On @-@ Loan card that was issued on or after 1 November 2004 . A refund is immediately provided at the time an anonymous On Loan card is returned , unless it has more than HK $ 500 stored on it . A Personalised On @-@ Loan card or an anonymous On @-@ Loan card with more than HK $ 500 stored on it needs to be sent back to Octopus Cards Limited for refund processing , in which case , the refund for a Personalised On @-@ Loan card would be available in eight days , and that of an anonymous On @-@ Loan card would be available in five days . If a damaged card is returned for refund , a HK $ 30 levy would be charged to the cardholder .

 Usage of the Octopus card was extended to the Chinese city of Shenzhen and Macau in 2006 . In collaboration with China <unk> , Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two <unk> restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006 . In 2008 , five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus . Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen , but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer 's credit card to reload an Octopus card . The two <unk> restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at <unk> Commercial City and Shenzhen Railway Station . Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment . In Macau , the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment . Similar to its usage in Shenzhen , an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau , and the currency exchange rate between the <unk> <unk> and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is <unk> : <unk> . The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the Rua Do Campo and the Sands Casino .

 On @-@ Loan cards are issued for usage in day @-@ to @-@ day functions , primarily for fare payment in transport systems . They are further classified into Child , Adult , Elder , and Personalised categories , with the first three based on age and different amounts of fare concession . With the exception of the Personalised cards , On @-@ Loan cards are anonymous ; no personal information , bank account , or credit card details are stored on the card , and no identification is required for the purchase of these cards . If an owner loses a card , only the stored value and the deposit of the card are lost . On @-@ Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all MTR stations , the KMB Customer Service Centre , New World First Ferry ( <unk> ) Octopus Service Centres , and the New World First Bus ( <unk> ) Customer Service Centre .

 = = = = Personalised cards = = = = 
 The multi @-@ coloured Personalised card is available on registration . The name and , if opted , a photo of the holder are imprinted on the cards . They can function automatically as a Child , Adult , or Elder card by recognising the cardholder 's age stored on the card , hence accounting for different concessionary fares . As of 2003 , there were 380 @,@ 000 holders of Personalised Octopus cards . In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card , this card can be used as a key card for access to residential and office buildings . If a Personalised card is lost , the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use of the card . A refund would then be issued to the holder of the card for the deposit and the value that remained on the card six hours after the loss is reported , minus a HK $ 30 card cost and a HK $ 20 handling fee . 
 A Personalised card with " student status " is available for students in Hong Kong . To be eligible for this card , the applicant must be a full @-@ time Hong Kong student aged between 12 and 25 . This type of Personalised card is automatically issued to a student who applies for student concessionary privileges . Additionally , they can be used for school administrative tasks such as the recording of student attendance and the management of library loans .

 In contrast to On @-@ Loan cards , Sold cards are sponsored and branded cards . They are souvenir cards that are frequently released by Octopus Cards Limited . The designs for these cards usually come from fictional characters in popular culture , or they are inspired by Chinese cultural events such as Chinese New Year . These cards are sold at a premium , have limited or no initial stored value , and cannot be refunded , but they can otherwise be used as ordinary cards . An example of the Sold card is the <unk> and <unk> collection . It was launched at the end of January 2007 to coincide with the beginning of the Year of the Pig , it features two differently designed versions of the card and is sold for HK $ 138 per set . Each set comes with an Adult Octopus card , with a pouch for the card , a matching strap and a <unk> or <unk> ornament . Octopus Cards Limited has launched new collections of these cards for such occasions as the Mid @-@ Autumn Festival , the passing of the year 2004 , and the release of the movie <unk> .

 The special @-@ purpose card , Airport Express Tourist Octopus , was introduced by Octopus Cards Limited to target tourists in Hong Kong . Two versions of this card are offered , a HK $ 220 card with a free single ride on the Airport Express , the Mass Transit Railway ( MTR ) train line that runs between the Hong Kong International Airport and the urban areas of Hong Kong , and a HK $ 300 card with two free single rides included . The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase . Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR and include a HK $ 50 refundable deposit . Usable value on these cards may be added if necessary . These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days ; users may be required to produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong . Airport Express Tourist Octopus is available for purchase at all MTR stations . 
 The other special @-@ purpose card , the MTR Airport Staff Octopus , is available for the staff of Hong Kong International Airport and AsiaWorld @-@ Expo , a convention centre close to the airport , for commuting at a reduced fare between the airport and MTR stations via the Airport Express . Staff who apply for the card may use it for a discount of up to 64 percent for Airport Express single journey fares . The MTR Airport Staff Octopus is available upon application via the company for which that a staff member works .

 Other than the Octopus card itself , operator Octopus Cards Limited also sells watches and mobile phone covers that function as anonymous Octopus cards . The types of watches available include wrist watches , pocket watches , and watch key chains . The mobile phone covers were specifically designed for Nokia models <unk> and <unk> , and iPhone 4 and 4S . As with the card itself , these products are used by waving them over a card reader . They may be reloaded with money value the same way as the card itself , including automatic reloading via the Automatic Add Value Service , with the exception that they cannot be reloaded at Add Value Machines due to their shapes . An Octopus watch or mobile phone cover may be stored with a maximum of HK $ 1 @,@ 000 , but do not have any initial stored value at the time of its purchase . It may have a maximum negative value of HK $ 35 as with an Octopus card . These products are not refundable for their costs , but the remaining value stored on them may be refunded if they are damaged , with the damaged product itself also returned to the customer . 
 In June 2007 , a new set of limited edition products was announced , featuring Mini Octopus cards and Child Octopus <unk> . The Mini Octopus cards , available in Adult and Elder editions , measure 4 @.@ 7 cm by 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 85 in by 1 @.@ 18 in ) and work as regular ( anonymous ) Adult and Elder , respectively , Octopus cards . The Child Octopus <unk> are plastic wristbands with a watch @-@ like round face and work as regular Child Octopus cards . The same value @-@ adding abilities and limitations as the aforementioned watches and mobile phone apply . 
 They also would cooperate with different companies . Octopus can be tailored to promotional needs with companies logo or special design . In 2008 , Octopus has cooperated with Commercial Radio Hong Kong , launched a collection of " 903 20 Plus Octopus " . 
 = = Technology = = 
 The Octopus system was designed by Australia @-@ based company ERG Group ( now <unk> Technology ) . The company was selected in 1994 to lead the development of the Octopus project and was responsible for the building and installation of the components of the Octopus system . Operations , maintenance and development was undertaken by Octopus Cards Limited , and in 2005 , it replaced the central transaction clearing house with its own system . 
 The Octopus card uses the Sony 13 @.@ 56 MHz <unk> radio frequency identification ( RFID ) chip , with Hong Kong being the world 's first major public transport system using this technology . It is a " touch and go " system , so users need only hold the card in close proximity of the reader , and thus physical contact is not required . Data is transmitted at up to 212 kbit / s ( the maximum speed for Sony <unk> chips ) , compared to 9 @.@ 6 kbit / s for other smart card systems like <unk> and Visa Cash . The card has a storage capacity of 1 KB to 64 KB compared to the 125 bytes provided by traditional magnetic stripe card . 
 Octopus uses a nonstandard system for RFID instead of the more popular ISO / IEC <unk> standards , since there were no standards in the nascent industry during its development in 1997 . The operating range of the reader / writer is between 30 and 100 mm ( 1 @.@ 18 and 3 @.@ 94 in ) depending on the type of model being used . 
 Octopus is specifically designed so that card transactions are relayed for clearing on a store and forward basis , without any requirement for reader units to have realtime round @-@ trip communications with a central database or computer . The stored data about the transaction may be transmitted by network after hours , or in the case of offline mobile readers may be retrieved by a hand held device , for example a Pocket PC . 
 In practice , different data collection mechanisms are used by different transport operators , depending on the nature of their business . The MTR equips its stations with local area networks that connect the components that deal with Octopus cards — turnstiles , Add Value Machines , value @-@ checking machines and customer service terminals . Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR 's Kowloon Bay headquarters through a frame relay wide area network , and hence onwards to the central clearing house system ( <unk> ) for clearing . Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as 7 @-@ Eleven . Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers , including those installed on minibuses . Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system , depending on operator . 
 = = = Security = = = 
 The Octopus card uses encryption for all airborne communication and performs mutual authentication between the card and reader based on the ISO <unk> @-@ 2 three @-@ pass mutual authentication protocol . In other words , data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key . This means that the security of the Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed . A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software , for example , to add value ( up to HK $ 1 @,@ 000 ) to any Octopus card without authorization . Nevertheless , as of 2003 , the Octopus card and system have never been successfully hacked . 
 Octopus card reader includes a fail @-@ safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction when more than one card is being detected at the same time . On 11 February 2009 , Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail @-@ safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile . A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile , pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail @-@ safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction . Because of this , if they get caught by the station staff , they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction .

 The Octopus card system is owned and operated by Octopus Cards Limited , a wholly owned subsidiary of Octopus Holdings Limited . The company was founded as Creative Star Limited in 1994 to oversee the development and implementation of the Octopus card system , and was renamed as its current name of Octopus Cards Limited in 2002 . Creative Star was formed as a joint @-@ venture company by five major transit companies in Hong Kong — MTR Corporation , Kowloon @-@ Canton Railway Corporation , Kowloon Motor Bus , Citybus , and Hongkong and <unk> Ferry . In January 2001 , the shares of Hongkong and <unk> Ferry in the company was transferred to New World First Bus and New World First Ferry . In the same year , together with MTR Corporation , the company was transformed from its previous non @-@ profit making status to a profit making enterprise . 
 Due to the expansion of the company 's businesses , Octopus Holdings Limited was established in 2005 and Octopus Cards Limited was restructured as its subsidiary . The business of Octopus Cards Limited , being a payment business , is regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority , while Octopus ' non @-@ payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited that are independent of Octopus Cards Limited . As of 2007 , Octopus Holdings Limited was a joint @-@ venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong ; 54 @.@ 4 % by the MTR Corporation , 22 @.@ 1 % by the Kowloon @-@ Canton Railway Corporation , 12 @.@ 4 % by Kowloon Motor Bus , 5 % by Citybus , and 3 @.@ 1 % by New World First Bus . Since the Government of Hong Kong owns 76 @.@ 54 % of the MTR Corporation ( as of 31 December 2005 ) and wholly owns the Kowloon @-@ Canton Railway Corporation , it is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings Limited , and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Cards Limited . 
 Initially , Octopus Cards Limited , then known as Creative Star Limited , was restricted to having at most 15 percent of Octopus card transactions for non @-@ transport transactions , as it operated under the Hong Kong government 's Banking Ordinance . On 20 April 2000 , the Hong Kong Monetary Authority authorised the company for deposit @-@ taking , which allowed for 50 percent of Octopus card transactions to be unrelated to transport . HK $ 416 million ( US $ 53 @.@ 3 million ) is deposited in the Octopus system at any given time as of 2000 . 
 = = In taxis = = 
 Although a popular form of transport , taxis in Hong Kong do not accept the Octopus card . On 27 June 2006 , after 10 years of negotiations between Octopus Cards Limited and the taxi industry , the first trial of taxis equipped with Octopus card readers was launched in the New Territories with taxis operated by the Yellow Taxi Group . But it was reported on 30 October that of the 20 taxis that participated in the trial , eight had dropped out . Part of the reason was technical — drivers must return to the office every day for accounting . The Octopus card company said it would be upgrading the system to allow automatic account updating in the future . Wong Yu @-@ ting , managing director of the Yellow Taxi Group , also noted that they had been " trying to convince restaurants and retailers " to offer discounts to Octopus taxi passengers , but the Transport Department had been a major obstacle . The Transport Department is against this approach for legal reasons .

 The Octopus card is recognised internationally , winning the Chairman 's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance 's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for being the world 's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system , and for its innovative use of technologies .

 In February 2007 it was found that when customers added value to their cards at self @-@ service add @-@ value points located in MTR and Light rail stations , their bank accounts were <unk> even if the transactions had been cancelled . Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems . Initially , two cases were reported . The company then announced that the use of the payment system , Electronic Payment Services ( EPS ) , at add @-@ value service points would be suspended until further notice , and that it had started an investigation into the reasons for the problem . 
 On 27 July 2007 it was announced that the faulty transactions could be traced back to 2000 , and that a total of 3 @.@ 7 million Hong Kong dollars had been wrongly deducted in 15 @,@ 270 cases . The company reported that there might be cases dating to before 2000 , but that only transactions from the past seven years were kept . The company stated that it would co @-@ operate with EPS Company Limited , operator of Electronic Payment Services , and banks , to contact customers involved and arrange a refund within ten weeks ' time . 
 On 21 December 2007 the company announced that it would permanently cease all transactions using EPS because it could not guarantee that such problems would not occur again .

Octopus Holdings made 44 million Hong Kong dollars ( $ <unk> USD ) over 4 @.@ 5 years . Roderick Woo Bun , Hong Kong 's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data , gave radio interviews and called for transparent investigation , but his term expired at the end of July 2010 . Allan Chiang Yam @-@ wang was announced as the incoming Privacy Commissioner . This news was met with protests and international outrage , due to his prior history of privacy invasions involving cameras used to spy on his employees at the Post Office , and disclosing hundreds of job applicants ' personal data to corporations . Outgoing Privacy Commissioner Woo pledged to finish a preliminary report on the Octopus privacy abuse before his term ends , and called for a new law making it a criminal offence for companies to sell personal data . 
 = Znám 's problem = 
 In number theory , Znám 's problem asks which sets of k integers have the property that each integer in the set is a proper divisor of the product of the other integers in the set , plus 1 . Znám 's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám , who suggested it in 1972 , although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time . One closely related problem drops the assumption of <unk> of the divisor , and will be called the improper Znám problem hereafter . 
 One solution to the improper Znám problem is easily provided for any k : the first k terms of Sylvester 's sequence have the required property . Sun ( 1983 ) showed that there is at least one solution to the ( proper ) Znám problem for each k ≥ 5 . Sun 's solution is based on a recurrence similar to that for Sylvester 's sequence , but with a different set of initial values . 
 The Znám problem is closely related to Egyptian fractions . It is known that there are only finitely many solutions for any fixed k . It is unknown whether there are any solutions to Znám 's problem using only odd numbers , and there remain several other open questions . 
 = = The problem = = 
 Znám 's problem asks which sets of integers have the property that each integer in the set is a proper divisor of the product of the other integers in the set , plus 1 . That is , given k , what sets of integers 
 <formula> 
 are there , such that , for each i , ni divides but is not equal to 
 <formula> 
 A closely related problem concerns sets of integers in which each integer in the set is a divisor , but not necessarily a proper divisor , of one plus the product of the other integers in the set . This problem does not seem to have been named in the literature , and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem . Any solution to Znám 's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem , but not necessarily vice versa . 
 = = History = = 
 Znám 's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám , who suggested it in 1972 . Barbeau ( 1971 ) had posed the improper Znám problem for k 
 = 3 , and <unk> ( 1973 ) , independently of Znám , found all solutions to the improper problem for k ≤ 5 . <unk> ( 1975 ) showed that Znám 's problem is unsolvable for k < 5 , and credited J. <unk> with finding the solution { 2 , 3 , 11 , 23 , 31 } for k = 
 5 . 
 = = Examples = = 
 One solution to k 
 = 5 is { 2 , 3 , 7 , 47 , 395 } . A few calculations will show that 
 An interesting " near miss " for k = 
 4 is the set { 2 , 3 , 7 , 43 } , formed by taking the first four terms of Sylvester 's sequence . It has the property that each integer in the set divides the product of the other integers in the set , plus 1 , but the last member of this set is equal to the product of the first three members plus one , rather than being a proper divisor . Thus , it is a solution to the improper Znám problem , but not a solution to Znám 's problem as it is usually defined . 
 = = Connection to Egyptian fractions = = 
 Any solution to the improper Znám problem is equivalent ( via division by the product of the xi 's ) to a solution to the equation 
 <formula> 
 where y as well as each xi must be an integer , and conversely any such solution corresponds to a solution to the improper Znám problem . However , all known solutions have y = 1 , so they satisfy the equation 
 <formula> 
 That is , they lead to an Egyptian fraction representation of the number one as a sum of unit fractions . Several of the cited papers on Znám 's problem study also the solutions to this equation . Brenton & Hill ( 1988 ) describe an application of the equation in topology , to the classification of singularities on surfaces , and <unk> et al . ( 2005 ) describe an application to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata . 
 = = Number of solutions = = 
 As <unk> & <unk> ( 1978 ) showed , the number of solutions for any k is finite , so it makes sense to count the total number of solutions for each k . 
 Brenton and <unk> calculated that the number of solutions for small values of k , starting with k 
 = 5 , forms the sequence 
 2 , 5 , 18 , 96 ( sequence <unk> in the OEIS ) . 
 Presently , a few solutions are known for k = 
 9 and k = 10 , but it is unclear how many solutions remain undiscovered for those values of k . However , there are infinitely many solutions if k is not fixed : Cao & Jing ( 1998 ) showed that there are at least 39 solutions for each k ≥ 12 , improving earlier results proving the existence of fewer solutions ( Cao , Liu & Zhang 1987 , Sun & Cao 1988 ) . Sun & Cao ( 1988 ) conjecture that the number of solutions for each value of k grows monotonically with k . 
 It is unknown whether there are any solutions to Znám 's problem using only odd numbers . With one exception , all known solutions start with 2 . If all numbers in a solution to Znám 's problem or the improper Znám problem are prime , their product is a primary <unk> number ( <unk> , <unk> & <unk> 2000 ) ; it is unknown whether infinitely many solutions of this type exist . 
 = Constitution of May 3 , 1791 ( painting ) = 
 The Constitution of May 3 , 1791 ( Polish : Konstytucja 3 Maja 1791 roku ) is an 1891 Romantic oil painting on canvas by the Polish artist Jan Matejko . It is a large piece , and one of Matejko 's best known . It memorializes the Polish Constitution of May 3 , 1791 , a milestone in the history of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth and the high point of the Polish Enlightenment . 
 Like many Matejko works , the picture presents a grand scene populated with numerous historic figures , including Poland 's last King , Stanisław August Poniatowski ; Marshals of the Great Sejm Stanisław Małachowski and Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha ; co @-@ authors of the Constitution such as Hugo Kołłątaj and Ignacy Potocki ; and other major contemporary figures such as Tadeusz Kościuszko . Some twenty individuals have been identified by modern historians ; another ten or so who had been reported in older sources as being present , await definitive identification . 
 The picture was painted between January and October 1891 to commemorate the Constitution 's centenary . It was one of the last works by Matejko , who died in November 1893 . The painting was displayed in Lwów ( now Lviv , Ukraine ) until 1920 , when it was moved to Kraków . It was hidden during World War II and later moved to Warsaw , where it now hangs in the Royal Castle . 
 = = Constitution of May 3 , 1791 = = 
 The Constitution of May 3 , 1791 was adopted as a " Government Act " ( Polish : Ustawa rządowa ) on that date by the Sejm ( parliament ) of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . It has been called " the first constitution of its type in Europe " and the world 's second oldest constitution . 
 It was designed to redress long @-@ standing political defects of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . The Commonwealth 's system of " Golden Liberty " , which conferred disproportionate rights on the nobility , had increasingly corrupted the Commonwealth 's politics . The Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country 's magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy . It introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility ( szlachta ) and placed the peasants under the protection of the government , thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom . The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto , which at one time had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose , or be bribed by an interest or foreign power , to undo the legislation adopted by that Sejm . 
 The adoption of the May 3 Constitution met with hostile political and military responses from the Commonwealth 's neighbors . In the Polish – Russian War of 1792 ( sometimes called the " War in Defense of the Constitution " ) , the Commonwealth was attacked by Catherine the Great 's Imperial Russia allied with the Targowica Confederation , a coalition of Polish magnates and landless nobility who opposed reforms that might weaken their influence . The Commonwealth 's ally Prussia , under Frederick William II , broke its alliance , and the Commonwealth was defeated . In the end , the Constitution of May 3 remained in force for little more than one year . Despite the Commonwealth 's defeat in the Polish – Russian War and the ensuing partitions which eliminated the Commonwealth , the May 3 Constitution remained for more than 123 years a beacon in the struggle to restore Polish sovereignty . In the words of two of its co @-@ authors , Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj , it was " the last will and testament of the expiring Country . " 
 = = History = = 
 The sketch of the work was presented in the cycle History of Civilization in Poland . 
 Matejko began work on the painting in the middle of January 1891 , to coincide with the centenary of the Constitution . Although the painting was not finished until October , by May 3 it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in Sukiennice , Kraków . On April 7 , 1892 , Matejko transferred the painting to Prince Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko , marshal of Galician Sejm in Lwów , and it was displayed in the Sejm building ( now the main building of the Lviv University ) . This painting was one of the last works by Matejko , who died in November 1893 . 
 In 1920 , two years after Poland regained independence , the painting was moved to Kraków , where from 1923 it was displayed in the building of the Polish Sejm . The painting was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II , when Poland was occupied by the Germans . After the war the painting was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw , and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building . Since 1984 the painting has been in the collection of the Royal Castle in Warsaw , where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown . The painting is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators , where the Constitution was adopted . The painting was restored in 2007 . 
 = = Significance and historiography = = 
 The painting is one of Matejko 's best known works and today it is commonly seen as one of his masterpieces , an " education in national history . " However , it was less well received by his contemporaries , with turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ century reviews criticizing it for being " too crowded " and with unclear composition ; supporters of Matejko 's previous works were much more guarded in their praise of this painting . 
 Matejko 's technique in this painting was subtly but noticeably different compared to his other paintings ; authors Wrede et al. attribute this to Matejko 's exploration of new techniques , but note that contemporary critiques saw this departure from his old style as the weakening form of the dying master , and did not applaud the changes . They also note that Matejko usually dedicated two years to paintings of that size ; this one was completed in less than a year , during a period in which Matejko was working on other projects and suffering from stress and depression . Matejko himself was not fond of the 18th century and the Polish Enlightenment , remarking that he " would rather prefer to paint any other century " . He felt compelled , however , by the anniversary of the Constitution to create an artwork commemorating the event , which he recognized as historically significant . 
 Matejko commonly identified the characters in his paintings with a written legend , but he did not create one for the Constitution . Consequently , some characters in the painting have not been identified . A partial legend was written by Matejko 's secretary , Marian <unk> , and even though it provides a list of 39 characters , Wrede et al. write that his " chaotic description " is not very helpful . Modern analysis has been done by Polish historians Jarosław Krawczyk and Emanuel M. Rostworowski .

 The painting , set in the late afternoon of May 3 , 1791 , shows the procession of deputies from the Royal Castle ( background ) , where the Constitution has just been adopted by the Great Sejm , to St. John 's Collegiate Church ( left , now an <unk> ) , where a Te Deum will be sung . The procession moves down St. John 's Street ( ulica <unk> ) , surrounded by enthusiastic Warsaw residents and visitors . The deputies are protected by soldiers . 
 While the procession was an actual historic event , Matejko took many artistic liberties , such as including persons who were not in fact present or had died earlier . He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of the final years of the Commonwealth . He also felt that there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution , and so he , the artist , needed to create such a moment . 
 = = = Center = = = 
 The painting is centered on the Sejm marshal Stanisław Małachowski ( 1 ) , who is wearing a white , French @-@ inspired costume . Małachowski holds the marshal staff in his left hand and in his right hand , he triumphantly raises the text of the Constitution . Although the historical document was titled Ustawa rządowa ( Government Ordinance ) , Matejko chose to make the title page of the document as portrayed in his painting more explicit — and at the same time put the name of the painting right in its center . He is carried by deputies Aleksander <unk> of Kraków ( 2 ) ( on his right ) and Ignacy Zakrzewski of Poznań ( 3 ) ( on his left ) . Their significance is that Kraków and Poznań are principal cities of two major regions of Poland : Lesser Poland and Greater Poland , respectively . Under Małachowski 's right hand there is a figure with a bandaged head holding a flag ; this is Tadeusz Kościuszko ( 4 ) , and his head wound is a reference to the battle of Maciejowice , which took place during the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794 , three years after the event depicted in the painting . To the left of Kościuszko , is a figure identified by <unk> et al. as Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski , although this is disputed by other sources . 
 Another figure , to the right of Małachowski , is being carried ; he is Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha ( 5 ) , marshal of the Lithuanian confederation and the second Sejm marshal . He is dressed in more traditional Polish clothing . Between Małachowski and Sapieha , the head of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz ( 6 ) , a well @-@ known writer , is visible . He appears to be carrying Sapieha . The other figure carrying Sapieha , to his right , is Michał Zabiełło ( 7 ) . 
 In the lower center of the painting , Matejko shows a scene that took place in the Royal Castle . Jan Suchorzewski ( 8 ) , deputy from Kalisz and an opponent of the Constitution , has fallen to the ground , holding his young son with one arm ; his other hand , holding a knife , is held by Stanisław Kublicki ( 9 ) , standing to his right . Kublicki was a deputy from Inflanty , a supporter of the townsfolk and peasant causes , and of the Constitution . The artist here alludes to Suchorzewski 's unsuccessful attempt to prevent the king from signing the Constitution , during which he threatening to kill his own son to save him from the " slavery of the Constitution " . A deck of cards has fallen out of Suchorzewski 's pocket , a reference to the manner in which he was bribed by the anti @-@ Constitution Russian ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg and hetman Branicki ; Suchorzewski suddenly started winning large sums of money in games , despite his poor skills as a gambler . Branicki ( 10 ) can be seen standing between the king and Suchorzewski , dressed in a Russian uniform , foreshadowing the rank of general he received several years later in the Russian Army . In reality Suchorzewski , like most of those opposed to the Constitution , refused to participate in the procession . 
 Notable figures in the center of the painting , to the left of Małachowski , include other supporters of the Constitution . Priest Hugo Kołłątaj ( 11 ) is the most prominent , gesturing in disdain at Suchorzewski . Several other figures in the vicinity are described in sources , but their precise location is unclear , or the sources contradict one another . The priest holding the Bible ( 12 ) is probably Feliks Turski , although some identify him as Tymoteusz Gorzeński . The figures to the right of Kołłątaj represents the Grand Lithuanian Marshal , Ignacy Potocki ( 13 ) , and perhaps Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski ( 14 ) ( although some sources identify Czartoryski elsewhere in the painting , in the vicinity of Kościuszko ) . Surrounding Kołłątaj are likely the priest Scipione Piattoli ( 15 ) and Tadeusz <unk> or <unk> ( 16 ) . 
 = = = Left = = = 
 On the stairs of the church , King Stanisław August Poniatowski ( 17 ) is ascending . Matejko was not very fond of Poniatowski , and he portrayed him in a rather pompous posture , with his hand extended to be kissed , and in the company of numerous pretty ladies , supporting his reputation as a " lady 's man " . Poniatowski 's inclusion in the procession is one of Matejko 's artistic liberties , as he had arrived at the church before the procession . A woman hands him a laurel wreath ( 18 ) ; sources have identified her as the Courland princess Dorothea von Medem ( Dorothea Biron ) or Róża z <unk> , wife of former Warsaw mayor Jan Dekert . Behind her ( leftmost in the group of two women , with only her face showing ) stands Elżbieta Grabowska ( 19 ) , the king 's mistress and mother of his children . Bowing at the church doors is the former mayor of Warsaw , Jan Dekert ( 20 ) . He is accompanied by his daughter Marianna ( in a yellow dress , facing away from the viewer ) taking a prominent position near the king ( 38 ) . Dekert 's inclusion in the painting is another example of Matejko taking liberties with history , as he died in October 1790 ; he was an important burghers figure associated with the Free Royal Cities Act , which was incorporated into the Constitution . 
 Behind the king , holding his hands to his head , is Prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński @-@ Światopełk ( 21 ) , another opponent of the Constitution , known for being on a Russian payroll . Below him is another opponent of the Constitution , Antoni <unk> ( 22 ) . An anonymous black @-@ clad French royalist ( 23 ) is shown looking terrified at the scene , seeing another revolution in the making . He raises his hand over the king 's head . 
 In the group of people gathered below the king , in another acknowledgement of the burghers ' importance , is burgher Jan Kiliński ( 24 ) , one of the leaders of the Kościuszko Uprising . To his right , at the edge of the crowd , is the priest Clemens Maria Hofbauer ( 25 ) , who ran an orphanage and a school in Warsaw and is canonized as a saint in the Catholic church . 
 = = = Right = = = 
 To the right of Sapieha are reformer Stanisław Staszic ( 26 ) and , with his hand around Staszic , Andrzej Zamoyski ( 27 ) , author of the Zamoyski Codex , an earlier attempt to reform the state . To the left of Staszic , the head of bishop of Smoleńsk , Tymoteusz Gorzeński ( 28 ) , is visible in the crowd . Beneath Staszic and Zamoyski , with an outstretched hand , is Kazimierz Konopka ( 29 ) , Kołłątaj 's secretary and one of the Polish Jacobins ; Konopka has a French blue @-@ white @-@ red flower in his hat and a <unk> , an <unk> and hammer @-@ like weapon , in his hand . Above them is an unnamed Eastern Orthodox priest ( 30 ) ; the figure on his right ( 31 ) is either Paweł Ksawery <unk> , pioneer of agricultural reforms , or Józef <unk> , a less progressive figure . This line of figures ends with Antoni <unk> ( 32 ) , Lithuanian official and reformer . To the right of Zamoyski is an unnamed peasant ( 33 ) . His passive attitude is seen as a representation of the unconcerned attitude of Polish peasantry towards the reforms . 
 To their right is the king 's nephew , prince Józef Poniatowski ( 34 ) , in the uniform of the light cavalry of the Duchy of Warsaw and riding a grey horse . The uniform is another instance of foreshadowing ; Poniatowski became the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Duchy 's army and died during the Battle of Leipzig . At the time of the passing of the Constitution , he was the commander of the Warsaw garrison , and is shown keeping an eye on the procession , with his soldiers lined up and guarding the street . To his right , partially obscured by Poniatowski 's horse 's head , is Stanisław Mokronowski ( 35 ) , deputy , general , and future leader of the Kościuszko Uprising in Lithuania . 
 At the very bottom right corner , two Polish Jews are on the edge of the scene ; the younger ( 36 ) one is usually described as enthralled by the events , watching them with hope , but most analysis focuses on the older man ( 37 ) , whose hand is making a Sy , git ( " that 's good " ) gesture . Interpretation of this figure varies ; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution , which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews — the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way — others put him , or both of the Jews , among the opponents of the Constitution , describing them as frowning and disturbed , gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth , or at least concerned with the liberal reforms . The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles .

 = Océan @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Océan class ironclads were a group of three wooden @-@ hulled armored frigates built for the French Navy in the mid to late 1860s . Océan attempted to blockade Prussian ports in the Baltic Sea in 1870 during the Franco @-@ Prussian War . Marengo participated in the French conquest of Tunisia in 1881 . Suffren was often used as the flagship for the squadron she was assigned to . She was flagship of the Cherbourg Division , the Channel Division , Mediterranean Squadron and the Northern Squadron during her career . The ships were discarded during the 1890s . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Océan @-@ class ironclads were designed by Henri Dupuy de Lôme as an improved version of the Provence @-@ class ironclads . The ships were central battery ironclads with the armament concentrated amidships . For the first time in a French ironclad three watertight iron bulkheads were fitted in the hull . Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal @-@ reinforced ram . 
 The ships measured 87 @.@ 73 meters ( 287 ft 10 in ) overall , with a beam of 17 @.@ 52 meters ( 57 ft 6 in ) . They had a maximum draft of 9 @.@ 09 meters ( 29 ft 10 in ) and displaced 7 @,@ 749 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 627 long tons ) . Their crew numbered between 750 and 778 officers and men . The metacentric height of the ships was very low , between 1 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 7 m ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Océan @-@ class ships had one horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engine driving a single propeller . Their engines were powered by eight oval boilers . On sea trials the engines produced between 3 @,@ 600 – 4 @,@ 100 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 700 – 3 @,@ 100 kW ) and the ships reached 13 @.@ 5 – 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 25 @.@ 0 – 26 @.@ 5 km / h ; 15 @.@ 5 – 16 @.@ 5 mph ) . They carried 650 metric tons ( 640 long tons ) of coal which allowed them to steam for approximately 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 600 km ; 3 @,@ 500 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The Océan @-@ class ships were barque or barquentine @-@ rigged with three masts and had a sail area around 2 @,@ 000 square meters ( 22 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 These ships had their main armament mounted in four barbettes on the upper deck , one gun at each corner of the battery , with the remaining guns on the battery deck below the barbettes . The original armament consisted of four 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in the barbettes , and on the battery deck , four 194 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) and four 164 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) guns . This was upgraded in Océan to four 274 @-@ millimeter ( 10 @.@ 8 in ) guns in the barbettes and eight 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) on the battery deck before she was commissioned . The two later ships , Marengo and Suffren , were armed with 274 @-@ millimeter guns in the barbettes , and four 240 @-@ millimeter guns and seven 138 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) on the battery deck . 
 The 18 @-@ caliber 274 @-@ millimeter Modéle 1870 gun fired an armor @-@ piercing , 476 @.@ 2 @-@ pound ( 216 @.@ 0 kg ) shell while the gun itself weighed 22 @.@ 84 long tons ( 23 @.@ 21 t ) . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 424 ft / s ( 434 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 3 inches ( 360 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 19 @-@ caliber 240 @-@ millmeter Modele 1870 gun weighed 317 @.@ 5 pounds ( 144 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 15 @.@ 41 long tons ( 15 @.@ 66 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 624 ft / s ( 495 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 4 inches ( 366 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 138 @-@ millimeter gun was 21 calibers long and weighed 2 @.@ 63 long tons ( 2 @.@ 67 t ) . It fired a 61 @.@ 7 @-@ pound ( 28 @.@ 0 kg ) explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 529 ft / s ( 466 m / s ) . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 By 1885 all of the 138 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by four or six 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns . At some point the ships received a dozen 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns . They fired a shell weighing about 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of about 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a range of about 3 @,@ 200 meters ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute . The hull was not recessed to enable any of the guns on the battery deck to fire forward or aft . However , the guns mounted in the barbettes sponsoned out over the sides of the hull did have some ability to fire fore and aft . Late in the ships ' careers four above @-@ water 356 @-@ millimeter ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes were added . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The Ocean @-@ class ships had a complete 178 – 203 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 0 – 8 @.@ 0 in ) waterline belt of wrought iron . The sides of the battery itself were armored with 160 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) of wrought iron . The barbette armor was 150 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick . The unarmored portions of their sides were protected by 15 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) iron plates . Gardiner says that the barbette armor was later removed to improve their stability , but this is not confirmed by any other source .

 = = Service = = 
 During the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 Océan was assigned to the Northern Squadron that attempted to blockade Prussian ports on the Baltic until recalled on 16 September 1870 and ordered to return to Cherbourg . Afterward she was assigned to the Evolutionary Squadron until 1875 when she was placed in reserve . Océan was recommissioned in 1879 for service with the Mediterranean Squadron . She had a lengthy refit in 1884 – 85 and was assigned to the Northern Squadron after it was completed . Around 1888 the ship was transferred back to the Mediterranean Squadron until she was reduced to reserve around 1891 . Océan was assigned to the Gunnery School that same year and later became a training ship for naval apprentices before being condemned in 1894 . 
 Marengo was running her sea trials when the Franco @-@ Prussian War began and was immediately put in reserve . She was recommissioned in 1872 for service with the Mediterranean Squadron until 1876 when she was again placed in reserve . On 2 October 1880 the ship was recommissioned and assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron . Marengo was transferred to the Levant Squadron ( French : Division Navale du Levant ) on 13 February 1881 and bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July 1881 as part of the French conquest of Tunisia . She remained in the Mediterranean until she was assigned to the Reserve Squadron in 1886 . In 1888 Marengo became the flagship of the Northern Squadron and led the squadron during its port visit to Kronstadt in 1891 . She was reduced to reserve the following year and sold in 1896 . 
 Suffren was placed into reserve after she completed her sea trials and was not commissioned until 1 March 1876 when she became flagship of the Cherbourg Division . Throughout her career the ship was often used as a flagship because of her spacious admiral 's quarters . On 1 September 1880 the ship was assigned to the division that participated in the international naval demonstration at Ragusa later that month under the command of Vice Admiral Seymour of the Royal Navy in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro . Suffren was reduced to reserve in 1881 and not recommissioned until 23 August 1884 when she was assigned to the Northern Squadron . The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron about 1888 and remained there until paid off in 1895 and condemned in 1897 . 
 = The Boat Race 1984 = 
 The 130th Boat Race took place on 18 March 1984 . Held annually , the event is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . The race was originally scheduled to take place the day before but the Cambridge boat struck a barge before the start and the race was postponed until the following day , making it the first Boat Race to be held on a Sunday . Oxford won by three @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths and both crews beat the existing course record . 
 Cambridge 's Goldie won the reserve race , while Cambridge were victorious in the Women 's Boat Race . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Cambridge by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths in the previous year 's race . However Cambridge held the overall lead , with 68 victories to Oxford 's 60 . 
 Originally scheduled to take place on Saturday 17 March , the Cambridge cox , Peter Hobson , steered their boat into a moored barge during the warmup , destroying the bow . The crew paddled to the side of the river where most were able to disembark , but some were forced to swim to safety . The race was postponed to the following day where Cambridge competed in a boat borrowed from the Amateur Rowing Association . It was the first Boat Race to be held on a Sunday in the history of the competition . The disagreement over the inclusion of Boris Rankov in Oxford 's crew for the sixth time in the previous year 's race had not been resolved . Rankov , however , had left the university after completing his studies so the dispute would have no impact on this year 's race . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 = = Crews = = 
 Oxford were pre @-@ race favourites and their crew were an average of 11 pounds ( 5 @.@ 0 kg ) heavier than their Cambridge opponents . The race saw the return of five Blues for Oxford and four for Cambridge . Oxford 's crew contained two Canadian brothers ( the Evans twins , Mark and Michael ) , two Australians and an American cox , while Cambridge 's predominantly British crew was completed by a Canadian and an American . 
 = = Race = = 
 Oxford started from the Surrey station and despite rating higher , were slightly behind Cambridge after a minute . Aggressive steering from Hobson resulted in warnings from umpire Mike Sweeney , and by the mile post , Oxford held a two @-@ second lead . A push by Oxford at Harrods saw them five seconds clear by Hammersmith Bridge and two lengths clear by Chiswick Steps . Nine seconds ahead by Barnes Bridge , Oxford passed the finishing post officially 12 seconds and three @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths ahead of Cambridge , in a time of 16 minutes 45 seconds , beating the previous best of 16 minutes 58 seconds recorded by Oxford in the 1976 race . This was Oxford 's ninth consecutive victory , and their tenth in eleven years , and took the overall record to 68 – 61 in favour of Cambridge . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie beat Oxford 's Isis by two @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths , while Cambridge won the 39th Women 's Boat Race . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 Cambridge cox Hobson reacted to the pre @-@ race crash : " It was the worst nightmare in the world coming true . " Regarding the race , the Cambridge number 5 , John Garrett stated " the borrowed boat was better than ours but we weren 't used to it . " Oxford cox Seth Lesser said he was aware that his crew were setting a record @-@ breaking pace : " I knew the record was on ... We made another burn at St Paul 's School just to make sure . " 
 As a result of Saturday 's collision and the associated publicity , Sunday 's race was viewed on British television by more than 12 million people . 
 = Steel = 
 Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements , primarily carbon , that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost . Steel 's base metal is iron , which is able to take on two crystalline forms ( allotropic forms ) , body centered cubic ( BCC ) and face centered cubic ( FCC ) , depending on its temperature . It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements , primarily carbon , that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties . In the body @-@ centred cubic arrangement , there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube , and in the face @-@ centred cubic , there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube . Carbon , other elements , and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms . 
 The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2 @.@ 1 % of its weight . Varying the amount of alloying elements , their presence in the steel either as solute elements , or as precipitated phases , retards the movement of those dislocations that make iron comparatively ductile and weak , and thus controls its qualities such as the hardness , ductility , and tensile strength of the resulting steel . Steel 's strength compared to pure iron is only possible at the expense of iron 's ductility , of which iron has an excess . 
 Steel was produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years , but its extensive use began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century , with the production of blister steel and then crucible steel . With the invention of the Bessemer process in the mid @-@ 19th century , a new era of mass @-@ produced steel began . This was followed by Siemens @-@ Martin process and then Gilchrist @-@ Thomas process that refined the quality of steel . With their introductions , mild steel replaced wrought iron . 
 Further refinements in the process , such as basic oxygen steelmaking ( BOS ) , largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the product . Today , steel is one of the most common materials in the world , with more than 1 @.@ 3 billion tons produced annually . It is a major component in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations . 
 = = Definitions and related materials = = 
 The noun steel originates from the Proto @-@ Germanic adjective <unk> ( made of steel ) , which is related to <unk> ( standing firm ) . 
 The carbon content of steel is between 0 @.@ 002 % and 2 @.@ 1 % by weight for plain iron – carbon alloys . These values vary depending on alloying elements such as manganese , chromium , nickel , iron , tungsten , carbon and so on . Basically , steel is an iron @-@ carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction . In contrast , cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction . Too little carbon content leaves ( pure ) iron quite soft , ductile , and weak . Carbon contents higher than those of steel make an alloy , commonly called pig iron , that is brittle ( not malleable ) . While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel , alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel . Common alloying elements include : manganese , nickel , chromium , molybdenum , boron , titanium , vanadium , tungsten , cobalt , and niobium . Additional elements are also important in steel : phosphorus , sulfur , silicon , and traces of oxygen , nitrogen , and copper , that are most frequently considered undesirable . 
 Alloys with a higher than 2 @.@ 1 % carbon content , depending on other element content and possibly on processing , are known as cast iron . Cast iron is not malleable even when hot , but it can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel and good <unk> properties . Certain compositions of cast iron , while retaining the economies of melting and casting , can be heat treated after casting to make malleable iron or ductile iron objects . Steel is also distinguishable from wrought iron ( now largely obsolete ) , which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of slag . 
 = = Material properties = = 
 Iron is commonly found in the Earth 's crust in the form of an ore , usually an iron oxide , such as magnetite , hematite etc . Iron is extracted from iron ore by removing the oxygen through combination with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon that is lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide . This process , known as smelting , was first applied to metals with lower melting points , such as tin , which melts at about 250 ° C ( 482 ° F ) and copper , which melts at about 1 @,@ 100 ° C ( 2 @,@ 010 ° F ) and the combination , bronze , which is liquid at less than 1 @,@ 083 ° C ( 1 @,@ 981 ° F ) . In comparison , cast iron melts at about 1 @,@ 375 ° C ( 2 @,@ 507 ° F ) . Small quantities of iron were smelted in ancient times , in the solid state , by heating the ore in a charcoal fire and welding the clumps together with a hammer , squeezing out the impurities . With care , the carbon content could be controlled by moving it around in the fire . 
 All of these temperatures could be reached with ancient methods used since the Bronze Age . Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond 800 ° C ( 1 @,@ 470 ° F ) , it is important that smelting take place in a low @-@ oxygen environment . Unlike copper and tin , liquid or solid iron dissolves carbon quite readily . Smelting , using carbon to reduce iron oxides , results in an alloy ( pig iron ) that retains too much carbon to be called steel . The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step . 
 Other materials are often added to the iron / carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties . Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron @-@ carbon solution more stable , chromium increases hardness and melting temperature , and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue . 
 To inhibit corrosion , at least 11 % chromium is added to steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface ; this is known as stainless steel . Tungsten interferes with the formation of cementite , allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates , resulting in high speed steel . On the other hand , sulfur , nitrogen , and phosphorus make steel more brittle , so these commonly found elements must be removed from the steel melt during processing . 
 The density of steel varies based on the alloying constituents but usually ranges between 7 @,@ 750 and 8 @,@ 050 kg / m3 ( 484 and 503 lb / cu ft ) , or 7 @.@ 75 and 8 @.@ 05 g / cm3 ( 4 @.@ 48 and 4 @.@ 65 oz / cu in ) . 
 Even in a narrow range of concentrations of mixtures of carbon and iron that make a steel , a number of different metallurgical structures , with very different properties can form . Understanding such properties is essential to making quality steel . At room temperature , the most stable form of pure iron is the body @-@ centered cubic ( BCC ) structure called alpha iron or α @-@ iron . It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon , no more than 0 @.@ 005 % at 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) and 0 @.@ 021 wt % at 723 ° C ( 1 @,@ 333 ° F ) . The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called ferrite . At 910 ° C pure iron transforms into a face @-@ centered cubic ( FCC ) structure , called gamma iron or γ @-@ iron . The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite . The FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon , as much as 2 @.@ 1 % ( 38 times that of ferrite ) carbon at 1 @,@ 148 ° C ( 2 @,@ 098 ° F ) , which reflects the upper carbon content of steel , beyond which is cast iron . When carbon moves out of solution with iron it forms a very hard , but brittle material called cementite ( <unk> ) . 
 When steels with exactly 0 @.@ 8 % carbon ( known as a eutectoid steel ) , are cooled , the austenitic phase ( FCC ) of the mixture attempts to revert to the ferrite phase ( BCC ) . The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure , resulting in an excess of carbon . One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite , leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite that is able to hold the carbon in solution . The two , ferrite and cementite , precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite , named for its resemblance to mother of pearl . In a <unk> composition ( greater than 0 @.@ 8 % carbon ) , the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries and then when the composition left behind is eutectoid , the pearlite structure forms . For steels that have less than 0 @.@ 8 % carbon ( <unk> ) , ferrite will first form until the remaining composition is 0 @.@ 8 % at which point the pearlite structure will form . No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries . The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow , allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate . 
 As the rate of cooling is increased the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains ; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains , resulting in hardening of the steel . At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching , the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite . <unk> is highly strained and stressed supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle . Depending on the carbon content , the martensitic phase takes different forms . Below 0 @.@ 2 % carbon , it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form , but at higher carbon content it takes a body @-@ centered tetragonal ( BCT ) structure . There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite . Moreover , there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors . 
 <unk> has a lower density ( it expands ) than does austenite , so that the transformation between them results in a change of volume . In this case , expansion occurs . Internal stresses from this expansion generally take the form of compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite , with a fair amount of shear on both constituents . If quenching is done improperly , the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools . At the very least , they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections . It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched , although they may not always be visible . 
 = = = Heat treatment = = = 
 There are many types of heat treating processes available to steel . The most common are annealing , quenching , and tempering . Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the eutectoid compositions ( <unk> ) . <unk> steel does not harden from heat treatment . Annealing is the process of heating the steel to a sufficiently high temperature to relieve local internal stresses . It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material . This process goes through three phases : recovery , recrystallization , and grain growth . The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the constituents of the alloy . 
 <unk> and tempering first involves heating the steel to the austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil . This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure . The steel is then tempered , which is just a specialized type of annealing , to reduce brittleness . In this application the annealing ( tempering ) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite , or <unk> and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects . The result is a more ductile and fracture @-@ resistant steel . 
 = = Steel production = = 
 When iron is smelted from its ore , it contains more carbon than is desirable . To become steel , it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount , at which point other elements can be added . In the past , steel facilities would cast the raw cast iron product into ingots which would be stored until use in further refinement processes that resulted in the finished product . In modern facilities , the initial product is close to the final composition and is continuously cast into long slabs , cut and shaped into bars and extrusions and heat treated to produce a final product . Today only a small fraction is cast into ingots . Approximately 96 % of steel is continuously cast , while only 4 % is produced as ingots . 
 The ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs , billets , or blooms . <unk> are hot or cold rolled into sheet metal or plates . <unk> are hot or cold rolled into bars , rods , and wire . <unk> are hot or cold rolled into structural steel , such as I @-@ beams and rails . In modern steel mills these processes often occur in one assembly line , with ore coming in and finished steel products coming out . Sometimes after a steel 's final rolling it is heat treated for strength , however this is relatively rare .

 Steel was known in antiquity , and possibly was produced in bloomeries and crucibles . 
 The earliest known production of steel are pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia ( Kaman @-@ <unk> ) and are nearly 4 @,@ 000 years old , dating from 1800 BC . Horace identifies steel weapons like the falcata in the Iberian Peninsula , while <unk> steel was used by the Roman military . 
 The reputation of <unk> iron of South India ( <unk> steel ) amongst the rest of the world grew considerably . South Indian and Mediterranean sources including Alexander the Great ( 3rd c . BC ) recount the presentation and export to the Greeks of 100 talents worth of such steel . Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds , capable of producing high @-@ carbon steel . Large @-@ scale Wootz steel production in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon sources such as the plant <unk> occurred by the sixth century BC , the pioneering precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy . 
 The Chinese of the Warring States period ( 403 – 221 BC ) had quench @-@ hardened steel , while Chinese of the Han dynasty ( 202 BC – 220 AD ) created steel by melting together wrought iron with cast iron , gaining an ultimate product of a carbon @-@ intermediate steel by the 1st century AD . The Haya people of East Africa invented a type of furnace they used to make carbon steel at 1 @,@ 802 ° C ( 3 @,@ 276 ° F ) nearly 2 @,@ 000 years ago . East African steel has been suggested by Richard Hooker to date back to 1400 BC . 
 = = = Wootz steel and Damascus steel = = = 
 Evidence of the earliest production of high carbon steel in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area , Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka , and in <unk> areas of Sri Lanka . This came to be known as Wootz steel , produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally . The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil , Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans , Egyptian , Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – what they called <unk> Iron . A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama , in the South East of Sri Lanka , brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period . The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD . In Sri Lanka , this early steel @-@ making method employed a unique wind furnace , driven by the monsoon winds , capable of producing high @-@ carbon steel . Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India , the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400 – 500 BC . 
 Wootz , also known as Damascus steel , is famous for its durability and ability to hold an edge . It was originally created from a number of different materials including various trace elements , apparently ultimately from the writings of <unk> of <unk> . However , the steel was an old technology in India when King Porus presented a steel sword to the Emperor Alexander in 326 BC . It was essentially a complicated alloy with iron as its main component . Recent studies have suggested that carbon nanotubes were included in its structure , which might explain some of its legendary qualities , though given the technology of that time , such qualities were produced by chance rather than by design . Natural wind was used where the soil containing iron was heated by the use of wood . The ancient Sinhalese managed to extract a ton of steel for every 2 tons of soil , a remarkable feat at the time . One such furnace was found in <unk> and archaeologists were able to produce steel as the ancients did . 
 Crucible steel , formed by slowly heating and cooling pure iron and carbon ( typically in the form of charcoal ) in a crucible , was produced in Merv by the 9th to 10th century AD . In the 11th century , there is evidence of the production of steel in Song China using two techniques : a " <unk> " method that produced inferior , inhomogeneous , steel , and a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that used partial <unk> via repeated forging under a cold blast . 
 = = = Modern steelmaking = = = 
 Since the 17th century the first step in European steel production has been the smelting of iron ore into pig iron in a blast furnace . Originally employing charcoal , modern methods use coke , which has proven more economical . 
 = = = = Processes starting from bar iron = = = = 
 In these processes pig iron was refined ( fined ) in a finery forge to produce bar iron , which was then used in steel @-@ making . 
 The production of steel by the cementation process was described in a treatise published in Prague in 1574 and was in use in Nuremberg from 1601 . A similar process for case hardening armour and files was described in a book published in Naples in 1589 . The process was introduced to England in about 1614 and used to produce such steel by Sir Basil Brooke at Coalbrookdale during the 1610s . 
 The raw material for this process were bars of iron . During the 17th century it was realized that the best steel came from <unk> iron of a region north of Stockholm , Sweden . This was still the usual raw material source in the 19th century , almost as long as the process was used . 
 Crucible steel is steel that has been melted in a crucible rather than having been forged , with the result that it is more homogeneous . Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel . The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s . Blister steel ( made as above ) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace , and cast ( usually ) into ingots . 
 = = = = Processes starting from pig iron = = = = 
 The modern era in steelmaking began with the introduction of Henry Bessemer 's Bessemer process in 1855 , the raw material for which was pig iron . His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply , thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used . The Gilchrist @-@ Thomas process ( or basic Bessemer process ) was an improvement to the Bessemer process , made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus . 
 Another 19th @-@ century steelmaking process was the Siemens @-@ Martin process , which complemented the Bessemer process . It consisted of co @-@ melting bar iron ( or steel scrap ) with pig iron . 
 These methods of steel production were rendered obsolete by the Linz @-@ <unk> process of basic oxygen steelmaking ( BOS ) , developed in the 1950s , and other oxygen steel making methods . Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities , primarily nitrogen , that previously had entered from the air used . Today , electric arc furnaces ( EAF ) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel . They can also be used for converting pig iron to steel , but they use a lot of electrical energy ( about 440 kWh per metric ton ) , and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity . 
 = = Steel industry = = 
 It is common today to talk about " the iron and steel industry " as if it were a single entity , but historically they were separate products . The steel industry is often considered an indicator of economic progress , because of the critical role played by steel in infrastructural and overall economic development . 
 In 1980 , there were more than 500 @,@ 000 U.S. steelworkers . By 2000 , the number of steelworkers fell to 224 @,@ 000 . 
 The economic boom in China and India has caused a massive increase in the demand for steel in recent years . Between 2000 and 2005 , world steel demand increased by 6 % . Since 2000 , several Indian and Chinese steel firms have risen to prominence , such as Tata Steel ( which bought Corus Group in 2007 ) , Shanghai <unk> Group Corporation and <unk> Group . ArcelorMittal is however the world 's largest steel producer . 
 In 2005 , the British Geological Survey stated China was the top steel producer with about one @-@ third of the world share ; Japan , Russia , and the US followed respectively . 
 In 2008 , steel began trading as a commodity on the London Metal Exchange . At the end of 2008 , the steel industry faced a sharp downturn that led to many cut @-@ backs . 
 The world steel industry peaked in 2007 . That year , ThyssenKrupp spent $ 12 billion to build the two most modern mills in the world , in Calvert , Alabama and Sepetiba , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . The worldwide Great Recession starting in 2008 , however , sharply lowered demand and new construction , and so prices fell . ThyssenKrupp lost $ 11 billion on its two new plants , which sold steel below the cost of production . 
 = = Recycling = = 
 Steel is one of the world 's most @-@ recycled materials , with a recycling rate of over 60 % globally ; in the United States alone , over 82 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 81 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 long tons ) was recycled in the year 2008 , for an overall recycling rate of 83 % .

 = = = Carbon steels = = = 
 Modern steels are made with varying combinations of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes . Carbon steel , composed simply of iron and carbon , accounts for 90 % of steel production . Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements , usually molybdenum , manganese , chromium , or nickel , in amounts of up to 10 % by weight to improve the <unk> of thick sections . High strength low alloy steel has small additions ( usually < 2 % by weight ) of other elements , typically 1 @.@ 5 % manganese , to provide additional strength for a modest price increase . 
 Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) regulations have given rise to a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel ( <unk> ) . This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material . There are several commercially available grades of <unk> , such as dual @-@ phase steel , which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a <unk> , high strength steel . Transformation Induced Plasticity ( TRIP ) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite @-@ free low @-@ alloy ferritic steels . By applying strain , the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat . Twinning Induced Plasticity ( <unk> ) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy . 
 Carbon Steels are often galvanized , through hot @-@ dip or electroplating in zinc for protection against rust . 
 = = = Alloy steels = = = 
 Stainless steels contain a minimum of 11 % chromium , often combined with nickel , to resist corrosion . Some stainless steels , such as the ferritic stainless steels are magnetic , while others , such as the austenitic , are nonmagnetic . Corrosion @-@ resistant steels are abbreviated as <unk> . 
 Some more modern steels include tool steels , which are alloyed with large amounts of tungsten and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening . This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy 's temperature resistance . Tool steel is generally used in axes , drills , and other devices that need a sharp , long @-@ lasting cutting edge . Other special @-@ purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor @-@ ten , which weather by acquiring a stable , rusted surface , and so can be used un @-@ painted . <unk> steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements , but unlike most steel contains little carbon ( 0 @.@ 01 % ) . This creates a very strong but still malleable steel . 
 Eglin steel uses a combination of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low @-@ cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons . Hadfield steel ( after Sir Robert Hadfield ) or manganese steel contains 12 – 14 % manganese which when abraded strain hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing . Examples include tank tracks , bulldozer blade edges and cutting blades on the jaws of life . 
 In 2016 a breakthrough in creating a strong light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology . Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness . The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy — nearly as strong as titanium at ten percent the cost — which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by <unk> , a Korean <unk> . 
 = = = Standards = = = 
 Most of the more commonly used steel alloys are categorized into various grades by standards organizations . For example , the Society of Automotive Engineers has a series of grades defining many types of steel . The American Society for Testing and Materials has a separate set of standards , which define alloys such as A36 steel , the most commonly used structural steel in the United States . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Iron and steel are used widely in the construction of roads , railways , other infrastructure , appliances , and buildings . Most large modern structures , such as stadiums and skyscrapers , bridges , and airports , are supported by a steel skeleton . Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing . In addition , it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars . Despite growth in usage of aluminium , it is still the main material for car bodies . Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials , such as bolts , nails , and screws and other household products and cooking utensils . 
 Other common applications include shipbuilding , pipelines , mining , offshore construction , aerospace , white goods ( e.g. washing machines ) , heavy equipment such as bulldozers , office furniture , steel wool , tools , and armour in the form of personal vests or vehicle armour ( better known as rolled homogeneous armour in this role ) . 
 = = = Historical = = = 
 Before the introduction of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques , steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed , particularly for the cutting edge of knives , razors , swords , and other items where a hard , sharp edge was needed . It was also used for springs , including those used in clocks and watches . 
 With the advent of speedier and <unk> production methods , steel has become easier to obtain and much cheaper . It has replaced wrought iron for a multitude of purposes . However , the availability of plastics in the latter part of the 20th century allowed these materials to replace steel in some applications due to their lower fabrication cost and weight . Carbon fiber is replacing steel in some cost insensitive applications such as aircraft , sports equipment and high end automobiles .

 = Hamdi Qandil = 
 Hamdi Qandil ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , surname also spelled <unk> or Kandil ; born 1936 ) is a prominent Egyptian journalist , news anchor , talk show host and activist . Qandil started his journalism career in the 1950s when he wrote for the Akher Sa 'a ( " Last Hour " ) magazine at the invitation of veteran journalist Mustafa Amin . In 1961 he began broadcasting a news show called Aqwal al @-@ Suhf ( " In the Press " ) until 1969 when he was appointed director of the Arab Broadcasting Studios Union . In 1971 he left his post in protest at a government inspection of his technical staff . He later worked with UNESCO from 1974 to 1986 , specializing in the field of international media . In 1987 he co @-@ founded a satellite broadcasting company that later became known as MBC , where he worked for three months before leaving because of political differences with its management . Qandil briefly presented the show Ma 'a Hamdi Qandil ( " With Hamdi Qandil " ) for ART , but left amid disagreements between him and his managers regarding Qandil 's planned interviews with Muammar Gaddafi and Tariq Aziz . 
 He returned to Egyptian television in 1998 , hosting the current affairs and press review talk show Ra 'is el @-@ Tahrir ( " Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief " ) . The program became one of the most popular and respected in Egypt . After apparent trouble with the state censors , Qandil moved the show to Dubai TV in 2004 under the name Qalam Rosas ( " Pencil . " ) The new program was highly watched throughout the Arab world . He was forced to quit Dubai TV after criticizing Arab governments and subsequently hosted the show on the Libyan channel Al @-@ Libia for two months before the Libyan government cancelled it . He returned to Egypt and wrote for the Al @-@ Masry Al @-@ <unk> newspaper and then Al @-@ Shorouk , but his association with the latter ended as a result of a libel suit brought on by then @-@ Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit in response to a column critical of Egyptian foreign policy written by Qandil in May 2010 . The case was later dropped following the 2011 Egyptian Revolution . 
 Qandil is well known for his pan @-@ Arabist discourse and fierce criticism of the Egyptian and other Arab governments . According to Al @-@ Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies political analyst <unk> <unk> , Qandil " is a great Egyptian journalist and highly credible , he is bold and gives constructive criticism ... people listen to him and take what he says seriously , which is why he poses a threat " to the government . Prior to the Egyptian revolution , Qandil co @-@ founded the National Association for Change , a reformist group headed Mohamed ElBaradei . Since September 2012 , Qandil has lent his support to the Egyptian Popular Current opposition movement .

 Qandil was born in Cairo in 1936 to a father from <unk> . He was the eldest of five children . Qandil spent much of his childhood and had his primary schooling in the Nile Delta city of Tanta . His father had moved the middle @-@ income family to that city , where he owned a few <unk> of land mostly planted with pears and grapes . Qandil 's father primarily distributed them to neighbors and others close to him . 
 During Qandil 's boyhood , he borrowed and read books from a medical practice and a culture and sporting association in Tanta on a near weekly basis . He also learned field hockey there . Qandil was at the top of his class throughout his later school years and initially sought to enter the medical profession , a typical career aspiration for students with high marks . His mother particularly encouraged him to become a doctor . Qandil simultaneously took an interest in writing , Arabic calligraphy and foreign languages . 
 = = = Journalism career and education = = = 
 Qandil was introduced to journalism when he began writing a secondary school research paper . During that time , he also wrote an article for the low @-@ budget Tanta newspaper Al Ikhlas , criticizing King Farouk for spending one million pounds from the treasury to purchase a yacht called the " <unk> . " He was fired soon after , but had since grown fond of journalism . Due to this new interest and his father 's increasingly poor health , Qandil did not complete the first stage of his medical studies , causing his 1952 application to medical school to be rejected . He instead enrolled in the department of geology at Alexandria University . In July of that year , King Farouk was overthrown by a group of dissenting officers led by Gamal Abdel Nasser , leading to the subsequent establishment of a republican system under the presidency of leading officer Muhammad Naguib . 
 Qandil spent two months studying geology and decided to retake his high school examinations in order to enter into medical school . He performed well and was admitted to Cairo University 's Qasr El @-@ <unk> Faculty of Medicine in 1953 . He continued in his studies until 1956 , by which time Nasser had become president . During this period he also joined the National Guard . Together with some of his fellow students he founded his college 's official magazine , which they printed through the Akhbar el @-@ Yom publishing house . The magazine 's first edition was confiscated due to an article Qandil wrote that was critical of university professors and regulations . Shortly after completing his final exams in 1956 , Qandil was offered a writing position with Akher Sa 'a ( " Last Hour " ) magazine by its owners , the prominent journalists and brothers Mustafa Amin and Ali Amin . Mustafa employed Qandil with a salary of 15 Egyptian pounds and initially tasked him with writing the horoscope and a column that responded to letters from readers . Qandil was asked by Amin to serve as an editor for Akher Sa 'a in 1961 . 
 That year Qandil also attended the International Union of Students in Prague , Czechoslovakia , where he met Yasser Arafat , then the head of the General Union of Palestinian Students . Later in 1956 Qandil was accepted into the department of journalism , obtaining a license ( bachelor 's degree ) in journalism in 1960 . Four years later he received a diploma in journalism from the Berlin Institute . Throughout this period he wrote for the magazine Al @-@ Tahrir , earning a salary of 25 Egyptian pounds , and also worked with Al @-@ <unk> magazine in Damascus . 
 = = Career in television and the UN = = 
 In 1961 Qandil began to work in broadcast television as the presenter of the program Aqwal al @-@ Suhf ( " In the Press " ) . In 1966 he became a media adviser to a television studio in Jordan , a role which ended after six weeks ; the single broadcast of Aqwal al @-@ Suhf in Jordan was met with consternation from the Jordanian royal government and after Qandil was notified of this disapproval , he immediately returned to Egypt where he continued presenting the program . His position in Aqwal al @-@ Suhf ended in 1969 with his appointment as director of the Arab Broadcasting Stations Union ( <unk> ) . 
 In early May 1971 Qandil left the <unk> after refusing to launch a disciplinary investigation of the technical team that recorded the Labor Day speech given by Anwar Sadat , who became president following Nasser 's death in 1970 . He left at a time when numerous broadcasters and media personalities were removed from their positions during Sadat 's Corrective Revolution . However , he briefly returned to television in 1973 to announce Egypt 's claimed victory in the Yom Kippur War with Israel in October of that year . 
 Qandil was appointed manager of the Department of the Free Flow of Information and Communication Policies for UNESCO in 1974 . In an interview with Al @-@ Ahram Weekly , Qandil stated that while at UNESCO he " specialised in satellite communications and published several books and studies " dealing with global media and broadcasting . During this time he strongly pushed to include Palestine as a member and attempted to remove the United States , the United Kingdom and Singapore from the organization . According to his own account , he was also able to master the English and French languages , and gain experience in diplomacy . He left UNESCO in 1986 . 
 Together with partners from Egypt and the Arab world , Qandil co @-@ founded the Eastern Satellite Communications Company in 1987 . Its main purpose was to serve broadcasting station that would target Arabic @-@ speaking communities in the Western world and to counter what Qandil perceived as Western bias in global media . However , in 1992 , as a result of financial difficulties the company was sold and subsequently became the Middle East Broadcasting Center ( MBC ) . Qandil worked at MBC for roughly three months until he quit , citing political differences with the station 's managers , who considered him a Nasserist . That same year , he was offered to host his own show at Arab Radio and Television ( ART ) , but initially opted to work on a project setting up a private Egyptian station for Al @-@ Ahram . The station was not launched and Qandil took up a position at ART in 1996 where he hosted his own show called With Hamdi Qandil . Qandil 's arrangements to interview Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the anniversary of the 1969 coup that brought him to power , and also Tariq Aziz , the vice president of Iraq at the time , aroused controversy among ART 's managers . He quit thereafter .

 In 1998 Qandil responded favorably to the invitation of <unk> El @-@ Sherif , the Information Minister in Hosni Mubarak 's government , to return to Egyptian television . In March his program Ra 'is el @-@ Tahrir ( " Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief " ) began airing . Qandil stated he returned to Egyptian television because he felt he owed " a debt of gratitude to the institution that built my fame when I was in my twenties . Also , working in Egypt is more immediately rewarding than anywhere else . " With the relaxation of media restrictions during this period , Ra 'is el @-@ Tahrir became one of the most popular and respected television programs in Egypt . Describing the relative freedom afforded to the media , Qandil stated in 2001 that the situation was an improvement from when he first began the program , but " as long as there remains a censor , we will continue to ask for more [ freedom of expression ] . " 
 Ra 'is el @-@ Tahrir was intended to serve as a weekly review of the pan @-@ Arab press , but in practice the program became a medium through which Qandil expressed his opinions on various issues confronting Egypt and the Arab world , views which he claimed were representative of the popular Egyptian sentiment . Al @-@ Ahram Weekly ′ s Amina <unk> wrote that during the show , Qandil spoke " in histrionic style , his commentary replete with daring questions and remarks . Viewers are fascinated by his apparent lack of inhibition . " 
 In the wake of the Second Intifada , the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation that began in 2000 , the show became dominated by the conflict , which Qandil generally regarded as a campaign of Israeli aggression . He frequently broadcast the Israeli military 's actions during the Intifada and called for viewers to support the uprising and boycott Israeli products . Qandil responded to a query regarding his extensive coverage of the Intifada by saying , " How are news shows expected to react to events such as the Intifada ? Are we supposed to keep silent ? " 
 Ra 'is el @-@ Tahrir later moved to Dream TV , an Egypt @-@ based television station . Qandil continued to express his frustrations regarding the Israel and the Intifada , the run @-@ up to the invasion of Iraq , and what he perceived as the United States ' maligned intentions for the Middle East . According to author and researcher Andrew Hammond , " The show 's combination of current affairs , press reviews and talk @-@ shows became the most talked @-@ about television in Egypt since Al @-@ Jazeera 's al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Mu <unk> . " His show on Dream TV was cancelled abruptly in early 2003 amid rumors that he had been crossing political red lines during his broadcasts , including stinging criticism of the government of Hosni Mubarak . This reasoning was dismissed by Dream TV manager Sanaa Mansour , who stated that Qandil had not been let go , was free to express himself and left the show without offering an explanation to management . 
 In 2004 Qandil moved to the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) began hosting a program on Dubai TV called Qalam Rosas ( " Pencil " ) . The program was virtually a continuation of Ra 'is al @-@ Tahrir , a highly watched show dealing with the Arab world 's major political , economic and social affairs of the day . Qalam Rosas would normally open with Qandil interviewing an Arab intellectual and discussing a current event . The show would then continue to a round table discussion with other journalists analyzing various social and political events and movements concerning the citizens of the Arab world . At its closing , Qandil would summarize the show with a well @-@ known maxim or saying . The London @-@ based Arab Media Watch organization awarded Qandil the 2006 Media Accomplishment Award to commend him for his " creativity and participation in the media world " over the course of his five decade career . In 2008 Qandil was forced to leave Dubai TV for criticizing Arab leaders , while commending Hassan Nasrallah , the secretary @-@ general of the Lebanese political party and paramilitary group Hezbollah . 
 After his departure from Dubai TV he entered into a contract with Al @-@ Libia , although he only remained with the Libyan channel for two months . Qandil 's show was cancelled when the state @-@ owned Al Jamahiriya Radio 's General Authority took control of the channel . There was no official reason for the cancellation , but Qandil stated it was because of " instructions from high @-@ ranking Libyan officials due to pressures from Egypt . " He was reportedly offered to present Qalam Rosas on the Hezbollah @-@ linked Al @-@ Manar TV in early 2009 , but opted not to join citing an unclear situation regarding his contract with Al @-@ Libia . 
 = = Political activism and Aboul Gheit lawsuit = = 
 After his brief stint on Al @-@ Libia , Qandil returned to Egypt to write for the newspaper Al @-@ Masry Al @-@ <unk> in 2008 and later began writing for Al @-@ Shorouk . He co @-@ founded and served as the media spokesman for National Association for Change ( NAC ) headed by Mohamed ElBaradei in early 2010 . The NAC 's stated purpose is push for democratic and other reforms in Egypt . In May Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit brought a lawsuit for libel against Qandil in response to a critical column about Aboul Gheit and Egyptian foreign policy that Qandil wrote for Al @-@ Shorouk , called " The Homeland ’ s Disgrace and that of the Citizen . " In the column Qandil lambasted the contradictory statements made by Aboul Gheit and Egypt 's ambassador to Israel , in which the latter said Israel was a friendly state , while Aboul Gheit had just previously stated that Israel was an enemy . Qandil wrote that the ambassador sought to cover up Aboul Gheit 's statement , and that Aboul Gheit 's words " usually ... fall from his mouth like droppings of a torn rubbish bag . " The matter was transferred to the criminal court . His relationship with Al @-@ Shorouk consequently ended as a result of the controversy . 
 In June 2010 Qandil quit his position as the NAC 's media spokesman . He did not give an official reason for resigning , but was reportedly upset that ElBaradei was frequently outside of Egypt . In mid @-@ December Qandil appeared in court and his defense team , which included his brother Assem and Gamal Eid requested that the " biased " court quit and that the case be transferred to a civil jurisdiction . On 24 January 2011 the court refused the referral and also refused to summon Aboul Gheit at the request of Qandil 's defense team . On 25 January mass demonstrations demanding President Hosni Mubarak 's downfall erupted across Egypt , eventually overthrowing the government , including Aboul Gheit , on 11 February . In April Aboul Gheit dropped the lawsuit . According to Hafez Abu <unk> of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights , the revolution was the clear reason Aboul Gheit withdrew the suit , and had it not occurred , " the court could have handed [ Qandil ] a prison sentence . " 
 = = Political views = = 
 Qandil describes himself as a supporter of Nasserism , which he defines not as a political affiliation , but rather an ideal of " social justice " and " national liberation " that " goes beyond generation and class . " He did not join any of Egypt 's Nasserist political parties or organizations , but viewed the era of late president Nasser as a period in which his " generation was taught self @-@ respect , national pride and the courage to stand up against the great powers . " Qandil was described by Hammond as a " secular @-@ nationalist ... embodying the ' conscience of the Arab nation ' " . 
 In a 1999 interview Qandil stated his view that the pan @-@ Arab media was not able to counter what he perceived as the influence of Zionism in American media and that the state of Arab media reflected the state of stagnation in the Arab world in general . Qandil is vociferously opposed to United States foreign policy in the Middle East . He referred to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 as the " biggest modern disaster for the Arabs since 1948 , " the year in which the newly established state of Israel defeated a coalition of Arab armies , causing a mass exodus of Palestinians from their homes . 
 Qandil supported the 2011 Egyptian revolution and called for Mubarak to step down from the start of the protests . In a lecture to students from the American University of Cairo in early March 2011 , Qandil hailed the young protesters who started the revolution as " brave " and expressed hope that it would open an era of democracy and press freedom in Egypt . During the 2012 Egyptian presidential election , Qandil endorsed Nasserist candidate <unk> Sabahi after the Revolutionary Youth Coalition ( <unk> ) announced their support for him . In late September 2012 , during the post @-@ revolution period in Egypt during Mohamed Morsi 's presidency , Qandil announced his support for the Egyptian Popular Current movement founded by Sabahi . At the inaugural conference , Qandil stated that " a major political battle " would soon be launched for the next parliamentary elections and that Egypt 's diverse make @-@ up could never be changed .

 = Kalamazoo @-@ class monitor = 
 The Kalamazoo @-@ class monitors were a class of ocean @-@ going ironclad monitors begun during the American Civil War . Unfinished by the end of the war , their construction was suspended in November 1865 and the unseasoned wood of their hulls rotted while they were still on the building stocks . If the four ships had been finished they would have been the most seaworthy monitors in the US Navy . One was scrapped in 1874 while the other three were disposed of a decade later . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 John Lenthall , Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair , ordered Benjamin F. Delano , naval constructor at New York City , to design a wooden @-@ hulled ironclad that would carry her armament in two gun turrets . The deck was to be 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) above the waterline and protected by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armor . The ship 's side armor was to be 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick , backed by 12 – 15 inches ( 305 – 381 mm ) of wood ; it was to cover the entire ship 's side , down to a depth three feet below the waterline . It should carry enough coal to steam one week at full power with " sufficient speed to make good use of its ram " . Gideon Welles , Secretary of the Navy , called them enlarged versions of the Miantonomoh @-@ class monitors with greater speed and " adapted to coast service " , meaning more seaworthy . 
 The Kalamazoo @-@ class ships were 345 feet 5 inches ( 105 @.@ 3 m ) long overall and had a length between perpendiculars of 332 feet 6 inches ( 101 @.@ 3 m ) . They had a beam of 56 feet 8 inches ( 17 @.@ 27 m ) and a draft of 17 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 3 m ) . The ships were designed to displace 5 @,@ 660 long tons ( 5 @,@ 750 t ) and were 3 @,@ 200 tons burthen . They were the largest ships to be built in navy shipyards to date . 
 Their unseasoned wooden hulls were massively reinforced by iron straps as well as iron stanchions to bear the enormous weight of their armor and guns . They retained the typical monitor overhang introduced by John Ericsson , designer of the Monitor , where the upper part of the hull was 42 inches ( 1 @,@ 100 mm ) wider than the lower part of the hull . The Kalamazoo 's wrought iron side armor consisted of two layers of three @-@ inch plates , backed by 21 inches of wood , six feet in height . The outer layer of armor extended 18 inches ( 460 mm ) further below the waterline . The three @-@ inch deck armor rested on 6 inches ( 152 mm ) of wood and was covered in another three inches of wood . 
 They were powered by two 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engines , each driving one 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) propellers , using steam generated by eight tubular boilers . The engines were rated at 2 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 500 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . They had a bore of 46 @.@ 5 inches ( 1 @,@ 181 mm ) and a stroke of 50 inches ( 1 @,@ 270 mm ) . Two large funnels were positioned between the turrets to handle the combustion gases from the boilers . The <unk> were intended to carry 500 long tons ( 510 t ) of coal . 
 The ships ' main armament consisted of four smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading , 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets . Each gun weighed approximately 43 @,@ 000 pounds ( 20 @,@ 000 kg ) . They could fire a 350 @-@ pound ( 158 @.@ 8 kg ) shell up to a range of 2 @,@ 100 yards ( 1 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of + 7 ° . The turrets were protected by 15 inches of armor .

 Construction of the ships began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built when the war ended in early 1865 . Construction was suspended on all four on 17 November 1865 ; they remained on the stocks . The ships were renamed , usually twice , in 1869 to conform to several new ship naming conventions . Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig , but this never happened . The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874 . Unusually , <unk> was condemned by an Act of Congress on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884 . 
 = Franklin half dollar = 
 The Franklin half dollar is a coin that was struck by the United States Mint from 1948 to 1963 . The fifty @-@ cent piece pictures Founding Father Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and the Liberty Bell on the reverse . A small eagle was placed to the right of the bell to fulfill the legal requirement that half dollars depict the figure of an eagle . Produced in 90 percent silver with a reeded edge , the coin was struck at the Philadelphia , Denver , and San Francisco mints . At the end of April 2016 the metal value of the $ 0 @.@ 50 coin was approximately $ 6 @.@ 48 , an increase of approximately 1300 % . 
 Mint director Nellie Tayloe Ross had long admired Franklin , and wanted him to be depicted on a coin . In 1947 , she instructed her chief engraver , John R. Sinnock , to prepare designs for a Franklin half dollar . Sinnock 's designs were based on his earlier work , but he died before their completion . The designs were completed by Sinnock 's successor , Gilroy Roberts . The Mint submitted the new designs to the Commission of Fine Arts ( " Commission " ) for its advisory opinion . The Commission disliked the small eagle and felt that depicting the crack in the Liberty Bell would expose the coinage to jokes and ridicule . Despite the Commission 's disapproval , the Mint proceeded with Sinnock 's designs . 
 After the coins were released in April 1948 , the Mint received accusations that Sinnock 's initials " JRS " on the cutoff at Franklin 's shoulder were a tribute to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin ( Stalin did not have a middle name that began with an ' R ' ) . No change was made , with the Mint responding that the letters were simply the artist 's initials ( The same accusation was made after the release of the Sinnock designed Roosevelt Dime in 1946 ) . The coin was struck regularly until 1963 ; beginning in 1964 it was replaced by the Kennedy half dollar , issued in honor of the assassinated President , John F. Kennedy . Though the coin is still legal tender , its value to collectors or as silver both greatly exceed its face value .

 Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross had long been an admirer of Benjamin Franklin , and wished to see him on a coin . In 1933 , Sinnock had designed a medal featuring Franklin , which may have given her the idea . Franklin had opposed putting portraits on coins ; he advocated proverbs about which the holder could profit through reflection . In a 1948 interview , Ross noted that Franklin only knew of living royalty on coins , and presumably would feel differently about a republic honoring a deceased founder . Indeed , Franklin might have been more upset at the reverse design : as numismatic writer Jonathan Tepper noted , " Had Benjamin Franklin known that he would be appearing on a half dollar with an eagle , he most likely would have been quite upset . He detested the eagle , and numismatic lore has it that he often referred to it as a scavenger . Given the practical man that he was , Franklin proposed the wild turkey as our national bird . " 
 An 1890 statute forbade the replacement of a coin design without congressional action , unless it had been in service for 25 years , counting the year of first issuance . The Walking Liberty half dollar and Mercury dime had been first issued in 1916 ; they could be replaced without congressional action from and after 1940 . Mint officials considered putting Franklin on the dime in 1941 , but the project was shelved due to heavy demands on the Mint for coins as the United States entered World War II . During the war , the Mint contemplated adding one or more new denominations of coinage ; Sinnock prepared a Franklin design in anticipation of a new issue , which did not occur . The dime was redesigned in 1946 to depict fallen President Franklin Roosevelt , who had been closely associated with the March of Dimes . The Walking Liberty design seemed old @-@ fashioned to Mint officials , and the only other coin being struck which was eligible for replacement was the Lincoln cent . Abraham Lincoln remained a beloved figure , and Ross did not want to be responsible for removing him from the coinage . 
 In 1947 , Ross asked Sinnock to produce a design for a half dollar featuring Franklin . The chief engraver adapted his earlier work for the obverse . He had designed the medal from a bust of Franklin by Jean @-@ Antoine Houdon . Sinnock based his design for the reverse on the 1926 commemorative half dollar for the sesquicentennial ( 150th anniversary ) of American Independence . Numismatic writer Don Taxay later discovered that Sinnock had based his Liberty Bell ( as depicted on both the Sesquicentennial half dollar and the Franklin half ) on a sketch by John Frederick Lewis . Sinnock died in May 1947 , before finishing the reverse design , which was completed by the new chief engraver , Gilroy Roberts . Similar to Sinnock 's work for the Roosevelt dime , the portrait is designed along simple lines , with Franklin depicted wearing a period suit . The small eagle on the reverse was added as an afterthought , when Mint officials realized that the Coinage Act of 1873 required one to be displayed on all coins of greater value than the dime . 
 The Mint sought comments on the designs from the Commission of Fine Arts , which was provided with a lead striking of the obverse and a view of the reverse ; Taxay suggests they were shown a plaster model . On December 1 , 1947 , Commission chairman Gilmore Clarke wrote to Ross saying that they had no objection to the obverse , in which they recognized Sinnock 's " good workmanship " . As for the reverse , 
 The eagle shown on the model is so small as to be insignificant and hardly discernible when the model is reduced to the size of a coin . The Commission hesitate to approve the Liberty Bell as shown with the crack in the bell visible ; to show this might lead to puns and to statements derogatory to United States coinage . 
 The Commission disapprove the designs . 
 Numismatist Paul Green later noted , " Over the years there would probably have been even more puns and derogatory statements if there had been an attempt to depict the bell without a crack . " The Commission suggested a design competition under its auspices . Its recommendations , which were only advisory , were rejected by the Treasury Department and the coin was approved by Treasury Secretary John W. Snyder , which Taxay ascribes to an unwillingness to dishonor Sinnock .

 On January 7 , 1948 , the Treasury issued a press release announcing the new half dollar . The Commission 's disapproval went unreported ; instead the release noted that the design had been Ross 's idea and had received Secretary Snyder 's " enthusiastic approval " . The release noted Franklin 's reputation for thrift , and expressed hope that the half dollar would serve as a reminder that spare cash should be used to purchase savings bonds and savings stamps . Franklin became the fifth person and first non @-@ president to be honored by the issuance of a regular @-@ issue US coin , after Lincoln , Roosevelt , George Washington and Thomas Jefferson . 
 In a speech given when she unveiled the design in January 1948 , Ross indicated that she had been urged to put Franklin on the cent because of his association with the adage " a penny saved is a penny earned " ( in Franklin 's original , " A penny saved is twopence dear " . ) Ross stated , " You will agree , I believe , that the fifty @-@ cent piece , being larger and of silver , lends itself much better to the production of an impressive effect . " On April 29 , 1948 , the day before the coin 's public release , Ross held a dinner party for 200 at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia ; each guest received a Franklin half dollar in a card signed by Ross . 
 The new half dollars first went on sale at noon on April 30 , 1948 , the anniversary of George Washington 's 1789 inauguration as President . They were sold from a booth on the steps of the Sub @-@ Treasury Building in New York , by employees of the Franklin Savings Bank dressed in Revolutionary @-@ era garb . 
 The Roosevelt dime had been designed by Sinnock , and had provoked complaints by citizens viewing Sinnock 's initials " JS " on the coin as those of Joseph Stalin , placed there by some Kremlin infiltrator within the Mint . Even though Sinnock 's initials ( placed on the cutoff of Franklin 's bust ) were expressed " JRS " , the Mint still received similar complaints , to which they responded with what numismatic historian Walter Breen termed " outraged official denials " . According to The New York Times , " People wrote in demanding to know how the Bureau of the Mint had discovered that Joe Stalin had a middle name . " Another rumor was that the small " o " in " of " was an error , and that the coins would be recalled . This claim died more quickly than the Stalin rumor . 
 After the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , Congress and the Mint moved with great speed to authorize and produce a half dollar in tribute to him . With the authorization of the Kennedy half dollar on December 30 , 1963 , the Franklin half dollar series came to an end . Breen reports rumors of 1964 Franklin half dollars , produced possibly as trial strikes to test 1964 @-@ dated dies , but none has ever come to light . A total of 465 @,@ 814 @,@ 455 Franklin half dollars were struck for circulation ; in addition , 15 @,@ 886 @,@ 955 were struck in proof .
