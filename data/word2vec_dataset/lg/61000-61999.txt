 The bigeye thresher ( Alopias superciliosus ) is a species of thresher shark , family Alopiidae , found in temperate and tropical oceans worldwide . Like other thresher sharks , nearly half its total length consists of the elongated upper lobe of the tail fin . Its common name comes from its enormous eyes , which are placed in keyhole @-@ shaped sockets that allow them to be rotated upward . This species can also be distinguished by a pair of deep grooves on the top of its head , from which its scientific name is derived . 
 The large eyes of the bigeye thresher are adapted for hunting in low light conditions . It is one of the few sharks that conduct a diel vertical migration , staying in deep water during the day and moving into surface waters at night to feed . To protect its sensitive brain and eyes from the temperature changes accompanying these movements , the bigeye thresher has a vascular exchange system called the rete mirabile around those organs . This species feeds mainly on fish and squid , which are stunned via whip @-@ like strikes of the long tail . Bigeye threshers are ovoviviparous , usually bearing litters of two pups . The embryos are oophagous and feed on ova produced by the mother while inside the uterus . This shark is caught by commercial fisheries across its range ; the meat is not highly regarded but the skin , fins , and liver oil are valued . It has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .

 British biologist Richard Thomas Lowe was the first to scientifically describe the bigeye thresher , in papers published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London ( 1840 ) and Transactions of the Zoological Society of London ( 1849 , sometimes given as 1839 ) . He based his description on a specimen caught off Madeira in the eastern Atlantic Ocean . However , Lowe 's description was subsequently overlooked by researchers and this species was known by different names until the 1940s , when new specimens from Cuba and Florida prompted its original scientific name to be resurrected . The specific epithet superciliosus is from the Latin super meaning " above " , and <unk> meaning " eyebrow " , referring to the distinct lateral grooves above the eyes . 
 An allozyme analysis conducted by Blaise Eitner in 1995 showed that the closest relative of the bigeye thresher is the pelagic thresher ( A. pelagicus ) , with which it forms a clade . Fossil remains of the bigeye thresher dating to the Middle Miocene ( 16 @.@ 0 – 11 @.@ 6 Ma ) have been found in the <unk> region of Japan . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The bigeye thresher has a virtually circumtropical distribution . In the western Atlantic Ocean , it has been reported from New York to Florida , the Bahamas , Cuba , Venezuela , Tobago and southern Brazil . In the eastern Atlantic , it is known from Portugal , Madeira , Senegal , Guinea to Sierra Leone , Angola , and the Mediterranean Sea . In the western Indian Ocean , it occurs off South Africa , Madagascar , and the Arabian Sea . In the Pacific Ocean , it is known from southern Japan , Taiwan , New Caledonia , northwestern Australia , and New Zealand , and eastward to Hawaii , southern California , the Gulf of California , and west of the Galapagos Islands . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has shown that Atlantic and Indo @-@ Pacific populations are somewhat genetically divergent from each other . 
 Bigeye threshers are usually found over the continental shelf and in the open sea , though they are occasionally encountered in shallow coastal waters . They occur in surface temperatures of 16 – 25 ° C ( 61 – 77 ° F ) , but have been tracked as far down as 723 m ( 2 @,@ 372 ft ) , where the temperature is only 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) . Little is known of their geographical movements ; one individual has been documented moving from New York to the Gulf of Mexico , a straight @-@ line distance of 2 @,@ 767 km ( 1 @,@ 719 mi ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The eyes of the bigeye thresher can measure up to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) across in adults . Each eye is taller than wide , with a bulbous upper portion . The orbits extend onto the dorsal surface of the head , allowing the eyes to orient upwards . There are also a pair of distinctive lateral grooves that extend from above the eyes to over the gill slits , giving it a " helmet " -like appearance . The snout is moderately long and bulbous , and there are no labial furrows at the corners of the mouth . The teeth are moderately large with a single , narrow cusp . There are 19 – 24 teeth in the upper jaw and 20 – 24 teeth in the lower jaw ; their shapes are similar in both jaws . There are large and small dermal denticles , with the smaller ones more numerous and interspersed amongst the larger ones . The smaller denticles taper to a point . 
 Up to half the body length is taken up by the long upper lobe of the caudal fin , which is broader than in other threshers . The large pectoral fins have a curved anterior margin and broad tips . The first dorsal fin is placed further back than in the other thresher sharks , with the free rear tip located above or just before the pelvic fins . Its coloration is a deep , metallic violet to purplish brown above and creamy white below . This color rapidly fades to a dull gray after death . Most bigeye threshers are 3 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 0 m ( 10 @.@ 8 – 13 @.@ 1 ft ) long and weigh 160 kg ( 350 lb ) . The largest known bigeye thresher measured 4 @.@ 9 m ( 16 ft ) long and weighed 364 kg ( 802 lb ) , and was caught near <unk> , New Zealand , in February 1981 . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The size and upward orientation of the bigeye thresher 's eyes are adapted to search for the silhouettes of prey in dim light . This species is one of a handful of shark species that conducts a diel vertical migration , spending daytime in deeper water between 300 – 500 m ( 980 – 1 @,@ 640 ft ) , beneath the thermocline where the temperature ranges from 6 to 12 ° C ( 43 to 54 ° F ) , and ascending above it to water less than 100 m ( 330 ft ) deep during nighttime . This migration likely relates to finding prey at night and avoiding predators during the day . The sharks ' daytime swimming patterns are usually steady , while at night they have a pattern of slow ascents and rapid descents . 
 Bigeye threshers are likely preyed upon by larger sharks and marine mammals . Known parasites of the bigeye thresher include the copepod <unk> tunica , and the tapeworm Litobothrium <unk> . Sea lampreys ( <unk> marinus ) have been seen attached near the cloaca of this shark . The bigeye thresher appears to be an ecological competitor of the blue shark ( Prionace glauca ) , and the numbers of the two species are negatively correlated such as that only one of two occurs in any given location . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The bigeye thresher has larger teeth than other threshers and feeds on a wider variety of prey . Known food items include schooling forage fish such as mackerel and herring , benthic fishes such as hake and whiting , larger pelagic fishes such as lancetfish and small billfish , squid such as <unk> and <unk> , and possibly crab <unk> . They likely use their long tails to stun their prey prior to capture , as they are often found hooked by their tails on longlines and with the bait fish in their stomachs . The shape of their eye sockets give them binocular vision in an upward direction to better aim their strikes . In the Mediterranean , they are strongly associated with schools of frigate mackerel ( <unk> <unk> ) , suggesting that these sharks follow concentrations of their prey from place to place . It is said that the bigeye thresher uses its long tail to smack down birds . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Like other mackerel sharks , bigeye threshers are ovoviviparous and bear litters of two pups , one in each uterus . Very rarely , the litter size may be one , three , or four . There is no defined breeding season and most adult females are pregnant throughout the year without any apparent lag time between pregnancies . The gestation period is unknown . The developing fetuses are initially nourished by a yolk sac , and later on exhibit oophagy , in which they consume infertile eggs produced by their mother ( and possibly also uterine fluid ) . There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark ( Carcharias taurus ) . Unborn embryos are similar in appearance to adults , with proportionally larger heads and eyes . They are covered with a thin layer of epithelium that prevents the uterine wall from being abraded by the embryo 's sharp dermal denticles ; this has not been observed in the young of other thresher sharks . The young measure 1 @.@ 35 – 1 @.@ 4 m ( 4 @.@ 4 – 4 @.@ 6 ft ) long at birth . Males mature at a length around 2 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 9 m ( 8 @.@ 9 – 9 @.@ 5 ft ) and at an age of 9 – 10 years , while females mature at a length around 3 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 6 m ( 11 – 12 ft ) and at an age of 12 – 14 years . The maximum lifespan of this species is believed to be 19 years for a male and 20 years for a female . A female bigeye thresher is estimated to produce only 20 young over her entire life . 
 = = = Thermoregulation = = = 
 There is conflicting evidence on whether the bigeye thresher is warm @-@ bodied like the common thresher ( A. vulpinus ) . In a 1971 study , Carey et al. probed the swimming muscles of two bigeye threshers with a thermistor needle and reported finding a temperature elevation of 1 @.@ 8 and 4 @.@ 3 ° C ( 3 @.@ 8 and 9 @.@ 1 ° F ) compared to the ambient environment . However , an anatomical examination conducted by Sepulveda et al. in 2005 found that though the bigeye thresher possesses the aerobic red muscles responsible for generating heat in the common thresher , these muscles are arranged in two strips along the flanks just beneath the skin , as opposed to near the core of the body . There is also no blood vessel countercurrent exchange system ( the rete mirabile ) in the trunk to limit the loss of metabolic heat to the water . Based on these differences , the authors questioned earlier measurements and concluded it was unlikely that the bigeye thresher maintains an elevated body temperature . The bigeye thresher does possess a highly developed rete system around its brain and eyes . This is thought to function in buffering those sensitive organs against temperature changes during the shark 's daily migrations up and down the water column , which can be as much as 15 – 16 ° C ( 27 – 29 ° F ) .

 The bigeye thresher shark is rarely encountered by divers underwater and poses no danger . This species is or was taken by longline fisheries operated by many countries , including the United States , Japan , Spain , Brazil , Uruguay , and Mexico , and constitutes about 10 % of the pelagic shark catch . The bigeye thresher comprises 20 % of the longline catch off Cuba , where it is attracted at night using <unk> sticks ( chemical lights ) . It is also significant to Taiwanese fisheries , which land about 220 metric tons annually . The meat is marketed fresh , smoked , or dried and salted , though it is not highly regarded due to its mushy texture . The skin is used to make leather products , the liver oil for vitamins , and the fins for shark fin soup . 
 In the waters of the United States , this species is considered a nuisance bycatch of longlines , gillnets , and trawls . It is also occasionally caught in shark nets around beaches in South Africa . Along with the other thresher species , the bigeye thresher is listed as a game fish by the International Game Fish Association ( IGFA ) , and is pursued by recreational anglers off the United States , South Africa , and New Zealand . The bigeye thresher is highly susceptible to over @-@ exploitation due to its low lifetime fecundity . All three <unk> shark species were assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) in 2007 . 
 = HMS Daring ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Daring was a D @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s . The ship spent the bulk of her career on the China Station . She was briefly commanded by Louis Mountbatten before World War II . Daring escorted convoys in the Red Sea in October – November 1939 and then returned to the UK in January 1940 for the first time in five years . While escorting a convoy from Norway , she was sunk by the German submarine U @-@ 23 in February 1940 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Daring displaced 1 @,@ 375 long tons ( 1 @,@ 397 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 890 long tons ( 1 @,@ 920 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Daring carried a maximum of 473 long tons ( 481 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 870 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 870 km ; 6 @,@ 760 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 145 officers and men . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Daring had a single 3 @-@ inch ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) QF gun between her funnels and two 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II guns mounted on the side of her bridge . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . 
 = = Career = = 
 Daring was ordered on 2 February 1931 under the 1930 Naval Estimates , and was laid down at John I Thornycroft 's yard at Woolston , Southampton on 18 June 1931 . She was launched on 7 April 1932 and completed on 25 November 1932 , at a total cost of £ 225 @,@ 536 , excluding equipment supplied by the Admiralty , such as weapons , ammunition and wireless equipment . The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September – October 1933 . Lord Louis Mountbatten assumed command on 29 April 1934 , and Daring was given a refit at Sheerness Dockyard from 3 September to 24 October to prepare the ship for service on the China Station . 
 In December 1934 she sailed to join the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in the Far East and served there until the outbreak of war . Upon the ship 's arrival at Singapore , Lord Mountbatten was transferred to command HMS Wishart and Commander Geoffrey Barnard assumed command . 
 The ship and her sisters Duncan , Diana , and Dainty were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet shortly before World War II began in September 1939 . Daring was kept in the Red Sea for escort and patrol work until November 1939 . She was overhauled in Malta from 25 November to 20 December . The ship escorted the Union @-@ Castle Line ocean liner SS Dunnottar Castle to Belfast in early 1940 and was under repair at Portsmouth until 25 January . Daring joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in Scapa Flow on 10 February 1940 for escort duties . While escorting Convoy <unk> from Norway , she was torpedoed on 18 February in position 58 ° 39 ′ N 01 ° 40 ′ W by U @-@ 23 , under the command of Otto Kretschmer . Daring capsized and sank very quickly after having her stern blown off ; 157 of the ship 's company were lost . The five survivors were rescued by the submarine HMS Thistle , which had witnessed the attack .

 = Kaga Rebellion = 
 The Kaga Rebellion or <unk> Uprising was a large @-@ scale revolt in Kaga Province ( present @-@ day southern Ishikawa Prefecture ) , Japan , in late 1487 through 1488 . Togashi Masachika , who ruled Kaga Province as shugo , had been restored to power in 1473 with aid from the Asakura clan as well as the Ikkō @-@ ikki , a loose collection of lesser nobility , monks , and farmers . By 1474 , however , the Ikkō @-@ ikki grew discontent with Masachika , and launched some initial revolts , which were easily quelled . In 1487 , when Masachika left on a military campaign , between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand Ikkō @-@ ikki revolted . Masachika returned with his army , but the Ikkō @-@ ikki , backed by several disaffected vassal families , overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace , where he committed seppuku . The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of shugo to Masachika 's uncle Yasutaka , but over the next several decades the Ikkō @-@ ikki increased their political hold on the province , which they would effectively control for almost a century . 
 = = Background and initial revolts = = 
 During the 15th century in Japan , peasant revolts , known as ikki , became much more commonplace . During the turmoil of the Ōnin War ( 1467 – 1477 ) and subsequent years , these rebellions increased in both frequency and success . Many of these rebels became known as Ikkō @-@ ikki , a collection of peasant farmers , Buddhist monks , Shinto priests , and <unk> ( lesser nobles ) who all espoused belief in the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism . Rennyo , the Hongan @-@ ji abbot who led the Jōdo Shinshū movement , attracted a large following in Kaga and Echizen Province , but distanced himself from the political goals of the ikki , advocating violence only for self @-@ defense or defense of one 's religion . 
 During the mid @-@ 15th century , a civil war broke out among the Togashi clan over the position of shugo . Togashi Masachika had been driven out of Kaga by his younger brother , Kochiyo . When the Ōnin War broke out in 1467 , Masachika sided with Hosokawa and Kochiyo with <unk> . In 1473 , Masachika requested aid from Asakura Toshikaga , the lord of Echizen and ally of Hosokawa , as well as from the priests of Yoshizaki , who were associated with Rennyo . Masachika promised the ikki that if restored to power , he would lift his supporters out of their poverty . Further motivating the ikki to support Masachika were the religious policies of Kochiyo : Kochiyo patronized the Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū , a fierce rival to the Hongan @-@ ji for control of the Shinshū sect , and persecuted followers of the Hongan @-@ ji . Toshikaga pledged his support , as did the Yoshizaki priests , the latter prior to any approval from Rennyo . Rennyo eventually granted his approval to the actions of the Yoshizaki priests , and with Toshikaga providing military aid and the Ikkō @-@ ikki rioting throughout Kaga , Masachika quickly overthrew his brother . But Ikkō @-@ ikki support of Masachika was short @-@ lived . By 1474 , the Ikkō @-@ ikki were in dispute with Masachika as they claimed that he did not fulfill his promises of economic reward , and they attempted a rebellion . Rennyo refused to support their actions and the rebels were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in <unk> Province . In 1475 , <unk> <unk> , a disciple of Rennyo , falsely claimed that Rennyo supported a renewed uprising in Kaga . The revolt failed , and Rennyo excommunicated <unk> . Tiring of his efforts to restrain the unruly Ikkō @-@ ikki , Rennyo left Yoshizaki for the capital region . 
 = = 1488 revolt = = 
 Despite the previous revolts having been easily suppressed , unrest continued to simmer in Kaga under Masachika 's governance . The Ikkō @-@ ikki who remained in Kaga grew bolder , refusing to pay taxes and even seizing tax revenue and land , despite Rennyo 's continued protestations . In 1487 , Masachika left with a large army for Ōmi Province in response to a call for aid from shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa , who was attempting to suppress the robber baron <unk> <unk> . In Masachika 's absence , the Ikkō @-@ ikki , led by <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , three sons of Rennyo , launched their revolt and between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand members took up arms . Masachika quickly returned from his military expedition , and defeated the rebels in several battles . However , several vassal families , discontent with Masachika , joined with the rebels . The rebels cut off Masachika from reinforcements from his allies in the bordering Echizen , <unk> , and Noto Provinces , and besieged his castle . Masachika , trapped in a burning castle and faced with certain defeat , committed seppuku . In his place , the vassal families who rebelled against Masachika put forward his uncle and ex @-@ shugo , Yasutaka , as a candidate to be the new shugo . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the overthrow of Masachika , Kaga became known as " <unk> no <unk> kuni " ( " the kingdom of peasants " , or " province ruled by peasants " ) . Shogun Yoshihisa , a friend and ally of Masachika , demanded that Rennyo excommunicate the Kaga ikki . However , Hosokawa <unk> , an influential political figure who was also a close friend and patron of Rennyo , negotiated a deal which permitted Rennyo to merely reprimand the ikki while <unk> would join the Hongan @-@ ji . In Kaga , Togashi Yasutaka took power as shugo , ruling the province until his death in 1504 . Afterward , under the rule of his son , <unk> , the ikki began to assert their influence over the vassal families that supported them in the uprising . The ikki soon split into rival political factions and initiated a series of political struggles which culminated in a civil war in 1531 . The heads of the three predominant Hongan @-@ ji temples in Kaga , as well as <unk> , were defeated when <unk> , a son of Rennyo , brought in Ikkō @-@ ikki troops from Mikawa Province . Upon <unk> 's victory , the office of shugo was abolished and the leaders of the opposition were exiled . The Ikkō @-@ ikki would control Kaga until 1580 , when forces loyal to Oda Nobunaga defeated them . 
 = Clavaria zollingeri = 
 Clavaria zollingeri , commonly known as the violet coral or the magenta coral , is a widely distributed species of fungus . It produces striking tubular , purple to pinkish @-@ violet fruit bodies that grow up to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) tall and 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) wide . The extreme tips of the fragile , slender branches are usually rounded and brownish . A typical member of the clavarioid or club fungi , Clavaria zollingeri is saprobic , and so derives nutrients by breaking down organic matter . The fruit bodies are typically found growing on the ground in woodland litter , or in grasslands . Variations in branching and color can often be used to distinguish C. zollingeri from similarly colored coral fungi such as <unk> purpurea and Clavulina amethystina , although microscopy is required to reliably identify the latter species . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described scientifically by French mycologist Joseph @-@ Henri Léveillé in 1846 . It was named after German botanist Heinrich Zollinger , who researched the genus Clavaria , and collected the type specimen in Java , Indonesia . Léveillé considered the dichotomous branching to be the prominent characteristic that separated this species from the otherwise similar Clavaria amethystina . American Charles Horton Peck published a species collected from Stow , Massachusetts as Clavaria <unk> in 1910 , but this is a synonym . The mushroom is commonly known as the " violet coral " , or the " magenta coral " . 
 In a 1978 classification of the genus Clavaria , Ronald Petersen placed C. zollingeri in the subgenus Clavaria , a grouping of species with clamp connections absent from all septa in the fruit body ; others in the subgenus included C. purpurea , C. fumosa , and the type , C. vermicularis . A large @-@ scale molecular analysis of the phylogenetic distributions and limits of clavarioid fungi in the family Clavariaceae was published by Bryn <unk> and David McLaughlin in 2006 . Based on their analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences , C. zollingeri shared the greatest genetic similarity with Clavulinopsis <unk> . Petersen 's concept of the infrageneric classification of Clavaria was largely rejected in this analysis , as two of the three subgenera he proposed were found to be polyphyletic . 
 = = Description = = 
 The coloring of the fruit bodies is quite variable , ranging from violet to amethyst , or violet shaded with brown or red . The colors may be variable over the fruit body ; in one instance the outside branches were brown while the inner branches in the center of the bundle were light violet . Dried specimens may lose their coloring almost entirely , as the pigments may be sensitive to light or dryness . The fruit body is typically 5 to 10 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 9 in ) tall and 4 to 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) wide . The stem , or base , is short , and the branching starts a short distance above the ground . The surfaces of the fragile branches are smooth and dry ; the branches are 2 – 6 thick , typically with rounded tips . It has no distinguishable odor , and a taste somewhat like radishes or cucumber . Although edible in small quantities , the fragile fruit bodies are of limited culinary value , and may have a laxative effect . 
 In mass , the spores ( produced on the surface of the branches ) are white . Light microscopy reveals additional details : the spores are roughly spherical to broadly elliptical , with dimensions of 4 – 7 by 3 – 5 μm . They have a clear apiculus about 1 μm long , and a single large oil droplet . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , do not have clamps , and measure 50 – 60 by 7 – 9 μm , gradually widening at the apex . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Other lavender to violet @-@ colored corals include Clavulina <unk> , which is so multiply branched so as to appear toothed , and Clavulina amethystina , which can only be reliably distinguished by its two @-@ spored basidia in comparison to the four @-@ spored basidia of Clavaria species . In <unk> purpurea , the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple . The Australian coral Clavaria <unk> is also similar in appearance to Clavaria <unk> , but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt processes that are the same color as the rest of the fruit body . Ramariopsis pulchella — a small , violet @-@ colored coral fungus rarely taller than 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) — could be mistaken for a small C. zollingeri . It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 5 by 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 μm . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The fruit bodies of Clavaria zollingeri grow either solitarily , in groups , or in clusters on the ground in grassy spots , usually near hardwood trees , or with mosses . It is a saprobic species , deriving nutrients by breaking down organic matter . It has a widespread distribution , and has been found in Australia , New Zealand , North America , South America , and Asia ( including Brunei , India , and Korea ) . In North America , the distribution is restricted to the northeastern regions of the continent . Rare in Europe , it is listed in the Red Lists of threatened species in Denmark and Great Britain . In Ireland , it is used as an indicator species to help assess the fungal diversity of nutrient @-@ poor grasslands , a habitat under threat . It was recorded from the Netherlands for the first time in 2006 .

 Clavaria zollingeri contains lectins , a class of proteins that bind specific carbohydrates on the surface of cells , causing them to clump together .

 = Ashdod = 
 Ashdod ( Hebrew : <unk> ( audio ) ; Arabic : <unk> , <unk> Isdud ) is the sixth @-@ largest city in Israel , located in the Southern District of the country , on the Mediterranean coast where it is situated between Tel Aviv to the north ( 32 kilometres ( 20 miles ) away ) and Ashkelon to the south ( 20 km ( 12 mi ) away ) . Jerusalem is 53 km ( 33 mi ) to the east . 
 Ashdod is Israel 's largest port , accounting for 60 % of the country 's imported goods . The city is also an important regional industrial center . 
 Modern Ashdod covers the territory of two ancient twin towns , one inland and one on the coast , which were for most of their history two separate entities , connected though by close ties with each other . This article is dealing with both these historic towns and other ancient sites now located within the territory of modern Ashdod . 
 The first documented urban settlement at Ashdod dates to the Canaanite culture of the 17th century BCE , making the city one of the oldest in the world . Ashdod is mentioned 13 times in the Bible . During its pre @-@ 1956 history the city was settled by Philistines , Israelites , colonists coming in the wake of Alexander 's conquests , Romans and Byzantines , Arabs , Crusaders , and Ottoman Turks . 
 Modern Ashdod was established in 1956 on the sand hills near the site of the ancient town , and incorporated as a city in 1968 , with a land @-@ area of approximately 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) . Being a planned city , expansion followed a main development plan , which facilitated traffic and prevented air pollution in the residential areas , despite population growth . According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics , Ashdod had a population of 217 @,@ 959 in 2014 , with an area of 47 @,@ 242 dunams ( 47 @.@ 242 km2 ; 18 @.@ 240 sq mi ) .

 Three stone tools dating from the Neolithic era were discovered , but no other evidence of a Stone Age settlement in Ashdod was found , suggesting that the tools were deposited here in a later period . 
 = = = Bronze and Iron Ages = = = 
 The site of Ashdod in the Bronze Age and Iron Ages was at a tell just south of the modern city . It was excavated by archaeologists in nine seasons between 1962 and 1972 . The effort was led during the first few years by David Noel Freedman of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and Moshe Dothan . The remaining seasons were headed by Dothan for the Israel Antiquities Authority . 
 The earliest major habitation in Ashdod dates to the 17th century BCE , when the acropolis of the tell was fortified . Ashdod is first mentioned in written documents from Late Bronze Age Ugarit , which indicate that the city was a center of export for dyed woolen purple fabric and garments . At the end of the 13th century BCE the Sea Peoples conquered and destroyed Ashdod . By the beginning of the 12th century BCE , the Philistines , generally thought to have been one of the Sea Peoples , ruled the city . During their reign , the city prospered and was a member of the Philistine <unk> , which included Ashkelon and Gaza on the coast and Ekron and Gath farther inland , in addition to Ashdod . 
 In 950 BCE Ashdod was destroyed during Pharaoh Siamun 's conquest of the region . The city was not rebuilt until at least 815 BCE . 
 <unk> led the revolt of Philistines , Judeans , <unk> , and <unk> against Assyria after expulsion of king <unk> , whom Sargon had installed instead of his brother <unk> . Gath ( <unk> ) belonged to the kingdom of Ashdod at that time . Assyrian king Sargon II 's commander @-@ in @-@ chief ( turtanu ) , whom the King James Bible calls simply " Tartan " , Isaiah 20 : 1 regained control of Ashdod in 712 / 711 BCE and forced the usurper Yamani to flee . Sargon 's general destroyed the city and exiled its residents , including some Israelites who were subsequently settled in Media and Elam . 
 <unk> was king at the time of Sargon 's son Sennacherib ( r . 705 – 681 BCE ) , and <unk> in the reign of Sennacherib 's son Esarhaddon ( r . 681 – 669 BCE ) . 
 Psamtik I of Egypt ( r . 664 – 610 BCE ) is reported to have besieged the great city Azotus for twenty @-@ nine years ( Herodotus , ii . 157 ) ; the biblical references to the remnant of Ashdod ( Jeremiah 25 : 20 ; cf Zephaniah 2 : 4 ) are interpreted as allusions to this event . 
 The city absorbed another blow in 605 BCE , when Nebuchadnezzar conquered it . 
 In 539 BCE the city was rebuilt by the Persians . In 332 BCE it was conquered in the wars of Alexander the Great . 
 In the Book of Nehemiah , the <unk> seem to represent the whole nation of the Philistines in the sixth century BCE , the speech of Ashdod ( which half of the children from mixed families are described as adopting ) would simply be the general Philistine dialect . Hugo Winckler explains the use of that name by the fact that Ashdod was the nearest of the Philistine cities to Jerusalem .

 There are Biblical episodes referencing Ashdod but they remain uncorroborated by archaeological finds : 
 Upon Joshua 's conquest of the Promised Land , Ashdod was allotted to the Tribe of Judah ( Book of Joshua 15 : 46 ) . 
 In I Samuel 6 : 17 Ashdod is mentioned among the principal Philistine cities . After capturing the Ark of the covenant from the Israelites , the Philistines took it to Ashdod and placed it in the temple of Dagon . The next morning Dagon was found prostrate before the Ark ; on being restored to his place , he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken . The people of Ashdod were smitten with boils ; a plague of mice was sent over the land ( 1 Samuel 6 : 5 ) . 
 According to the Bible , during the 10th century BCE Ashdod became , along with all the kingdom of Philistia , a patronage area of the Kingdom of Israel under the control of King David . 
 The capture of the city by King Uzziah of Judah shortly after 815 BCE is mentioned within 2 Chronicles ( 26 : 6 ) and in the Book of Zechariah ( 9 : 6 ) , speaking of the false Jews . 
 In the Book of Nehemiah ( Nehemiah 13 : 23 – 24 ) , some 5th century BCE residents of Jerusalem are said to have married women from Ashdod , and half of the children of these unions were reportedly unable to understand Hebrew ; instead , they spoke " the language of Ashdod " . 
 = = = Hellenistic period = = = 
 Once Hellenised , the city changed its name to the more Greek @-@ sounding <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) and prospered until the Hasmonean Revolt . During the rebellion Judas Maccabeus " took it , and laid it waste " ( Antiquities of the Jews Book 12 , 8 : 6 ) His brother Jonathan conquered it again in 147 BCE and destroyed the temple of Dagon of biblical fame ( Antiquities Book 13 , 4 : 4 ; 1 Samuel 5 : 1 @-@ 5 ) . During the rule of Alexander <unk> , Ashdod was part of his territory ( Antiquities Book 13 , 15 : 4 ) . 
 = = = Roman and Byzantine periods = = = 
 After the destruction wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II , Pompey restored the independence of Azotus , as he did with all <unk> coastal cities ( Antiquities Book 14 , 4 : 4 ) . A few years later , in 55 BCE , after more fighting , Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls ( Antiquities Book 14 , 5 : 2 ) . In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod , who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome ( Antiquities Book 17 , 8 : 1 ) . By the time of the First Jewish – Roman War ( 66 @-@ 70 ) , there must have been a large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to place a garrison in the city . 
 Despite its location four miles ( 6 km ) from the coast , Ptolemy ( c . 90 – c . 168 CE ) described it as a maritime city , as did Josephus in Antiquities Book 13 , 15 : 4 . The same Josephus though describes Ashdod as " in the inland parts " ( Antiquities Book 14 , 4 : 4 ) . This curious contradiction may refer to Ashdod 's control of a separate harbor , called Azotus <unk> , or Ashdod @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Sea ( <unk> - " <unk> " , Greek for " on the coast " ) . The landlocked city was called by the Romans <unk> , " of the horsemen " , and by the Greeks until late in the medieval period , Azotus <unk> or " inland Azotus " . 
 During the Byzantine period , the port city overshadowed its inland counterpart in size and importance . The 6th @-@ century Madaba Map is showing both under their respective names . 
 = = = In the New Testament = = = 
 The 1st century AD Book of Acts refers to Azotus as the place in which Philip the Evangelist reappeared after he converted the Ethiopian eunuch to Christianity . Philip preached the gospel throughout the area until he reached Caesarea , about 90 km to the north . 
 = = = Early Muslim period = = = 
 The prominence of Hellenised , then Christian Azotus continued until the 7th century , when it came under Muslim rule . 
 A coastal fort was erected by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al @-@ Malik , the builder of the Dome of the Rock , at or near the former Azotus <unk> , which was later reconstructed by the Fatimids and Crusaders . 
 The medieval Arabic name of the port town was <unk> Azdud , " harbour of Azdud " , a very interesting combination between the by then already ancient Aramaic word for harbour , <unk> , and " Azdud " , a return to a form much closer to the old Semitic name " Ashdod " . 
 The geographer Ibn Khordadbeh ( c . 820 – 912 ) referred to the inland city as " Azdud " and described it as a postal station between al @-@ Ramla and Gaza . 
 = = = Crusader period = = = 
 Documents from the Crusader period indicate that Ashdod belonged to the lordship of Ramla , and it appears probable that in 1169 the old Arab sea fort was given by Hugh , lord of Ramla , to his knight Nicolas de <unk> . From this period the fort is known as Castellum <unk> . 
 = = = Ayyubid and Mamluk periods = = = 
 The port stops being mentioned during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods , making it likely that it was destroyed by the Muslims along with the other port cities , due to fears that they might again be used by Crusader invasions from the sea . With the destruction of the port city , its inland counterpart regains its importance .

 The location of the village on Via Maris enhanced the city 's importance during the Ottoman rule . In 1596 CE , administrated by nahiya ( " subdistrict " ) of Gaza under the <unk> ' ( " district " ) of Gaza , the population of Ashdod numbered about 413 . The villagers paid taxes on wheat , barley , sesame and fruit crops , as well as goats and beehives . 
 In the late nineteenth century , Isdud was described as a village spread across the eastern slope of a low hill , covered with gardens . A ruined khan stood southwest of the village . Its houses were one @-@ storey high with walls and enclosures built of adobe brick . There were two main sources of water : a pond and a masonry well . Both were surrounded by groves of date @-@ palm and fig @-@ trees .

 During the Mandatory period , Isdud had two elementary schools ; one for boys which was opened in 1922 , and one for girls which started in 1942 . By the mid @-@ 1940s the boy @-@ school had 371 students , while the girl @-@ school had 74 .

 The village of Isdud was occupied by the Egyptian army on May 29 , 1948 and became the Egyptians ' northernmost position during the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War . While the Israelis failed to capture territory , and suffered heavy casualties , Egypt changed its strategy from offensive to defensive , thus halting their advance northwards . Egyptian and Israeli forces clashed in the surrounding area , with the Egyptians being unable to hold the Ad Halom bridge over the Lachish River . Israeli forces surrounded the town during Operation Pleshet , and shelled and bombed it from the air . For three nights from 18 October the Israeli Air Force bombed Isdud and several other locations . Fearing encirclement , Egyptian forces retreated on October 28 , 1948 and the majority of the residents fled . The 300 townspeople who remained were driven southwards by the Israel Defense Forces .

 In 1950 , the <unk> of Sde <unk> and <unk> were established to the east of Isdud , and in 1949 and 1953 , Bnei Darom and Gan <unk> were established north of Isdud . According to Khalidi , they were established on the village lands . 
 The modern city of Ashdod was founded in 1956 . On May 1 , 1956 , then finance minister Levi Eshkol approved the establishment of the city of Ashdod . " Ashdod Company Ltd . " , a daughter company of City @-@ Builders Company Ltd . , was created for that purpose by <unk> Ben @-@ Ami and Philipp Klutznick . The first settlers , 22 families from Morocco , arrived in November 1956 , followed by a small influx of immigrants from Egypt . In July 1957 , the government granted a 24 square kilometres ( 9 square miles ) , approximately 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) from Tel Aviv , to the Ashdod Company Ltd . , for building the modern city of Ashdod . The building of the Eshkol A power station in Ashdod was completed in 1958 and included 3 units : 2 units of 50 megawatt , and one unit of 45 megawatt ( with sea water desalination capabilities ) . 
 The first local council was appointed in October 1959 . Dov Gur was appointed the first local council head on behalf of the Israeli Ministry of Interior . The Magistrates ' Court in the city was inaugurated in 1963 . The building of the port of Ashdod began in April 1961 . The port was inaugurated in November 1963 , and was first utilized in November 1965 , with the coming of the Swedish ship " <unk> " . 
 Large @-@ scale growth of the city began in 1991 , with the massive arrival of immigrants from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia and infrastructure development . From 1990 to 2001 the city accepted more than 100 @,@ 000 new inhabitants , a 150 % growth . 
 Ashdod was one of six cities that won the 2012 Education Prize awarded by the Israel Ministry of Education . 
 = = Urban development = = 
 The modern city of Ashdod city was built outside the historic settlement site , on virgin sands . The development followed a main development plan . The planners divided the city into seventeen neighborhoods of ten to fifteen thousand people . Wide avenues between the neighborhoods make traffic flow relatively freely inside the city . Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center , urban park , and health and education infrastructure . The original plan also called for a business and administrative center , built in the mid @-@ 1990s , when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling in ten years . 
 Three industrial zones were placed adjacent to the port in the northern part of the city , taking into account the prevailing southern winds which take air pollution away from the city . The plan had its problems , however , including asymmetric growth of upscale and poorer neighborhoods and the long @-@ time lack of a main business and administrative center . 
 The city was planned for a maximum of 250 @,@ 000 inhabitants , and an additional area in the south was reserved for further development . 
 In 2012 , a plan to build an industrial zone on part of the Ashdod Sand Dune was approved . The plan calls for a hi @-@ tech industrial park , events halls , and coffee shops to be built adjacent to the train station . It will cover 400 dunams ( 0 @.@ 4 km2 ; 0 @.@ 2 sq mi ) , including 130 dunams of built @-@ up space , with the rest of the area being preserved as a nature reserve . In addition , the Port of Ashdod is undergoing a massive expansion program , and a private hospital will be built in the city .

 Ashdod is one of the most important industrial centers in Israel . All industrial activities in the city are located in northern areas such as the port area , the northern industrial zone , and around the Lachish River . The port of Ashdod is the largest port in Israel , handling about 60 % of Israel 's port cargo . It was mainly upgraded in recent years and will be able to provide berths for Panamax ships . Various shipping companies offices are also located in the port area which also is home to an Eshkol A power station and coal terminal . 
 The Northern industrial zone is located on Highway 41 and includes various industry including an oil refinery , which is one of only two in the country . The heavy industry zone located south of the Lachish River was once the main industrial center in Ashdod . Recently , however , leisure facilities have moved into the area .

The other main road in the area is Highway 41 which served the city from the start of its modern history . This road runs from west to east towards Gedera and it is the main transport link to the port of Ashdod and the industrial zones , and connects to Highway 4 with an interchange . 
 In late 2012 , Ashdod won a NIS 220 million grant from the Israeli Transport Ministry to improve public transportation and decrease private car use . According to the municipality 's plans , a 20 @-@ kilometer ring of road arteries will be given priority in public transportation . These arteries will carry four bus rapid transit lines . In the city 's more crowded areas , such as Herzl Boulevard or the western part of Menachem Begin Boulevard , a public transportation lane will be paved in the center of the road . In other areas , the right @-@ hand lane will be reserved for public transportation . Buses will also be given priority at traffic lights ; electronic devices will allow a bus to signal its approach , causing the light to turn green .

 Héctor Headley López Swainson ( born July 9 , 1929 ( possibly April 8 , 1932 ) ) is a former left fielder and third baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the Kansas City Athletics and New York Yankees from 1955 to 1966 . He is notable as the first black manager at the AAA baseball level , as the third outfielder on the Maris / Mantle Yankees , and as the Kansas City Athletics franchise hitting streak record holder . López was on World Series Championship teams for the Yankees in 1961 and 1962 . In various seasons , he finished among the top 10 American League hitters in hits , runs batted in , runs scored , doubles , triples , slugging percentage , sacrifice flies , sacrifice hits , games played , times hit by pitch and at bats . He was also known for his hustle , his clutch hitting and poor fielding . 
 López was the second Panamanian @-@ born major league baseball player and continues to be one of the country 's most revered world champion athletes . Although Humberto Robinson ( 102 games played / 5 seasons ) debuted in the major leagues 22 days earlier than López , López ( 1 @,@ 450 games played / 12 seasons ) was the first of the 49 major leaguers born in Panama to have an extensive career . He was the first Panamanian @-@ born major leaguer to finish in the top 10 in any official statistical category ( sacrifice hits , 1956 ) ; first to lead his league in any official statistic ( sacrifice flies , 1958 ) ; first to play in the World Series ( with the 1960 Yankees ) ; and the first to win a World Championship ( with the 1961 Yankees ) . 
 He was an infielder for the Athletics , and later was often the third outfielder on the Maris / Mantle Yankees of the early and mid @-@ 1960s . López had his most successful season in 1959 , but continued to contribute effectively during the early 1960s during their pennant successes . The utility player divided his career almost equally between infield and outfield positions . After retiring from baseball , he went on to become a groundbreaking manager in minor league baseball as the first to break the baseball color line as a black manager at the AAA level for the Buffalo Bisons and then served in various international managerial and coaching positions .

 Born in Colón , Panama , López grew up in Colón and the neighboring Panama Canal Zone . He held a part @-@ time job at an American military base bowling alley . He was a high school track star whose father had been a pitcher for the Panama national baseball team . As a high school athlete , he played semipro baseball for US $ 100 per month in Colón . After he graduated from high school he signed to play with St. Hyacinthe of the Canadian Provincial League who also employed Clifford " Connie " Johnson . 
 = = Kansas City Athletics ( 1955 – 59 ) = = 
 Prior to the 1952 season , López was acquired by the Philadelphia Athletics from the Drummondville Cubs of the Class @-@ C Provincial League for $ 1 @,@ 500 ( $ 13 @,@ 367 today ) . In 1954 , López won baseball 's Triple Crown in the Winter League . Throughout his professional career , he played in the Panama winter league where he won three batting titles and regularly led the league in home runs . López developed in the A 's farm system , and when the team relocated to Kansas City in 1955 he was recalled to the major league club . López made his major league debut in 1955 . That season he finished second to Carlos Paula among rookies in batting average and was overshadowed by American League strikeout @-@ leading pitcher Herb Score for the Rookie of the Year . He usually played second or third base during his time with the Athletics . During his rookie season , he finished third on the team in home runs , trailing only Gus Zernial ( 30 ) and Vic Power ( 19 ) . He tied Jim <unk> for third on the team in RBIs with 68 , trailing only Zernial and Power , who had 84 and 76 , respectively . López was the team 's regular third baseman , and was the youngest regular starter on the team . In 1956 , the team finished with a 52 – 102 record , but López had a career @-@ high 153 hits . He also set then @-@ career highs in home runs ( 18 ) and runs batted in ( 69 ) . In his early years , black and white players did not room together on the road , so he roomed with Vic Power even though Power 's closest friend on the team was Clete Boyer . In 1957 , he had a 22 @-@ game hitting streak , that is the All @-@ time Kansas City Athletics team record for the thirteen seasons the franchise played there . 
 He earned a position in the top @-@ 10 in the American League in both games played and at bats in 1956 and 1958 , as well as leading the AL in sacrifice flies and times grounded into double plays in 1958 . López also was in the top 10 in doubles and runs scored in 1958 and in sacrifice hits in 1956 . On June 26 , 1958 , López hit three home runs in a game against the Washington Senators . During his career with the Athletics , he hit .278 with 67 home runs and 269 RBIs , and scored 298 runs . However , his talents were wasted on a team that never finished above 6th place . On May 26 , 1959 , he was traded with Ralph Terry to the New York Yankees for Johnny <unk> , Tom Sturdivant , and Jerry <unk> . For all his offensive skills , López led American League third basemen in errors in each of his four full seasons in Kansas City . 
 Baseball writer and Kansas City Athletics fan Bill James wrote that López was as bad a defensive player as you would ever want to see . The Authors of The Great American Baseball Card Flipping , Trading and Bubble Gum Book wrote of López 's defense " I would like to go on record right here and now as declaring Hector López the all @-@ time worst fielding major league ballplayer . " 
 = = New York Yankees ( 1959 – 66 ) = = 
 In his first season with the Yankees after being traded , he played 35 games in the outfield , the first time in his career he played more than 20 outfield games . He still played 76 games at third base for the team . In his 33 games with Kansas City at the start of the 1959 Major League Baseball season , he had played exclusively at second base . In his next five seasons with the Yankees from 1960 to 1964 , he mostly played in the outfield as he was part of five consecutive pennant winners . During his time with the Yankees , he was often the third outfielder of the Maris / Mantle Yankees that won two of the five consecutive World Series they played in from 1960 to 1964 . He logged the most games in left field during the back @-@ to @-@ back World Series Championship seasons of 1961 & 1962 ( 129 vs. Berra @-@ 109 , Tresh @-@ 43 ) . During the five pennant years , with Roger Maris playing right field and Mickey Mantle playing center field , López logged 406 games in left field . This was the most by any Yankee during this period ( Tom Tresh @-@ 195 , Yogi Berra @-@ 129 ) . López is one of eleven Yankees to have been on these five consecutive pennant winners and along with Whitey Ford , Elston Howard , Bobby Richardson , & Clete Boyer is one of seven Yankees to have been part of the entire Maris / Mantle Yankee era . In 1965 and 1966 , he made the majority of his outfield appearances in right field . However , in 1965 Mantle did not play center field . Mantle did return to center field for the majority of his appearances in 1966 ( the final year of the Maris / Mantle Yankees and the final year of López ' career ) . 
 In 1959 , he finished in the top 10 in slugging percentage , hits , doubles and RBI . In 1960 he was among the top 10 in triples and sacrifice hits . During the 1961 World Series , López replaced Mantle ( who only had six Series at bats ) in Game 4 and recorded a 2 @-@ run single on the way to a 7 – 0 victory . In Game 5 , which was the Series @-@ clinching game , he homered and tripled , driving in five runs , and caught Vada Pinson 's fly ball for the final out of the Series . His three for seven , 7 run batted in performance continues to be remembered by New Yorkers as a highlight of the series . 
 = = Managing = = 
 López was the manager of the Buffalo Bisons in 1969 . This made him the first black manager at the AAA level . This was six years before Frank Robinson became the first black manager in the major leagues . López was one of three black men ( along with Sam Bankhead and Gene Baker ) to manage in the minor leagues in the twenty @-@ five years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947 . In 1990 , he coached Malverne High School of Malverne , New York in Nassau County on Long Island in addition to working in the parks department in the Town of Hempstead . López has also managed in Venezuela and been a player @-@ manager in Panama . He was the manager of the Panama national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic . 
 = = Panamanian history = = 
 He paved the way as a role model for the first three Panamanian Major League All @-@ Stars , Ben <unk> and Manny <unk> also from Colón , and Rod Carew a <unk> born in neighboring Gatun . López recorded many firsts among Panamanian baseball players ; he was the first regular major leaguer , since 1955 was his rookie season , whereas Robinson did not qualify as a rookie until 1958 ( the season in which he recorded his 50th career inning pitched ) and <unk> Clarke , who also debuted in 1955 , never qualified as a rookie . López ' 1955 rookie season , when he batted .290 , was also the first by a Panamanian to qualify for baseball 's statistical leadership by recording the minimum number of plate appearances or innings pitched . Thus , although he was not the first to appear in the major leagues , he was in a sense the first Panamanian everyday player . 
 None of the other major leaguers born in Panama who played in the 1950s ( Robinson , Clarke , Pat Scantlebury , Tom Hughes ) played in the major league postseason , which then only included the World Series , before López did so with the 1960 Yankees . No other Panamanian was part of a World Series champion before López with the 1961 Yankees . He was the first Panamanian to record many statistical accomplishments , such as a stolen base , home run , double , triple , walk or strikeout . His 1956 season was the first by a Panamanian with more than 150 hits , more than 25 doubles , 90 runs scored , or more than 60 walks . His 1959 season was the first with more than 20 home runs or 90 runs batted in . López twice had .350 on @-@ base percentages , but in each season he recorded over 400 plate appearances without recording the qualifying number for unofficial league leadership . Thus , his career high on @-@ base percentage in a season in which he qualified for statistical leadership was .347 in 1956 . He was the first to finish among the top 10 in his league in each of the aforementioned statistical categories , and the first to lead his league in any official statistical batting category ( sacrifice flies in 1958 ) . López was the first Panamanian to accumulate a sufficient number of career appearances to qualify for career statistical leadership ( which depending upon the source is based on 3000 , 4000 or 5000 at bats ) , although his career .269 batting average , .330 on @-@ base percentage and .415 slugging percentage are not historically significant . 
 He also represented Panama in the 1960 Caribbean Series and tied with Félix Torres and Herman Davis for the tournament home run leadership . He continues to be considered a legendary world champion who represented the country . In 2006 , he was cited by professional basketball coach , Joseph Clarke , as ranking alongside such noted Panamanian sports personalities as Ismael Laguna , Roberto Durán , and Mariano Rivera as Panamanian World Champions . López has two sons . Ever since López ' performances with the Yankees , the team has had a huge following in Panama .

 Lopez retired following the 1966 season at the age of 36 . That year , he also participated in his first Old @-@ Timers ' Day . He has returned to the annual event every year ( totaling 49 years as of 2015 ) . 
 = Maria Goeppert @-@ Mayer = 
 Maria Goeppert Mayer ( June 28 , 1906 – February 20 , 1972 ) was a German @-@ born American theoretical physicist , and Nobel laureate in Physics for proposing the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus . She was the second female Nobel laureate in physics , after Marie Curie . 
 A graduate of the University of Göttingen , Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctorate on the theory of possible two @-@ photon absorption by atoms . At the time , the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote , but the development of the laser permitted this . Today , the unit for the two @-@ photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert Mayer ( GM ) unit . 
 Maria Goeppert married Joseph Edward Mayer and moved to the United States , where he was an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University . Strict rules against nepotism prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member , but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on double beta decay in 1935 . In 1937 , she moved to Columbia University , where she took an unpaid position . During World War II , she worked for the Manhattan Project at Columbia on isotope separation , and with Edward Teller at the Los Alamos Laboratory on the development of the Teller 's " Super " bomb . 
 After the war , Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the University of Chicago ( where Teller and her husband worked ) and a senior physicist at the nearby Argonne National Laboratory . She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells , for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 , which she shared with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Wigner . In 1960 , she was appointed full professor of physics at the University of California at San Diego . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Maria Göppert was born on June 28 , 1906 , in Kattowitz ( now Katowice , Poland ) , a city in Prussia , the only child of Friedrich Göppert and his wife Maria née Wolff . In 1910 , she moved with her family to Göttingen when her father , a sixth @-@ generation university professor , was appointed as the professor of pediatrics at the University of Göttingen . Goeppert was closer to her father than her mother . " Well , my father was more interesting , " she later explained . " He was after all a scientist . " 
 Göppert was educated at the Höhere Technische in Göttingen , a school for middle @-@ class girls who aspired to higher education . In 1921 , she entered the <unk> , a private high school run by suffragettes that aimed to prepare girls for university . She took the abitur , the university entrance examination , at age 17 , a year early , with three or four girls from her school and thirty boys . All the girls passed , but only one of the boys did . 
 In the Spring of 1924 , Göppert entered the University of Göttingen , where she studied mathematics . A purported shortage of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls led to an upsurge of women studying mathematics at a time of high unemployment , and there was even a female professor of mathematics at Göttingen , Emmy Noether , but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificate . 
 Instead , Goeppert became interested in physics , and chose to pursue a Ph.D. In her 1930 doctoral thesis she worked out the theory of possible two @-@ photon absorption by atoms . Eugene Wigner later described the thesis as " a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness " . At the time , the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote , but the development of the laser permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two @-@ photon @-@ excited fluorescence was detected in a europium @-@ doped crystal . To honor her fundamental contribution to this area , the unit for the two @-@ photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert @-@ Mayer ( GM ) unit . One GM is 10 − 50 <unk> s photon − 1 . Her examiners were three future Nobel prize winners : Max Born , James Franck and Adolf Otto Reinhold <unk> . 
 On January 19 , 1930 , Goeppert married Joseph Edward Mayer , an American Rockefeller fellow who was one of James Franck 's assistants . The two had met when Mayer had boarded with the Goeppert family . The couple moved to Mayer 's home country of the United States , where he had been offered a position as associate professor of chemistry at Johns Hopkins University . They had two children , Maria Ann and Peter Conrad . 
 = = United States = = 
 Strict rules against nepotism ostensibly prevented Johns Hopkins University from hiring Goeppert Mayer as a faculty member , but she was given a job as an assistant in the Physics Department working with German correspondence . She received a very small salary , a place to work and access to the facilities . She taught some courses , published an important paper on double beta decay in 1935 . 
 There was little interest in quantum mechanics at Johns Hopkins , but Goeppert Mayer worked with Karl Herzfeld , collaborating on a number of papers . She also returned to Göttingen in the summers of 1931 , 1932 and 1933 to work with her former examiner Born , writing an article with him for the Handbuch der Physik . This ended when the NSDAP came to power in 1933 , and many academics , including Born and Franck , lost their jobs . Goeppert Mayer and Herzfeld became involved in refugee relief efforts . 
 Joe Mayer was fired in 1937 . He attributed this to the hatred of women on the part of the dean of physical sciences , which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer 's presence in the laboratory . Herzfeld agreed and added that , with Goeppert Mayer , Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins , some thought that there were too many German scientists there . There were also complaints from some students that Mayer 's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics . Mayer took up a position at Columbia University , where the chairman of the Physics Department , George B. Pegram , arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office , but she received no salary . She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi , who arrived at Columbia in 1939 . Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements . Using the Thomas – Fermi model , she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements . This proved to be correct . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 In December 1941 , Goeppert Mayer took up her first paid professional position , teaching science part @-@ time at Sarah Lawrence College . In the spring of 1942 , with the United States embroiled in World War II , she joined the Manhattan Project . She accepted a part @-@ time research post from Urey with Columbia University 's Substitute Alloy Materials ( SAM ) Laboratories . The objective of this project was to find a means of separating the fissile uranium @-@ 235 isotope in natural uranium ; she researched the chemical and thermodynamic properties of uranium hexafluoride and investigated the possibility of separating isotopes by photochemical reactions . This method proved impractical at the time , but the development of lasers would later open the possibility of separation of isotopes by laser excitation . 
 Through her friend Edward Teller , Goeppert Mayer was given a position at Columbia with the Opacity Project , which researched the properties of matter and radiation at extremely high temperatures with an eye to the development of the Teller 's " Super " bomb , the wartime program for the development of thermonuclear weapons . In February 1945 , Joe was sent to the Pacific War , and Goeppert Mayer decided to leave her children in New York and join Teller 's group at the Los Alamos Laboratory . Joe came back from the Pacific earlier than expected , and they returned to New York together in July 1945 . 
 In February 1946 , Joe became a professor in the Chemistry Department and the new Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago , and Goeppert Mayer was able to become a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the school . When Teller also accepted a position there , she was able to continue her Opacity work with him . When the nearby Argonne National Laboratory was founded on July 1 , 1946 , Goeppert Mayer was also offered a part @-@ time job there as a senior physicist in the Theoretical Physics Division . She responded " I don 't know anything about nuclear physics . " She programmed the Aberdeen Proving Ground 's ENIAC to solve criticality problems for a liquid metal cooled reactor using the Monte Carlo method . 
 = = Nuclear shell model = = 
 During her time at Chicago and Argonne in the late 1940s , Goeppert Mayer developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells , which she published in 1950 . Her model explained why certain numbers of nucleons in an atomic nucleus result in particularly stable configurations . These numbers are what Eugene Wigner called magic numbers : 2 , 8 , 20 , 28 , 50 , 82 , and 126 . Enrico Fermi provided a critical insight by asking her : " Is there any indication of spin orbit coupling ? " She realised that this was indeed the case , and postulated that the nucleus is a series of closed shells and pairs of neutrons and protons tend to couple together . She described the idea as follows : 
 Think of a room full of <unk> . Suppose they go round the room in circles , each circle enclosed within another . Then imagine that in each circle , you can fit twice as many dancers by having one pair go clockwise and another pair go counterclockwise . Then add one more variation ; all the dancers are spinning twirling round and round like tops as they circle the room , each pair both twirling and circling . But only some of those that go counterclockwise are twirling counterclockwise . The others are twirling clockwise while circling counterclockwise . The same is true of those that are dancing around clockwise : some twirl clockwise , others twirl counterclockwise . 
 Three German scientists , Otto <unk> , J. Hans D. Jensen , and Hans Suess , were also working on solving the same problem , and arrived at the same conclusion independently . Their results were announced in the issue of the Physical Review before Goeppert Mayer ' s announcement in June 1949 . Afterwards , she collaborated with them . Hans Jensen co @-@ authored a book with Goeppert Mayer in 1950 titled Elementary Theory of Nuclear Shell Structure . In 1963 , Goeppert Mayer , Jensen , and Wigner shared the Nobel Prize for Physics " for their discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure . " She was the second and most recent female Nobel laureate in physics , after Marie Curie . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 In 1960 , Goeppert Mayer was appointed full professor of physics at the University of California at San Diego . Although she suffered from a stroke shortly after arriving there , she continued to teach and conduct research for a number of years . She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965 . Goeppert Mayer died in San Diego , California , on February 20 , 1972 , after a heart attack that had struck her the previous year left her comatose . She was buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego . 
 After her death , the Maria Goeppert Mayer Award was created by the American Physical Society to honor young female physicists at the beginning of their careers . Open to all female physicists who hold Ph.D.s , the winner receives money and the opportunity to give guest lectures about her research at four major institutions . Two of her former universities also honor her . The Argonne National Laboratory presents an award each year to an outstanding young woman scientist or engineer , while the University of California at San Diego hosts an annual Maria Goeppert Mayer symposium , bringing together female researchers to discuss current science . Crater Goeppert Mayer on Venus with a diameter of about 35 km is also named after Goeppert @-@ Mayer . In 2011 , she was included in the third issuance of the American Scientists collection of US postage stamps , along with Melvin Calvin , Asa Gray , and Severo Ochoa . Her papers are in the Geisel Library at the University of California , San Diego , and the university 's physics department is housed in Mayer Hall , which is named after her and her husband . 
 = Powhatan Beaty = 
 Powhatan Beaty ( October 8 , 1837 – December 6 , 1916 ) was an African American soldier and actor . During the American Civil War , he served in the Union Army 's 5th United States Colored Infantry Regiment throughout the Richmond – Petersburg Campaign . He received America 's highest military decoration , the Medal of Honor , for taking command of his company at the Battle of Chaffin 's Farm after all officers had been killed and / or wounded . 
 Following the war , he became an orator and actor , appearing in amateur theater productions in his home of Cincinnati , Ohio . His most well @-@ known stage performance was an 1884 appearance at Ford 's Opera House on 9th Street in Washington , D.C. , opposite Henrietta Vinton Davis . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Beaty was born into slavery on October 8 , 1837 , in Richmond , Virginia . He moved to Cincinnati , Ohio , in 1849 , where he received an education . He gained his freedom sometime on or before April 19 , 1861 ; the exact date is unknown and may have been before his move to Ohio . While in school , he developed an interest in theater and made his public acting debut at a school concert . After leaving school , he was apprenticed to a black cabinet maker and eventually worked as a turner . He continued to study acting privately and received training in the field from several coaches , including James E. Murdock , a retired professional stage actor from Philadelphia . 
 A year after the outbreak of the Civil War , with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond , Kentucky , on August 30 , 1862 , rumors of an impending Confederate attack on Cincinnati began to circulate . Richmond was one hundred miles to the south of Cincinnati , and no organized Union troops lay between the two cities . An attack by Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan , who had led his cavalry on a raid behind Union lines in Kentucky the previous month , was also feared . On September 2 , the men of Cincinnati were organized into work units to build fortifications around the city . 
 Although Cincinnati 's African Americans were initially pressed into service at bayonet point , after the appointment of William Dickson as commander of the black troops their treatment improved significantly . Dickson promised that they would be treated fairly and kept together as a distinct unit , to be called the Black Brigade . He then allowed them to return home to prepare for military service , with orders to report the next morning for duty . About four hundred men were released that day , September 4 , and the next morning about seven hundred reported for duty . Among those men was Beaty , who served in Company Number 1 of the Brigade 's 3rd Regiment . Despite the danger of Confederate attack , the unarmed unit was assigned to build defenses near the Licking River in Kentucky , far in advance of the Union lines . For the next fifteen days , they cleared forests , constructed forts , magazines and roads , and dug trenches and rifle pits . The brigade was disbanded on September 20 , the threat of attack having receded . 
 = = United States Colored Troops service = = 
 By June 1863 , Ohio had not yet fielded an African American combat unit , but Ohio blacks were being recruited for service in the regiments of other states . Beaty enlisted from Cincinnati on June 7 , 1863 for a three @-@ year term of service in the Union Army ; he was among a group of men recruited for a Massachusetts regiment . He joined as a private but was promoted to sergeant only two days later . He was placed in charge of a squad of forty @-@ seven other recruits and ordered to report to Columbus , Ohio , from where they would be sent to Boston . Upon arriving in Columbus on June 15 , however , they learned that the Massachusetts regiments were full and unable to accept their service . The Governor of Ohio , David Tod , immediately requested permission from the Department of War to form an Ohio regiment of African Americans . Permission was granted , and on June 17 , Beaty and his squad became the first members of the 127th Ohio Volunteer Infantry , later re @-@ designated the 5th United States Colored Troops . After three months of recruitment and organization in Camp Delaware , on the Olentangy River outside of Delaware , Ohio , the unit set out for Virginia . 
 By the Battle of Chaffin 's Farm on September 29 , 1864 , Beaty had risen to the rank of first sergeant in Company G. His regiment was among a division of black troops assigned to attack the center of the Confederate defenses at New Market Heights . The defenses consisted of two lines of abatis and one line of palisades manned by Brigadier General John Gregg 's Texas Brigade . The attack was met with intense Confederate fire and was turned back after reaching a line of abatis . During the retreat , Company G 's color bearer was killed ; Beaty returned through about 600 yards of enemy fire to retrieve the flag and return it to the company lines . The regiment had suffered severe casualties in the failed charge . Of Company G 's eight officers and eighty @-@ three enlisted men who entered the battle , only sixteen enlisted men , including Beaty , survived the attack unwounded . With no officers remaining , Beaty took command of the company and led it through a second charge at the Confederate lines . The second attack successfully drove the Confederates from their fortified positions , at the cost of three more men from Company G. By the end of the battle , over fifty percent of the black division had been killed , captured , or wounded . For his actions , Beaty was commended on the battlefield by General Benjamin Butler and seven months later , on April 6 , 1865 , awarded the Medal of Honor . 
 Beaty continued to distinguish himself in the 5th Regiment 's further engagements . His actions during the Battle of Fair Oaks & Darbytown Road in October 1864 earned him a mention in the general orders to the Army of the Potomac . The regimental commander , Colonel Giles Shurtleff , twice recommended him for a promotion to commissioned officer . Nothing came of Colonel Shurtleff 's requests , however Beaty did receive a brevet promotion to lieutenant . By the time he was mustered out of the Army he had participated in thirteen battles and numerous skirmishes . 
 = = Post @-@ war life = = 
 After the war , Beaty returned to Cincinnati and raised his family . His son , A. Lee Beaty , became an Ohio state legislator and an assistant U.S. District Attorney for southern Ohio . He resumed his career as a turner and pursued amateur acting and public speaking engagements . He gave public readings for charitable causes and became a well @-@ known <unk> among the African American community of Cincinnati . Through the 1870s he acted in local theaters and directed music and drama exhibitions in the city . He wrote a play about a rich southern planter entitled Delmar , or Scenes in Southland , which was performed in January 1881 with himself in the lead role . Set in Kentucky , Mississippi , and Massachusetts , the work covered the end of slavery and transition to freedom for blacks from 1860 to 1875 . The privately run play was well received , but Beaty did not engage in self @-@ promotion and it never moved into public theaters . 
 In January 1884 , Beaty was working as an assistant engineer at the Cincinnati water works when Henrietta Vinton Davis , a prominent African American actress , came to perform in the city . Together , he and Davis put on a large musical and dramatic festival in <unk> Hall which proved to be very successful . Included in the show were productions of Ingomar , the Barbarian and Robert Montgomery Bird 's The Gladiator , in which Beaty took the role of Spartacus . The culmination of the festival was a performance of selected scenes from Macbeth , with Beaty playing the title role and Davis as Lady Macbeth . Newspapers in both the black and white communities of Cincinnati praised the performances of the two actors , with the Commercial stating that Beaty " threw himself into his part with masterly energy and power " . 
 The successful festival led to Beaty being invited to play as a principal actor in a Washington , D.C. , Shakespearean production organized by Davis . A company including Davis , Beaty , and amateur actors from the D.C. area performed Richard III almost in entirety , three scenes from Macbeth , and one scene from Ingomar , the Barbarian . Davis , the premier black Shakespearean actress of the time , was the star of the show and Beaty played opposite her as Macbeth , King Henry VI , and Ingomar . The May 7 , 1884 , production was played in Ford 's Opera House to a full house of more than 1 @,@ 100 people ; among them was Frederick Douglass . There was some heckling during the play , primarily from some of the white attendees , however a reviewer from The Washington Post reported that " the earnestness and intelligence of several of the leading performers were such as to command the respect of those most disposed to find cause for laughter in everything that was said or done " . Washington newspapers praised the principal actors , but noted that the inexperience of some of the supporting cast was evident . Reviewers for African American newspapers were especially pleased to see such a production in an important venue like Ford 's Theater . The New York Globe wrote of the performance " [ t ] hus leap by leap the colored man and woman encroach upon the ground so long held sacred by their white brother and sister " . 
 Beaty continued to tour with Davis and performed a show in Philadelphia before returning to Cincinnati . He helped form his city 's Literary and Dramatic Club and , in 1888 , became the organization 's drama director . He lived out the rest of his life in Cincinnati and died at age seventy @-@ nine on December 6 , 1916 ; he was buried at Union Baptist Cemetery .

 Ra.One is a 2011 Indian science fiction superhero film directed by Anubhav Sinha , and starring Shah Rukh Khan , Arjun Rampal , Kareena Kapoor , Armaan Verma , Shahana Goswami and Tom Wu in pivotal roles . The script , written by Anubhav Sinha and Kanika Dhillon , originated as an idea that Anubhav Sinha got when he saw a television commercial , and which he subsequently expanded . The film follows Shekhar <unk> ( Shah Rukh Khan ) , a game designer who creates a motion sensor @-@ based game in which the antagonist ( Ra.One ) is more powerful than the protagonist ( G.One ) . The former escapes from the game 's virtual world and enters the real world ; his aim is to kill Lucifer , the game ID of Shekhar 's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One 's power . <unk> pursued , the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them . 
 Principal photography began in March 2010 and took place in India and the United Kingdom , and was overseen by an international crew . The post @-@ production involved 3 @-@ D conversion and the application of visual effects , the latter being recognised as a technological breakthrough among Indian films . With a budget of ₹ 150 crore ( US $ 22 million ) , inclusive of publicity costs , Ra.One was one of the most expensive Indian films at the time of release . The producers spent ₹ 150 crore ( US $ 22 million ) out of a ₹ 52 crore ( US $ 7 @.@ 7 million ) marketing budget , which involved a nine @-@ month publicity campaign , brand tie @-@ ups , merchandise , video games and viral marketing . 
 Ra.One was initially scheduled to release on 3 June 2011 , but delays due to a lengthy post @-@ production process and escalating costs pushed back the release date . The film also faced controversies involving plagiarism , content leaks and copyright challenges . Consequently , Ra.One was theatrically released on 26 October 2011 , the beginning of the five @-@ day Diwali weekend , in 2D , 3D and dubbed versions , with three international premieres being held between October 24 & 26 , 2011 . The film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an Indian film as of 2011 , and was preceded by high audience and commercial expectations . 
 Upon release , Ra.One received mixed reviews , with critics praising the visuals and music , but criticising the script and direction . Commercially , the film became the third highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of 2011 domestically , the highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of 2011 worldwide , and broke a number of opening box office records , though it failed to sustain at the box office after its extended opening weekend . Although the film earned more than Rs 170 crores it was still not considered as a hit film as the distributors failed to recover their investment . The film subsequently won a number of awards for its technical aspects , notably one National Film Award , one Filmfare Award and four International Indian Film Academy Awards . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Shekhar <unk> ( Shah Rukh Khan ) , a game designer who works for the London @-@ based Barron Industries , has delivered a number of commercial failures ; an irate Barron ( Dalip Tahil ) gives him his last chance to develop a successful game . To impress his sceptical son Prateek ( Armaan Verma ) , and upon the request of his wife Sonia ( Kareena Kapoor ) , Shekhar uses his son 's idea that the antagonist should be more powerful than the protagonist . His colleague , computer programmer Jenny ( Shahana Goswami ) , uses Shekhar 's face as a model for that of the game 's protagonist G.One ( Shah Rukh Khan ) ( Technically Good One and in Hindi Jeevan , which means life ) , while the shape @-@ shifting antagonist Ra.One ( Technically Random Access Version One and in Hindi <unk> , a mythical demon ) is made faceless . Another colleague , Akashi ( Tom Wu ) , implements the characters ' movements . The game , named Ra.One , contains three levels , the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed . Each character possesses a special device – the <unk> ( Hertz <unk> Resonance Transmitter ) which gives them their powers . Upon reaching the last level , the characters gain a gun with one bullet ; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his <unk> is attached . 
 When Ra.One undergoes final tests , Akashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them . When the game is officially launched , it receives a standing ovation from the audience ; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately . He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level , but is interrupted by Akashi . Ra.One , unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far , becomes determined that Lucifer will die . He uses a wireless technology ( which Jenny had introduced in a conference ) to enter the real world , a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction . Akashi informs Shekhar , who partially understands the situation and rushes home , fearing for his son 's life . Meanwhile , Ra.One murders Akashi and assumes his appearance ; he goes to find Lucifer , and meets Shekhar in the process . In an attempt to save his son , Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer , but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card . Consequently , Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident . 
 Sonia , devastated after Shekhar 's death , tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar 's funeral .

 = = Cast = = 
 The major characters of Ra.One were played by protagonists Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor , and primary antagonist Arjun Rampal . Supporting roles were played by Tom Wu , Shahana Goswami and child artist Armaan Verma . The film featured cameo appearances by Rajinikanth playing the Enthiran character Chitti , Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra , the latter two being characters in a dream sequence . Additional minor roles were played by Dalip Tahil and Satish Shah , and an important voice @-@ over was provided by Amitabh Bachchan . Khan performed both as Shekhar and <unk> The titular character Ra.One was enacted by three actors – Rampal , Wu and Kapoor , signifying the character 's shape @-@ shifting ability . 
 Khan was the first actor to be cast in the film . Three actors had initially been considered for the lead female role ; Kapoor was ultimately chosen because she insisted on playing the part . Rampal accepted the role of Ra.One after Sinha expressed a strong desire to cast him in the film . Wu was contracted to the film in July 2010 , and Goswami was cast one month later . Bachchan agreed to be a part of the film after being requested by Khan and Sinha . Several cast members prepared extensively for their roles ; Rampal and Kapoor followed special diets to lose weight , and Verma learnt capoeira . Khan and Verma performed their own stunts , and Kapoor subsequently did so as well despite initial reluctance . 
 However , the cast did encounter problems during production . Khan faced difficulties with his superhero suit and prosthetic makeup , and injured his left knee . The decision to cast Rampal was met with scepticism due to " questionable acting abilities , " a statement Sinha criticised . In addition , Rampal encountered back problems ( which were treated by the time production began ) , prompting speculation of a possible replacement by Vivek Oberoi . Jackie Chan had initially been approached for the role of Akashi , but he declined the offer . Rajnikanth suffered from health problems which caused a delay in the filming of his cameo appearance . Dutt faced a scheduling conflict with Agneepath ( 2012 ) , which was later resolved .

 = = = Development = = = 
 According to director Anubhav Sinha , the idea of Ra.One originated when he saw an advertisement on television which showed children remotely controlling a human . He was attracted to the concept and wrote a script based on it . Sinha then approached Khan , who liked the story and decided to produce the film under his production company Red Chillies Entertainment . Sinha was apprehensive of retaining Khan 's support after the former 's previous film Cash ( 2007 ) became a commercial failure , but Khan reportedly " remained unchanged " . 
 Shahrukh Khan felt that the film possessed significant commercial potential , in addition to being a fulfilment of his " childhood dream " to be a superhero and to fly . He stated that he wanted to " make a film that gives me the right to deserve the iconic status that I 've got for 20 years . " He also said that he wanted to make a film dedicated to father @-@ son relationships , which were , in his opinion , " neglected " in Bollywood . Khan 's idea was to make a simple family drama which expanded into an action film . He declined to make the film in English to increase its appeal for Western audiences , feeling that " cracking Hollywood on their terms " was unnecessary . Both Khan and Sinha credited their children for providing encouragement , and regularly " approving " the film 's execution . 
 Red Chillies Entertainment continued to work on other projects before finalising the production aspects of Ra.One. After providing the visual effects for My Name Is Khan ( 2010 ) , the studio focused solely on Ra.One and did not take up any other films . Khan initially approached a number of directors to helm the film , including Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar , but they declined ; eventually , Sinha was made the film 's director . To prepare the film 's premises and characterisation , Sinha spent several months viewing video clips , digital art portals and comic books . Sinha and Khan also watched around 200 superhero films from all over the world . The storyboards were designed by Atul <unk> , who was contracted after he met Khan at Yash Raj Studios . While the former began work on the storyboards , the producers hired a storyboard artist from Hollywood . <unk> revealed that Khan and the other artist differed on their visions of the film , and so he was brought back . Before filming , Khan reportedly took tips from actor Kamal Hassan regarding the production of large @-@ scale films , having been impressed by Hassan 's <unk> ( 2008 ) . 
 The title of the film received significant media attention due to it being the name of the antagonist rather than the protagonist . The move was considered innovative , and noted as a sign of the " rising importance of the villain in Bollywood . " According to Sinha , the title had not been planned as such , and was ultimately chosen because Ra.One " sounded cooler " than <unk> Khan was advised to name the film after his own character ; he declined to do so , citing the inter @-@ dependence between good and evil . He also called Alfred Hitchcock as his inspiration , and pointed out that the antagonists in films like Sholay , Mr. India and Sadak were better remembered than the protagonists . 
 = = = Principal photography = = = 
 The crew of Ra.One featured both Indian and overseas personnel . Nicola Pecorini served as the director of photography , with V. Manikandan providing assistance . Andy Gill and Spiro Razatos were hired as the stunt supervisors , and Nino <unk> was hired as the stunt cinematographer . Sabu Cyril and Marcus Wookey were responsible for the production design . The film 's producer was Bobby Chawla , but Gauri Khan later stepped in after the former suffered a brain haemorrhage . Filming took place at a number of studios , notably Filmistan Studios , Film City and Yash Raj Studios in India and the Black Hangar Studios in the UK . 
 Principal photography was initially set to begin in Miami , but the idea was abandoned due to budget constraints . The first phase of filming began in Goa on 21 March 2010 and continued until May . The second and third phases took place in London with the entire cast , beginning in July 2010 and ending in August . The next phase was split into two schedules ; the first schedule commenced at Filmistan Studios in the first week of September 2010 , while the second schedule began in December 2010 and took place over a seven @-@ day period . The remaining portions were filmed in July 2011 at Film City . A cameo appearance and a music video were filmed in the weeks leading up to the release , the former at the Whistling Woods Studios in Mumbai . 
 Ra.One featured three major action sequences , which were filmed in sets and real locations across Mumbai and London . The cinematography borrowed ideas from video games , such as rapid transitions between first @-@ person and third @-@ person perspectives . Procedures such as bullet time were also incorporated into the film . The production design was closely associated with the lighting and cinematography to facilitate smooth filming . However , filming faced a number of difficulties including increasing costs , delays and safety constraints . In addition , differences between Khan and Sinha caused tensions on the sets . 
 = = = Post @-@ production = = = 
 As with the filming crew , the post @-@ production crew of the film included both Indian and overseas personnel . Prime Focus carried out the film 's 3 @-@ D conversion , with London @-@ based colorist Richard Fearon performing the color grading . Red Chillies VFX partnered with a number of visual effects studios around the world , and undertook the incorporation of the visual effects under the supervision of Jeffrey Kleiser . Nvidia provided the information technology – based software utilised for the effects , while <unk> Quirk supervised over the computer @-@ generated imagery used in the film . <unk> <unk> was responsible for the film 's sound design . 
 The idea for converting the film to 3 @-@ D was put forth during filming , and was implemented in July 2011 due to a revived interest in 3 @-@ D films . The process required 2 @,@ 600 artists to convert 4 @,@ 400 shots of the film . The sound design involved bridging the real and the virtual world , and the required sound enhancements were achieved by using the Dolby Surround 7 @.@ 1 system . Incorporating the visual effects began in April 2010 , and was preceded by extensive research . 1 @,@ 200 artists worked for 2 ½ years to complete the visual effects work . A number of complex procedures were executed , including cubical transformations and the design of the faceless form of Ra.One. 
 Despite precautions , the post @-@ production faced significant delays owing to the digital inter @-@ mediation , increased work @-@ load due to the 3 @-@ D and dubbed versions of the film , and delays in the completion of the visual effects . The post @-@ production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer . The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres , generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release . Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work , and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time . 
 = = = Costumes = = = 
 The body suits worn by Khan and Rampal were designed by Robert Kurtzman and Tim Flattery , and made by a team of specialists based in Los Angeles . Sinha spent around three months conceptualising the costumes , watching various superhero films to design a costume not created already . He then wrote a 23 @-@ page document with his sketches and details of what he wanted , and gave it to the designers to work upon . To create the suit , Khan was required to enter a small chamber where a warm latex @-@ like liquid was released up to his neck and allowed to solidify , forming the mould which was then peeled off his body . The suit was joined by a concealed zipper and subsequently modified . Computer @-@ generated embellishments such as light beams and electricity were added to the suits after Khan expressed dissatisfaction with the initial rushes of the film . A total of 21 costumes were made for the film , with each suit reportedly costing ₹ 10 million ( US $ 150 @,@ 000 ) . 
 Khan 's suit was made of reinforced latex , coloured steel @-@ blue and fitted with micro @-@ computer circuitry . Rampal 's suit was made of three @-@ inch thick solid rubber , and was red in color . Both actors were required to wear additional suits inside their body suits to prevent skin contact . Wearing the suits created a number of difficulties for the actors . It took 20 minutes to put on the suits and 40 minutes to remove them . In addition , the non @-@ porous nature of the suits created intense heat inside , causing excessive perspiration despite the presence of special air conditioning ducts . Khan later felt that the suits ' conception had been a mistake since filming occurred during the day ; digital adjustments to the suits brought " all the efforts to naught . " 
 Manish Malhotra designed the look and the costume of Kareena Kapoor for the song " Chammak Challo " , which received widespread media coverage . Kapoor wore a red sari draped in the style of a dhoti . Since the release of the song , the costume was termed a " fashion rage , " becoming popular in India and some overseas countries . Fashion experts applauded the costume and Kapoor 's ability to carry it off " stunningly , " though certain experts dismissed the naming of the sari color .

 The soundtrack of Ra.One was composed by Vishal @-@ Shekhar , with the lyrics being written by <unk> Panchi , Vishal Dadlani and <unk> . A. R.

Sinha announced that R & B singer Akon and the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra would be a part of the soundtrack ; the former lent his vocals for " Chammak Challo " and " Criminal " , while the latter performed in " <unk> Naina " . The composers obtained the official license to use Ben E. King 's " Stand By Me , " on which they based the song " <unk> . " The soundtrack contains fifteen tracks , including seven original songs , four remixes , three instrumentals and an international version of " Chammak Challo " . The music rights were bought by T @-@ Series for ₹ 150 million ( US $ 2 @.@ 2 million ) . The Hindi version of the soundtrack was released on 12 September 2011 ; the Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 10 October 2011 , featuring six tracks each .

 The producers of Ra.One spent ₹ 100 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 5 million ) out of a ₹ 520 million ( US $ 7 @.@ 7 million ) marketing budget , ₹ 150 million ( US $ 2 @.@ 2 million ) of this was utilised for internet promotions alone . The film 's first theatrical poster was released in December 2010 , and was followed by the release of two teaser trailers during the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . The first theatrical trailer premiered three months later . Khan and Sinha undertook a multi @-@ city tour during which they unveiled a 3 @,@ 600 feet @-@ long piece of fan mail to collect audience messages . The official website of Ra.One was launched on 31 May 2011 , and an official YouTube channel for the film was subsequently unveiled .

 The film 's marketing utilised merchandise and games to facilitate the creation of a franchise . Khan marketed merchandise related to the film , which included toys , tablets and apparel . On 14 October 2011 , a gaming tournament featuring games like Call of Duty was conducted in Mumbai and telecast live on YouTube . Red Chillies Entertainment partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe to create " Ra.One – The Game , " a game for <unk> which was released on 5 October 2011 . The producers further collaborated with UTV <unk> to design a social game titled Ra.One Genesis , with an independent plot based on G.One , in addition to designing digital comics based on the film 's characters .

 In May 2011 , the first rushes of Ra.One were shown to the cast of Khan 's other home production Always Kabhi Kabhi ( 2011 ) . Subsequently , the film was screened for test audiences to study and gauge the film 's appeal across different age groups . A few days prior to the theatrical release , Khan arranged a special screening of the film 's final cut in Yash Raj Studios , where he invited close friends , his family and the film 's crew . Between 24 and 26 October 2011 , Ra.One had international premieres in Dubai , London and Toronto , all of which were chosen due to their international significance and large South Asian populations . The premiere in Dubai was held on 24 October 2011 at the Grand Cinemas , <unk> . A high @-@ profile dinner and charity auction followed , where Khan raised <unk> ( approximately US $ 8 @,@ 200 ) to build a workshop for children with special needs . The premiere included three simultaneous screenings of the film , for which tickets were placed on sale for the public . The premiere in London took place at the O2 Cineworld the following day , and the premiere in Toronto took place at the TIFF Bell Lightbox on 26 October 2011 . 
 Ra.One was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification on 14 October 2011 to receive its viewership rating . The Board raised strong objections to the film 's action scenes , fearing that they would influence young children to emulate the stunts . The police and the Indian Railways security force had made similar objections to the train @-@ based stunts in the film , claiming that youngsters would " blindly imitate them " and hence put their lives at risk . The film was finally passed with a ' U ' certificate without cuts , but under the condition that prominent disclaimers were shown , stating that the stunts were computer @-@ generated and should not be imitated . The British Board of Film Classification rated the film 12A for " moderate fantasy violence " . In March 2012 , a Mid @-@ Day report alleged that Ra.One had received a favourable rating , pointing out that the producers had violated the rules by meeting the Board officials during the screening .

 The film faced allegations of plagiarism with similarities to Terminator 2 : Judgment Day ( 1991 ) , the Batman series , Iron Man ( 2008 ) , The Sorcerer 's Apprentice ( 2010 ) and Tron : Legacy ( 2010 ) . Khan denied the allegations , saying , " I got inspired from a lot of superhero movies but the movie is original . In fact , Ra.One will be the first superhero @-@ based movie in the world in which the superhero lives in a family . " 
 A few days before the release , screenwriter Yash Patnaik claimed that Ra.One resembled a concept that he had developed several years before . Patnaik appealed to the Bombay High Court to delay the film 's release , until he was given due credit or 10 % of the film 's overall profit . The court , observing prima facie evidence that there had been copyright violations , asked the filmmakers to deposit ₹ 10 million ( US $ 150 @,@ 000 ) with the court on 21 October 2011 before releasing the film . However , Patnaik challenged the court 's decision and demanded that the producers give him credit and not cash . Sinha later claimed that he alone had developed the film 's story .

 Reports of a planned sequel of Ra.One began surfacing prior to the film 's release , though the extent of real progress on the sequel is unknown .

 Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is the 2004 debut novel of British writer Susanna Clarke . An alternative history set in 19th @-@ century England around the time of the Napoleonic Wars , it is based on the premise that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men : Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange . Centred on the relationship between these two men , the novel investigates the nature of " Englishness " and the boundaries between reason and unreason , Anglo @-@ Saxon and Anglo @-@ Dane , and Northern and Southern English cultural tropes / stereotypes . It has been described as a fantasy novel , an alternative history , and a historical novel . It inverts the Industrial Revolution conception of the North @-@ South divide in England : in this book the North is romantic and magical , rather than rational and concrete . It can be usefully compared and contrasted with Elizabeth Gaskell 's attempts at synthesising a unitary English identity in her fiction . 
 The narrative draws on various Romantic literary traditions , such as the comedy of manners , the Gothic tale , and the Byronic hero . The novel 's language is a pastiche of 19th @-@ century writing styles , such as those of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens . Clarke describes the supernatural with mundane details . She supplements the text with almost 200 footnotes , outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship . 
 Clarke began writing Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in 1992 ; ten years later she submitted the manuscript for publication . It was accepted by Bloomsbury and published in September 2004 , with illustrations by Portia Rosenberg . Bloomsbury were so sure of its success that they printed 250 @,@ 000 hardcover copies . The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the New York Times best @-@ seller list . It was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Novel .

 = = = Volume I : Mr Norrell = = = 
 The novel opens in autumn 1806 in northern England with The Learned Society of York Magicians , made up of " theoretical magicians " , who believe that magic died out several hundred years earlier . The group is stunned to learn of a " practising magician " , Mr Gilbert Norrell , who owns a large collection of " books of magic " , which he has spent years purchasing to keep them out of the hands of others . Norrell proves his skill as a practical magician by making the statues in York Cathedral speak . John Childermass , Mr Norrell 's long @-@ time servant , convinces a member of the group , John Segundus , to write about the event for the London newspapers . 
 Segundus 's article generates considerable interest in Mr Norrell , who moves to London to revive practical English magic . He enters society with the help of two gentlemen about town and meets a Cabinet Minister , Sir Walter Pole . To ingratiate himself , Mr Norrell attempts to recall Sir Walter 's fiancée , Emma Wintertowne , from the dead . He summons a fairy — " the gentleman with thistle @-@ down hair " — who strikes a bargain with Mr Norrell to restore Emma : half of her life will be spent with the fairy . After news spreads of Emma 's resurrection and happy marriage to Sir Walter , magic becomes respectable ; and Mr Norrell performs various feats to aid the government in their ongoing war against Napoleon . 
 While living in London , Mr Norrell encounters Vinculus , a street @-@ magician , who relates a prophecy about a nameless slave and two magicians in England , but Norrell dismisses it . While travelling , Vinculus later meets Jonathan Strange , a young gentleman of property from Shropshire , and recites the same prophecy , prompting Strange to become a magician . Meanwhile , the gentleman with thistle @-@ down hair takes a liking to Stephen Black , Sir Walter 's capable black butler , and promises to make him a king . Emma ( now Lady Pole ) lapses into lassitude . She rarely speaks , and her attempts to communicate her situation are confounded by magic . No doctor can cure her , and Mr Norrell claims that her problems cannot be solved by magic . Without the knowledge of the other characters , each evening she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by the gentleman with thistle @-@ down hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost @-@ Hope , where they dance all night long . 
 = = = Volume II : Jonathan Strange = = = 
 Volume II opens in Summer 1809 with Strange learning of Mr Norrell and travelling to London to meet him . They immediately clash over the importance of John Uskglass ( the legendary Raven King ) to English magic . Strange argues that " without the Raven King there would be no magic and no magicians " while Norrell retorts that the Raven King made war upon England and should be forgotten . Despite their differing opinions and temperaments , Strange becomes Norrell 's pupil . Norrell , however , deliberately keeps some knowledge from Strange . 
 Lady Pole and Strange 's wife , Arabella , become friends ; several times Lady Pole attempts to tell Arabella about her forced nights of dancing at the fairy 's castle in Lost @-@ Hope , but each time she tells an unrelated story . Arabella also meets the gentleman with thistle @-@ down hair at the Poles ' , but she assumes he is simply a resident . Without her husband 's knowledge , the fairy plots to enchant her , although Stephen Black continually attempts to dissuade him . 
 The <unk> become a popular couple in London . The Cabinet ministers find Strange easier to deal with than Norrell , and they send him to assist the Duke of Wellington on his Peninsular Campaign . For over a year , Strange helps the army : he creates roads , moves towns , and makes dead men speak . After he returns , he fails to cure George III 's madness , although Strange manages to save the king from becoming enchanted by the gentleman with thistle @-@ down hair , who is determined to make Stephen a king . Strange then helps defeat Napoleon at the horrific Battle of Waterloo . 
 Frustrated with being Norrell 's pupil , Strange pens a scathing review of a book outlining Norrell 's theories on modern magic ; in particular , Strange challenges Norrell 's views of the Raven King . The English public splits into " <unk> " and " Strangites " ; Norrell and Strange part company , although not without regret . Strange returns home and works on his own book , The History and Practice of English Magic . Arabella goes missing , then suddenly reappears , sick and weak . Three days later she dies . 
 = = = Volume III : John Uskglass = = = 
 Volume III opens in January 1816 with Childermass experiencing strong magic that is not produced by either Norrell or Strange . At the same time , Lady Pole attempts to shoot Mr Norrell as he is returning home . Childermass takes the bullet himself but is not killed . Afterwards , Lady Pole is cared for in the country by John Segundus , who has an inkling of the magic surrounding her . During travels in the north , Stephen meets Vinculus , who recites his prophecy : " the nameless slave shall be a king in a strange country ... " Stephen believes it applies to him , but the gentleman with thistle @-@ down hair argues that it applies to the Raven King . 
 Strange settles in Venice and meets Flora <unk> . They become fond of each other and Strange 's friends believe he may marry again . However , after experimenting with dangerous magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to Faerie , he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive . Immediately after he discovers this , the gentleman with the thistledown hair curses him with Eternal Night , an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes . Thereafter , Strange 's strenuous efforts to rescue her take their toll , and his letters to friends begin to appear crazed . At Strange 's request , Flora moves with her family to Padua and <unk> herself inside her home , along with a mirror given to her by Strange . <unk> is sent by Lascelles and Norrell to Venice to only enquire about Strange but is brought before him by Strange 's magic . Strange instructs <unk> with several tasks and re @-@ invokes the old alliances within England between the forces of nature and John Uskglass . In England , this reawakening sparks a magical renaissance , but Norrell fails to grasp its significance . Strange returns and gives Childermass instructions which allow him to free Lady Pole from the fairy 's enchantment . Strange , bringing " Eternal Night " with him , asks Norrell to help him undo Arabella 's enchantment by summoning John Uskglass . 
 Childermass meanwhile indirectly receives the message meant for him by Strange and uses it to break the enchantment over Lady Pole . Enraged by this the gentleman with the thistledown hair first murders Vinculus forcing Stephen Black to watch . Then after begins to place a second curse upon Lady Pole that would lead to her imminent death for cheating him of his prize . In parallel , Norrell and Strange attempt a spell intended to pay homage from the forces of England to John Uskglass . Their same belief as the gentleman with the thistledown hair that the ' nameless slave ' applies to Uskglass ends up in them devoting their power to Stephen who uses his momentary control of England to destroy the man with the thistledown hair . Amongst the confusion , Stephen leaves down one of the newly opened Faerie roads , and becomes the new king of the now blossoming Lost @-@ Hope . 
 Between the death of Vinculus and the gentleman with the thistledown hair , Childermass notes that tattooed upon Vinculus 's body is the last works of John Uskglass . As he tries to preserve the tattoos in memory , a man appears . Between calling Childermass his servant ( leading him to believe it is Norrell in disguise ) and trivially performing other feats of great magic , the unknown man brings Vinculus back to life . 
 As a result of the imprecision of the fairy 's curse , which was placed on " the English magician , " Norrell is trapped along with Strange in the " Eternal Night , " and they cannot move more than a certain distance from each other . Upon the gentleman with the thistledown hair 's death , Arabella comes through the mirror in Venice , where Flora is waiting for her upon instruction of Strange . The penultimate scene is of the now infamous Childermass releasing the contract upon The Learned Society of York Magicians , telling them they can study magic again , and showing the now restored Vinculus as proof that one last book remains , tattooed upon his body . Two months later , Strange has a conversation with the now stronger Arabella still living in Venice , explaining that he and Norrell are working to undo the eternal darkness they are both trapped in , but are planning to adventure into other worlds . Neither wish to take her to Faerie again , so he instead promises to return to her when he dis @-@ spells the darkness and tells her not to be a widow till then , which she agrees to . 
 = = Composition and publication = = 
 Clarke first developed the idea for Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell during a year spent teaching English in Bilbao , Spain : " I had a kind of waking dream ... about a man in 18th @-@ century clothes in a place rather like Venice , talking to some English tourists . And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background – he 'd been dabbling in magic , and something had gone badly wrong . " She had also recently re @-@ read J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings and afterwards was inspired to " trying writing a novel of magic and fantasy " . 
 After she returned from Spain in 1993 , Clarke began to think seriously about writing her novel . She signed up for a five @-@ day fantasy and science @-@ fiction writing workshop , co @-@ taught by writers Colin Greenland and Geoff Ryman . The students were expected to prepare a short story before attending , but Clarke only had " bundles " of material for her novel . From this she extracted " The Ladies of Grace Adieu " , a story about three women secretly practising magic who are discovered by the famous Jonathan Strange . Greenland was so impressed with the story that , without Clarke 's knowledge , he sent an excerpt to his friend , the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman . Gaiman later said , " It was terrifying from my point of view to read this first short story that had so much assurance ... It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata . " Gaiman showed the story to his friend , science @-@ fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden . Clarke learned of these events when Nielsen Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology Starlight 1 , which featured pieces by well @-@ regarded science @-@ fiction and fantasy writers . She accepted , and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997 . 
 Clarke spent the next ten years working on the novel in her spare time , while editing cookbooks full @-@ time for Simon & Schuster in Cambridge . She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3 ; according to the New York Times Magazine , her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet . She was never sure , however , if she would finish her novel or if it would be published . Clarke tried to write for three hours each day , beginning at 5 : 30 am , but struggled to keep this schedule . Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end , she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together . Clarke , admitting that the project was for herself and not the reader , " clung to this method " " because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning , [ the novel ] would lack depth , and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do . But if I had known it was going to take me ten years , I would never have begun . I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year , or the year after next . " Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together . Greenland did not read the novel until it was published . 
 Around 2001 , Clarke " had begun to despair " , and started looking for someone to help her finish and sell the book . Giles Gordon became her agent and sold the unfinished manuscript to Bloomsbury in early 2003 , after two publishers rejected it as unmarketable . Bloomsbury were so sure the novel would be a success that they offered Clarke a £ 1 million advance . They printed 250 @,@ 000 hardcover copies simultaneously in the United States , Britain , and Germany . Seventeen translations were begun before the first English publication was released . Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell was first published in the United States on 8 September 2004 , in the United Kingdom on 30 September , and in other countries on 4 October . 
 = = Style = = 
 Clarke 's style has frequently been described as a pastiche , particularly of nineteenth @-@ century British writers such as Charles Dickens , Jane Austen , and George Meredith . Specifically , the novel 's minor characters , including sycophants , rakes , and the Duke of Wellington , evoke Dickens ' caricatures . Laura Miller , in her review for Salon , suggests that the novel is " about a certain literary voice , the eminently civilized voice of early 19th century social comedy " , exemplified by the works of Austen . The novel even uses obsolete spellings — chuse for choose and shewed for showed , for example — to convey this voice as well as the free indirect speech made famous by Austen . Clarke herself notes that Austen 's influence is particularly strong in the " domestic scenes , set in living rooms and drawing rooms where people mostly chat about magic " where Dickens 's is prominent " any time there 's more action or description " . While many reviewers compare Clarke 's style to that of Austen , Gregory Feeley argues in his review for The Weekly Standard that " the points of resemblance are mostly superficial " . He writes that " Austen gets down to business briskly , while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay . " For example , Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel , but only in a footnote . He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way through the novel . 
 In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell , Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness . For example , the narrator notes : " It has been remarked ( by a lady infinitely cleverer than the present author ) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry . Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne ! No young lady ever had such advantages before : for she died upon the Tuesday , was raised to life in the early hours of Wednesday morning , and was married upon the Thursday ; which some people thought too much excitement for one week . " As Michel Faber explains in his review for The Guardian , " here we have all the defining features of Clarke 's style simultaneously : the archly Austenesque tone , the somewhat overdone quaintness ( " upon the Tuesday " ) , the winningly matter @-@ of @-@ fact use of the supernatural , and <unk> to spare . " Gregory Maguire notes in The New York Times that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself : " [ A gentleman ] picks up a book and begins to read ... but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel – the sort of work which above all others he most despises – and he puts it down in disgust . " Elsewhere , the narrator remarks , " Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women . " The narrator 's identity has been a topic of discussion , with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested . 
 Clarke 's style extends to the novel 's 185 footnotes , which document a meticulous invented history of English magic . At times , the footnotes dominate entire pages of the novel . Michael Dirda , in his review for The Washington Post , describes these notes as " dazzling feats of imaginative scholarship " , in which the anonymous narrator " provides elaborate mini @-@ essays , relating anecdotes from the lives of semi @-@ legendary magicians , describing strange books and their contents , speculating upon the early years and later fate of the Raven King " . This extensive extra @-@ textual apparatus is reminiscent of postmodernist works , such as David Foster Wallace 's Infinite Jest ( 1996 ) and Thomas Pynchon 's Mason & Dixon ( 1997 ) , particularly as Clarke 's notes humorously refer to previous notes in the novel . Clarke did not expect her publisher to accept the footnotes . 
 Feeley explains that Romantic poet John Keats 's " vision of enchantment and devastation following upon any dealings with faeries " informs the novel , as the passing reference to the " cold hillside " makes clear . The magic in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell has been described as " wintry and sinister " and " a melancholy , macabre thing " . There are " flocks of black birds , a forest that grows up in the canals of Venice , a countryside of bleak moors that can only be entered through mirrors , a phantom bell that makes people think of everything they have ever lost , a midnight darkness that follows an accursed man everywhere he goes " . The setting reflects this tone , as " dark , fog , mist and wet give the book much of its creepy , northern atmosphere . " According to Nisi Shawl in her review for The Seattle Times , the illustrations reinforce this tenor : " Shadows fill the illustrations by Portia Rosenberg , as apt as Edward Gorey 's for Dickens ' ' Bleak House ' . " Author John Clute disagrees , arguing that they are " astonishingly inappropriate " to the tone of the novel . Noting that Clarke refers to important nineteenth @-@ century illustrators George Cruikshank and [ Thomas Rowlandson ] , whose works are " line @-@ dominated , intricate , scabrous , cartoon @-@ like , savage and funny " , he is disappointed with the " soft and wooden " illustrations provided by Rosenberg . 
 = = Genre = = 
 Reviewers variously describe Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell as a fantasy novel , an alternative history , a historical fiction , or as a combination of these styles . Clarke herself says , " I think the novel is viewed as something new ... blending together a few genres – such as fantasy and adventure and pastiche historical – plus there 's the whole thing about slightly knowing footnotes commenting on the story . " She explains in an interview that she was particularly influenced by the historical fiction of Rosemary Sutcliff as well as the fantasies of Ursula K. Le Guin and Alan Garner , and that she loves the works of Austen . 
 In his review for The Boston Globe , John Freeman observes that Clarke 's fantasy , like that of Franz Kafka and Neil Gaiman , is imbued with realism . He argues that the footnotes in particular lend an air of credibility to the narrative : for example , they describe a fictional biography of Jonathan Strange and list where particular paintings in Norrell ’ s house are located . In an interview , Clarke describes how she creates this realist fantasy : " One way of grounding the magic is by putting in lots of stuff about street lamps , carriages and how difficult it is to get good servants . " To create this effect , the novel includes many references to real early @-@ nineteenth century people and things , such as : artists Francisco Goya , Cruikshank , and Rowlandson ; writers Frances Burney , William Beckford , Monk Lewis , Lord Byron , and Ann Radcliffe ; Maria Edgeworth 's Belinda and Austen 's Emma ; publisher John Murray ; politicians Lord Castlereagh and George Canning ; The Gentleman 's Magazine and The Edinburgh Review ; Chippendale and Wedgwood furnishings ; and the madness of King George III . Clarke has said that she hopes the magic is as realistic as that in Le Guin 's Earthsea trilogy . This realism has led other reviewers , such as Polly Shulman , to argue that Clarke 's book is more of an historical fiction , akin to the works of Patrick O 'Brian . As she explains , " Both Clarke 's and O 'Brian 's stories are about a complicated relationship between two men bound together by their profession ; both are set during the Napoleonic wars ; and they share a dry , melancholy wit and unconventional narrative shape . " Shulman sees fantasy and historical fiction as similar because both must follow rigid rules or risk a breakdown of the narrative . 
 As well as literary styles , Clarke pastiches many Romantic literary genres : the comedy of manners , the Gothic tale , the silver @-@ fork novel , the military adventure , the Byronic hero , and the historical romance of Walter Scott . In fact , Clarke 's novel maps the literary history of the early nineteenth century : the novel begins with the style and genres of Regency England , an " Austenian world of light , bright , sparkling dialogue and well @-@ mannered gentility " , and gradually transforms into a dark , Byronic tale . Clarke combines these Romantic genres with modern ones , such as the fantasy novel , drawing on the works of J. R. R. Tolkien , Philip Pullman , T. H. White , and C. S. Lewis . As Maguire notes , Clarke includes rings of power and books of spells that originate in these authors ' works . In contrast , Sacha Zimmerman suggests in The New Republic that while Tolkien 's world is " entirely new " , Clarke 's world is more engaging because it is eerily close to the reader 's . Although many reviewers compare Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell to the Harry Potter series , Annie <unk> contends in The Baltimore Sun that " the allusion is misleading " : unlike J. K. Rowling 's novels , Clarke 's is morally ambiguous , with its complex plot and dark characters . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Friendship = = = 
 Reviewers focus most frequently on the dynamic between Norrell and Strange , arguing that the novel is about their relationship . In her review for the Times Literary Supplement , Roz Kaveney writes that the two illustrate Harold Bloom 's notion of the " anxiety of influence " in addition to romantic friendship . The two are a " study in contrasts " , with Norrell " exceptionally learned but shy and fussy " while Strange is " charming , young , fashionable and romantic " . As one reviewer remarks , " Clarke could have called the book Sense and Sensibility if the title weren 't already taken . " 
 = = = Reason and madness = = = 
 The novel is not about the fight between good and evil but rather the differences between madness and reason — and it is the fairy world that is connected to madness ( mad people can see fairies , for example ) . Lady Pole , who is taken away into the fairyland of Lost @-@ Hope every night , appears insane to those around her . She is hidden away , like the character type examined by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in their seminal book The Madwoman in the Attic ( 1979 ) . Developing a " divided consciousness " , she is passive and quiet at home at the same time she is vengeful and murderous in the fairy land . 
 = = = Englishness = = = 
 Clarke 's book is identified as distinctively English not only because of its style but also because of its themes of " vigorous common sense " , " firm ethical fiber " , " serene reason and self @-@ confidence " , which are drawn from its Augustan literary roots . The " muddy , bloody , instinctual spirit of the fairies " is equally a part of its Englishness , along with " arrogance , provincialism and class prejudice " . The fairy tradition that Clarke draws on is particularly English ; she alludes to tales from children 's literature and others which date back to the medieval period . As Feeley notes , " The idea of fairies forming a hidden supernatural aristocracy certainly predates Spenser and Shakespeare , and seems to distinguish the English tales of wee folk from those of Scotland and Ireland . " In these medieval English stories , the fairies are depicted as " capricious , inconsistent in their attitude toward humankind , [ and ] finally unknowable " , characteristics which Clarke integrates into her own fairies . Clarke notes in an interview that she drew the idea of unpredictable , amoral fairies from the works of Neil Gaiman . 
 In an interview with Locus , Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of " Englishness " into Jonathan Strange : " I wanted to explore my ideas of the fantastic , as well as my ideas of England and my attachment to English landscape . ... Sometimes it feels to me as though we don 't have a fable of England , of Britain , something strong and idealized and romantic . I was picking up on things like Chesterton and Conan Doyle , and the sense ( which is also in Jane Austen ) of what it was to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place " . In particular , " it 's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent , and fundamentally very responsible about the rest of the world " , which connects Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke 's Jonathan Strange . 
 = = = Historical otherness = = = 
 Using techniques of the genre of alternative history , Clarke creates events and characters that would have been impossible in the early nineteenth century . She also explores the " silencing " of under @-@ represented groups : women , people of colour , and poor whites . Both Strange and Norrell suppress the voices of these groups in their rise to power . Mr Norrell , for example , attempts to buy up all the books of magic in England to keep anyone else from acquiring their knowledge . He also <unk> away half of Emma Wintertowne 's ( Lady Pole 's ) life for political influence , a deal about which , due to an enchantment , she cannot speak coherently . 
 Clarke explores the limits of " English " magic through the characters of Stephen Black and Vinculus . As Clarke explains , " If you put a fairy next to a person who is also outside English society ... suddenly the fact that there is this alien race seems more believable , because you 've got another alien and the two of them can talk about the English in this very natural way . " The gentleman with the thistle @-@ down hair sees Stephen as a noble savage and enslaves him — like Lady Pole , Stephen is silenced . Both " suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record " . Furthermore , the gentleman 's desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the English objectification of black slaves . Stephen vows to hate all white Englishmen after he discovers that they enslaved his mother , but when the gentleman shows him the hanging of the white Vinculus , he weeps . Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King , a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English . As Elizabeth <unk> explains , " The most English of all Englishmen , then , is both king and slave , in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black . This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot . When Strange and Norrell summon ' the nameless slave ' , the Raven King 's powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black , allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery . " In the end , it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women , people of colour , and poor whites defeat the antagonist . 
 = = Reception = = 
 To promote Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell , Bloomsbury — who also published the Harry Potter series — launched what The Observer called " one of the biggest marketing campaigns in publishing history " . Their campaign included plans for newspaper serialisations , book deliveries by horse and carriage , and the placement of " themed teasers " , such as period stationery and mock newspapers , in United States <unk> . 7 @,@ 500 advance readers ' copies were sent out , a limited number wrapped in paper and sealed with wax . These sold for more than US $ 100 each on eBay in England in the weeks leading up to publication . By 2005 , collectors were paying hundreds of pounds for signed copies of a limited edition of the novel . 
 The book debuted at No. 9 on the New York Times best @-@ seller list , rising to No. 3 two weeks later . It remained on the list for eleven weeks . Four weeks after the book 's initial publication , it was in Amazon 's top ten . Clarke went on a 20 @-@ city tour to promote the novel , after its near @-@ simultaneous publication in 20 countries . Endorsements from independent booksellers helped the book sell out its first printing ; by the end of September 2004 , it had gone through eight printings . 
 The novel met with " a crackle of favorable reviews in major papers " . The New Republic hailed it as " an exceptional work " , both " thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative " . The Houston Chronicle described Clarke as " a superb character writer " , and the Denver Post called her a " superb storyteller " . The reviews praised Clarke 's " deft " handling of the pastiche of styles , but many criticised the novel 's pace , The Guardian complaining that " the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace <unk> " . In his review for Science Fiction Weekly , Clute suggested that " almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed " ( emphasis in original ) since they do little to advance the story . He argued that , at times , Clarke 's Austenesque tone gets in the way of plot development . On the other hand , The Baltimore Sun found the novel " a quick read " . Complaining that the book leaves the reader " longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry " , The Washington Post reviewer noted , with others , that " sex plays virtually no role in the story ... [ and ] one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent " . The New Statesman reviewer , Amanda Craig , praised the novel as " a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen – or , perhaps , by the young Mrs Radcliffe , whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key . " However , she also criticised the book : " As fantasy , it is deplorable , given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales . What is so wonderful about magicians , wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers , but that they possess these in spite of being low @-@ born . Far from caring about being gentlemen , wizards are the ultimate expression of rank 's irrelevance to talent " . However , reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points . Maguire wrote in the New York Times : 
 What keeps this densely realised confection aloft is that very quality of reverence to the writers of the past . The chief character in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell isn 't , in fact , either of the magicians : it 's the library that they both adore , the books they consult and write and , in a sense , become . Clarke 's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes , to pay them homage and to add to the literature . 
 While promoting the novel , Neil Gaiman said that it was " unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last 70 years " , a statement which has most often been read hyperbolically . However , as Clute explains , what Gaiman meant was that Jonathan Strange is " the finest English novel of the fantastic since Hope Mirrlees 's great Lud @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Mist ( 1926 ) , which is almost certainly the finest English fantasy about the relationship between England and the fantastic yet published " ( emphasis in original ) . Clute writes that " a more cautious claim " would be : " if Susanna Clarke finishes the story she has hardly begun in Strange ... she may well have then written the finest English novel of the fantastic about the myth of England and the myth of the fantastic and the marriage of the two ever published , bar none of the above , including Mirrlees .

" Prebble interrupts the main text to read the footnotes , announcing them with the word footnote . According to the AudioFile review , the " narrative flow suffers " because of these interruptions and the reviewer recommends listening " with text in hand " .

 In 2004 , Clarke announced that she was working on a book that begins a few years after Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell ends . It is intended to centre on characters such as Childermass and Vinculus who , as Clarke says , are " a bit lower down the social scale " . 
 = Union Bank of Switzerland = 
 Union Bank of Switzerland ( UBS ) was a large integrated financial services company located in Switzerland . The bank , which at the time was the second largest bank in Switzerland , merged with Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998 , to become UBS to form what was then the largest bank in Europe and the second largest bank in the World . 
 UBS was formed in 1912 through the merger of the Bank in Winterthur and Toggenburger Bank , both founded in the early 1860s . UBS then continued to grow through acquisitions , including Aargauische Kreditanstalt in 1919 , Eidgenössische Bank in 1945 , Interhandel Basel in 1967 , Phillips & Drew in 1986 , and Schröder , Münchmeyer , Hengst & Co. in 1997 among others . 
 The historical UBS logo features a horizontal acronym " UBS " referring to the " Union Bank of Switzerland " , " Union de Banques Suisses " or " Unione di <unk> <unk> " . The vertical acronym " SBG " refers to the name of the bank in German " Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft " . " UBS " ceased to be considered a representational abbreviation for the Union Bank of Switzerland after the bank 's 1998 merger with Swiss Bank Corporation and is today considered a standalone brand . 
 = = 1980 – 1998 = = 
 By the 1980s , the bank had undertaken a major push into the securities business internationally . The bank established a position as a leading European underwriter of <unk> and pulled off a major coup in 1985 by pricing a large bond offering for Nestlé , Rockwell , IBM , and Mobil at below market rates . 
 The bank also made two major acquisitions in 1986 , first it purchased Phillips & Drew an established British brokerage and asset management firm , founded in 1895 . However , UBS initially had issues integrating Phillips & Drew . The firm lost £ 15 million when a rush of orders overwhelmed the firm ’ s settlement system in 1987 . Then the bank lost £ 48 million as a result of Philips & Drew positions in the October 1987 stock market crash . Between April 1987 and February 1988 , UBS was required to spend as much as £ 115 million to shore up Phillips & Drew . Phillips & Drew unit returned to profitability in 1992 after years of losses . UBS also expanded into West Germany , acquiring Deutsche Länderbank in 1986 . 
 In 1991 , UBS made its first acquisition in the United States , purchasing Chase Investors Management Corporation , the asset management business of Chase Manhattan Bank . Chase Investors , which was established in 1972 , was subsequently folded into UBS Asset Management after the acquisition . At the time of the acquisition , which resulted in approximately US $ 100 million for Chase , the business managed in excess of US $ 30 billion in public and private pension plans , as well as various financial assets of corporations , governments , foundations and endowments . 
 UBS also entered the life insurance business in 1993 establishing UBS Life . UBS formed a joint venture with Swiss Life in 1995 , known as UBS Swiss Life . UBS took a 25 % ownership position in Swiss Life in exchange for a 50 % share in the joint venture . 
 UBS entered the 1990s clearly the largest and most conservative of the three large Swiss Banks . Unlike Swiss Bank and Credit Suisse , which had both made aggressive international acquisitions in trading and investment banking , UBS ’ s investments had been more conservative in businesses such as asset management and life insurance while 60 % of the bank 's profits came from its even more conservative Swiss banking operations . In 1993 , Credit Suisse outbid UBS for Switzerland 's Swiss Volksbank , the fifth largest bank in Switzerland which had run into financial difficulties in the early 1990s . The acquisition propelled Credit Suisse ahead of UBS as the largest bank in Switzerland for the first time . UBS instead settled on a group of less audacious acquisitions , purchasing a group of smaller banks in Switzerland in 1994 and then acquiring the Cantonal Bank of Appenzell @-@ Ausserrhoden in 1996 . 
 In its final acquisition , prior to the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation , the bank acquired Schröder , Münchmeyer , Hengst & Co. from Lloyds TSB in 1997 in order to further penetrate the German investment banking market as well as the market for wealthy private clients . Schröder Münchmeyer Hengst was formed through the 1969 merger of three German banks : Schroeder Brothers & Co . , <unk> & Co. and Frederick Hengst & Co . ( formerly known as Bank Siegmund <unk> ) .

 During the mid @-@ 1990s , UBS came under fire from dissident shareholders , critical of bank 's relatively conservative management and lower return on equity . Martin Ebner , through his investment trust , BK Vision became the largest shareholder in UBS and attempted to force a major restructuring of the bank ’ s operations . The battles between Ebner and UBS management proved a distraction to the bank in the mid @-@ 1990s . Looking to take advantage of the situation , Credit Suisse approached UBS about a merger that would have created the second largest bank in the world in 1996 . UBS 's management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger . Ebner , who supported the idea of a merger , led a major shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of UBS 's chairman , Robert Studer . Studer 's successor Mathis Cabiallavetta would be one of the key architects of the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation . 
 On 8 December 1997 , Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation announced an all stock merger . At the time of the merger , Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation were the second and third largest banks in Switzerland , respectively both trailing Credit Suisse . Discussions between the two banks had begun several months earlier , less than a year after rebuffing Credit Suisse 's merger overtures . 
 The all @-@ stock merger resulted in the creation UBS AG , a huge new bank with total assets of more than US $ 590 billion . Also referred to as the " New UBS " to distinguish itself from the former Union Bank of Switzerland , the combined bank became the second largest in the world , at that time , behind only the Bank of Tokyo @-@ Mitsubishi . Additionally , the merger pulled together the banks ' various asset management businesses to create the world 's largest money manager , with approximately US $ 910 billion in assets under management . 
 The merger , which was billed as a merger of equals , resulted in UBS 's shareholders receiving 60 % of the combined company and Swiss Bank 's shareholders receiving the remaining 40 % of the bank 's common shares . UBS 's Mathis Cabiallavetta became chairman of the new bank while Swiss Bank 's Marcel Ospel was named chief executive officer . However , it quickly became evident that from a management perspective , it was Swiss Bank that was buying UBS as nearly 80 % of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals . Additionally , UBS professionals suffered more headcount reductions , particularly in the investment banking unit where there were heavy cuts in the corporate finance and equities businesses . The more severe cuts at UBS were an acknowledgment that prior to the merger Swiss Bank Corporation had built a global investment banking business , Warburg Dillon Read through its acquisitions of Dillon Read in New York and S.G. Warburg in London . Swiss Bank was generally considered to be further along than UBS in developing its international investment banking business , particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where Warburg Dillon Read was considered to be the more established platform . UBS , on the other hand had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in Switzerland and both banks had notably strong asset management capabilities . 
 After the merger was completed , it was widely speculated that a series of losses suffered by UBS on its equity derivative positions in late 1997 was a contributing factor in pushing UBS management to consummate the merger . It would become clear that the derivatives losses prompted UBS to accept the terms proposed by Swiss Bank more readily than they otherwise would have .

 Prior to its merger with Swiss Bank Corporation , UBS operated as a full @-@ service bank and a provider of wholesale financial services through its retail banking , commercial banking , investment banking , asset management and wealth management businesses . In 1997 , prior to its merger with Swiss Bank Corporation , UBS operated 275 branches in Switzerland and 82 branches , subsidiaries and representative offices outside Switzerland . The company had approximately 27 @,@ 611 employees , of which 19 @,@ 355 worked in Switzerland and the remaining 8 @,@ 256 employees were outside Switzerland . The bank had total assets of nearly <unk> billion and shareholders ' equity of nearly <unk> billion as of the end of 1997 .

 = = = Origins of the Union Bank of Switzerland = = = 
 In 1862 , The Bank in Winterthur was founded in Winterthur , Switzerland , with an initial share capital of <unk> million . The Bank in Winterthur operated primarily as a commercial bank , providing financing for a range of companies and projects . The bank would be involved in funding the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works , the hotel Baur au Lac in Zurich and many other companies . The bank capitalized on its location at an important Swiss railroad junction and its large warehousing facilities allowed the bank to take advantage of the dramatic rise in cotton prices caused by the American Civil War . The Bank in Winterthur saw its share capital double by the end of the war . 
 Meanwhile , in 1863 , the Toggenburger Bank was founded in <unk> , Switzerland with an initial share capital of <unk> million . The Toggenburger Bank was a savings and mortgage bank for individual customers with a branch office network in Eastern Switzerland . In 1882 , Toggenburger Bank opened a branch in St. Gallen in eastern Switzerland and began to shift its operations there through the end of the 19th century . 
 The Union Bank of Switzerland was formed in 1912 when the Bank in Winterthur merged with the Toggenburger Bank . The combined bank had total assets of <unk> million and a total shareholders ' equity of <unk> million . This combination was part of a larger trend toward concentration in the banking sector in Switzerland at the time . Through the next few years , the bank would begin to shift its operations to Zurich from its historical headquarters in the cities of Winterthur and St. Gallen , Switzerland . In 1917 , UBS completed construction of a new headquarters in Zurich on <unk> , considered to be the Wall Street of Switzerland . 
 The new bank used different names in its three core languages : German , French and English . In German , the bank was Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft and was known by the initials SBG . The original English name for the combined bank was the Swiss Banking Association , but it was later changed to Union Bank of Switzerland in 1921 to mirror the French form of the name : Union de Banques Suisses . The bank 's logo , introduced in 1966 , would later reflect both the German SBG and the English and French name UBS . 
 UBS acquired a number of banks in its first decade as a combined bank and expanded its branch network , establishing representation throughout Switzerland by 1923 . UBS acquired a controlling interest in Aargauische <unk> in 1913 and Banque Ch . Masson & Cie. in 1916 . Although the bank suffered during World War I and the postwar economic crises in Europe , UBS continued to make acquisitions after the conclusion of World War I. The bank purchased the remaining stake in Aargauische <unk> in 1919 that it had not acquired in 1913 . Also in 1919 , the bank acquired <unk> @-@ AG <unk> & Cie. in Fleurier and William <unk> & Cie . In 1920 , UBS acquired Banca Svizzera @-@ Americana with branches in Locarno and Lugano ; Unionbank Geneva and Banque Henry <unk> & Cie . , based in La Chaux @-@ de @-@ Fonds . Three years later , in 1923 , UBS acquired the Schweizerische <unk> in Bern establishing representation in the last of the major cities in Switzerland . 
 Through the Great Depression , UBS pared its assets considerably shrinking from <unk> million in 1929 to <unk> million at the end of 1935 . The bank saw its shareholders ' capital decline from <unk> million in 1929 to <unk> million in 1933 and then further to <unk> million by 1936 . However , the bank continued to acquire smaller , weaker competitors , purchasing Banca Unione di <unk> in Lugano and Chiasso in 1935 followed by Berner Handelsbank in Bern in 1938 . In 1937 , UBS established Intrag AG , an asset management business responsible for investment trusts ( i.e. , mutual funds ) and set up the " America @-@ Canada Trust Fund <unk> " . Over the years , Intrag would set up a series of other funds , including the " Mutual Fund for Swiss Stocks <unk> " and the " South Africa Trust Fund <unk> " . 
 The Bank in Winterthur and the Toggenburger Bank merge to form the Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft . Its French name is Union de Banques Suisses ( UBS ) and its Italian name is Unione di <unk> <unk> ( UBS ) . The English name of the bank at first is Swiss Banking Association . In 1921 that somewhat inappropriate name is changed into Union Bank of Switzerland ( UBS ) . 
 The merged bank shows the following figures for 1912 : Total assets : <unk> million . Shareholders ' Equity : <unk> million . Profit : <unk> million . 
 Dr. Rudolf Ernst ( 1865 – 1956 ) 
 First Chairman of the Board of Directors of the merged bank from 1912 until 1941 is Rudolf Ernst , of Winterthur , until 1921 alternating with C. Emil Grob @-@ Halter of <unk> . 
 After the merger of the Bank in Winterthur and the Toggenburger Bank to form Union Bank of Switzerland ( UBS ) , Dr. Rudolf Ernst became the merged bank 's first chairman in 1912 . Following his resignation in 1941 , he was elected as an Honorary chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland . 
 Rudolf Ernst joined the Bank in Winterthur in 1895 . He was also financial director of the City of Winterthur for 16 years . At the young age of 36 , he was elected in 1901 to the Board of Directors of the Bank in Winterthur and as its chairman at the same time . During his chairmanship , the bank changed its focus from its original lending business and began to expand its issuing and asset management franchise . With the acquisition of the Bank in Baden in 1906 , the bank gained a branch in Zurich and a seat on the stock exchange , one of the cornerstones for the successful merger in 1912 with the Toggenburger Bank to form Union Bank of Switzerland . Rudolf Ernst also held directorships on the boards of various industrial and insurance companies . Between 1912 and his retirement in 1941 , he was chairman of the Board of Union Bank of Switzerland , in an alternating capacity with Carl Emil Grob @-@ Halter , who held the chairmanship in 1916 and 1918 as the representative of the merger partner Toggenburger Bank . 
 = = = Activities in World War II = = = 
 On the eve of World War II , UBS was the recipient of a large influx of foreign funds for safekeeping . During the war , the bank 's traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became their largest clients . Still , unlike many of its peers , UBS 's business lagged through much of the war . 
 Decades after the war , it was demonstrated that Union Bank of Switzerland likely took active roles in trading stolen gold , securities and other assets during World War II . The issue of " unclaimed property " of Holocaust victims became a major issue for UBS in the mid @-@ 1990s and a series of revelations in 1997 brought the issue to the forefront of national attention in 1996 and 1997 . UBS confirmed that a large number of accounts that had gone unclaimed as a result of the bank 's policy of requiring death certificates from family members to claim the contents of the account . UBS 's handling of these revelations were largely criticized and the bank received significant negative attention in the U.S. UBS came under significant pressure , particularly from American politicians , to compensate Holocaust survivors who were making claims against the bank . 
 In January 1997 , Christoph Meili , a night watchman at the Union Bank of Switzerland , found employees shredding archives compiled by a subsidiary that had extensive dealings with Nazi Germany . The shredding was in direct violation of a recent Swiss law adopted in December 1996 protecting such material . UBS acknowledged that it had " made a deplorable mistake " , but an internal historian maintained that the destroyed archives were unrelated to the Holocaust . Criminal proceedings then began against the archivist for possible violation of a recent Federal Document Destruction decree and against Meili for possible violation of bank secrecy , which is a criminal offence in Switzerland . Both proceedings were discontinued by the District Attorney in September 1997 . 
 Meili was suspended from his job at the security company that served UBS , following a criminal investigation . Meili and his family left Switzerland for the United States where they were granted political asylum . By contrast , in the U.S. , Meili was largely regarded as a hero and whistleblower and received a particularly warm reception from the American Jewish community . 
 In 1997 , the World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks ( WJC ) was launched to retrieve deposits made by victims of Nazi persecution during and prior to World War II . Negotiations involving Union Bank of Switzerland , Credit Suisse , the WJC and Stuart Eizenstat , on behalf of the U.S. , ultimately resulted in a settlement of US $ 1 @.@ 25 billion in August 1998 . The settlement , which coincided with UBS 's merger with Swiss Bank , together with the bank 's embarrassment in the Long Term Capital Management collapse in 1998 brought a degree of closure to the issue . 
 = = = 1945 – 1979 = = = 
 Shortly after the end of World War II , UBS completed the acquisition of Eidgenössische Bank , a large Zurich @-@ based bank that became insolvent . As a result of the merger , UBS exceeded CHF1 billion of assets for the first time and completed the transition of its operations to Zurich . Although UBS opened an office in New York in 1946 , the bank remained primarily focused on its domestic business . Prior to the end of World War II , the Swiss banking landscape was dominated by Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse . UBS was among the next group of large banks that included Schweizerische Volksbank ( Swiss Volksbank or Swiss Popular Bank ) and Bank Leu . Throughout the 1950s and 1960s , the Union Bank of Switzerland , which was at best the third largest bank in Switzerland would catch up to its larger peers and by the 1970s surpass them in terms of size . 
 UBS opened branches and acquired a series of banks in Switzerland growing from 31 offices in 1950 to 81 offices by the beginning of the 1960s . Throughout the 1950s , UBS was the most acquisitive bank in Switzerland , acquiring Banque <unk> & Cie . ( 1948 ) , Volksbank Interlaken ( 1952 ) , <unk> , <unk> & Cie ( 1954 ) , Banque <unk> fils & Cie . ( 1956 ) , Banque de Sion ( 1956 ) , Banque de <unk> ( 1957 ) , the Crédit <unk> ( 1957 ) , Crédit <unk> ( 1957 ) , Bank <unk> AG ( 1960 ) and Volksbank in <unk> ( 1960 ) . 
 In addition to these bank acquisitions , UBS also acquired an 80 % stake in Argor SA , a Swiss precious metal refinery founded in 1951 , through whom they started to issue UBS branded gold bars . In 1973 , the bank increased the stake to full 100 % ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of the refinery changing to <unk> & Management . Nevertheless , UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor @-@ Heraeus which is famous for the unique <unk> holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting . 
 By 1962 , UBS reached <unk> billion of assets , narrowly edging ahead of Swiss Bank Corporation to become the largest bank in Switzerland temporarily . Through 1979 , SBC was consistently the largest of the three major Swiss banks by assets , except for short periods in 1962 and then again in 1968 when UBS temporarily moved ahead of SBC . After 1979 , UBS would firmly establish itself as the largest Swiss bank . UBS would retain this position for the next 15 years until Credit Suisse leapfrogged into the top spot following its 1993 acquisition of Schweizerische Volksbank ( Swiss Volksbank ) and later Winterthur Group . 
 UBS continued its rapid growth in the 1960s punctuated by the acquisition of Interhandel ( <unk> und <unk> AG ) in 1967 . Interhandel , originally , was a large Swiss conglomerate that up until the 1960s had both financial as well as industrial holdings . Interhandel was the corporate successor of I.G. Chemie , which the U.S. government had claimed was a front for Germany 's I.G. Farben during World War II . During the war , the U.S. government seized General Aniline & Film ( later GAF Corporation ) , an Interhandel subsidiary , and it was not until 1963 that the long @-@ running dispute between Interhandel and the U.S. government was resolved . The shares in GAF Corporation were sold in a highly competitive auction in 1965 and the proceeds were split between Interhandel and the U.S. government . As a result of the sale of GAF , at the time of its merger with UBS , Interhandel held substantial amounts of cash . The addition of the Interhandel capital , which propelled UBS into the top spot among Swiss banks in 1968 , also made UBS one of the strongest banks in Europe and helped fuel the bank ’ s further expansion in the late 1960s and 1970s . UBS consolidated four affiliated mortgage lenders and assumed their domestic retail operations . The bank further expanded into consumer lending through the acquisition of a series of Swiss financial businesses in 1969 , including Banque Orca , <unk> Bank Bern , <unk> Bank and <unk> Bank . 
 UBS also began to intensify its overseas expansion . In 1967 , UBS opened a full branch office in London , its first such office outside Switzerland . Prior to this , UBS had operated through a series of correspondent banks and representative offices . Three years later , UBS opened a branch office in New York . The bank also established a UK subsidiary in 1975 and a U.S. subsidiary in 1979 to focus on building the bank ’ s presence in the underwriting of debt and equity securities . Nevertheless , UBS , which had traditionally concentrated its efforts on the domestic Swiss market , was the last of the three largest Swiss banks to establish a branch office in the U.S. and its securities operations were overshadowed by those of its two Swiss peers . 
 = = = 1980 – 1998 = = = 
 By the 1980s , the bank had undertaken a major push into the securities business internationally . The bank established a position as a leading European underwriter of <unk> and pulled off a major coup in 1985 by pricing a large bond offering for Nestlé , Rockwell , IBM , and Mobil at below market rates . 
 The bank also made two major acquisitions in 1986 , first it purchased Phillips & Drew an established British brokerage and asset management firm , founded in 1895 . However , UBS initially had issues integrating Phillips & Drew . The firm lost £ 15 million when a rush of orders overwhelmed the firm ’ s settlement system in 1987 . Then the bank lost £ 48 million as a result of Philips & Drew positions in the October 1987 stock market crash . Between April 1987 and February 1988 , UBS was required to spend as much as £ 115 million to shore up Phillips & Drew . Phillips & Drew unit returned to profitability in 1992 after years of losses . UBS also expanded into West Germany , acquiring Deutsche Länderbank in 1986 . 
 In 1991 , UBS made its first acquisition in the United States , purchasing Chase Investors Management Corporation , the asset management business of Chase Manhattan Bank . Chase Investors , which was established in 1972 , was subsequently folded into UBS Asset Management after the acquisition . At the time of the acquisition , which resulted in approximately US $ 100 million for Chase , the business managed in excess of US $ 30 billion in public and private pension plans , as well as various financial assets of corporations , governments , foundations and endowments . 
 UBS also entered the life insurance business in 1993 establishing UBS Life . UBS formed a joint venture with Swiss Life in 1995 , known as UBS Swiss Life . UBS took a 25 % ownership position in Swiss Life in exchange for a 50 % share in the joint venture . 
 UBS entered the 1990s clearly the largest and most conservative of the three large Swiss Banks . Unlike Swiss Bank and Credit Suisse , which had both made aggressive international acquisitions in trading and investment banking , UBS ’ s investments had been more conservative in businesses such as asset management and life insurance while 60 % of the bank 's profits came from its even more conservative Swiss banking operations . In 1993 , Credit Suisse outbid UBS for Switzerland 's Swiss Volksbank , the fifth largest bank in Switzerland which had run into financial difficulties in the early 1990s . The acquisition propelled Credit Suisse ahead of UBS as the largest bank in Switzerland for the first time . UBS instead settled on a group of less audacious acquisitions , purchasing a group of smaller banks in Switzerland in 1994 and then acquiring the Cantonal Bank of Appenzell @-@ Ausserrhoden in 1996 . 
 In its final acquisition , prior to the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation , the bank acquired Schröder , Münchmeyer , Hengst & Co. from Lloyds TSB in 1997 in order to further penetrate the German investment banking market as well as the market for wealthy private clients . Schröder Münchmeyer Hengst was formed through the 1969 merger of three German banks : Schroeder Brothers & Co . , <unk> & Co. and Frederick Hengst & Co . ( formerly known as Bank Siegmund <unk> ) .

 During the mid @-@ 1990s , UBS came under fire from dissident shareholders , critical of bank 's relatively conservative management and lower return on equity . Martin Ebner , through his investment trust , BK Vision became the largest shareholder in UBS and attempted to force a major restructuring of the bank ’ s operations . The battles between Ebner and UBS management proved a distraction to the bank in the mid @-@ 1990s . Looking to take advantage of the situation , Credit Suisse approached UBS about a merger that would have created the second largest bank in the world in 1996 . UBS 's management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger . Ebner , who supported the idea of a merger , led a major shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of UBS 's chairman , Robert Studer . Studer 's successor Mathis Cabiallavetta would be one of the key architects of the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation . 
 On 8 December 1997 , Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation announced an all stock merger . At the time of the merger , Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation were the second and third largest banks in Switzerland , respectively both trailing Credit Suisse . Discussions between the two banks had begun several months earlier , less than a year after rebuffing Credit Suisse 's merger overtures . 
 The all @-@ stock merger resulted in the creation UBS AG , a huge new bank with total assets of more than US $ 590 billion . Also referred to as the " New UBS " to distinguish itself from the former Union Bank of Switzerland , the combined bank became the second largest in the world , at that time , behind only the Bank of Tokyo @-@ Mitsubishi . Additionally , the merger pulled together the banks ' various asset management businesses to create the world 's largest money manager , with approximately US $ 910 billion in assets under management . 
 The merger , which was billed as a merger of equals , resulted in UBS 's shareholders receiving 60 % of the combined company and Swiss Bank 's shareholders receiving the remaining 40 % of the bank 's common shares . UBS 's Mathis Cabiallavetta became chairman of the new bank while Swiss Bank 's Marcel Ospel was named chief executive officer . However , it quickly became evident that from a management perspective , it was Swiss Bank that was buying UBS as nearly 80 % of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals . Additionally , UBS professionals suffered more headcount reductions , particularly in the investment banking unit where there were heavy cuts in the corporate finance and equities businesses . The more severe cuts at UBS were an acknowledgment that prior to the merger Swiss Bank Corporation had built a global investment banking business , Warburg Dillon Read through its acquisitions of Dillon Read in New York and S.G. Warburg in London . Swiss Bank was generally considered to be further along than UBS in developing its international investment banking business , particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where Warburg Dillon Read was considered to be the more established platform . UBS , on the other hand had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in Switzerland and both banks had notably strong asset management capabilities . 
 After the merger was completed , it was widely speculated that a series of losses suffered by UBS on its equity derivative positions in late 1997 was a contributing factor in pushing UBS management to consummate the merger . It would become clear that the derivatives losses prompted UBS to accept the terms proposed by Swiss Bank more readily than they otherwise would have .

 Union Bank of Switzerland , suffering criticism of its conservative business model , was looking for ways to catch up to its key Swiss rivals and viewed LTCM as the type of client that could help accelerate the bank 's growth . In 1997 , UBS entered into a financing arrangement with LTCM and the hedge fund quickly became the bank 's largest client , generating US $ 15 million in fees for UBS . Union Bank of Switzerland sold LTCM a 7 @-@ year European call option on 1 million shares in LTCM , then valued at about US $ 800 million . It hedged this option by purchasing a US $ 800 million interest in LTCM and invested a further US $ 300 million in the hedge fund . Following the merger , Swiss Bank managers were surprised to discover the massive exposure to LTCM at UBS . Ultimately , UBS was unable to sell or hedge its interest in LTCM as its value declined in the summer of 1998 . 
 By November 1998 , UBS 's losses from its exposure to LTCM were estimated at approximately <unk> million . UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse , ultimately writing off <unk> million . The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US $ 3 @.@ 625 billion by the hedge fund 's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets . UBS contributed US $ 300 million to the bailout effort , which would largely be recovered . In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse , Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS along with three other executives .

 Ginga Legend Weed was featured on Jason Thompson 's House of 1000 Manga segment on Anime News Network . He praised the series for its story and took note of the " flavor " of having a combination of physically realistic dogs , " shōnen tropes " , the dogs ' knowledge of the human world ( such as job occupations and dog breeds ) , and dog behavior involving honor , loyalty , honorifics , and auras . However , Thompson noted that the " noble melodrama sometimes gets to be a little much " , and felt that several characters , with the exception of Weed , began " to blur together " due to the difficulty of drawing a very large cast of dogs . Additionally , he commented that the fights weren 't visually " exciting " , as dogs are " lacking prehensile arms " . Overall , Thompson felt that the series was unique , stating that " no one else [ is ] making manga quite like this . " In a later installment of House of 1000 Manga , Thompson expressed his preference for Takahashi 's original work , Ginga : Nagareboshi Gin , stating that it felt " more exciting and natural " than its " stiffer and more pompous " sequel .

 = Manuel Alberti = 
 Manuel <unk> Alberti ( 28 May 1763 – 31 January 1811 ) was a priest from Buenos Aires , when the city was part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata . He had a curacy at Maldonado , Uruguay during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata , and returned to Buenos Aires in time to take part in the May Revolution of 1810 . He was chosen as one of the seven members of the Primera Junta , which is considered the first national government of Argentina . He supported most of the proposals of Mariano Moreno and worked at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper . The internal disputes of the Junta had a negative effect on his health , and he died of a heart attack in 1811 .

 = = = Colonial times = = = 
 Manuel Alberti was born in Buenos Aires on 28 May 1763 to Antonio Alberti and Juana Agustina Marín . He was baptized on the following 1 June at the Concepción parish ; his godparents were Juan Javier Dogan and Isabel de Soria y Santa Cruz . He had three brothers , Isidoro , Manuel Silvestre and Félix , and three sisters , <unk> , Juana María and María Clotilde . The Alberti family became benefactor of the House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires by donating them a land plot so it could move its headquarters . 
 He made his first studies at the Real Colegio de San Carlos in February 1777 , graduating in philosophy , logic , physics and metaphysics . He studied with Hipólito Vieytes , and ended his secondary education on 17 February 1779 . He moved to Córdoba the following year , to get university studies of theology at the National University of Córdoba . Despite a brief return to Buenos Aires during his second year because of health problems , he could finish all the syllabus . He got his doctorate in theology and physics on 16 July 1785 . He got his degree at the Church of the Company from interim provost Fray Pedro Gaitán . 
 He received the presbyterate in the first months of 1786 , and was appointed for the Concepción parish , the same one where he was baptized . He also worked at the aforementioned House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires . He got the curacy of Magdalena on 12 September 1790 , but resigned a year later because of health problems . He returned in 1793 , and resigned definitively on 21 February 1794 . After this , he moved to Maldonado . There are few historical records of his activities in those <unk> . 
 The territory fell briefly under British rule during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata . There was looting after the failed resistance , and Alberti hid all the valuable things from the half @-@ built parish . In defiance of the new British rule , Alberti gave medical aid to the Spanish soldiers and Catholic burials to the deceased , and mailed the Spanish forces with details about the British troops located in the city . As a result , he was jailed . He was released by the British Juan Jaime Backhouse in order to restore religious practices ( the invaders did not attempt to enforce Protestantism in the population ) , but under military escort . The British would be defeated by Santiago de Liniers , and driven away from the viceroyalty . 
 = = = Primera Junta = = = 
 He returned to Buenos Aires in 1808 , and got the curacy of San Benito de Palermo . This was supposed to be a new jurisdiction split from the one of San Nicolás de Bari , but such change was never enforced , so he was actually in charge of both . He became involved with politics as well , joining the groups of Miguel de Azcuénaga and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña . Those groups sought to generate great political and social changes , and would lead to the May Revolution . He was selected to take part in the open cabildo celebrated on 22 May to decide the fate of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros , as well as other twenty @-@ seven ecclesiastics . He was among the nineteen that voted for the removal of the viceroy , supporting the proposal of Cornelio Saavedra . He also supported Juan Nepomuceno Solá and Ramón Vieytes , who proposed the calling of deputies from the other cities of the viceroyalty . 
 His brother Manuel Silvestre Alberti signed the popular petition formulated on 25 May that aimed to draft the composition of the Primera Junta that would replace Cisneros in power . On that day Alberti moved to Azcuénaga 's house and from it he observed the events in the plaza , along with many other patriots gathered there . He was there when he came to know that he was chosen as a member of the new Junta . The reasons of Alberti 's inclusion in the Junta are unclear , as with all its members . A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists , and Alberti in particular may have been elected to serve as chaplain of the government . 
 In the Junta , Alberti was aligned with most of the reformist proposals of Mariano Moreno , as well as Juan Larrea and Juan José Castelli . He signed most of the rulings that shaped the new political system , such as those related to popular sovereignty , representative and republican principles , separation of powers , publicity of the government actions , freedom of speech and the bases of political federalism . However , he did not support the actions of the Junta that contradicted his religious formation , regardless of the context . He refused to sign the death penalty for Santiago de Liniers , captured after the defeat of his counter @-@ revolution . He signed the harsh commands given to Castelli for the first Upper Peru campaign , but noticing next to his signature that he made an exception with the articles involving capital punishment . He was also concerned by the role of the church in the new political system and headed a dispute against the Cabildo about it . He considered that the Cabildo should not have any authority over the Junta in ecclesiastic topics , to prevent the former abuses of the absolutist governments . 
 Manuel Alberti worked in journalism as well , at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper created by the Junta . The ruling that created this newspaper gave Alberti the duty of selecting the news reports to publish . This duty was exclusive of Alberti and not shared with the other members of the Junta . Some historians also consider that Alberti may be the real author of the newspaper 's editorials , as they were not signed and the style is not similar to other reports by Mariano Moreno , who is usually considered the author . 
 The first conflict between Alberti and Moreno was caused by the arrival of Gregorio Funes , dean of Córdoba with similar ideas to those of Cornelio Saavedra , president of the Junta . Moreno was keeping an internal dispute with Saavedra , and expected Alberti to write against Funes . He did not , and Moreno made harsh comments about it . Alberti would be further distanced from Moreno when the Junta voted for the incorporation of the deputies from other cities into the Junta . At first , both of them opposed the proposal , but Alberti ultimately voted accepting it , stating that he did so just out of political convenience . The Primera Junta was thus turned into the Junta Grande . Mariano Moreno , left in a minority group , resigned . 
 The inclusion of new deputies increased disputes within the Junta . He opposed both Saavedra and Funes , albeit in a more moderate manner than Moreno . Those fights affected his health , and he had a mild heart attack on 28 January 1811 . Fearing for his life , he wrote his will and received the Anointing of the Sick . Three days later he had another strong disagreement with Funes , and had another heart attack when he was returning to his house . He was buried in the cemetery of San Nicolás de Bari , as requested in his will . The death certificate states that he hadn 't been given last rites because his unanticipated death did not allow for time . Alberti was the first member of the Primera Junta to die . 
 = = Commemoration = = 
 All members of the Junta Grande assisted to Alberti 's funeral , even his political enemy Gregorio Funes . Domingo Matheu was the most affected one by his death , to the point of crying for it . Alberti was replaced in the Junta by Nicolás Rodríguez Peña , a decided <unk> . Saavedra and Funes did not like him , but with the social commotion generated by Alberti 's death , they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination . 
 Alberti requested in his will to avoid pageantry or complex funerals , and inherited his properties ( house , farm , furniture , slaves , clothing , books , etc . ) to his siblings Juana María , Matilde , <unk> and Manuel Silvestre . His personal diaries are kept , but with some parts of them being lost due to poor keeping . Still , his personal bibliography is used by historians to reconstruct his influences and ideological background . It included many works of theology , studies of the Bible , scholastic <unk> and juridical studies . Alberti 's remains were lost when the chapel was demolished to make way for an expansion of 9 de Julio Avenue . 
 The government of Buenos Aires name a street in his honor in 1822 . In 1910 , during the Argentina Centennial , a statue of him was erected in Barrancas de Belgrano , a neighborhood at the north of Buenos Aires . The district of Manuel Alberti , in Buenos Aires Province , is also named after him . 
 = Horses in the Middle Ages = 
 Horses in the Middle Ages differed in size , build and breed from the modern horse , and were , on average , smaller . They were also more central to society than their modern counterparts , being essential for war , agriculture , and transport . 
 Consequently , specific types of horse developed , many of which have no modern equivalent . While an understanding of modern horse breeds and equestrianism is vital for any analysis of the medieval horse , researchers also need to consider documentary ( both written and pictorial ) and archaeological evidence . 
 Horses in the Middle Ages were rarely differentiated by breed , but rather by use . This led them to be described , for example , as " chargers " ( war horses ) , " palfreys " ( riding horses ) , cart horses or packhorses . Reference is also given to their place of origin , such as " Spanish horses , " but whether this referred to one breed or several is unknown . Another difficulty arising during any study of medieval documents or literature is the flexibility of the medieval languages , where several words can be used for one thing ( or , conversely , several objects are referred to by one word ) . Words such as ' courser ' and ' charger ' are used interchangeably ( even within one document ) , and where one epic may speak disparagingly of a rouncey , another praises its skill and swiftness . 
 Significant technological advances in equestrian equipment , often introduced from other cultures , allowed for significant changes in both warfare and agriculture . In particular , improved designs for the solid @-@ treed saddle as well as the arrival of the stirrup , horseshoe and horse collar were significant advances in medieval society . 
 Consequently , the assumptions and theories developed by historians are not definitive , and debate still rages on many issues , such as the breeding or size of the horse , and a number of sources must be consulted in order to understand the breadth of the subject . 
 = = Breeding = = 
 During the decline of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages , much of the quality breeding stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries . In the west , this may have been due in part to the reliance of the British and Scandinavians on infantry @-@ based warfare , where horses were only used for riding and pursuit . 
 However , there were exceptions ; in the 7th century a Merovingian kingdom still retained at least one active Roman horse breeding centre . The Spanish also retained many quality horses , in part due to the historic reputation of the region as a horse @-@ breeding land , and partially due to the cultural influences related to the Islamic conquest of the Iberian peninsula between the 8th and 15th centuries . 
 The origins of the medieval war horse are obscure , although it is believed they had some Barb and Arabian blood through the Spanish Jennet , a forerunner to the modern Friesian and Andalusian horse . It is also possible that other sources of oriental bloodstock came from what was called the <unk> breed ( possibly akin to the Turkoman horse ) from Iran and Anatolia , another type of oriental horse brought back from the Crusades . " Spanish " horses , whatever their breeding , were the most expensive . In fact , in Germany the word <unk> became the term for quality war horses . However , German literary sources also refer to fine horses from Scandinavia . France also produced good war horses . Some scholars attribute this to the strong Feudal society there , but an equally probable explanation is the historic influence of the Roman horse breeding traditions preserved by the Merovingians , combined with the addition of valuable Spanish and oriental bloodstock captured in the wake of the victory of Charles Martel over the Islamic Umayyad invaders at the Battle of Tours in 732 . Following this battle , the Carolingians began to increase their heavy cavalry , which resulted in the seizure of land ( for fodder production ) , and a change in tribute payment from cattle to horses . 
 As the importance of horse breeding to successful warfare was realized , planned breeding programs increased . Many changes were due to the influence of Islamic culture through both the Crusades and the Moorish invasions of Spain ; the Arabs kept extensive pedigrees of their Barb and Arabian horses via an oral tradition . Some of the earliest written pedigrees in recorded European history were kept by Carthusian monks , who were among those who bred the Spanish Jennet . Because they could read and write , thus kept careful records , monastics were given the responsibility for horse breeding by certain members of the nobility , particularly in Spain . In England , a common source of warhorses were the wild moorland ponies , which were rounded up annually by horse @-@ breeders , including the Cistercians , for use as campaign riding horses , or light cavalry ; one such breed was the Fell pony , which had similar ancestry to the Friesian horse . 
 It is also hard to trace what happened to the bloodlines of destriers when this type seems to disappear from record during the 17th century . Many modern draft breeds claim some link to the medieval " great horse , " with some historians considering breeds such as the Percheron , Belgian and Suffolk Punch likely descendants of the destrier . However , other historians discount this theory , since the historical record suggests the medieval warhorse was quite a different ' type ' to the modern draught horse Such a theory would suggest the war horses were crossed once again with " cold blooded " work horses , since war horses , and the destrier in particular , were renowned for their hot @-@ blooded nature . 
 = = = Types of horse = = = 
 Throughout the period , horses were rarely considered breeds , but instead were defined by type : by describing their purpose or their physical attributes . Many of the definitions were not precise , or were interchangeable . Prior to approximately the 13th century , few pedigrees were written down . Thus , many terms for horses in the Middle Ages did not refer to breeds as we know them today , but rather described appearance or purpose . 
 One of the best @-@ known of the medieval horses was the destrier , renowned and admired for its capabilities in war . It was well trained , and was required to be strong , fast and agile . A 14th @-@ century writer described them as " tall and majestic and with great strength " . In contemporary sources , the destrier was frequently referred to as the " great horse " because of its size and reputation . Being a subjective term , it gives no firm information about its actual height or weight , but since the average horse of the time was 12 to 14 hands ( 48 to 56 inches , 122 to 142 cm ) , thus a " great horse " by medieval standards might appear small to our modern eyes . The destrier was highly prized by knights and men @-@ at @-@ arms , but was actually not very common , and appears to have been most suited to the joust . 
 <unk> were generally preferred for hard battle as they were light , fast and strong . They were valuable , but not as costly as the destrier . They were also used frequently for hunting . 
 A more general @-@ purpose horse was the rouncey ( also <unk> ) , which could be kept as a riding horse or trained for war . It was commonly used by squires , men @-@ at @-@ arms or poorer knights . A wealthy knight would keep rounceys for his retinue . Sometimes the expected nature of warfare dictated the choice of horse ; when a summons to war was sent out in England , in 1327 , it expressly requested rounceys , for swift pursuit , rather than destriers . <unk> were sometimes used as pack horses ( but never as cart horses ) . 
 The well @-@ bred palfrey , which could equal a destrier in price , was popular with nobles and highly ranked knights for riding , hunting and ceremonial use . <unk> was a desirable trait in a palfrey , as the smooth gait allowed the rider to cover long distances quickly in relative comfort . Other horse types included the jennet , a small horse first bred in Spain from Barb and Arabian bloodstock . Their quiet and dependable nature , as well as size , made them popular as riding horses for ladies ; however , they were also used as cavalry horses by the Spanish . 
 The hobby was a lightweight horse , about 13 to 14 hands ( 52 to 56 inches , 132 to 142 cm ) , developed in Ireland from Spanish or Libyan ( Barb ) bloodstock . This type of quick and agile horse was popular for skirmishing , and was often ridden by light cavalry known as <unk> . Hobbies were used successfully by both sides during the Wars of Scottish Independence , with Edward I of England trying to gain advantage by preventing Irish exports of the horses to Scotland . Robert Bruce employed the hobby for his guerilla warfare and mounted raids , covering 60 to 70 miles ( 97 to 113 km ) a day . 
 = = Horses in warfare = = 
 . 
 While light cavalry had been used in warfare for many centuries , the medieval era saw the rise of heavy cavalry , particularly the European knight . Historians are uncertain when the use of heavy cavalry in the form of mounted shock troops first occurred , but the technique had become widespread by the mid @-@ 12th century . The heavy cavalry charge itself was not a common occurrence in warfare . Pitched battles were avoided if at all possible , with most offensive warfare in the early Middle Ages taking the form of sieges , or swift mounted raids called chevauchées , with the warriors lightly armed on swift horses and their heavy war horses safely in the stable . Pitched battles were sometimes unavoidable , but were rarely fought on land suitable for heavy cavalry . While mounted riders remained effective for initial attacks , by the 14th century , it was common for knights to dismount to fight . Horses were sent to the rear , and kept ready for pursuit . By the Late Middle Ages ( approx 1300 @-@ 1550 ) , large battles became more common , probably because of the success of infantry tactics and changes in weaponry . However , because such tactics left the knight unmounted , the role of the war horse also changed . By the 17th century , the medieval charger had become a thing of the past , replaced by lighter , unarmoured horses . Throughout the period , light horse , or prickers , were used for scouting and reconnaissance ; they also provided a defensive screen for marching armies . Large teams of draught horses , or oxen , were used for pulling the heavy early cannon . Other horses pulled wagons and carried supplies for the armies . 
 = = = Tournaments = = = 
 Tournaments and hastiludes began in the 11th century as both a sport and to provide training for battle . Usually taking the form of a melee , the participants used the horses , armour and weapons of war . The sport of jousting grew out of the tournament and , by the 15th century , the art of tilting became quite sophisticated . In the process , the pageantry and specialization became less war @-@ like , perhaps because of the knight 's changing role in war . 
 Horses were specially bred for the joust , and heavier armour developed . However , this did not necessarily lead to significantly larger horses . Interpreters at the Royal Armouries , Leeds , re @-@ created the joust , using specially bred horses and replica armour . Their horses accurately represented the medieval mount , being compactly built and not particularly tall . 
 = = = Types of war horses = = = 
 The most well @-@ known horse of the medieval era of Europe is the destrier , known for carrying knights into war . However , most knights and mounted men @-@ at @-@ arms rode smaller horses known as coursers and rounceys . ( A common generic name for medieval war horses was charger , which was interchangeable with the other terms ) . In Spain , the jennet was used as a light cavalry horse . 
 Stallions were often used as war horses in Europe due to their natural aggression and hot @-@ blooded tendencies . A 13th @-@ century work describes destriers " biting and kicking " on the battlefield , and , in the heat of battle , war horses were often seen fighting each other . However , the use of mares by European warriors cannot be discounted from literary references . Mares were the preferred war horse of the Moors , Islamic invaders who attacked various European nations from AD 700 through the 15th century . They also were preferred by the Mongols . 
 War horses were more expensive than normal riding horses , and destriers the most prized , but figures vary greatly from source to source . <unk> are given a values ranging from seven times the price of an ordinary horse to 700 times . The Bohemian king Wenzel II rode a horse " valued at one thousand marks " in 1298 . At the other extreme , a 1265 French ordinance ruled that a squire could not spend more than twenty marks on a rouncey . Knights were expected to have at least one war horse ( as well as riding horses and packhorses ) , with some records from the later Middle Ages showing knights bringing twenty @-@ four horses on campaign . Five horses was perhaps the standard . 
 = = = Size of war horses = = = 
 There is dispute in medievalist circles over the size of the war horse , with some notable historians claiming a size of 17 to 18 hands ( 68 to 72 inches , 173 to 183 cm ) , as large as a modern Shire horse . However , there are practical reasons for dispute over size . Analysis of existing horse armour located in the Royal Armouries indicates the equipment was originally worn by horses of 15 to 16 hands ( 60 to 64 inches , 152 to 163 cm ) , or about the size and build of a modern field hunter or ordinary riding horse . Research undertaken at the Museum of London , using literary , pictorial and archaeological sources , supports military horses of 14 to 15 hands ( 56 to 60 inches , 142 to 152 cm ) , distinguished from a riding horse by its strength and skill , rather than its size . This average does not seem to vary greatly across the medieval period . Horses appear to have been selectively bred for increased size from the 9th and 10th centuries , and by the 11th century the average warhorse was probably 14 @.@ 2 to 15 hands ( 58 to 60 inches , 147 to 152 cm ) , a size verified by studies of Norman horseshoes as well as the depictions of horses on the Bayeux Tapestry . Analysis of horse transports suggests 13th @-@ century destriers were a stocky build , and no more than 15 to 15 @.@ 2 hands ( 60 to 62 inches , 152 to 157 cm ) . Three centuries later , warhorses were not significantly bigger ; the Royal Armouries used a 15 @.@ 2 hands ( 62 inches , 157 cm ) Lithuanian Heavy Draught mare as a model for the statues displaying various 15th- and 16th @-@ century horse armours , as her body shape was an excellent fit . 
 Perhaps one reason for the pervasive belief that the medieval war horse had to be of draught horse type is the assumption , still held by many , that medieval armour was heavy . In fact , even the heaviest tournament armour ( for knights ) weighed little more than 90 pounds ( 41 kg ) , and field ( war ) armour 40 to 70 pounds ( 18 to 32 kg ) ; <unk> , or horse armour , more common in tournaments than war , rarely weighed more than 70 pounds ( 32 kg ) . For horses , <unk> <unk> ( a type of hardened leather ) , and padded <unk> were more common , and probably as effective . Allowing for the weight of the rider and other equipment , horses can carry approximately 30 % of their weight ; thus such loads could certainly be carried by a heavy riding horse in the 1 @,@ 200 to 1 @,@ 300 pounds ( 540 to 590 kg ) range , and a draught horse was not needed . 
 Although a large horse is not required to carry an armoured knight , it is held by some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase the power of a lance strike . However , practical experiments by re @-@ enactors have suggested that the rider 's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount , and that little of the horse 's weight is translated to the lance . 
 Further evidence for a 14 @-@ 16 hand ( 56 to 64 inches ( 140 to 160 cm ) ) war horse is that it was a matter of pride to a knight to be able to vault onto his horse in full armour , without touching the stirrup . This arose not from vanity , but necessity : if unhorsed during battle , a knight would remain vulnerable if unable to mount by himself . In reality , of course , a wounded or weary knight might find it difficult , and rely on a vigilant squire to assist him . Incidentally , a knight 's armour served in his favour in any fall . With his long hair twisted on his head to form a springy padding under his padded @-@ linen hood , and his helm placed on top , he had head protection not dissimilar to a modern bicycle or equestrian helmet . 
 = = Transportation = = 
 Throughout the Middle Ages it was customary for people of all classes and background to travel , often widely . The households of the upper classes and royal courts moved between manors and estates ; the demands of diplomacy , war and crusades took men to distant countries ; priests travelled between churches , monasteries and formed emissaries to Rome ; people of all classes went on pilgrimage , or travelled to find work ; others travelled as a pastime . Most people undertook small journeys on foot and hired horses for longer journeys . For the upper classes , travel was accompanied by a great deal of pomp and display , with fine horses , large retinues and magnificent cavalcades in order to display their wealth as well as to ensure personal comfort . For example , in 1445 , the English royal household contained 60 horses in the king 's stable and 186 kept for " chariots " ( carriages ) and carts . 
 During much of the Middle Ages , there was no system of interconnected roads and bridges . Though parts of Europe still had remnants of Roman roads built before the collapse of the Roman Empire , most had long fallen into disrepair . Because of the necessity to ride long distances over uncertain roads , smooth @-@ gaited horses were preferred , and most ordinary riding horses were of greater value if they could do one of the smooth but ground @-@ covering four @-@ beat gaits collectively known as an amble rather than the more jarring trot . 
 Mule trains , for land travel , and barges , for river and canal travel , were the most common form of long @-@ distance haulage , although wheeled horse @-@ drawn vehicles were used for shorter journeys . In areas with good roads , regular carrier services were established between major towns . However , because medieval roads were generally so poor , carriages for human passengers were rare . When roads permitted , early carriages were developed from freight wagons . Carriage travel was made more comfortable in the late 14th century with the introduction of the chariot <unk> , which had strap suspension . 
 The speed of travel varied greatly . Large retinues could be slowed by the presence of slow @-@ paced carts and litters , or by servants and attendants on foot , and could rarely cover more than fifteen to twenty miles a day . Small mounted companies might travel 30 miles a day . However , there were exceptions : stopping only for a change of horses midway , Richard II of England once managed the 70 miles between Daventry and Westminster in a night . 
 For breeding , war and travel purposes , it was also necessary to be able to transport horses themselves . For this purpose , boats were adapted and built to be used as horse transports . William of Normandy 's invasion of England in 1066 required the transfer of over 2000 horses from Normandy . Similarly , when travelling to France in 1285 – 6 , Edward I of England ferried over 1000 horses across the English Channel to provide the royal party with transport . 
 = = = Riding horses = = = 
 Riding horses were used by a variety of people during the Middle Ages , and so varied greatly in quality , size and breeding . Knights and nobles kept riding horses in their war @-@ trains , saving their warhorses for the battle . The names of horses referred to a type of horse , rather than a breed . Many horses were named by the region where they or their immediate ancestors were foaled . For example , in Germany , Hungarian horses were commonly used for riding . Individual horses were often described by their gait ( ' trotters ' or ' <unk> ' ) , by their colouring , or by the name of their breeder . 
 The best riding horses were known as palfreys ; other riding horses were often called <unk> , from which the modern term " hack " is derived . Women sometimes rode palfreys or small , quiet horses known as <unk> . 
 = = = Harness and pack horses = = = 
 A variety of work horses were used throughout the Middle Ages . The pack horse ( or " <unk> horse " ) carried equipment and belongings . Common riding horses , often called " <unk> " , could be used as pack horses . Cart horses pulled wagons for trading and freight haulage , on farms , or as part of a military campaign . These draught horses were smaller than their modern counterparts ; pictorial and archaeological evidence suggests that they were stout but short , approximately 13 to 14 hands ( 52 to 56 inches , 132 to 142 cm ) , and capable of drawing a load of 500 to 600 pounds ( 230 to 270 kg ) per horse . Four @-@ wheeled wagons and two @-@ wheeled carts were more common in towns , such as London and , depending on type of vehicle and weight of the load , were usually pulled by teams of two , three , or four horses harnessed in tandem . Starting in the 12th century , in England the use of oxen to pull carts was gradually superseded by the use of horses , a process that extended through the 13th century . This change came because horse @-@ drawn transport moved goods quicker and over greater distances than ox @-@ drawn methods of transport . 
 = = Agriculture = = 
 The Romans had used a two @-@ field crop rotation agricultural system , but from the 8th century on , a three @-@ field system became more common . One field would be sown with a winter crop , the second with a spring crop , and the third left fallow . This allowed a greater amount of spring crop of oats to be grown , which provided fodder for horses . Another advance during the Middle Ages was the development of the heavy mouldboard plough , which allowed dense and heavy soils to be tilled easily ; this technology required the use of larger teams of draught animals including oxen and horses , as well as the adoption of larger fields . Particularly after the 12th century , the increased use of both the horse collar and use of iron horse shoes allowed horsepower to be directed more efficiently . Horse teams usually were four horses , or perhaps six , as compared to eight oxen , and the lesser numbers compensated for the fact that the horses needed to be fed grain on top of pasture , unlike oxen . The increased speed of horses also allowed more land to be ploughed in a day , with an eight ox plough team averaging half of an acre per day , but a horse team averaged a full acre per day . 
 For farm work , such as ploughing and harrowing , the draught horse utilized for this purpose was called an <unk> ( or <unk> ) , which was usually smaller and cheaper than the cart horse . While oxen were traditionally used as work animals on farms , horses began to be used in greater numbers after the development of the horse collar . Oxen and horses were sometimes harnessed together . The transition from oxen to horses for farm work was documented in pictorial sources ( for example , the 11th @-@ century Bayeux tapestry depicts working horses ) , and also clear from the change from the Roman two @-@ field crop @-@ rotation system to a new three @-@ field system , which increased the cultivation of fodder crops ( predominantly oats , barley and beans ) . Horses were also used to process crops ; they were used to turn the wheels in mills ( such as corn mills ) , and transport crops to market . The change to horse @-@ drawn teams also meant a change in ploughs , as horses were more suited to a wheeled plough , unlike oxen . 
 = = Equestrian equipment and technological innovations = = 
 The development of equestrian technology proceeded at a similar pace as the development of horse breeding and utilisation . The changes in warfare during the Early Middle Ages to heavy cavalry both precipitated and relied on the arrival of the stirrup , solid @-@ treed saddle , and horseshoe from other cultures . 
 The development of the nailed horseshoe enabled longer , faster journeys on horseback , particularly in the wetter lands in northern Europe , and were useful for campaigns on varied terrains . By providing protection and support , nailed horse shoes also improved the efficiency of draught horse teams . Though the Romans had developed an iron " <unk> " that resembled a hoof boot , there is much debate over the actual origins of the nailed horseshoe , though it does appear to be of European origin . There is little evidence of nailed @-@ on shoes prior to AD 500 or 600 , though there is speculation that the Celtic Gauls were the first to nail on metal horseshoes . The earliest clear written record of iron horseshoes is a reference to " crescent figured irons and their nails " in a list of cavalry equipment from AD 910 . Additional archaeological evidence suggests they were used in Siberia during the 9th and 10th centuries , and had spread to Byzantium soon afterward ; by the 11th century , horseshoes were commonly used in Europe . By the time the Crusades began in 1096 , horseshoes were widespread and frequently mentioned in various written sources . 
 = = = Riding technology = = = 
 The saddle with a solid tree provided a bearing surface to protect the horse from the weight of the rider . The Romans are credited with the invention of the solid @-@ treed saddle , possibly as early as the 1st century BC , and it was widespread by the 2nd century AD . Early medieval saddles resembled the Roman " four @-@ horn " saddle , and were used without stirrups . The development of the solid saddle tree was significant ; it raised the rider above the horse 's back , and distributed the rider 's weight , reducing the pounds per square inch carried on any one part of the horse 's back , thus greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life . Horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree . It also allowed a more built up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle . From the 12th century on , the high war @-@ saddle became more common , providing protection as well as added security . The built up <unk> of a solid @-@ treed saddle enabled horsemen to use lance more effectively . 
 Beneath the saddle , <unk> or saddle cloths were sometimes worn ; these could be decorated or embroidered with heraldic colours and arms . War horses could be equipped with additional covers , blankets and armour collectively referred to as <unk> ; this could be for decorative or protective purposes . Early forms of horse armour , usually restricted to tournaments , comprised padded leather pieces , covered by a trapper ( a decorated cloth ) , which was not particularly heavy . Mail and plate armour was also occasionally used ; there are literary references to horse armour ( an " iron blanket " ) starting in the late 12th century . 
 The solid tree allowed for effective use of the stirrup . The stirrup was developed in China and in widespread use there by 477 AD . By the 7th century , primarily due to invaders from Central Asia , such as the Avars , stirrups arrived in Europe , and European riders had adopted them by the 8th century . Among other advantages , stirrups provided greater balance and support to the rider , which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently without falling , especially against infantry . 
 The increased use of the stirrup from the 8th century on aided the warrior 's stability and security in the saddle when fighting . This may have led to greater use of shock tactics , although a couched lance could be used effectively without stirrups . In particular , Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the stirrup , and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner . 
 A theory known as The Great Stirrup Controversy argues that the advantages in warfare that stemmed from use of the stirrup led to the birth of feudalism itself . Other scholars , however , dispute this assertion , suggesting that stirrups provided little advantage in shock warfare , being useful primarily for allowing a rider to lean farther to the left and right on the saddle while fighting , and simply reduce the risk of falling off . Therefore , it is argued , they are not the reason for the switch from infantry to cavalry in Medieval militaries , nor the reason for the emergence of Feudalism . 
 There was a variety of headgear used to control horses , predominantly bridles with assorted designs of bits . Many of the bits used during the Middle Ages resemble the <unk> , snaffle bit and curb bit that are still in common use today . However , they often were decorated to a greater degree : the bit rings or shanks were frequently covered with large , ornamental " bosses . " Some designs were also more extreme and severe than those used <unk> curb bit was known during the classical period , but was not generally used during the Middle Ages until the mid @-@ 14th century . Some styles of snaffle bit used during the Middle Ages had the lower cheek extended , in the manner of the modern half @-@ cheek or full cheek snaffle . Until the late 13th century , bridles generally had a single pair of reins ; after this period it became more common for knights to use two sets of reins , similar to that of the modern double bridle , and often at least one set was decorated . 
 Spurs were commonly used throughout the period , especially by knights , with whom they were regularly associated . A young man was said to have " won his spurs " when he achieved knighthood . Wealthy knights and riders frequently wore decorated and filigreed spurs . Attached to the rider 's heel by straps , spurs could be used both to encourage horses to quickly move forward or to direct lateral movement . Early spurs had a short shanks or " neck " , placing the <unk> relatively close to the rider 's heel ; further developments in the spur shape lengthened the neck , making it easier to touch the horse with less leg movement on the part of the rider . 
 = = = Harness technology = = = 
 A significant development which increased the importance and use of horses in harness , particularly for ploughing and other farm work , was the horse collar . The horse collar was invented in China during the 5th century , arrived in Europe during the 9th century , and became widespread throughout Europe by the 12th century . It allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle by means of yokes or <unk> used in earlier times . The yoke was designed for oxen and not suited to the anatomy of horses , it required horses to pull with their shoulders rather than using the power of their hindquarters . <unk> in such a manner , horse teams could pull no more than 500 kg . The breastplate @-@ style harness that had flat straps across the neck and chest of the animal , while useful for pulling light vehicles , was of little use for heavy work . These straps pressed against the horse 's <unk> @-@ <unk> muscle and trachea , which restricted breathing and reduced the pulling power of the horse . Two horses harnessed with a <unk> harness were limited to pulling a combined total of about 1 @,@ 100 pounds ( 500 kg ) . In contrast , the horse collar rested on horses ' shoulders and did not impede breathing . It allowed a horse to use its full strength , by pushing forward with its hindquarters into the collar rather than to pull with its shoulders . With the horse collar , a horse could provide a work effort of 50 % more foot @-@ pounds per second than an ox , because it could move at a greater speed , as well as having generally greater endurance and the ability to work more hours in a day . A single horse with a more efficient collar harness could draw a weight of about 1 @,@ 500 pounds ( 680 kg ) . 
 A further improvement was managed by altering the arrangement of the teams ; by hitching horses one behind the other , rather than side by side , weight could be distributed more evenly , and pulling power increased . This increase in horse power is demonstrated in the building accounts of Troyes , which show carters hauling stone from quarries 50 miles ( 80 km ) distant ; the carts weighed , on average , 5 @,@ 500 pounds ( 2 @,@ 500 kg ) , on which 5 @,@ 500 pounds ( 2 @,@ 500 kg ) of stone was regularly loaded , sometimes increasing to 8 @,@ 600 pounds ( 3 @,@ 900 kg ) – a significant increase from Roman @-@ era loads . 
 = = Horse trades and professions = = 
 The elite horseman of the Middle Ages was the knight . Generally raised from the middle and upper classes , the knight was trained from childhood in the arts of war and management of the horse . In most languages , the term for knight reflects his status as a horseman : the French chevalier , Spanish <unk> and German Ritter . The French word for horse @-@ mastery – <unk> – gave its name to the highest concept of knighthood : chivalry . 
 A large number of trades and positions arose to ensure the appropriate management and care of horses . In <unk> households , the marshal was responsible for all aspects relating to horses : the care and management of all horses from the chargers to the pack horses , as well as all travel logistics . The position of marshal ( literally " horse servant " ) was a high one in court circles and the king 's marshal ( such as the Earl Marshal in England ) was also responsible for managing many military matters . Also present within the great households was the constable ( or " count of the stable " ) , who was responsible for protection and the maintenance of order within the household and commanding the military component and , with marshals , might organise hastiludes and other chivalrous events . Within lower social groupings , the ' marshal ' acted as a farrier . The highly skilled marshal made and fitted horseshoes , cared for the hoof , and provided general veterinary care for horses ; throughout the Middle Ages , a distinction was drawn between the marshal and the blacksmith , whose work was more limited . 
 A number of tradesmen dealt with the provision of horses . Horse dealers ( frequently called " horse coursers " in England ) bought and sold horses , and frequently had a reputation as dishonest figures , responsible for the brisk trade in stolen horses . Others , such as the " <unk> " offered horses for hire , and many formed large establishments on busy roads , often branding their horses to deter theft . 
 = = Women and horses = = 
 It was not uncommon for a girl to learn her father 's trade and for a woman to share her husband 's trade , since the entire family often helped run medieval shops and farms . Many guilds also accepted the membership of widows , so they might continue their husband 's business . Under this system , some women trained in horse @-@ related trades , and there are records of women working as farriers and saddle @-@ makers . On farms , where every hand was needed , excessive emphasis on division of labour was impracticable , and women often worked alongside men ( on their own farms or as hired help ) , leading the farm horses and oxen , and managing their care . 
 Despite the difficulties of travel , it was customary for many people , including women , to travel long distances . Upper @-@ class wives frequently accompanied their husbands on crusade or to tournaments , and many women traveled for social or family engagements ; both nuns and laywomen would perform pilgrimages . When not on foot , women would usually travel on horseback or , if weakened or infirm , be carried in a wagon or a litter . If roads permitted , women sometimes rode in early carriages developed from freight wagons , pulled by three or four horses . After the invention of better suspension systems , travel in carriages became more comfortable . Women of the nobility also rode horses for sport , accompanying men in activities that included hunting and hawking . 
 Most medieval women rode astride . Although an early chair @-@ like sidesaddle with handles and a <unk> was available by the 13th century and allowed women of the nobility to ride while wearing elaborate gowns , they were not universally adopted during the Middle Ages . This was largely due to the insecure seat they offered , which necessitated a smooth @-@ gaited horse being led by another handler . The sidesaddle did not become practical for everyday riding until the 16th @-@ century development of the pommel horn that allowed a woman to hook her leg around the saddle and hence use the reins to control her own horse . Even then , sidesaddle riding remained a precarious activity until the invention of the second , " leaping horn " in the 19th century . 
 It was not unknown for women to ride war horses , and take their part in warfare . Joan of Arc is probably the most famous female warrior of the medieval period , but there were many others , including the Empress Matilda who , armoured and mounted , led an army against her cousin Stephen of Blois , and Stephen 's wife Matilda of Boulogne in the 12th century . The 15th @-@ century writer Christine de Pizan advised aristocratic ladies that they must " know the laws of arms and all things pertaining to warfare , ever prepared to command her men if there is need of it .

 = Billy Meredith = 
 William Henry " Billy " Meredith ( 30 July 1874 – 19 April 1958 ) was a Welsh professional footballer . He was considered one of the early superstars of football due to his performances , notably for Manchester City and Manchester United . He won each domestic trophy in the English football league and gained 48 caps for Wales , for whom he scored 11 goals and won two British Home Championship titles . His favoured position was outside right , and his key skills were dribbling , passing , crossing and shooting . A dedicated and extremely fit professional , his habit of chewing on a toothpick during games made him instantly recognisable . 
 In 27 seasons in the Football League from 1892 to 1924 ( not including the four seasons lost to the First World War and the 1905 – 06 season in which he was banned for bribing an opposition player ) , he scored 176 goals in 740 league and cup appearances . He played for Chirk , before joining Northwich Victoria in 1892 . His career took off when he signed with Manchester City in 1894 and turned professional in January 1895 . He captained the team to the club 's first major honour , a 1 – 0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the 1904 FA Cup Final . He moved to Manchester United in May 1906 after being banned for bribing Aston Villa half @-@ back Alex Leake £ 10 to lose a match . There he won the league title in 1907 – 08 and 1910 – 11 , the FA Cup in 1909 , as well as two FA Charity Shields . He also helped to set up the Players ' Union , which was a fore @-@ runner of the Professional Footballers ' Association . He returned to Manchester City in 1921 at the age of 47 and played a further 32 games before retiring in 1924 , making him the oldest ever player for City , United and Wales . He later ran the Stretford Road Hotel and helped to coach the short @-@ lived Manchester Central . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Meredith was born in 1874 in Chirk , a small mining town in Denbighshire , North Wales , just south of Wrexham . He started work at Black Park Colliery as a pit pony driver at the age of 12 . His family were Primitive Methodists , and Meredith himself remained a lifelong teetotaller . He spent eight years working in the mines , and worked during a tough time for the industry , enduring a 25 % pay cut which led to strike action in 1893 ; this experience helped to shape his political views , which would become significant later in his life . An interest in football was kindled by his elder brothers . Elias , the eldest , was a train driver for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway . His work allowed him to take Meredith to watch professional teams such as Everton . Football was a keen pastime for the miners , and the standard of amateur teams from towns and villages in north east Wales was high as a result ; Chirk won the Welsh Cup five times between 1887 and 1894 , with miners making up a large proportion of the team . All the Meredith brothers played football , but Sam , two years older than Billy , was the first to make an impression . He left Chirk to attempt a professional career , and went on to play for Stoke City as a full @-@ back . 
 Meredith made his debut for the Chirk first team in September 1892 . The club played in The Combination , a league which contained a mixture of town clubs and reserve teams of clubs from big cities . At the end of his first season Meredith played in the 1893 Welsh Cup final , which Chirk lost 2 – 1 to Wrexham . Meredith formed a solid understanding with inside @-@ right William Owen , a former Wales international . Chirk withdrew from The Combination and entered only the Welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by the coal miners ' strike . In an attempt to make ends meet , Meredith not only played for Chirk , but accepted an offer to play for Football League club Northwich Victoria as well , who gave him a small fee on top of his expenses . Northwich were a struggling side , who withdrew from the Football League at the end of the 1893 – 94 season after finishing bottom of the Second Division . The club won just three league matches ; Meredith featured in each win . Back at Chirk , Meredith gained his first honour as part of the team that beat Westminster Rovers to win the 1894 Welsh Cup .

 = = = First spell at Manchester City = = = 
 Meredith 's performances for Northwich gained the attention of several other clubs in the Football League . Bolton Wanderers full @-@ back Di Jones , a former Chirk player , spoke with him about a possible move , but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight . Lawrence Furniss , an official at Ardwick , had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match . Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season . Later in 1894 , Ardwick , by then known as Manchester City , vigorously pursued Meredith 's signature . Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player . One was secretary @-@ manager Joshua Parlby , the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman . The pair were met with suspicion . Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals , and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues . Meredith did not wish to abandon life in Chirk . His mother was particularly against the idea : " It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away ... Our boys are happy and healthy , satisfied with their work and innocent amusements ... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished . " Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City , but as an amateur . He continued to work at the pit for at least a year , commuting back and forth for matches . 
 Meredith made his Manchester City debut in November 1894 in a 5 – 4 loss to Newcastle United . The following week he played his first home match for the club at Hyde Road , and scored two goals against Newton Heath – who later became Manchester United – in the first Manchester derby to take place in the league . Newton Heath won the match 5 – 2 . He turned professional in January 1895 , and ended the 1894 – 95 season with 12 goals in 18 appearances , just three strikes behind top @-@ scorer Pat <unk> , who had played an extra 12 games . 
 In his first full season at Manchester City , Meredith finished as top scorer . He was appointed club captain in his second season at the club , aged just 21 . The club finished as Second Division runners @-@ up in 1895 – 96 , but were denied promotion after heavy defeats to West Bromwich Albion and Small Heath in the test matches . After the departure of strike partner Pat <unk> to Liverpool in March 1897 , Meredith remained as City 's star player . 
 His new partner for the 1897 – 98 season was William Smith ( known as " Stockport Smith " to differentiate him from another William Smith in the team ) , whilst Billie Gillespie was placed at centre @-@ forward . Meredith provided Gillespie with many crosses into the box , picking up numerous assists as Gillespie outscored Meredith by 19 goals to 12 . Meredith also acted as a mentor for the slightly younger Gillespie , steering him away from drinking sessions by taking him along on fishing trips . The final match of the season saw Meredith score his first hat @-@ trick for the club in an emphatic 9 – 0 win against Burton Swifts . 
 City dominated the Second Division in the 1898 – 99 season , and won promotion as champions . Helping them to keep them in winning ways in the close season was late signing Jimmy Ross , a veteran forward who Meredith considered to be his " favourite hero " . Meredith claimed 30 goals in 35 games , including hat @-@ tricks against Grimsby Town , Loughborough , Darwen and Barnsley . 
 Meredith scored City 's first goal in the First Division on the opening day of the 1899 – 1900 season in a 4 – 3 defeat to Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 2 September . Seven days later he claimed two goals in a 4 – 0 home victory over Derby County , and " led the field that day " by dribbling the ball almost the whole length of the pitch before launching a powerful shot that settled into the corner of Jack Fryer 's net . The Athletic News reported that " for real brilliance the right @-@ wing [ Meredith and Ross ] took the biscuit " . 
 First Division defences managed to limit Meredith 's contribution in the 1900 – 01 campaign by singling him out for rough treatment , though Liverpool manager Tom Watson felt compelled to write a letter to Manchester City denying that a Liverpool director had stated that " all that the opposition had to do was watch Meredith – the rest are no good " . He finished the season with just seven goals in 35 appearances . 
 Meredith found the net eight times in 38 games in the 1901 – 02 campaign , as City were relegated back out of the First Division . The club 's secretary , Sam Ormerod , selected 29 different players as the club slumped to defeat in 13 of the opening 20 games . Ormerod was forced to step down , as new business figures took control behind the scenes and began to sign promising young Scottish players . New manager Tom Maley was more willing than his predecessor to confront Meredith over his tendency to stray out of position and attempt to dominate the City attack . 
 City won immediate promotion as Second Division champions in 1902 – 03 , with Meredith scoring 22 goals in 37 appearances and claiming a hat @-@ trick against Chesterfield Town . Maley managed to find him a suitable inside @-@ right partner in Jimmy Bannister , who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith . He also played Sammy Frost at half @-@ back , who was able to win the ball and bring Meredith into the play , and signed outside @-@ left Frank Booth to balance the attack . Maley encouraged teamwork , meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders . 
 Meredith was partnered with George Livingstone for the 1903 – 04 campaign , who was able to supply him and the rest of the team with quality passes . Drawn against a strong Sunderland outfit in the First Round of the FA Cup , Meredith was the " raider @-@ in @-@ chief " as City claimed a 3 – 2 victory at Hyde Road . City then defeated Woolwich Arsenal and Middlesbrough to reach the semi @-@ finals . There they faced The Wednesday at Goodison Park , and Meredith scored one goal ( bundled in by Gillespie ) and claimed two assists as City won the game 3 – 1 . Their opponents in the final at Crystal Palace were mid @-@ table Second Division outfit Bolton Wanderers , and Meredith was cautiously optimistic before the match , stating " We ought to win ... if we play anything like our normal game the cup is ours ... but this is the cup final and , well , anything might happen . " With just over 20 minutes played , Livingstone found Meredith with a long ball , who then beat goalkeeper Dai Davies to score the only goal of the game ; Bolton supporters long maintained that Meredith had been offside . As captain , Meredith was handed the trophy by Prime Minister Arthur Balfour . 
 He scored nine goals in 36 games in the 1904 – 05 season , as City came within two points and two places of champions Newcastle United . The season ended in controversial circumstances at Villa Park , and with a 3 – 2 defeat to Aston Villa ending any hopes of winning the league , Sandy Turnbull and Villa captain Alex Leake exchanged blows . The Football Association launched an investigation into the violence , and the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for the entirety of the 1905 – 06 season for ( unsuccessfully ) attempting to bribe Alex Leake . No evidence was taken from Meredith , who denied the charge , and the evidence was not made public . The club , fearful of FA sanctions , refused to pay Meredith during the campaign . He was transfer listed in May 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe Leake on the orders of manager Tom Maley and that illegal payments were common practice at Hyde Road . The FA acted on his information , and fined Manchester City £ 900 for illegal payments and suspended numerous players , boardroom members and staff members . 
 You approve of the severe punishment administered by the Commission AGAINST ME and state that the offence I committed at Aston Villa should have wiped me out of football forever . Why ME ALONE ? when I was only the spokesman of others equally guilty .

 In May 1906 , while still serving his ban , Meredith moved to Manchester United . He joined on a free transfer and received a £ 500 signing @-@ on fee from United ; Manchester City reluctantly accepted the transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising Meredith a benefit match , and he was willing to forego on the agreement if the club instead granted his transfer . He returned from suspension on 1 January 1907 , and marked his debut at Bank Street with an assist for Sandy Turnbull to score the only goal of the game against Aston Villa . In addition to Turnbull , Meredith was joined at United by former City teammates Jimmy Bannister and Herbert Burgess . This new forward line made the team into a powerful force , as they already possessed a dominant half @-@ back line in captain Charlie Roberts , Dick Duckworth and Alex Bell . They ended the 1906 – 07 season in eighth place in the First Division . 
 Manager Ernest Mangnall signed Jimmy Turnbull , and the forward line of Meredith , Bannister , Jimmy Turnbull and Sandy Turnbull were dominant in the 1907 – 08 campaign . United won the title with a nine @-@ point margin over second @-@ placed Aston Villa , and secured the 1908 FA Charity Shield ( the first ever Charity Shield ) with a 4 – 0 win over Queens Park Rangers at Stamford Bridge . 
 United slipped to a disappointing 13th @-@ place finish in 1908 – 09 . Meredith was suspended for the month of January in punishment for kicking a Brighton & Hove Albion player in an FA Cup match . The club reached the 1909 FA Cup Final , knocking out Brighton , Everton , Blackburn Rovers , Burnley and Newcastle United . Their cup final opponents at Crystal Palace were Bristol City , captained at centre @-@ half by Billy <unk> – England captain and staunch opponent of the Players ' Union . A Sandy Turnbull goal settled the tie , which was described as quite a boring game ; Meredith himself dismissed reports of the match , stating " it was a good game for dashing , keen , thrilling football , great goalkeeping and narrow escapes at either end " . Meredith and his teammates celebrated the victory with music hall stars such as George Robey . 
 United finished fifth in 1909 – 10 and exited the FA Cup at the First Round with a defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor . However the club continued to advance under the generous chairmanship of John Henry Davies , and Old Trafford was opened in February 1910 . 
 Harold Halse was to partner Meredith at inside @-@ right for the 1910 – 11 season , but proved too much of a " free @-@ spirit " and was replaced by Jack <unk> , a " <unk> [ who ] understands what Meredith requires " . A defeat at Villa Park in the penultimate game of the season left United needing to beat third @-@ place Sunderland and hope that Aston Villa failed to beat Liverpool . United were a goal down when Meredith provided Enoch West with a cross which West sent into the net for the equalising goal . Four more goals came and they won the game 5 – 1 and left the field as champions of England for the second time . 
 Meredith played in the 1911 FA Charity Shield , as United beat Swindon Town 8 – 4 at Stamford Bridge . However the 1911 – 12 campaign ended in a disappointing 13th @-@ place finish and Mangnall left the club to manage rivals Manchester City . Meredith 's Benefit match was played on 7 September 1912 , between Manchester United and Manchester City , and the Welsh FA also donated the proceeds of two trial matches to the fund . There were 39 @,@ 911 spectators and a total of £ 1 @,@ 400 was raised . 
 New manager John Bentley led United to a fourth @-@ place finish in 1912 – 13 . He dropped Meredith to blood a young Jackie Sheldon . By this time , Meredith made headlines primarily due to his squabbling with the club over them stalling payment of his benefit matches and his dissatisfaction at being dropped . The club dropped to 14th spot in 1913 – 14 , and only avoided relegation on the last day of the 1914 – 15 season after bribing Liverpool to lose 2 – 0 at Old Trafford ; Meredith this time played no part in the resulting bribery scandal . He instead claimed to be baffled as to why his teammates refused to pass to him during the game . 
 During the First World War he actually played a match against United , making a guest appearance for Port Vale , with Vale recording a 5 – 2 victory at the Old Recreation Ground . Frustrated with the club for delaying payments over his benefit match , he also played as a guest for Manchester City . After the war ended he demanded a free transfer , and was repulsed that the club demanded a transfer fee , stating that the transfer market was a " degrading business " for players . On 7 May 1921 , at 46 years , 281 days , he became United 's oldest ever player when he took to the field in a league game against Derby County . 
 = = = Return to Manchester City = = = 
 In 1921 he returned to Manchester City on a free transfer . He played 25 first team games in the 1921 – 22 season , helping City to record a derby victory over rivals Manchester United . He featured once in the 1922 – 23 campaign , playing the club 's final game at Hyde Road . He played four FA Cup and two First Division games in the 1923 – 24 season . Mangnall , now his manager at City , shocked Manchester when he selected Meredith for the cup game with Brighton & Hove Albion at the Goldstone Ground , but was vindicated with a 5 – 1 victory ; Meredith also scored a goal , though this was due to a poor mistake from the Brighton goalkeeper . He played both games against Cardiff City in the next round , a 0 – 0 draw at Maine Road and 1 – 0 win at Ninian Park , and claimed an assist in the goal that settled the tie . His last match was against Newcastle United in the semi @-@ finals at the age of 49 years and 245 days , making him City 's oldest ever player ; the game ended in a 2 – 1 defeat . 
 = = International career = = 
 Meredith won his first cap for Wales in a 2 – 2 draw with Ireland on 16 March 1895 in Belfast . He won 12 caps in the 1890s , but was forced to miss six games as his club would not let him play in games that clashed with league fixtures . Wales could compete with Ireland , but were regularly beaten by Scotland and England . On 26 March 1900 , Wales played for the first time in South Wales , at Cardiff Arms Park , and Meredith scored a goal to earn the Welsh a celebrated 1 – 1 draw with England . After serving his suspension , he returned to Wales for the British Home Championship title victory in 1907 , the nation 's first success in the competition . In those three games , he scored against Ireland in a 3 – 2 victory , and captained Wales to a 1 – 0 win over Scotland and a 1 – 1 draw with England . Wales were denied a late penalty against the English , and Meredith was later recorded to have said " never mind , little Wales will win some day [ against England ] . May I be there at the death . " 
 After draws with Ireland and Scotland , Meredith " wept unashamedly " as he helped Wales to beat England 2 – 1 at Highbury to claim the 1920 British Home Championship . It was only his second victory against the English in 20 attempts , and it marked the last of his 48 caps . Though his record number of caps was later surpassed , at 45 years and 229 days he remains the oldest player to win a Wales cap . He was actually chosen by the selectors for 71 consecutive matches , but only made 48 appearances as his clubs regularly refused to release him for international duty . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Meredith was able to avoid injury throughout his career , despite the extremely physical nature of the game during the period . This was due in part to his extraordinary balance and agility , which allowed him to avoid clumsy challenges , and the toughness he had built up from spending his adolescence working in the mines . A model professional , he spent his spare time improving his game with extra training sessions and maintained peak physical fitness by avoiding alcohol and tobacco . His " gimmick " was to chew on a toothpick during matches , and this unusual trait was picked up on by cartoonists of the time . 
 Writing a 1947 critique of Stanley Matthews , Meredith criticised the lack of direct play on show in the 1940s and stated that when he was playing that " I knew what was expected of me – to beat the wing @-@ half and the full @-@ back , take the ball down to the corner flag and centre " . His ball control skills were unparalleled , leaving opposition players unable to tackle him . He also was an extremely accurate passer and crosser of the ball . His dribbling and crossing gave him a large advantage over rival wingers , who relied solely on speed to beat opposition full @-@ backs . In addition to wing @-@ play , he was also highly skilled at sending in long @-@ range shots across the face of the goal , and could be relied upon to meet crosses from his left @-@ winger with a powerful volley . 
 Meredith had to deal with extremely physical defences , and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players . As his talents became widely regarded , more well organised defences would designate him with a man @-@ marker , to try and isolate him from his teammates . This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside @-@ right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return . A hard @-@ working wing @-@ half would also improve Meredith 's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank . The best teams he played in also had a centre @-@ forward able to make the most of his accurate crosses . 
 = = Players ' Union = = 
 Meredith organised the first meeting of the Players ' Union ( PU ) in December 1907 . Meredith had previously been involved with the Association Footballers ' Union ( the " <unk> " ) , the first attempt by football players in England to organise a trade union . The Players ' Union , like the <unk> before it , sought the relaxation of restrictions on transfers and wages . Others made the argument that a free market wage structure would ruin the amateur principles the sport was founded on , but Meredith felt that these words rang hollow considering that club directors and shareholders made vast profits . At the first annual meeting in December 1908 , the PU stated their aims as to allow unlimited wages , the right to transfer from club to club , and for players to take a percentage of any transfer fee . 
 With the union threatening strike action , particularly at international matches , in April 1909 the Football Association insisted that all players agree to leave the union and pledge loyalty to the FA . Manchester United refused to issue the revised contracts to its players , and FA suspended the entire squad . The club then refused to pay the players in lieu of their suspension , and so the players instead took away ornaments from the club 's office before Mangnall persuaded them to return the items . The players continued to train , and captain Charlie Roberts came up with the name of Outcasts F.C. The FA organised a meeting of 200 players , excluding the Outcasts , but a rambling speech from chairman Charles Clegg failed to win them over , and an agreement was reached where the PU would be recognised by the FA . 
 In October 1909 , the Union balloted its members over the organisation 's membership of the General Federation of Trade Unions ( <unk> ) . The result of the vote , a decisive " no " to <unk> support , effectively supported the FA 's position that professional footballers were fundamentally different from workmen in other industries . Meredith resumed league football in November 1909 , bemoaning his view that " many players refuse to take things seriously and continue to live a kind of schoolboy life " . 
 = = Personal life and legacy = = 
 He married Ellen Negus in 1901 , and the couple had two daughters . He was a supporter of the Liberal Party . He ran businesses throughout his career , with little success , and was declared bankrupt in July 1909 after his outfitting shop was damaged by <unk> 1998 , p . 135 During the 1910s he ran a public house ( despite being a teetotaller ) and later pursued an interest in the film industry by buying shares in numerous Stretford cinemas in the 1930s . He also starred in 1926 picture The Ball of Fortune , playing himself as a football trainer ; the film received generally positive reviews . In 1928 , together with former colleague Charlie Roberts he became a coach for the ambitious but short @-@ lived Manchester Central . Meredith 's son @-@ in @-@ law , former City captain Charlie Pringle , was a player . He retained a passion for football , and spent much of his retirement discussing the game with former colleagues and regulars at his hotel , the Stretford Road Hotel , which he ran from 1930 to 1945 . He rarely missed the chance to attend a Wales game in the 1920s and 1930s . 
 Meredith died in Withington , Manchester in April 1958 at the age of 83 , two months after the Munich air disaster , which claimed the lives of eight Manchester United players . After he spent many years in an unmarked grave , the Professional Footballers ' Association , the Welsh FA , Manchester City and Manchester United all agreed to cover the cost of upkeep on a new headstone . Meredith is honoured in the hall of fame at the City of Manchester Stadium . It was announced in August 2007 that Meredith was one of the 10 new inductees for 2007 to the English Football Hall of Fame .

 = Jean Abraham Grill = 
 Jean Abraham Grill ( 21 July 1736 – 12 March 1792 ) , sometimes called Johan Abraham Grill , was a Swedish merchant , supercargo , director of the Swedish East India Company ( SOIC ) and ironmaster at Godegård with several factories . 
 Grill journeyed to China twice as the representative for the SOIC . He lived in Canton ( now known as Guangzhou ) as well as Macao for a total of almost ten years , doing trade for the company during the arrival of three Swedish ships . In China he lived the life of an adventurer ; survived a shipwreck , traded with other East Asian countries together with his partner Michael Grubb and smuggled opium from India to China . 
 He returned to Sweden in 1768 , a wealthy man and lived the rest of his life in Swedish high society , writing minor essays about his travels as member of the Royal Swedish Academies of Sciences and Music . He married Lovisa Ulrika Lüning and bought the Godegård Manor and several ironworks , which he renovated and improved . When Grill died in 1792 , his wife took over his business and ran the ironworks and factories . 
 His most notable legacy is the notes , correspondence , accounts , cargo lists and books he kept during his life . They are preserved in the Godegård Archive and in the Gothenburg University Library . 
 = = Early life = = 
 One of the Grill family , Jean Abraham Grill was the eldest son of merchant Abraham Grill , the Younger ( 1707 – 68 ) and Anna Maria Petersen ( 1713 – 54 ) . He was born in Helsingør where his father was the Swedish consul at that time . In 1746 , the family moved to Gothenburg where his father had started a trading house . When Jean Abraham was 14 years old , he started working as an apprentice in his fathers office , and three years later he became a clerk at the Swedish East India Company ( SOIC ) . Through his fathers mediation he was appointed to second assistant on the ship Sophia Albertina for its journey to Canton ( now known as Guangzhou ) between 1755 and 1756 . 
 Being ambitious , Grill aimed for the higher positions in the SOIC , and to achieve that he had to learn more and gain more experience . So when he returned to Sweden from China , he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible . He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm , Swedish consul to France , in Montpellier where he worked for about six months . He stayed in France for five years , and in 1758 , he was employed by the Mallet & <unk> firm in Marseille . Grill 's letters to his family during those years indicates that he enjoyed his time in France and was interested in style and his own appearance . His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille , but his family , especially his uncle Claes Grill , advised against it . Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market , but he soon moved on to the more lucrative Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same . 
 = = In Canton = = 
 Grill followed his uncle Claes ' advice and went to Canton as third supercargo on the Fredric Adolph in 1761 , during the second carter of the SOIC . On 3 September 1761 , the ship ran aground at the Pratas Islands in the South China Sea . The ship 's captain , Daniel <unk> , did what he could to lighten the ship and tried to get it afloat again , but to no avail . Seven hours later the ship was a wreck , resting on the rocks and everyone aboard went into the boats . Twenty men stayed behind to guard the ship , while 122 men , including Grill , immediately set off for the nearest port . Five days later they landed on the Chinese mainland , in the " province of <unk> " [ sic ] , where they eventually got permission from the Chinese authorities to proceed to Canton . In Canton they met with the men left to guard the ship , now 17 in number , who had arrived two weeks earlier . Three expeditions with divers , one of them led by Grill , went to recover the cargo from the wreck . They managed to salvage about two @-@ thirds of the silver , tin , iron , coral , lead and copper from the cargo , plus one cat and a dog . 
 After the shipwreck , Grill remained in Canton as resident supercargo for seven years . As such he was the company 's representative in Canton , contacting Chinese merchants as well as buying goods and cargo for the ships . He was supercargo for the arrival of three more ships of the <unk> : the Stockholms Slott ( outward journey ) in 1762 , the Stockholms Slott ( resident supercargo in Canton ) in 1765 and the <unk> Prins Gustaf ( journey home ) 1768 . One of his tasks in Canton was to make sure that the Swedish factory at the Thirteen Factories was in good order and maintained . The Swedes rented factories or houses from the mandarins at other locations as well , but the one on 13 : e <unk> ( the 13 : th Factory street ) operated as their main building . Grills records of the Swedish factory are detailed and provide good insight into life in Canton at that time . 
 He also started a successful private company in partnership with the older and more experienced Michael Grubb , one of the directors of the SOIC and founder of the first Swedish trading office in Canton . They traded in Canton and Macao , which technically was against the rules and regulations in the charter of the SOIC . Grill took advantage of the fact that his father was a director of the SOIC , and until his father 's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships . From Europe the ships brought objets d 'art , corals from the Mediterranean Sea , expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing @-@ songs . Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich mandarins . 
 The Grubb @-@ Grill company used Chinese junks to trade with India , Java , Indochina , Philippines and Japan . From these places they traded in Japanese silk , pigments , spices , gold and silver treads , pearls and lacquerware . The most profitable product in that trade was opium , the smuggling of which became Grill 's own private business . During his time in Canton he smuggled " considerable quantities " from India to Macao . It is documented that he in 1767 received a shipment of 150 chests of opium sent from Madras ( now known as Chennai ) by Jacob Hahr , another supercargo . Consequently , Grill became Sweden 's first major drug runner . 
 The resident supercargo was responsible for buying goods such as tea , porcelain , silk , <unk> , sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden . The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa , who had his factory next to the Swedish , and judging from their letters , Puankhequa and Grill became friends . Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off @-@ season when the price was at its lowest . He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa , and several contracts are preserved . However , he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC 's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold it on to the SOIC at a slightly higher price . After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766 . Grill and his companions , Grubb and Hahr , had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC . In 1768 , Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship <unk> Prins Gustaf . Even so , Hahr stayed behind in Canton , continued their business and was able to transfer Grill 's share of the profit through international bank notes .
