 Lili killed 22 people throughout its lifetime . Fourteen deaths were reported in Central America , and six in the United Kingdom . There were two deaths indirectly related to the hurricane in the United States . Damage figures for Central America and the Bahamas are unavailable , but total damages in Cuba and the British Isles were estimated at $ 662 million ( 1996 USD ) .

 In its formative stages , Lili produced heavy rainfall in portions of Central America , causing flooding that left thousands of people homeless . In Costa Rica , there were four deaths , and five people drowned in Nicaragua , all due to river flooding . In Honduras , there were five deaths , one of which when a house was washed away . 
 The storm briefly posed a threat to Mexico , and a tropical storm warning was issued from Chetumal Bay to Cabo Catoche along the eastern Yucatán peninsula . A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were also issued for the Cayman Islands .

 While Lili was still a tropical depression , the government of Cuba issued a hurricane watch for Isla de la Juventud and the provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana provinces . On October 16 , a tropical storm warning was put in place for several provinces , which was upgraded to a hurricane warning the next day for eight provinces , eastward to Camagüey . The threat of the storm caused all flights to and from Cuba to be canceled , and the airport at Havana was closed . Officials set up shelters and ordered about 88 @,@ 000 people in Havana to evacuate from buildings prone to collapsing ; however , only 5 @,@ 000 people had evacuated by the day before landfall , due to fears of their houses being robbed . Ultimately , 269 @,@ 995 people evacuated due to the storm , along with over 270 @,@ 000 livestock . Officials also closed classes and sent workers home in areas along the projected path , and two hospitals were completely evacuated . Power lines in Havana were intentionally turned off before the storm to minimize potential damage . Before Lili , the last hurricane to strike Cuba was Hurricane Kate in 1985 . The country was already experiencing economic difficulties when the storm struck , following the collapse of the Soviet Union in a crisis known as the Special Period . 
 Crossing through Cuba , Hurricane Lili produced strong winds , affecting 11 of the country 's 15 provinces . The offshore Cayo Largo del Sur reported 92 mph ( 148 km / h ) in 10 minute sustained winds , with gusts to 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) . On the Isla de la Juventud , wind gusts reached 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , and on the mainland , Santo Domingo reported wind gusts of 112 mph ( 180 km / h ) . Heavy rainfall accompanied the hurricane 's passage through the country , peaking at 29 @.@ 41 in ( 747 mm ) , including a daily total of 17 @.@ 07 in ( 433 mm ) . High waves struck the southern coast of Cuba , estimated at over 20 ft ( 7 m ) . 
 While crossing Cuba , Lili primarily caused damage from its heavy rainfall and not from the winds . Nationwide , Lili damaged 92 @,@ 542 houses and destroyed another 6 @,@ 369 , mostly in Cienfuegos and Sancti Spíritus , which left thousands of people homeless . Heavy rains caused homes to collapse along the path , many already in poor condition . On Isla de la Juventud , the winds damaged 85 houses and destroyed another 103 . The winds also stripped 16 tons of grapefruit from their trees on the island . Nationwide , hundreds of thousands of trees fell during the storm . On Cayo Largo del Sur , the strong waves wrecked seaside cabanas . In Villa Clara Province , about 45 mi ( 75 km ) of roads were damaged , and the winds destroyed the roofs of 28 sugar refineries . In Havana , the storm wrecked a dozen buildings and downed several trees . Nationwide , the hurricane downed hundreds of power lines , leaving many towns without power , and power plants were damaged in Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos provinces . The hurricane also damaged 21 hospitals and dozens of health clinics , along with 32 schools . Extensive crop damage occurred along the storm 's path , affecting thousands of hectares of arable land , and damaging 105 agricultural facilities . Flooding affected the banana , fruit , coffee , sugar cane , and rice crops . Nationwide , the storm damaged about 25 @,@ 406 hectares of bananas and 686 @,@ 893 hectares of sugar cane , along with 36 @,@ 249 hectares of other crops . In Sancti Espíritu , 28 @,@ 000 tons of rice were wrecked , and in Matanzas , 7 @,@ 500 tons of citrus crops were heavily damaged . Total damages in the country were estimated at $ 362 million ( 1996 USD ) . There were no deaths in Cuba , and seven injuries .

 Tropical cyclone forecast models correctly anticipated that Lili would pass southeast of Florida , despite a potential landfall within 24 hours had the storm maintained its previous track . The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for the Florida Keys but not for the Miami metropolitan area . Wind gusts in the Florida Keys reached 38 mph ( 61 km / h ) at Sand Key Light . For several days , a trough extended northward from the hurricane , producing heavy rainfall in the southeast portion of the state . The highest total was 12 @.@ 08 in ( 307 mm ) in Everglades National Park . One person died in Palm Beach County when a farm worker was swept into a canal drainage pipe . 
 High waves from the hurricane affected the northern coast of Puerto Rico , causing minor flooding . 
 On October 18 , a low pressure area developed near Norfolk , Virginia , which moved up the coastline and struck New England the next day . The system drew moisture from Lili , which dropped heavy rainfall over portions of the northeastern United States that reached 13 @.@ 03 in ( 331 mm ) in Newburyport , Massachusetts . In the state , the rains flooded hundreds of houses , leaving over $ 10 million in damage . High rainfall and a storm surge flooded coastal portions of Maine , and Portland lost freshwater access for 24 hours after a water main broke . There was one indirect death when a man tried driving across a flooded road in Cumberland County , and damage in the state totaled over $ 26 million . Heavy rainfall in New Hampshire also caused flooding , and river flooding occurred in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey due to the storm . Farther south in Delaware , the rains caused flash flooding in northern New Castle County , and roadway flooding occurred in eastern Maryland . 
 = = = Bahamas = = = 
 A hurricane watch was issued for the northwestern Bahamas on October 17 , which was upgraded to a warning and expanded to cover the central Bahamas on the next day . A tropical storm warning was later issued for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands . The airport in Nassau was closed before the storm struck , and 40 people in Georgetown on Exuma island evacuated . 
 While moving through the Bahamas , Lili produced 92 mph ( 148 km / h ) in 10 – minute sustained winds on San Salvador Island . On Great Exuma island , there was an estimated 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) storm tide , mostly on the southwestern portion , which caused beach erosion and some coral damage . At French Bay , waves destroyed the public dock . Effects were worst on the western portion , including damaged houses and sunk boats . Hotels sustained heavy roof damage in Cockburn Town and Victoria Hill . The storm also knocked down trees , and sea spray damaged some crops . On Long Island , the storm damaged crops and a few houses . Overall damage in the Bahamas was described as " scattered " , and not affecting any tourism areas .

 On October 28 , the extratropical remnants of Lili moved over Ireland and the United Kingdom , considered the strongest storm to affect the area since 1961 . Alderney in the Channel Islands reported 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) winds , with gusts to 90 mph ( 144 km / h ) . Swansea in Wales reported gusts of 92 mph ( 148 km / h ) , leaving thousands of houses without power in the region . The remnants of Lili produced 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) waves in Bristol Channel , which heavily damaged about 500 cottages in Somerset . 40 ft ( 12 m ) waves in the North Sea removed an oil platform from its moorings , which nearly washed ashore near Peterhead until a line was reconnected . A 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) storm tide along the River Thames flooding coastal areas , and high waves washed a sailboat ashore along Chale Bay in the Isle of Wight . The remnants of Lili also dropped about 3 in ( 76 mm ) of rainfall , which alleviated drought conditions . The storm killed six people in Great Britain – four were related to traffic accidents , and two fishermen were swept into the sea . Damage was estimated at $ 300 million ( 1996 USD , £ 150 million in 1996 pound <unk> ) , making it the costliest storm in the United Kingdom since the Great Storm of 1987 .

 On October 20 , the government of Cuba issued an appeal to the international community for assistance . The Red Cross provided $ 1 @.@ 6 million to the country , and various departments of the United Nations provided $ 80 @,@ 000 . The government of Japan sent about $ 104 @,@ 000 worth of medical equipment , and Italy sent about $ 526 @,@ 000 worth of medical supplies . The Canadian Red Cross donated a water purification unit , and the Spanish Red Cross sent blankets and cots . The German Red Cross also sent mattresses and blankets . The American Red Cross sent 9 @.@ 5 tons of food . Several other countries sent assistance , including the European Commission which sent $ 750 @,@ 000 worth of supplies . There were early difficulties in transporting the relief supplies due to fuel shortages . Due to storm damage , 66 @,@ 881 people resided in shelters until their houses were rebuilt , or until they moved elsewhere . By March 1997 , most people had returned to their homes , although some did so without a roof . There was a threat for water @-@ borne diseases due to stagnant waters , although no such outbreaks occurred . The storm decreased the supply of the banana crop in 1997 , coupled with a drought . 
 Following the shooting down two small private U.S. planes in Cuban airspace in February 1996 , United States President Bill Clinton banned charter flights between the two nations . After the storm , the ban was lifted to allow the Caritas charity to fly a plane with supplies to Cuba . Some Cuban Americans in South Florida donated to help the affected Cuban victims , but others did not for fear it would assist the regime of President Fidel Castro . The plane landed on October 26 with 36 @.@ 5 tons of supplies , carrying about 30 tons of food and the remainder in the form of construction material . Only 23 tons of rice , beans , and milk were distributed . The Cuban government rejected the remaining seven tons due to the parcels containing inscriptions other than " Caritas " or " CRS " , such as " exile " or other messages against the communist party . The rejected aid was sent to the Dominican Republic or back to Miami . Catholic Relief Services later sent $ 252 @,@ 000 worth of medicine , and sent a second flight of aid in January 1997 with 43 tons of rice , cooking oil , and flour .

 Commerce Square is a Class @-@ A , high @-@ rise office building complex in Center City Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , United States . Commerce Square consists of One and Two Commerce Square , two identical 41 @-@ story office towers 565 feet ( 172 m ) high that surround a paved courtyard of 30 @,@ 000 square feet ( 2 @,@ 800 m2 ) . Architecturally , the granite @-@ clad towers feature setbacks on the north and south sides of the building and are topped with a pair of stone diamonds with cutout squares in the center . The towers were built as part an office @-@ building boom Philadelphia was experiencing on West Market Street in the late 1980s . Designed by IM Pei & Partners ( now called Pei Cobb Freed & Partners ) , the towers were developed in a joint venture between Maguire Thomas Partners and IBM . IBM also leased more than half of One Commerce Square for the company 's Mid @-@ Atlantic headquarters . Construction of the first phase , which included One Commerce Square , the plaza , and retail space , began in 1985 and was completed in 1987 . The project 's second phase , Two Commerce Square , did not begin until a lead tenant was secured for the building in 1990 . Consolidated Rail Corporation ( Conrail ) agreed to be Two Commerce Square 's lead tenant and make the skyscraper its corporate headquarters after a two @-@ year search for office space in the region . Two Commerce Square ended the skyscraper construction boom of the 1980s when it was completed in 1992 . No other office skyscraper was built in Philadelphia until Brandywine Realty Trust ( NYSE : <unk> ) built the Cira Centre in 2005 . 
 In the 1990s , Commerce Square 's lead tenants reduced their presence dramatically in the towers . IBM moved some of its operations out of Philadelphia in the early 1990s , and Conrail was bought by Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation later in the decade . Almost all of Conrail 's operations were moved out of Philadelphia by the 2000s . Commerce Square was praised mainly for its design of two towers surrounding a plaza . Renowned Philadelphia urban planner Edmund N. Bacon praised Commerce Square and its plaza by saying it " will prove to be one of the finest commercial projects to be built in this century " . 
 = = History = = 
 Commerce Square was part of an office @-@ building boom that took place in the late 1980s in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . During the boom numerous skyscrapers were constructed in the West Market Street neighborhood of Center City . The US $ 300 million development of Commerce Square was led by Robert F. Maguire III , co @-@ managing partner of Maguire Thomas Partners of Los Angeles . To get his project moving , Maguire engaged the architectural firm IM Pei & Partners ( now called Pei Cobb Freed & Partners ) to design the complex . Using a design by a leading architectural firm as incentive , Maguire approached IBM , a company he had past associations with . By early November 1984 , after negotiations with Maguire , IBM agreed to be a joint partner in the development . IBM also agreed to serve as the lead tenant for One Commerce Square , occupying about half the building as its headquarters for the Mid @-@ Atlantic region . Commerce Square would be split between two buildings , One Commerce Square being built first , and the second tower , Two Commerce Square , being built later once a lead tenant was secured . Plans for Commerce Square were officially announced on November 16 , 1984 at a press conference held by Maguire and IBM at the Bellevue @-@ Stratford Hotel . The first phase of the project included One Commerce Square , retail and restaurant space , a plaza , and an underground parking garage . Construction began with the first phase on June 10 , 1985 . One Commerce Square was topped off with a ceremony on June 6 , 1986 , and the skyscraper officially opened on October 23 , 1987 . 
 In 1987 the Consolidated Rail Corporation ( Conrail ) indicated it wanted to consolidate its offices spread out across Philadelphia into one office building . In May 1988 , Conrail solicited proposals from developers for a building to house its corporate headquarters . On March 30 , 1990 , after being sought after by numerous developers in Philadelphia and its suburbs , Conrail announced that it would be leasing 27 floors of Two Commerce Square . With a lead tenant secured , construction of the identical tower commenced in July 1990 . Two Commerce Square was completed in July 1992 and Conrail began moving in approximately 3 @,@ 000 employees in September of that year . Two Commerce Square marked the end of the skyscraper boom of the 1980s , being the last office skyscraper to be built in Philadelphia until the Cira Centre in 2005 . 
 After the office @-@ building boom of the 1980s , the 1990s saw an office glut that resulted in numerous vacancies and reduced leasing rates throughout Center City . In 1993 IBM , struggling financially , was shrinking its workforce and consolidating its operations nationwide , and its plans included moving some of its local employees out of the city . Though IBM had initially occupied nearly half of One Commerce Square , by 1993 it was using only one @-@ fifth of the building . In 1996 , Maguire Thomas Partners split up , leaving the ownership of Commerce Square to Thomas Properties Group Inc. alone . After the split , Thomas Properties renegotiated mortgage financing of the Commerce Square towers . Thomas Properties Group successfully renegotiated the debt for Two Commerce Square with Bank of America , but was unable to renegotiate the debt with One Commerce Square 's prime mortgage holder , Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation . To break the deadlock , Philadelphia Plaza Associates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . Thomas Properties Group was then the parent company of Philadelphia Plaza Associates which owned Commerce Square . 
 Philadelphia Plaza Associates emerged from bankruptcy reorganization early in 1998 , but the company still had concerns about filling the space soon to be vacated by Conrail . In October 1996 Conrail was bought by Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation . The merger was concluded in May 1998 and the former Conrail offices and employees began to be moved out of the building . In the merger deal , CSX Transportation absorbed Conrail 's 15 @-@ year lease . CSX was responsible for paying the lease , but the 728 @,@ 000 square feet ( 68 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space was subleased , offsetting the cost . Between 1999 and 2000 , as Conrail offices were phased out of Two Commerce Square , Thomas Properties filled the newly vacated space with new tenants .

 = Allegro ( musical ) = 
 Allegro is a musical by Richard Rodgers ( music ) and Oscar Hammerstein II ( book and lyrics ) , their third collaboration for the stage . Opening on Broadway on October 10 , 1947 , the musical centers on the life of Joseph Taylor , Jr . , who follows in the footsteps of his father as a doctor , but is tempted by fortune and fame at a big @-@ city hospital . 
 After the immense successes of the first two Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals , Oklahoma ! and Carousel , the pair sought a subject for their next play . Hammerstein had long contemplated a serious work which would deal with the problems of the ordinary man in the fast @-@ moving modern world . He and Rodgers sought to create a work which would be as innovative as their first two @-@ stage musicals . To that end , they created a play with a large cast , including a Greek chorus . The production would have no sets ; props and projections served to suggest locations . 
 After a disastrous tryout in New Haven , Connecticut , the musical opened on Broadway to a large advance sale of tickets , and very mixed reviews . Agnes de Mille , the choreographer of Rodgers and Hammerstein 's previous Broadway productions , both directed and choreographed the work . The show was viewed as too moralistic , and the Broadway run ended after nine months ; it was followed by a short national tour . It had no West End production and has rarely been revived . There are two recordings of Allegro , the original cast album and a studio recording released in 2009 . 
 = = Inception = = 
 Oscar Hammerstein II had always wanted to write a serious drama , one which would address the problems of life confronting ordinary people . By early 1946 , four years after his partnership with Richard Rodgers commenced , the duo had two hits ( Oklahoma ! and Carousel ) on Broadway , and success as producers of musicals others had written . In March , Hammerstein approached Rodgers with the idea for a play with two men as the central characters , rather than the usual " boy and girl " format . Over the following weeks , the two discussed it , and the concept evolved into a musical about one man , a doctor 's son , which appealed to Rodgers , the son and brother of doctors . By September , the general theme for the story had been established : the struggle of the main character to avoid compromising his principles as he progresses in life . 
 Hammerstein had thought of writing a play about a man , from birth to death . However , having just killed his leading male character , Billy Bigelow , onstage in Carousel , he was reluctant to kill off another . In the end , he took his protagonist from birth to age 35 . He envisioned a simply staged work like Our Town which after its initial run would lend itself to college productions . Allegro was conceived as taking place in an open space , using props and projections to convey scenery to the audience . In addition to the customary singing chorus , there would be a speaking chorus , in the manner of a Greek chorus , which would comment on the action , and speak to both characters and audience . 
 As background research about the medical profession , Hammerstein interviewed his own doctor . He wrote a few pages of the book before embarking with his wife for Australia to visit his mother @-@ in @-@ law ; when his ship arrived in Brisbane he mailed Rodgers part of the remainder . On receiving the packet , Rodgers , who did generally not compose until Hammerstein supplied him with a lyric , immediately sat down and composed three songs . Hammerstein put a good deal of his own experiences into the play . According to his son , William , " Most of the first act was based on his own memories of his own childhood . He had always been intrigued by it , you know ; his mother died when he was twelve . I always felt his songs came out of his feelings about her . " 
 Hammerstein spent a year writing and polishing the first act , taking infinite pains over the wording . The second act was more rushed ; under a deadline , Hammerstein completed it only a week before rehearsals began . Hammerstein 's protegee Stephen Sondheim , who served as a $ 25 @-@ a @-@ week gofer on the production , stated , 
 Years later , in talking over the show with Oscar — I don 't think I recognized it at the time — I realized he was trying to tell the story of his life ... Oscar meant it as a metaphor for what had happened to him . He had become so successful with Oklahoma ! and Carousel that he was suddenly in demand all over the place . What he was talking about was the trappings , not so much of success , but of losing sight of what your goal is . 
 = = Rehearsals and tryouts = = 
 The duo hired choreographer Agnes de Mille to direct — a move between two theatre functions which was unusual at the time . De Mille had been the choreographer for the dances in Oklahoma ! and Carousel , designing ballets which disclosed the characters ' psychological states to the audience . She had been concerned about the cohesion of the script as she received it from Hammerstein . When a few days before rehearsals began , she asked Hammerstein what the show was about , the lyricist replied , " It 's about a man not being allowed to do his own work because of worldly pressures . " De Mille answered , " That 's not the play you 've written . You haven 't written your second act . " Hammerstein replied , " But we 're already committed to the theatre in New York . " 
 De Mille faced an immense task . Instead of conventional sets , locations were suggested by platforms , images projected onto backdrops , and lighting — there were 500 lighting cues , at the time a Broadway record . There were forty stagehands , needed to shift sixty partial sets , with objects moved onto the stage by a semicircular track hidden by an elaborate series of curtains . According to de Mille biographer Carol Easton , " Allegro was a leviathan of a show , on a scale exceeding the grasp of any individual . " 
 Rehearsals took place in three New York locations , for principals , singers , and dancers . The production contained 41 principals and over a hundred dancers . De Mille also choreographed the dances , which were both extremely complicated and provided the framework for the scenes which made up the show . During the dances , Joe learns to walk , falls in love , goes astray , and then gets back on the proper track . De Mille used adults in children 's clothes for the dances when Joe is a child ; since there were no actual children on stage to provide scale , the illusion worked . The dance which accompanied " One Foot , Other Foot " was based on de Mille 's own experiences in watching her own son Jonathan learn to walk . 
 Sondheim later expressed his view of de Mille 's directing , calling her " a horror . She treated the actors and singers like dirt and treated the dancers like gods ... [ she was , ] I think , an extremely insensitive woman , an excellent writer , and a terrible director , in terms of morale , anyway . That was my first experience of bad behavior in the theatre . " However , Rufus Smith , who played the minor role of the football coach , stated , " Never again in my life will I experience what it is like to stop a show cold , by doing exactly what she taught me " . The immense job of directing the play finally proved too big for de Mille , who stated " I can 't do the new dances and the new songs and the new book , " and Hammerstein stepped in to direct the dialogue . According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest , at this point the cast was up in arms over de Mille 's treatment of them . James Mitchell , one of the dancers in the production , later stated that de Mille was better at directing dancers than actors , as actors come to the stage with preconceived notions about how to play a part , and dancers do not . 
 The first tryout , in New Haven , Connecticut , did not go to plan . During the first act , William Ching , playing Joseph Taylor , Sr. , was singing " A Fellow Needs a Girl " when the scenery wall began to collapse , forcing him to hold it up until the stagehands noticed . Dancer Ray Harrison caught his tap in a track in the stage , tore the ligaments in his knee and was carried from the stage , screaming . Lisa Kirk , the first Emily , fell into the orchestra while singing " The Gentleman Is a Dope " . She was catapulted back onto the stage with no pause in her singing , to great applause by the audience . Sondheim remembered , 
 Next day in the New York Herald Tribune ... Billy Rose , of all people was saying , " A star is born . " Next night she comes back , came to the same point in the song , and starts to fall , and the entire audience gasps because they 'd all read the Herald Tribune . She recovers quickly , they all sigh , and she gets another ovation . Oscar came backstage at the end and said , " You do that a third time and you 're fired . " 
 The disasters of the New Haven opener concluded during " Come Home " , a song near the end of the play — the quiet urgings of the chorus and Joe 's mother to entice him to return to his small town . A false fire alarm went off , and the audience began to push towards the exit . Joshua Logan , who was in attendance , loudly ordered the crowd to sit down , which it did . One of the Boston tryouts that followed New Haven was marked by boisterous behavior by <unk> , until Hammerstein yelled , " Shut up ! " and the audience subsided .

 The play opens with Marjorie Taylor in bed , in 1905 . Wife of small town doctor Joseph Taylor , she has just had a son . The people of the town predict great things for Joseph Taylor , Jr . , or Joe as he will come to be called ( Musical number : " Joseph Taylor , Jr . " ) . Joe learns what a baby learns : the comforting presence of his mother , the presence of another figure , who does not smell as nice , and who always leaves as soon as he picks up his black bag . Joe is seen as a baby and then not again as a child ; the audience takes his perspective . Joe 's Grandma notices him trying to walk , calls for Marjorie to witness the first steps , and once he takes them , as the chorus states , " the world belongs to Joe " ( " One Foot , Other Foot " ) . Joe grows to school age , and loses his beloved Grandma . He is comforted by Jennie Brinker , a businessman 's daughter . The two grow to high school age and date , though Joe lacks the nerve to kiss her , to Jennie 's frustration . As Joe prepares to leave for college , Dr. Taylor hopes that his son will help him in his medical practice , and he and Marjorie wonder if Joe will marry Jennie ( " A Fellow Needs a Girl " ) . 
 At the freshman mixer ( " Freshman Dance " ) , the audience finally sees Joe onstage . He marvels at his new world , in which he is a loner ( " A Darn Nice Campus " ) . Joe serves ineffectively as a cheerleader ( " The Purple and the Brown " ) , rooting for the Wildcats , whose star player is Joe 's freshman classmate Charlie Townsend . Both are pre @-@ medical students and soon become close friends . The friendship helps both ; Joe gains entrance to Charlie 's fraternity and social circles , while Charlie is allowed to copy Joe 's conscientious schoolwork . 
 While Joe is at college , Jennie remains at home , and her wealthy father , Ned Brinker , who disapproves of Joe for spending so many years in school before earning a living , encourages her to find other boyfriends . Jennie does not bother to conceal these romances in her letters ; Joe is finally fed up , and goes on a double date with Charlie and two girls . Beulah , Joe 's date , is initially enthusiastic about the budding romance ( " So Far " ) but walks away in disgust when Joe , who is unable to keep thoughts of Jennie from his mind , falls asleep after a passionate kiss . Jennie breaks up with the boy that Joe was afraid would marry her , and she is waiting for Joe when he returns home ( " You Are Never Away " ) . Marjorie Taylor is convinced that Jennie is the wrong girl for Joe , and after a confrontation with Jennie when she tells her this , Marjorie dies of a heart attack . Despite the disapproval of both families ( " What a Lovely Day for a Wedding " ) , Joe and Jennie marry , a wedding observed by the unhappy ghosts of Marjorie and Grandma ( " Wish Them Well " ) . 
 = = = Act 2 = = = 
 It is the Depression . Joe makes a bare living as assistant to his father . Mr. Brinker 's business has failed , and he lives with the couple , who are experiencing poverty for the first time in their lives . The poverty affects Jennie more than Joe — the new Mrs. Taylor dislikes life as an impoverished housewife ( " Money Isn 't Everything " ) . When she learns that Joe turned down a lucrative offer from a prominent Chicago physician , who is Charlie 's uncle , Jennie at first rages . When she finds that is not effective , she gets him to change his mind through guilt — if he accepts Dr. Denby 's offer , he can earn the money to start the small hospital of which his father dreams and they will have the money to bring up a child properly . 
 Joe accepts the job , and sadly leaves his father . He soon finds himself ministering to <unk> ; he is required to spend time at cocktail parties marked by useless conversation ( " Yatata , Yatata , Yatata " ) . Charlie is also part of the practice , but the former football star has turned to drink . Joe himself is becoming careless due to the distractions ; one mistake is caught by his nurse , Emily , who greatly admires the physician Joe could be ( " The Gentleman Is a Dope " ) . Denby congratulates Joe on his skills , both medical and social . The elder doctor has less time for a nurse , Carrie Middleton , who has worked at his hospital for thirty years and once dated him , but who is involved in a labor protest — Denby orders her fired at the request of Lansdale , an influential trustee and soap manufacturer . Charlie , Joe and Emily comment on the frenetic pace of the Chicago world in which they live ( " Allegro " ) . 
 Joe has become increasingly disillusioned by his life in the city , and worries about his former patients in his home town . He learns that Jennie is having an affair with Lansdale . As Joe sits , head in hands , his late mother and a chorus of the friends he left behind appeal to him to return ( " Come Home " ) . Joe has been offered the position of physician @-@ in @-@ chief at the Chicago hospital , replacing Denby , who is taking an executive position , or as the elder doctor terms it , being " kicked upstairs " . At a dedication of a new pavilion at the hospital , Joe has a revelation and shifts the path of his life ; as he does so , Grandma appears and calls for Marjorie to come watch , an echo of the scene in which he learned to walk . Joe refuses the position , and will return to his small town to assist his father , accompanied by Emily and Charlie , but not by Jennie ( Finale : " One Foot , Other Foot " ( reprise ) ) .

 Given the outstanding success of Oklahoma ! and Carousel , Allegro was anticipated with close interest by the theatre community and public . The musical attracted $ 750 @,@ 000 in advance sales , at a time when the top price ticket for a Broadway musical was $ 6 . 
 Allegro opened on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre on October 10 , 1947 . It starred John Battles as Joseph Taylor , Jr . , <unk> Dickey as Majorie Taylor , William Ching as Dr. Joseph Taylor , Roberta <unk> as Jennie Brinker , Lisa Kirk as Emily , and John Conte as Charlie Townsend . A special performance the afternoon of the opening for friends and associates generated wild applause ; the audience at the official opening that evening clapped little . As de Mille 's husband , Walter <unk> , put it , Allegro went over " like a wet firecracker " . 
 The mixed reviews prompted ongoing discussions of the play 's merit , continuing well after the first night . Some of the news that the show generated had nothing to do with its worth — de Mille had dancer Francis Rainer fired , and Rainer alleged that the dismissal was due to her union activism . After Actors Equity became involved , Rainer was rehired . More bad publicity came when the producers proposed to dismiss several orchestra and chorus members to cut costs so the show might continue through the summer of 1948 , and the fired performers also alleged dismissal for union involvement . The show closed before the summer , and in the fall , a national tour began . The national tour ran eight months , much shorter than that of Oklahoma ! or Carousel . No London production was mounted . According to Thomas Hischak in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia , the show made a small profit ; other sources state that the show lost money . 
 The show was popular in the 1950s among amateur drama societies , because of the large cast with no star and the bare stage . It has rarely been revived professionally : the St. Louis Municipal Opera presented it in 1955 ; Goodspeed Musicals presented it in Connecticut in 1968 . An abridged version was presented Off @-@ Off @-@ Broadway in 1978 by Equity Library Theatre . 
 In March 1994 a staged concert version was presented by New York City Center Encores ! , with a cast that included Stephen <unk> ( Joseph Taylor , Jr . ) , Karen Ziemba and Jonathan <unk> . Christopher Reeve was the narrator , and the concert was directed by Susan H. Schulman . A revised version of Allegro , re @-@ written by Joe DiPietro , who was a protege of Oscar 's son James Hammerstein , was produced at the Signature Theatre ( Arlington , Virginia ) in January 2004 . This version cut the musical in size and scale . The cast was cut with some characters being combined ; the original , lavish orchestrations were simplified . 
 The Canadian premiere of Allegro took place in 2004 , staged by the Toronto Civic Light @-@ Opera Company . With full orchestra and a cast of 30 , the production was designed and directed by Joe <unk> , and became one of the inspirations for the all @-@ star 2009 recording . It was attended by Ted Chapin , Bruce Pomahac and Dina Hammerstein , respectively , CEO of the Rodgers & Hammerstein organization , director of music for R & H , and Hammerstein 's daughter @-@ in @-@ law . The production was a major success , both artistically and financially for the company . 
 The Astoria Performing Arts Center in cooperation with Actor 's Equity mounted a production from May 1 – 17 , 2014 in Astoria , Queens , New York , Tom <unk> director . APAC has offices in the historic Kaufman Astoria Studios ; APAC 's performance space is located within the Good Shepherd United Methodist Church . 
 A 90 @-@ minute edited version directed by John Doyle was presented by the Classic Stage Company in New York City in November 2014 .

 = = = Musical treatment = = = 
 Although Allegro is filled with music , the music is fragmented , as the characters often break into song briefly . The character of Joe was unusual for a male lead of the time in having relatively little to sing ; Joe has only one solo number ( " A Darn Nice Campus " ) . Important songs are given to minor characters , such as " So Far " , given to Beulah , who only appears on the one date with Joe . Author and composer Ethan Mordden calls Rodgers 's technique " the deconstruction of theatre music , to match the show 's deconstruction of traditional theatre design " . 
 Rodgers 's music is more subtle than in his previous musicals , and his melodies more muted . The key changes are less dramatic than in other musicals of that time . Rodgers did not intend for the songs to become hits ; instead they were designed to draw the audience into the action , as onstage events were described subjectively in song .

 An original cast recording was released in 1947 , heavily abridged . According to Hischak , only Lisa Kirk as Emily shines on the recording , which he calls " sad evidences of a very ambitious undertaking " . Originally issued by RCA Victor Records on five 78s , sales were poor ; Victor did not reissue it on LP during the rapid transition from 78s to long @-@ playing records in 1949 – 1950 , when most record companies were hastily transferring their entire catalogues onto the new medium . The recording was made available briefly in simulated stereo in the 1960s , and was reissued in the 1970s in the original mono . The original cast recording was released on compact disc in 1993 . 
 A studio recording of the complete score was made in 2008 , with an all @-@ star cast featuring Patrick Wilson as Joe , Nathan Gunn and Audra McDonald as his parents , Marni Nixon as Grandma , Laura Benanti as Jennie , Liz Callaway as Emily , Judy Kuhn as <unk> , Norbert Leo Butz as Charlie , with special appearances by Stephen Sondheim , Schuyler Chapin and , through archival audio recordings , Oscar Hammerstein . The album , produced by Sony Masterworks Broadway , was released on February 3 , 2009 . According to musical theatre author John Kenrick , " this all star studio cast glorifies all that is right with this melodious and sometimes adventurous score " . 
 Vocalist Jo Stafford had a pop hit with ' The Gentleman Is A Dope ' in 1947 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The musical received mixed reviews following its opening night . The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson opined that Rodgers and Hammerstein had " just missed the final splendor of a perfect work of art " . Robert Coleman of the New York Daily Mirror stated that " Allegro is perfection " , and added that it was " a stunning blending of beauty , integrity , intelligence , imagination , taste and skill ... it lends new stature to the American musical stage " . Ward Morehouse of The Sun wrote that Allegro was " distinguished and tumultuous . It takes its place alongside of Oklahoma ! and Carousel as a theatrical piece of taste , imagination , and showmanship . " 
 However , Wolcott Gibbs of The New Yorker called the musical " a shocking disappointment " . Robert Garland , in the New York Journal American suggested that Rodgers and Hammerstein " had confused allegro [ which means at a fast pace ] with , say , lento , which means ' slow ' , ' unhurried ' , and even downright ' serious ' " . Critic George Jean Nathan , in a special piece in the Journal American , decried " such hokum mush as the familiar wedding scene and the ghost of a mother who returns at intervals to keep her son from error , but a cocktail party chatterbox number paraphrased from an old Noël Coward movie , a college number <unk> from an earlier George Abbott one , and various other elements hardly rivaling the daisy in freshness " . In Theatre Arts , Cecil Smith called Allegro " acceptable only as an exercise in stagecraft , not as a work of art ... Allegro fails where Our Town succeeded ... Joseph Taylor , Jr . ' s life has little or nothing to tell us about our own lives . " Louis <unk> of New York P.M. called the show " an out @-@ and @-@ out failure . " 
 De Mille 's direction and choreography were reviewed generally positively ; Cecil Smith applauded her for the " ease and flawless design with which Miss de Mille brings mobility to these non @-@ dancing [ singing and speaking choruses ] ... no previous musical has approached Allegro in consistency of movement , expertness of timing and shapeliness of visual patterns . Times dance critic John Martin stated , " Allegro has definitely made history " for de Mille 's giving " form and substance to material with little of either " . Dance Magazine praised her for creating " the illusion of space and depth far beyond the confines of the proscenium " . 
 As the disagreement continued past the opening night , Wayne Abrams wrote in the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , " Nobody is neutral about Allegro . The Hammerstein @-@ Rodgers @-@ de Mille musical play is either nigh unto perfection or a dismal flop . There 's that much room for disagreement . "

 Hammerstein was embittered by audience and critical reaction to his book , and felt they misunderstood it . Public perception was that Hammerstein had implied that small @-@ town folk were good while their big @-@ city cousins were neurotic and venal . The lyricist objected , pointing out that the worst character in the musical was a small @-@ town girl , but according to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin , " he knew it was his fault that the message was not clear . " In a preface to the published script , issued in 1948 , Hammerstein tried again to make his point : 
 It is a law of our civilization , that as soon as a man proves he can contribute to the well @-@ being of the world , there be created an immediate conspiracy to destroy his usefulness , a conspiracy in which he is usually a willing collaborator . Sometimes he awakens to his danger and does something about it . 
 According to Frederick Nolan , in his book about the pair 's music , " <unk> today , Allegro 's main fault seems to have been that it was ahead of its time , the integration of story and music far too advanced even for audiences now becoming accustomed to musicals which actually had stories . " Sondheim noted , " Allegro was an attempt to use epic theatre in contemporary musical theatre . It used a Greek chorus , and tried to tell the story of a life , not through events but through generalities . This is now what would be called a Brechtian approach . " 
 A decade after Allegro 's premiere , after learning of his fatal cancer , Hammerstein returned to the musical , hoping to correct its flaws , but he did not complete the project . While recording an oral history tape for Columbia University , Hammerstein stated , " I intended Dick to write music for it [ the chorus in Allegro ] but we wound up reciting the chorus instead ... I 'm not blaming anyone , because we all accepted it , we all collaborated ... but it was a mistake . " Rodgers later stated that the show was " too preachy , which was the one fault that Oscar had , if any , " and " [ n ] othing to be ashamed of , certainly " . Rodgers further defended the play , " The comments we made on the compromises demanded by success , as well as some of the satiric side issues — hypochondria , the empty cocktail party — still hold . " 
 The relative failure of Allegro reinforced the team 's determination to have another hit . Author James Michener recalled his meeting with the duo over the possibility of converting his book Tales of the South Pacific into a musical . " They were inwardly burning because of the reception accorded to Allegro . Those fellows were so mad I was fairly certain that they could make a great musical out of the Bronx telephone directory . " That project would become South Pacific and be a tremendous hit . 
 Hischak ties the failure of Allegro to a change in the pair 's style : 
 The failure of Allegro only partially tarnished the reputation of Rodgers and Hammerstein ; after all , it was a very respectable flop . Yet the long @-@ term repercussions were more serious . Never again would R & H experiment so boldly and risk losing their audience . They would continue to come up with surprising and wonderful things , but the days of radical and foolhardy innovation were over . From then on they would stick to the tried and true . Allegro marked the end of the R & H revolution .

 = Typhoon Irma ( 1981 ) = 
 Typhoon Irma , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Anding , was a powerful typhoon that struck the Philippines in November 1981 . The twenty @-@ fifth named storm and fourteenth typhoon of the 1981 Pacific typhoon season , Irma originated from an active monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines . The cyclone slowly developed as it moved westward . Following an increase in organization , the system was first classified on November 18 and was subsequently upgraded into a tropical storm on the next day . After passing near Guam , Irma continued to deepen , and was estimated to have attained typhoon intensity early on November 21 . The intensification rate accelerated thereafter , and on the afternoon of November 22 , Irma reached its peak wind speed of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . After maintaining this intensity for 16 hours , Irma weakened considerably due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of the Philippines . On the morning of November 24 , Irma moved ashore northeast of Manila , with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . The storm rapidly deteriorated overland , but was still believed to have been a typhoon when it emerged into the South China Sea . Typhoon Irma then began to re @-@ curve towards the northwest while weakening ; the cyclone was estimated to have obtained extratropical characteristics on November 26 . 
 Affecting an area already severely impacted by Typhoon Hazen , Typhoon Irma brought significant damage and flooding to the Philippines , especially in the province of Camarines Norte . Additionally , a 15 m ( 50 ft ) storm surge was noted in four towns in the Camarines Sur province , resulting in the deaths of 137 people . The nearby village of Benagaspasan was nearly demolished , where 47 fatalities occurred . In all , 595 were killed due to Irma . A total of 482 @,@ 678 persons were directly affected by Typhoon Irma . Irma destroyed or damaged 119 @,@ 233 dwellings , which left nearly 40 @,@ 000 homeless . A total of 24 @,@ 137 families or 141 @,@ 974 individuals left their homes , including 57 @,@ 198 that sought emergency shelter . Overall , damage totaled to $ 63 @.@ 3 million ( 1981 USD ) .

 Typhoon Irma originated from an active monsoon within the vicinity of Micronesia . The second of three storms to form within this region in mid @-@ November 1981 , the cyclone was first noted on November 10 as a " zone of strong convection activity " . Although the zone was well @-@ organized , there was initially little to no evidence of a low @-@ level circulation . However , a weak circulation was detected on a few days later , and on November 15 , the system was situated to the east of Ponape as satellite imagery indicated that convection was developing . During the next three days , thunderstorm activity waxed and waned as the disturbance moved north and then west . During this time , the disturbance was located 1 @,@ 100 km ( 685 mi ) east of Typhoon Hazen . By November 18 , shower activity had improved in both coverage and organization . That afternoon , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) for the disturbance . Within two hours , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began to track the system . 
 On the morning of November 19 , a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) , prompting the JTWC to classify the system as a tropical depression . After passing north of Guam , Irma was upgraded into a tropical storm by both agencies . Around this time , the JTWC expected that Irma would pass south of a front and then turn southwest . Tropical Storm Irma began to deepen more rapidly , and on November 20 , the JMA upgraded Irma into a severe tropical storm . Thereafter , Irma turned west as a subtropical ridge built north and northwest of the storm , which protected Irma from feeling the effects of strong wind shear . At 1800 UTC on November 20 , the JTWC upgraded Irma into a typhoon . Later that evening , a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) and a pressure of 968 mbar ( 28 @.@ 6 inHg ) . Following the formation of a 74 km ( 46 mi ) eye , the JMA declared that Irma attained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on November 21 ; subsequently , the system passed south of a second cold front . By 0900 UTC that day , rapid deepening to pressures below 925 mbar ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) was anticipated by the JTWC . At 1800 UTC on November 21 , the JMA raised the intensity of the typhoon to 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while the JTWC reported that Irma reached winds of 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) , equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the United States @-@ based Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ( SSHWS ) . Midday on November 22 , a Hurricane Hunter airplane reported a pressure of 905 mbar ( 25 inHg ) . Based on this the JTWC upgraded Irma into a super typhoon . Meanwhile , data from both the JTWC and JMA suggested that Irma reached its peak intensity , with the former reporting winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) and the latter reporting winds of 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) . On that day , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) also started to monitor the storm and assigned it with the local name Anding . 
 Irma maintained super typhoon intensity for 16 hours before gradually weakening due to the storm 's close proximity to the mountainous terrain of the Philippines . After turning northwest towards a break within the subtropical ridge , Irma moved ashore around 0900 UTC on November 24 , roughly 100 km ( 60 mi ) northeast of Manila . At the time of landfall , both agencies estimated winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , equal to Category 2 intensity on the SSHWS . Although the JTWC downgraded Irma to a tropical storm that afternoon just before entering the Lingayen Gulf and the South China Sea , the JMA maintained Irma at typhoon intensity throughout the storm 's passage of the Philippines . Ten hours later , a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Irma and noted that Irma was poorly organized , with most of the convection sheared off to the north of the center . Influenced by a trough east of Asia , Irma began to re @-@ curve into the Luzon Straits on November 25 . Around this time , the JMA downgraded Irma into a severe tropical storm . Early on November 26 , the JMA reported that Irma had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . About 24 hours later , Irma merged with a cold front in the Ryukyu Islands . On the evening of November 27 , both PASAGA and the JMA ceased monitoring Irma .

 A few days prior to Irma 's passage , the Philippines archipelago was affected by Typhoon Hazen , which left 2 @,@ 000 homeless . As Irma neared landfall , radio and television authorities warned residents to take precautions . Relief agencies were placed on standby . Schools were closed . Much of the Philippines , including the capital city of Manila , was placed on typhoon alert . 
 After striking the Philippines , the storm caused widespread damage while becoming the strongest storm to affect the archipelago since 1970 , which was also ironically also named Irma . The hardest hit was the province of Camarines Norte along the eastern portion of the island of Luzon . 
 A 15 m ( 50 ft ) storm surge hit the towns of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in the Camarines Sur province , situated roughly 230 km ( 145 mi ) southeast of Manila . Throughout the aforementioned four towns , 137 people were killed . Virtually every house was demolished due to storm surge in Benagaspasan , a small town with a population 1 @,@ 000 . A total of 47 killed in the village . Thirty @-@ seven were injured in <unk> as well . Fourteen survivors sought refuge in a health center 150 ft ( 46 m ) from the shore .

 Across much of Luzon , Irma flattened houses and flooding streets , resulting in considerable damage . Irma brought down power lines , which led to blackouts along the suburbs of Manila . One army officer died via electrocution while trying to fix the roof of his dwelling in Makati . Many other deaths occurred when they were crushed to death under collapsed houses or killed by flying debris . For instance , two people died when their house on Mindoro Island collapsed and a farmer in Quezon died after being hit by a falling coconut . Elsewhere on <unk> Island , 60 homes were destroyed . Offshore , eighteen fisherman were listed as missing . Twenty @-@ six of the casualties happened in Manila while 12 others died in the rural town of Daet along the southern part of Luzon due to flooding and falling debris . Due to the storm , iron sheets were littered across the slums of Manila . Communication lines between Daet and Manila were disconnected ; many villages between the two location were destroyed . In Lucena , two people were killed and many coconuts were tossed from trees . In Bulacan , civil defense officials advised thousands of inhabitants on the banks of the <unk> River to flee as water along the river threatened to overflow their banks . In the Rizal province , one agency reported that it dispatched several army trucks to fetch roughly 2 @,@ 000 stranded 12- to 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy scouts .

 = Chetwynd , British Columbia = 
 Chetwynd / <unk> / is a district municipality located on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northeastern British Columbia , Canada . Situated on an ancient floodplain , it is the first town eastbound travellers encounter after emerging from the Rockies along Highway 97 and acts as the gateway to the Peace River Country . The town developed during the construction of infrastructure through the Rocky Mountains in the 1950s , and was used as a transshipment point during the construction of hydroelectric dams in the 1960s and 1970s and the new town of Tumbler Ridge in the early 1980s . Home to approximately 2 @,@ 600 residents , the population has increased little if at all since the 1980s but is significantly younger than the provincial average . 
 Once known as Little Prairie , the community adopted its current name in honour of provincial politician Ralph L.T. Chetwynd , just prior to its incorporation in 1962 . The 64 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 25 sq mi ) municipality consists of the town , a community forest , and four exclave properties . Chetwynd has dozens of chainsaw carvings displayed throughout town as public art . It is home to a Northern Lights College campus . Nearby , there are four provincial parks , two lakes , and several recreational trails . 
 Highways 29 and 97 intersect in town ; the east @-@ west Highway 97 connect the town to Prince George and Dawson Creek while the north @-@ south Highway 29 connects Tumbler Ridge and Hudson 's Hope . A rail line branches off in three directions : northward to Fort St. John , east to Dawson Creek , and west through the Rockies to Prince George . Its economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry , fossil fuel extraction , and transportation . A member municipality of the Peace River Regional District , it is represented in provincial politics by Liberal MLA Mike Bernier . 
 = = History = = 
 From 1918 until the 1930s , the present townsite hosted a trading post on a grassy pasture known to the <unk> and Saulteaux as Little Prairie . In the 1920s , settlers from the Peace River Country began migrating westwards , across the frozen <unk> and Pine Rivers , to homestead . Little Prairie was homesteaded by Alexander and <unk> Windrem in 1930 and cleared the land by 1935 for hay , oats and gardens . Oil and coal discoveries , west of Little Prairie , near Commotion Creek , led to the construction of area roads . As the area 's natural resource potential became more apparent , a highway was planned in the late 1940s from the British Columbia Interior to the northern side of the Rocky and <unk> Mountains . The John Hart Highway , named after former B.C. Premier John Hart , was completed in 1952 ; designated Highway <unk> it stretches from Prince George to Dawson Creek , with an intersection at Little Prairie . This was northeastern BC 's first connection with the rest of the province ; previously a trip through the neighboring province of Alberta was required . Following the opening of the highway , businesses such as restaurants and service stations were opened in Little Prairie to accommodate incoming workers and settlers . The first school was built in 1951 . 
 Little Prairie was incorporated as a waterworks district on 8 October 1957 ; within the span of a few year a rail line , natural gas pipeline , and telephone line were built along the highway from Prince George . Provincial Minister of Railways Ralph L.T. Chetwynd ( who also directed the Pacific Great Eastern Railway ) headed the rail line project . The rail line continued eastward to Dawson Creek which was the western @-@ most terminus of Northern Alberta Railways . In early 1958 , the first train ceremonially arrived in Little Prairie from Vancouver . Its load included pipe to symbolize natural gas development , steel railway track for the extension of the rail line , box cars for grain and lumber , and a truck representing freight hauling along the Alaska Highway . The railway station in Little Prairie was completed in 1959 and named after Chetwynd , who had died two years earlier . Soon afterwards the post office adopted this name . Chetwynd became the community 's official name on 1 July 1959 . In 1960 the Chetwynd Waterworks District expanded its mandate to include garbage disposal , fire protection , and street lighting . Led by its Chamber of Commerce , the community incorporated as a municipality on 25 September 1962 . 
 Growth continued in the 1960s when the town served as the rail @-@ to @-@ truck transshipment point for delivering workers and supplies to the construction site of the <unk> Bennett Dam , in nearby Hudson 's Hope . <unk> and West Fraser Timber bought sawmills in 1964 and 1971 , respectively , and eventually became two of the town 's largest employers . The development of its forestry sector led to the town being declared the Canadian Forest Service 's 1992 Forestry Capital of Canada . The community opened a rodeo ground and curling rink in 1963 , a library in 1967 , a new fire hall in 1968 , an airport in 1970 and a hospital in 1971 . 
 Further growth was stoked in the late 1970s and early 1980s by the construction of the Peace Canyon Dam near the Bennett Dam , the opening of the natural gas and sulfur plant , and the construction of the mining town Tumbler Ridge . Chetwynd thus was re @-@ incorporated as a district in 1983 with a population of 2 @,@ 957 . With no more <unk> , Chetwynd 's population remained relatively stable at about 3 @,@ 000 , with a peak population in 1996 at 3 @,@ 113 . 
 On 4 December 1996 , Chetwynd 's boundaries were expanded to include 49 km ² ( 19 sq mi ) of forested land and industrial properties . Most of this came from moving the northern border up 210 metres ( 689 ft ) over Ol ' Baldy Ridge to create a community forest , a concept which originated from a Chetwynd Secondary School proposal in 1980 for a fitness trail . The trail became the backbone of a system of interconnected trails and greenspaces that went up the ridge . Four industrial properties — a gas plant , sulfur processing plant , coal mine , and pulp mill — became exclaves of the district as they incorporated to receive municipal services . The coal mine , with an expected lifespan of 15 years , was approved by the province for development in 1998 . It was not constructed until 2004 making it the province 's first new coal mine in 20 years . It only operated for 2 years before closing due to poor yields , equipment failure , and lack of financial backing . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Carved out of an ancient floodplain , the small terrace upon which Chetwynd is situated lies in the northern foothills of the Rocky Mountains . Once used as a grazing spot by nomadic Aboriginals , the terrace was farmed by settlers until it was developed into a town . Two types of soil — namely , the Widmark and Centurion Series — comprise the terrace 's surface . The Widmark Series — a moderately well @-@ drained degraded loamy , woody , silty , and clay @-@ like soil — lies north of Highway 97 . Meanwhile , the Centurion Series — which lies south of the highway — is a poorly drained soil with a dark @-@ brown peaty surface material consisting of decomposed leaves and mosses . These soils , also limited by topography and stoniness , are generally used for forage and pasture . 
 The town is surrounded by forested hills but the prairies of the Peace River Country begin here and continue eastward into Alberta . It lies in a transition area dividing two biogeoclimatic regions : the Boreal White and Black Spruce zone and the Engelmann Spruce @-@ Subalpine Fir zone . The area 's native tree species include deciduous balsam poplar and coniferous spruce and pine . Many fur @-@ bearing animals — deer , moose , elk , beaver , and bear — comprise the region 's mammalian wildlife . Three creeks run south through town . Windrem Creek — which flows down from Ol ' Baldy Mountain — and Widmark Creek both flow into Centurion Creek , which itself drains south into the Pine River . 
 The town experiences a cool continental climate , including frigid winters and warm summers . Southwesterly winds , coming off Williston Lake , predominate , with wind speeds averaging around 8 @.@ 2 km / h ( 5 @.@ 1 mph ) . About 318 millimetres ( 12 @.@ 5 in ) of rain and 169 centimetres ( 67 in ) of snow fall on the town annually and about 30 days with some fog are expected per year . Chetwynd , like the rest of the Peace River Regional District , uses Mountain Standard Time year @-@ round . The remainder of the province uses Pacific Standard Time with daylight saving time , meaning that Chetwynd shares the same time with the province during the summer and is one hour ahead during the winter . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 An initial 1958 population estimate , associated with Chetwynd 's application for incorporation , recorded 750 residents — inclusive of nearby work camps . The 1966 Canadian census , the first to define Chetwynd as a distinct subdivision , counted 1 @,@ 368 residents . Subsequent census counts documented a low of 1 @,@ 260 people in 1971 before a population boom between 1977 and 1983 during the construction of Tumbler Ridge and the Peace Canyon Dam . The population count slowly declined for the remainder of the 1980s before rising to a high of 3 @,@ 113 in 1996 ; nevertheless , the population declined in the late 1990s during the <unk> softwood lumber dispute when several mills either scaled back production or closed . 
 According to the 2006 Canadian census , Chetwynd had 2 @,@ 633 residents living in 1 @,@ 025 households . With a median age four years lower than the province 's , the population of Chetwynd is young . About 6 % more people were single ( and never married ) and 4 % less lived in lone @-@ parent households than the province 's proportion . According to the 2001 and 2006 census , while Chetwynd had an increase of 35 families , it had a decrease of 85 lone @-@ parent families and an increase of the same number of common @-@ law families . During the same period , the portion of dwellings being owned shifted from 50 % to 62 % , while the provincial proportion rose from 67 % to 70 % . The last complete census , the 2001 Canadian census , found that less than 5 % of Chetwynd residents were foreign @-@ born , and 90 % of residents had an English @-@ only mother tongue . While not counted as visible minorities during the census , 670 people considered themselves to have an Aboriginal identity , much higher than the provincial 4 % average . 
 The nine officer Chetwynd Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment , which covered the municipality and nearby rural communities , reported 981 Criminal Code offences in 2005 . This translated into a crime rate of 158 Criminal Code offences per 1 @,@ 000 people , higher than both the previous year 's rate of 142 and the 2005 provincial average of 125 . In 2004 , compared to the provincial average , Chetwynd had tripled the rates of reported impaired driving and cocaine @-@ related offences . Conversely , Chetwynd had much lower rates of robbery , bicycle theft , and theft from motor vehicle . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Chetwynd is the commercial centre for the rural communities of the Pine River Valley , as well as Moberly Lake , <unk> Lake , and Lone Prairie . These rural residents are mostly cattle , sheep , and bison ranchers and use the town as a transportation hub to ship their products via highways or rail . After the 1950 – 1980 boom period , the town 's economy has been bolstered by primary industries , including lumber mills ( West Fraser Mills , Canadian Forest Industries , <unk> Pulp Mill ) , gas plants ( Duke Energy , Talisman Energy ) , a coal processing plant ( Pine Valley Mining ) , and a sulfur processing plant ( <unk> ) . Since the late 1990s , Chetwynd has undergone an economic downturn from the closure of coal mines in Tumbler Ridge and the softwood lumber trade dispute between Canada and the United States , which led to the closure of the Louisiana @-@ Pacific Canada Pulp Company pulp operations in 2001 . The 2001 census recorded 1 @,@ 120 income @-@ earners over the age of 15 residing in Chetwynd ; of these , 690 worked full @-@ time throughout the year . Since then , the economy has rebounded with increased oil , gas and mineral exploration , tourist marketing of the area 's outdoor recreational activities and chainsaw carvings program , new and re @-@ opened coal mines , and wind farm construction . The Dokie Ridge Wind Farm is under construction and is expected to be completed in 2011 . 
 = = Education = = 
 The 2001 census estimated that only 10 % of people in Chetwynd between 20 and 64 years old graduated from a university , less than half of the 24 % provincial average and 26 % did not graduate from secondary school , 6 % higher than the provincial average . Chetwynd 's schools are administered by School District 59 Peace River South , which operates one secondary school and three primary schools . Chetwynd Secondary School had a 2003 enrollment of 516 people and a 2009 enrollment of 412 students , with declining enrollment figures projected to continue into the next decade . The three primary schools are Don Titus Elementary , Windrem Elementary , Little Prairie Elementary which had a combined 2003 enrollment of 630 children . Northern Lights College maintains a campus in Chetwynd , which has a 2003 enrollment of 170 students ( based on full @-@ time equivalents ) . It was established in 1976 with eight general interest and two university transfer courses . Today , the programs and courses offered at the Chetwynd campus are oriented towards training students for work in the local primary industries , including most trades and also Engineering as well as a variety of other minor courses ranging from music to babysitting . 
 = = Infrastructure = = 
 The John Hart Highway portion of Highway 97 runs east @-@ west through Chetwynd , connecting the town to Dawson Creek ( 102 km or 67 mi east ) and Prince George ( 304 km or 185 mi south ) . Highway 29 ( Don Philips Way ) runs north @-@ south through Chetwynd , connecting the town to Hudson 's Hope ( 60 km or 34 mi north ) and Tumbler Ridge ( 89 km or 47 mi southeast ) . The downtown core lies just west of the intersection of Highway 97 and Highway 29 . Chetwynd 's internal street network has 28 km or 17 mi of paved road which uses the highway as its main arterial road with parallel frontage roads for local trips . A site plan by the province in 1957 laid out the basic structure of the town . The residential areas are separated from the industry and the highway by the use of natural features , such as contours or creeks , and vegetative buffers . 
 Chetwynd has rail , air , and bus service for regional and provincial transportation needs . Rail lines enter Chetwynd from three directions : from Fort St. John in the north , from Dawson Creek in the east , and from Prince George in the south . Pacific Great Eastern Railway ( later BC Rail ) ran passenger service to Chetwynd until 1990 . Since then the trains have been used solely for moving resources such as lumber and coal . The District of Chetwynd has operated the unmanned Chetwynd Municipal Airport ( IATA : <unk> ) since 1970 . The runway was paved in 1975 but only handles chartered flights and helicopters . A new airport terminal was constructed in 2008 by students at Northern Lights College . The closest airports with commercial airlines are at Fort St. John and Dawson Creek . Greyhound Bus Lines maintain a bus stop in town on their Vancouver @-@ Prince George @-@ Dawson Creek route . 
 The District uses the northeast @-@ flowing Pine River as both a source of drinking water and an outlet for sewage . The former comes from an intake pipe southwest of town . Its sewerage consists of 28 kilometres ( 17 mi ) of sanitary sewers and 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) of storm sewers . Raw sewage is processed by a five @-@ cell lagoon system and released into the Pine River south of town . The water supply was briefly shut off in 2000 when oil pipeline along the Pine River ruptured spilling 6 @,@ 200 barrels ( 990 m3 ) of oil into the river . Electricity is supplied by BC Hydro from the Bennett and Peace Canyon Dams and natural gas by Pacific Northern Gas .

 The Little Prairie Heritage Museum , located in one of the town 's oldest buildings ( a converted post office dating to 1949 ) displays artifacts and re @-@ creations of the town 's frontier times , and nostalgia pieces from the construction of infrastructure through the Rocky Mountains . A public art program , started in 1987 , showcases over 50 chainsaw carvings spread throughout town with a downtown monument that declares Chetwynd the " Chainsaw Sculpture Capitol of the World " . The town 's first annual chainsaw carving contest was held in June 2005 . A regular contestant in the Communities in Bloom contest , the District built four wind turbines in 2004 to power decorative lights on 25 large trees along its boulevard as an entry to the <unk> Celebration contest . A statue of a lumberjack entitled " Chetwynd , the Little Giant of the Great Peace " , measuring 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 9 ft ) tall and located alongside the highway , has stood in the town since 1967 . The statue has been periodically altered by replacing the ax with other accessories , such as a lasso , rifle , gold pan and pitchfork , or dressed in other outfits , like a Santa suit . In 2009 the original statue was replaced with a wood carving facsimile , intended to reflect the popularity of the annual chainsaw carving event . 
 For outdoor recreation , a community forest on Mount Baldy provides residents with trails for walking , hiking , cycling , and cross @-@ country skiing close to home . There is downhill skiing about 100 km ( 60 mi ) west of town ( and closer to the Rocky Mountains ) at the Powder King Mountain Resort . Nearby provincial parks include Gwillim Lake Provincial Park ( 56 km , 35 mi southeast ) , Moberly Lake Provincial Park ( 25 km , 16 mi northwest ) , Pine River Breaks Provincial Park ( 15 km , 9 mi east ) , and East Pine Provincial Park ( 30 km , 19 mi east ) . Chetwynd has a large indoor rodeo facility , an outdoor speed skating oval , and a general recreation complex with an ice arena , wave pool , six @-@ lane curling rink , two baseball diamonds , and a skateboard park . It has recently been renovated and now contains a rock climbing wall , indoor walking track and fitness center . Smart Growth BC ranked the town as one of BC 's most livable municipalities in 2004 , due mainly to its large park spaces .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge . First held in 1829 , the competition is a 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) race along the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 2003 race by 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) , with Cambridge leading overall with 77 victories to Oxford 's 71 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . The race was sponsored by Aberdeen Asset Management for the fifth and final time . It was also the BBC 's 50th anniversary of live broadcast of the event . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race .

 = The 12 Days of Christine = 
 " The 12 Days of Christine " is the second episode of the second series of British dark comedy anthology series Inside No. 9 . It first aired on 2 April 2015 on BBC Two . It was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith , and directed by Guillem Morales . The episode tells the story of Christine , a young woman living in a small flat , over 12 years in her life , focussing on key days and life events in that time . Christine is played by Sheridan Smith , while those who play an important part in her life are played variously by Tom Riley , Stacy Liu , Michele Dotrice , Paul Copley , Pemberton , Jessica Ellerby , Jack Little and Dexter Little . Shearsmith plays the Stranger , an unknown figure apparently haunting Christine . 
 " The 12 Days of Christine " departed from the usual black comedy of Inside No. 9 to instead focus on drama . The story was interpreted in a number of different ways by commentators , who differed in their understanding of Christine 's life and confused perspective , and the identity of the Stranger . Reviewers responded extremely positively to the episode , which was awarded five out of five stars in both The Times and The Telegraph . Critics variously commended the performances of the actors , particularly Smith , the poignancy of the plot , and the impact of the unforeseen ending . 
 = = Production = = 
 The second series of Inside No. 9 was written in 2014 , and then filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015 . " The 12 Days of Christine " follows the life of Christine over 12 years , with the story told through scenes showing the key events in that time . Shearsmith described this as a very unusual episode structure and storytelling method , but felt that , in this case , it was effective . Upon penning the script , Pemberton and Shearsmith immediately thought of Sheridan Smith as a performer who would be suitable to play Christine . Both had previously worked with her , and the pair hoped that she would be willing to accept the role . Smith had been a long @-@ time fan of the writers ' work , and enjoyed the way the format of Inside No. 9 allows standalone stories . She was " gripped " by the script , and accepted the role ; during filming , she said she was " over the moon " to be working with Pemberton and Shearsmith . 
 As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters , the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series . " The 12 Days of Christine " starred Smith as Christine , around whom the story revolves . Adam , Christine 's partner , was played by Tom Riley , and Stacy Liu played Fung , Christine 's roommate . Christine 's parents — Marion and Ernie — were played by Michele Dotrice and Paul Copley , while Christine 's son Jack was played by Joel Little and Dexter Little . Christine 's colleague Bobby was played by Pemberton , and Adam 's colleague Zara was played by Jessica Ellerby . Shearsmith plays the Stranger , a mysterious man who repeatedly appears to Christine . For the second series on Inside No. 9 , Pemberton and Shearsmith were permitted to build two sets ; the first was for " La Couchette " , the first episode of the series , and the second was for " The 12 Days of Christine " . The two were built alongside each other at Twickenham Studios . Smith described the fake flat as " lovely " , explaining that it was " a full set ; bedroom , bathroom , working taps – everything " . She considered the flat 's 1970s decor " really cool " and " funky " .

 = = Analysis = = 
 " The 12 Days of Christine " was a departure from the typical " claustrophobic black comedy " of Inside No. 9 ; the episode has more limited use of humour , though comedic elements do remain . For John Dugdale , writing in The Sunday Times , it resembled an arthouse film . From the beginning of the episode , there are clues to the content of the closing scenes , including the sound of a heartbeat , sounds associated with cars , and blue flashing lights . There are also a number of allusions to horror films ; Fung is referred to as " the grudge " , the Stranger 's appearance evokes Don 't Look Now and the throwing of eggs may be associated with Ghostbusters . The name " Christine " , too , can be seen as a reference to Stephen King 's Christine . 
 = = = Interpretation = = = 
 For Chris Bennion , writing in The Independent , the events of " The 12 Days of Christine " are a life review ; the viewer shares Christine 's visions of her life as she lies dying . However , like Christine , the viewer does not realise this until the end . For Bennion , Christine does not merely relive key moments of her life , but attempts to " snatch at lost moments " as she longs " for second chances " . Julie McDowall , who reviewed the episode for The Herald , also considers the viewer " totally immersed in one character 's confused and flawed point of view " . She argued that " there was no thunderclap moment when the story 's twist is spectacularly revealed . There was just the slow and terrible realisation which we shared with Christine . We were with her , thinking ' Oh god no , not that . Don 't let it be that ! ' " Ultimately , claims McDowall , the oddities and confusion in the episode 's plot is revealed to be the product of Christine 's " brain slowly fading , her memories blinking out , light by light , into darkness " . Phoebe @-@ Jane Boyd , whose review of the episode was published on entertainment website Den of Geek , likewise saw the episode as Christine 's life flashing before her eyes , with a variety of elements from the scene of the crash — police cars , car sounds , the song on the radio — indicative of " her consciousness ... becoming muddled as parts of the car accident crash through into her memories " . 
 Andrew Billen argued that the episode used the link between the " breaches of realism " in ghost stories and the " transgressions " of comedy in order " to make a serious statement about the supernatural " . For him , the episode was a story about " human memory 's spasmodic grasp " and Christine 's " friable mental condition " . The fact that Christine has forgotten about the death of her first boyfriend — that Christine has a " memory like a sieve " — is , for Billen , " inexplicable " . The haunting element of the story , Billen suggests , is indicative of mental illness ; specifically , Christine 's early @-@ onset Alzheimer 's disease . That Christine is afflicted with the condition means that her life has become a " nightmare version " of blind man 's buff . The motif of blindness — Christine 's mental blindness juxtaposed with physical blindness — again emerges with the recurrence of " Con te partirò " , performed by Andrea Bocelli , who is blind . Billen conceded that his interpretation may be incorrect , and that the episode may have been a single " dying dream " . McDowall noted that , with Christine 's growing unhappiness and increasingly disheveled appearance as the episode progresses , it is easy to see the story as about a mental collapse . 
 The episode can also be seen as a story of revenge ; it can be imagined that Christine has repressed the memory of her first boyfriend , and that he " has come back into her life seeking revenge " . On this interpretation , the Stranger is the boyfriend , and causes the crash by stepping out in front of Christine 's car . McDowall suggests that the oddness early in the episode suggests that the story may be about " an obsessive ex [ or ] a stalker " . There is also indication that the episode is a ghost story . While Boyd sees this as misdirection on the part of the writers , for Benji Wilson , writing in the Daily Telegraph , the story is about ghosts , " but not in the normal way – by the close you realised everyone 's life is a ghost story , it ’ s just that your memories are the ghosts . "

 " The 12 Days of Christine " was extremely well received by television critics . It was awarded five out of five stars by Billen ( The Times ) and Wilson ( Daily Telegraph ) , who , respectively , called it a " masterpiece " and " a quiet elegy , terse and polished , in many ways perfect " . Comedy critic Bruce Dessau said he could not " speak highly enough of this episode " , while McDowall ( The Herald and The National ) said it was the " best thing [ she had ] seen all year " , and " surely the best thing the ingenious Shearsmith and Pemberton have done " . Bennion ( The Independent ) finished his review of the episode by saying that Inside No. 9 was " one of the best pieces of British television in years " , and , in a review in i , the episode was described as " <unk> good " . After the conclusion of the second series , Victoria Segal and Julia Raeside , writing in The Sunday Times , described " The 12 Days of Christine " as " emotionally affecting and brilliantly crafted " , highlighting it as the strongest episode in the series . 
 David Chater , writing in The Times , said " The 12 Days of Christine " was " not quite perfect " , as the " spooky " elements suggested that the writers " may have spent more time with The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville than is strictly healthy " . Nonetheless , he felt that " the episode is a distillation of accurate observation that says more about the hope , messiness and disappointment of life in half an hour than most dramas say over an entire series " . There was , he thought , " something infinitely poignant " about the way the episode showed the difference between what could have been and what was . 
 For Bennion , it was " a credit to the two creators that they can pack in such a depth of emotion into 29 minutes " . Similarly , Wilson praised the writers for achieving " genuine poignancy " in half an hour , and critics in the Metro said that the episode " packs more drama and suspense into 30 minutes than many a five @-@ part series " . Mulkern said the episode was a " superb piece of drama , imbued with an increasing sense of dread " . The story 's ending was praised , with Dessau saying that " One of the skills of actor / writers Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton is the way they plant seeds and gradually leak out details . They do it so expertly here that one really doesn 't see what is coming . " McDowall expressed a similar thought , saying that the " writers so cleverly threw us off the scent , making the eventual realisation so agonising " . Wilson called the ending " devastating and unforeseen " . 
 Bennion praised the performances of Smith and Riley , but said that Smith was " undoubtedly " the star of the show . Vicki Power , writing for the Daily Telegraph , agreed that Smith was the star , calling her " brilliant " , while Patrick Mulkern , writing for Radio Times , said that Smith offered " another multi @-@ faceted , stunning performance as the troubled Christine " . Chater said that Smith 's role was " superbly performed , as always " , and Billen said that Smith offered " tragic depth " to her character . Wilson commended Smith 's " arresting performance " , saying that " No one does girl @-@ next @-@ door naturalism better – she has the actor 's elixir of making you think you know her , just by a smile or an inflection . " Dessau commended the writers for allowing other actors to play the lead roles , praising the performances of Ridley and , especially , Smith . 
 Critics commended the episode 's music , with Mulkern comparing the use of " Con te partirò " in " The 12 Days of Christine " to its use in Benidorm , in which Pemberton starred , but noted that in " The 12 Days of Christine " it was used " with devastating effect " . Ellen E Jones , writing in The Independent , said that the song " was deployed on the soundtrack to devastating effect - we 'll be humming it uneasily for another 12 days to come . " Writers for i said that viewers would be " mournfully humming " the song " for 12 days to come " . 
 = Connie Smith = 
 Connie Smith ( born Constance June Meador ; August 14 , 1941 ) is an American country music artist . Active since 1964 , Smith is widely considered to be one of the genre 's best female vocalists . She has earned 11 Grammy award nominations , 20 top ten Billboard country singles , and 31 charting albums , three of which have hit number one . On October 21 , 2012 , Smith became the 12th solo female vocalist and 19th woman to be elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame . 
 Despite her success , Smith is considered by some music critics to be one of the most underrated vocalists in country music history due to the decision not to pursue super stardom with the non @-@ country general media market like such contemporaries as Loretta Lynn , Dolly Parton , and Tammy Wynette . Artists such as Parton , George Jones , and Chely Wright have cited Smith as either one of the best vocalists in the music industry or their favorite female artist . Eddie Stubbs of Nashville radio station WSM and the Grand Ole Opry has dubbed Smith " The Rolls @-@ Royce of Country Singers . " With this being said , Smith has stated on numerous occasions that country legend Loretta Lynn is her favourite country singer ever . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Connie Smith was born Constance June Meador on August 14 , 1941 , in Elkhart , Indiana ; the daughter of Wilma and Hobart Meador . Her parents were originally from West Virginia , and when Smith was five months old , the family returned there . They would later move to Dungannon , Ohio . Her father was abusive when she was a child , which would eventually cause her to suffer a mental breakdown when she was a teenager . When she was seven , her mother divorced her father and married Tom Clark . Clark brought 8 children to the new marriage ; Meador brought five , including Smith . The couple would eventually have two more children together , which in total added up to fifteen children . As a child , Smith was surrounded by music . Her stepfather played mandolin , while her brother played fiddle , and her other brother played guitar . On Saturday nights Smith would listen to the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcast . While she was a teenager , she was injured in a lawnmower accident , which nearly cut her leg off . While in the hospital recovering , she was given a guitar and learned how to play different chords . Following the recovery , she began to perform in various local talent contests . In 1959 , Smith graduated from Salem @-@ Liberty High School as the class salutatorian . 
 In August 1963 , she entered a talent contest at the Frontier Ranch country music park near Columbus , Ohio . Performing Jean Shepard 's " I Thought of You " , Smith won the talent contest and five silver dollars . That day at the park , country artist Bill Anderson heard Smith perform and was impressed by her voice . In January 1964 , Smith ran into Anderson again at a country music package concert , where he invited her to perform with him on Ernest Tubb 's Midnight Jamboree program in Nashville , Tennessee . After performing on the program , Smith returned to Nashville that May to record demos by Anderson that he planned on pitching to other country artists . Anderson 's manager Hubert Long brought the demo recording to RCA Victor Records , where producer Chet Atkins heard it . Also impressed by her vocals , Atkins offered Smith a recording contract , and she eventually signed with the label on June 24 , 1964 .

 Because Chet Atkins found himself too busy with other artists , Bob Ferguson acted as Smith 's producer on her first sessions and would continue to work as her producer until her departure from RCA . Smith 's first session took place on July 16 , 1964 , where she recorded four songs , three of which were written by Bill Anderson . One of the four songs recorded during the session entitled " Once a Day " was chosen to be Smith 's debut single . The song was rush @-@ released as a single on August 1 , 1964 and became Smith 's breakout single , reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart on November 28 and remained at the number one position for eight weeks . 
 " Once a Day " became the first debut single by a female country artist to reach number one . For nearly 50 years the single held the record for the most weeks spent at number one on the Billboard country chart by a female artist . RCA Victor released Smith 's self @-@ titled debut album in March 1965 which also reached No. 1 , spending seven weeks at the top of the Billboard Top Country Albums chart , and spending 30 weeks on the chart overall . In addition , the album also peaked at No. 105 on the Billboard 200 albums chart around the same time . Dan Cooper of Allmusic called the production of the album to sound as if she was " a down @-@ home Streisand fronting The Lennon Sisters . " During this time , Anderson wrote a series of singles that would jump @-@ start Smith 's career in the country music industry . Among these songs was Smith 's follow @-@ up single to " Once a Day " released in early 1965 titled " Then and Only Then " . The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard country chart . In addition , its B @-@ side , " Tiny Blue Transistor Radio " ( originally intended for Skeeter Davis ) , was also written by Anderson and peaked within the Top 25 on the same singles chart . 
 In 1965 Smith officially became a member of the Grand Ole Opry radio show in Nashville , Tennessee . It had been a dream of Smith 's to become a member since childhood , remembering saying at the age of five , " Someday I ’ m gonna sing on the Grand Ole Opry . " In the mid @-@ 60s Smith was temporarily fired from the Grand Ole Opry for not being on the show for twenty six weeks out of the year , which was the required amount of weeks to stay a member at the time . In the 1970s , Smith was nearly fired from the show for testifying about Jesus Christ . 
 Bill Anderson wrote her next single with Bette Anderson , which was released in April 1965 called " I Can 't Remember " . The single peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart and No. 30 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart . In October 1965 , Smith released her second studio album Cute ' n ' Country . The album featured both cover versions of other country songs and newer songs written by Bill Anderson . It included cover versions of songs by such artists as Jim Reeves , Webb Pierce , and Ray Price . Like her first album , Cute ' n ' Country reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and spent thirty weeks on the chart as well . Her next two singles , " If I Talk to Him " and " Nobody But a Fool ( Would Love You ) " , both reached No. 4 on the Hot Country Singles chart and were issued on Smith 's third album , Miss Smith Goes to Nashville ( 1966 ) . The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart . With her next few sessions , Smith 's producer Bob Ferguson felt pressured from RCA headquarters in New York City to market Smith 's sound toward more " middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road " country pop material . This change of sound was evident on her next two studio albums Born to Sing ( 1966 ) and Downtown Country ( 1967 ) . Both albums featured full orchestras in the background and cover versions of singles by pop artists of the time . Spawned from Born to Sing and Downtown Country were the singles " Ain 't Had No Lovin ' " and " The Hurtin 's All Over " , which both peaked within the Top 5 on the Hot Country Singles chart . 
 During this time , Smith also appeared in several country music vehicle films , where she performed many of her current hit recordings . In 1966 , she appeared in the films Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar and The Las Vegas Hillbillys , the latter of which starred Jayne Mansfield . In 1967 , she appeared in The Road to Nashville and Hell on Wheels . 
 In February 1967 , Smith released an album on RCA Camden entitled Connie in the Country , which mainly featured cover versions of country hits recorded at the time , including songs by Loretta Lynn and Buck Owens . In May 1967 Smith released an album of songs written entirely by Bill Anderson entitled Connie Smith Sings Bill Anderson . Smith later commented that , " ... it was an honor , not a favor " to record an album of all Bill Anderson songs . Included in the album was covers of Anderson 's own hits such as " City Lights " and " That 's What It 's Like to Be Lonesome " . Also featured was Anderson 's " I Love You Drops " , which Smith wanted to release as a single ; however Anderson wanted to release the song as his own single . Smith stated , " We begged him for that song . But I cut 33 of his songs . " It would later become a top ten hit for Anderson . Between 1966 and 1968 , Smith had five top ten singles in a row on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart : " I 'll Come Running " ( which Smith wrote herself ) , " Cincinnati , Ohio " , " Burning a Hole in My Mind " , " Baby 's Back Again " , and " Run Away Little Tears " . " Cincinnati , Ohio " would later inspire the city of Cincinnati , Ohio to declare their own " Connie Smith Day " in June 1967 . 
 = = = 1968 – 1972 : New directions = = = 
 By 1968 , Smith began to feel large amounts of pressure from the music business . The stress of touring , recording , promoting , and trying to keep a personal life led Smith to contemplate the possibility of suicide . Although she thought about suicide , Smith later clarified that she never saw the idea as an actual possibility . These pressures eventually led Smith to seek solace in both her family life and religion , becoming a Born Again Christian in the spring of 1968 . Although she did not give up her music career completely , Smith did balance it with a lighter schedule in order to avoid stress . In 1968 and 1969 , Smith also began to record darker songs , including the single " Ribbon of Darkness " , among others . Smith stated that it was reflection on her personal life , after recently divorcing her first husband Jerry Smith . Despite her recent personal troubles , Smith continued to enjoy the same commercial success she had before . In 1969 her next single " You and Your Sweet Love " ( written by Bill Anderson ) reached No. 6 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart . This was followed by another top ten single in 1970 , entitled " I Never Once Stopped Loving You " , which reached No. 5 on the same singles chart . Between 1969 and 1970 , Smith released two collaborative albums with American country artist Nat Stuckey called Young Love and Sunday Morning with Nat Stuckey and Connie Smith , the latter of which was a gospel album . 
 Between 1970 and 1971 , both the singles " Louisiana Man " and " Where Is My Castle " became top 20 hits on the Billboard Magazine country singles chart . In 1971 Smith 's cover of Don Gibson 's 1960 single " Just One Time " reached No. 2 on the Hot Country Singles chart . An album of the same name was also released , which reached No. 20 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart . By the early 1970s , Smith started to incorporate more Gospel music into her regular studio albums and touring show . Smith later stated that by incorporating more Gospel music into her secular recording career would make her leap into Christianity " count " . In 1971 , she released her third gospel album , Come Along and Walk with Me , which Smith later stated was her favorite gospel record out of the many she has made . 
 In 1972 , all three of Smith 's singles reached the top ten on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart : " Just for What I Am " ( # 5 ) , " If It Ain 't Love ( Let 's Leave It Alone ) " ( # 7 ) , and " Love Is the Look You 're Looking for " ( # 8 ) . In addition , three albums were also released to accommodate the success of the three singles , including a tribute to songwriter Dallas Frazier named If It Ain 't Love and Other Great Dallas Frazier Songs . In November 1972 , Smith announced she would depart from RCA the same week that country artist Eddy Arnold also announced his temporary departure . Smith later explained in an interview with Razor & Tie that she felt RCA showed a lack of respect for her and she felt she would have been happier recording elsewhere . 
 = = = 1973 – 1979 : Later career = = = 
 After parting ways with RCA , Smith moved to Columbia Records in 1973 . With her new contract , she insisted that she would be able to record one gospel album a year . She released her first gospel album under the her label in November 1973 , entitled God Is Abundant . In addition , the label also gave her the advantage of being able to incorporate more gospel songs into her regular country studio albums . Because of these factors , most of her singles remained out of the top ten , but she did manage to stay in the top 20 most of the decade . That year Smith recorded her first country album for the label entitled A Lady Named Smith with producer George Richey . Smith and Richey co @-@ wrote the album 's lead single , " You 've Got Me ( Right Where You Want Me ) " , which became a minor hit on the Billboard country chart . However Smith was dissatisfied with Richey 's production strategies and replaced him with Ray Baker for her next album , That 's the Way Love Goes ( 1974 ) . Her next single ( released on That 's the Way Love Goes ) was written by Dallas Frazier called " Ain 't Love a Good Thing " , which peaked at No. 10 on the Hot Country Singles Chart in 1974 . 
 After signing with Columbia , many music critics considered that Smith lost much of the quality that was found in her earlier records with RCA Victor . When reviewing her compilation from her years at Columbia titled Connie Smith Sings Her Hits ( 1997 ) , Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that Smith lost much of the " grain " in her voice . Jurek went on to write , " It could be said , that regardless of the material , she never made a bad record ; the tunes were carefully chosen it 's true , but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style . " In 1974 Smith released the singles " I Never Knew ( What That Song Meant Before ) " and " I 've Got My Baby on My Mind " , which both reached No. 13 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart . In 1975 , she released her second gospel album with the label , entitled Connie Smith Sings Hank Williams Gospel , which was a tribute to the gospel material that Hank Williams recorded . That year , she also released a cover of Williams ' secular " Why Don 't You Love Me ( Like You Used to Do ) " as a single . In 1976 , Smith released two cover versions of previously @-@ made pop hits by The Everly Brothers as singles : " ( Till ) I Kissed You " and " So Sad ( To Watch Good Love Go Bad ) " . After releasing two more studio albums in 1976 , Smith parted ways with Columbia Records the following year . 
 In 1977 Smith moved to Monument Records . With her new recording contract , she was marketed as country pop artist and was pressured into recording softer material . While reviewing Smith 's 1993 Monument compilation Greatest Hits on Monument , Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that she not only recorded country @-@ pop material , but also " heavily produced adult contemporary ballads and big , shiny disco @-@ influenced pop numbers . " Meanwhile , both of Smith 's albums under the label stiffed upon release . Her debut 1977 Monument album , Pure Connie Smith , only spawned one single , entitled " Coming Around " , which peaked outside the Top 40 . Only one single released on the label became a significant hit , a cover of Andy Gibb 's 1977 pop hit " I Just Want to Be Your Everything " , which peaked at No. 14 on the country singles chart in 1978 . Smith 's next five singles on the label continued to descend into progressively lower positions on the country singles chart and because of poor record sales , Smith decided to go into semi @-@ retirement in 1979 to raise her five children . 
 = = = 1998 – present : Comeback and current activities = = = 
 Smith was encouraged to restart her mainstream career in 1985 with a new recording contract to Epic Records . The label released two singles over the course of two years . The first single , " A Far Cry from You " ( 1985 ) , was written by Alternative country artist Steve Earle and reached No. 71 on the Hot Country Singles chart . The second single did not chart and Epic failed to release any further singles or an album . In 1986 , she made a cameo appearance in Stephen King 's horror film Maximum Overdrive as " dead lady in car " . 
 One day in the mid @-@ 1990s , Smith was at her home talking to one of her daughters on the phone . After telling her mother what she was going to that night , her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were . Because she did not have anything fun planned , Smith lied so her daughter wouldn 't have to worry about her . After the conversation ended , Smith realized that she didn 't need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career . With country artist Marty Stuart ( whom she later married in 1997 ) , acting as the album 's main producer , Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 . Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets , Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album . In October 1998 she released her second self @-@ titled studio album . Consisting of ten tracks , nine of them were co @-@ written by both Smith and Stuart . Although the album attracted little attention , it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style . Kurt Wolff of the book Country Music : The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded " far gutsier than anything in the Reba and Garth mainstream " . Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars , calling it " a solid effort " , also commenting , " ... it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that 's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade . Even if it doesn 't sell a copy , it 's a triumphant return for Smith . She hasn 't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer . " 
 Also in 1998 , Smith made a second cameo appearance in a film , portraying a " Singer at the Rodeo Dance " in The Hi @-@ Lo Country starring Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup . 
 In August 2003 , Smith released a collaborative gospel album with country artists Barbara Fairchild and Sharon White called Love Never Fails on <unk> Records . In an interview with Country Stars Central , Smith said that she was ill with the stomach flu while recording the album , but , still enjoyed making the record , Produced by country and bluegrass artist Ricky Skaggs ( White 's husband ) , the album received a nomination from the Dove Awards . The website <unk> reviewed the release and commented that Love Never Fails , " is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans ( who really like tinkly pianos and less @-@ twangy vocals ) , and while it probably won 't wow many country listeners , for folks who are fans any of these three singers , this is kind of a treat . 
 In November of 2008 , Smith joined the cast of Marty Stuart 's television series The Marty Stuart Show , which airs on the RFD @-@ TV network every Saturday night . The thirty @-@ minute program features traditional country music performed by both Stuart and Smith , as well as radio personality , Eddie Stubbs . Since 2008 , Smith had been writing new songs for her next album . In August Smith released her first new solo recording in thirteen years , entitled Long Line of Heartaches via Sugar Hill Records . The record was produced by Marty Stuart and includes five songs written by the pair . Harlan Howard , Kostas , Johnny Russell , and Dallas Frazier also wrote songs that were included on the album . In 2012 , Smith was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame .

 Connie Smith 's sound is defined by the Nashville Sound musical style , primarily during her breakthrough years in the 1960s . While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras , Smith 's sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals , while still featuring some pop @-@ influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal . Critics have largely praised Smith 's use of the steel guitar , which have often been described as " sharp " and " prominent " . Smith 's steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called " The Connie Smith Sound " . In an interview with Colin Escott in his book Born to Sing , Myrick recalls how Smith 's producer ( Bob Ferguson ) wanted the guitar to sound , " He came out and said he wanted a bright sound , and he adjusted my controls . I thought it was an awfully thin sound , but it wound up being very popular . " 
 Although Smith has never been one of the most commercially successful or career @-@ driven artists , she is one of country music 's most celebrated and respected . Music critics , fans , and counterparts alike have considered Smith to be one of the best and most underrated female vocalists in country music history . Music critics have often compared Smith 's vocals to that of country legend Patsy Cline , due to her emotional delivery and her strong use of diction and phrasing . In his review of Smith 's 1996 compilation The Essential Connie Smith , Jurek explained why Smith 's vocals are usually compared to Cline 's , " Connie Smith is perhaps the only female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to Patsy Cline 's throne . It 's not that there aren 't many amazing vocalists in the field , and plenty of legends among them . But in terms of the pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction , Smith is it . " Many artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists . Chely Wright said that she spent most of her childhood listening to records by Smith . George Jones cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography . Elvis Presley had many of Smith 's albums in his record collection at his Graceland home and intended on recording Smith 's version of " The Wonders You Perform " , but never got around to doing so . In a discussion with country songwriter Fred Foster , Dolly Parton famously said , " You know , there 's really only three female singers in the world : Barbra Streisand , Linda Ronstadt , and Connie Smith . The rest of us are only pretending " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Smith has been married four times . In 1961 , she married Jerry Smith , a <unk> at the Inter @-@ Lake Iron Corporation in Beverly , Ohio . They had one child together on March 9 , 1963 , named Darren Justin . ( In the late 1970s , Darren went to Europe to become a missionary ; he is currently a psychologist . ) In the mid @-@ 1960s , the couple divorced and Smith married the guitarist in her touring band , Jack Watkins . They had a son , Kerry Watkins , before separating nearly a year after marrying . Shortly afterward , Smith married telephone repairman Marshall Haynes . In the early 1970s , Haynes frequently toured with Connie on her road show . The couple had three daughters : Jeanne , Julie , and Jodi Haynes . After divorcing Haynes in the early 1990s , Smith stated that she would never marry again , but on July 8 , 1997 Smith married country artist Marty Stuart . They met while writing songs for Smith 's 1998 comeback album . Twenty eight years before , Stuart had first encountered her after attending her concert : " I met Connie when I was 12 years old . She came to the Indian reservation in my hometown to work at a fair . She hasn 't changed a bit . She looked great then and she looks great now . " Smith said that they have sustained their marriage by making " ... the Lord the center ... and commit . "

 = Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde = 
 Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde ( / <unk> / ) , commonly abbreviated to Poulton , is a market town in Lancashire , England , situated on the coastal plain called the Fylde . In the 2001 United Kingdom census , it had a population of 18 @,@ 264 . There is evidence of human habitation in the area from 12 @,@ 000 years ago and several archaeological finds from Roman settlement in England have been found in the area . At the time of the Norman conquest Poulton was a small agricultural settlement in the hundred of Amounderness . The church of St Chad was recorded in 1094 when it was endowed to Lancaster Priory . By the post @-@ Medieval period the town had become an important commercial centre for the region with weekly and triannual markets . Goods were imported and exported through two harbours on the River Wyre . In 1837 , the town was described as the " metropolis of the Fylde " , but its commercial importance waned from the mid @-@ 19th century with the development of the nearby coastal towns of Fleetwood and Blackpool . 
 Poulton has the administrative centre of the borough of Wyre and is in the parliamentary constituency of Wyre and Preston North . It is part of the Blackpool Urban Area and approximately 5 miles ( 8 km ) from Blackpool town centre ; there are rail links to Blackpool and Preston , and bus routes to the larger towns and villages of the Fylde . Poulton has a library and two secondary schools ; Baines School and Hodgson Academy . There is a farmers ' market once a month and since October 2011 there has been a weekly market on Mondays in the centre of the town .

 There is evidence of human habitation in the area around Poulton from c . 10 @,@ 000 BC . In 1970 building work in nearby Carleton uncovered the 12 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old skeleton of an elk , along with two bone or antler barbed points close to its hind bones . At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD , the area was inhabited by a Celtic tribe called the <unk> . A 4th century hoard of 400 Roman coins was found in the area , near Fleetwood . Other finds have been made in Poulton and Skippool ; in addition to coins , these have included a medal of Germanicus and a <unk> ( similar to a horseshoe ) . 
 Although there is little archaeological evidence of Anglo @-@ Saxon activity in the area following the departure of the Romans , local place names incorporate Old English elements like <unk> ( farmstead ) , suggesting that they were founded in that period . Nearby examples are Thornton , Marton and Carleton . Poulton was recorded in 1086 as <unk> ; the name is derived from the Old English words pull or <unk> + <unk> meaning " farmstead by a pool or creek " . In later years it was recorded variously as <unk> , <unk> , Potton , <unk> and Poulton . The affix le @-@ Fylde ( " in the district called the Fylde " ) was added in 1842 with the arrival of the Penny Post , to distinguish the town from Poulton @-@ le @-@ Sands , a village that is now part of Morecambe . 
 Poulton is one of seven ancient parishes of the hundred of Amounderness . Prior to the Norman conquest in 1066 , Amounderness was in the possession of Earl Tostig , the brother of King Harold II . Tostig died at the Battle of Stamford Bridge and his lands were subsequently taken over by the Normans . Between 1069 and 1086 William the Conqueror gave Amounderness to Anglo @-@ Norman baron Roger the Poitevin . In the Domesday Book of 1086 Poulton 's area was estimated to contain two carucates of arable land . The survey recorded three churches in Amounderness though not by name . Later documentary evidence suggests that they were probably the churches at Poulton , Kirkham and St Michael 's on Wyre . The dedication of Poulton 's church to 7th century Anglo @-@ Saxon saint Chad of Mercia lends weight to its pre @-@ conquest foundation , although it is possible that it was built between 1086 and 1094 . 
 In 1094 , Roger the Poitevin founded the Benedictine priory of St. Mary at Lancaster , as a cell of the Norman Abbey of St. Martin in Sées . He endowed the priory with the church and land at Poulton . Roger was eventually banished from the country and his lands returned to the possession of the Crown . In 1194 King Richard I granted the hundred of Amounderness to Theobald Walter , 1st Baron Butler , who held it until his death in 1206 . In 1268 , King Henry III granted the wapentake of Amounderness to his son Edmund Crouchback , who became the 1st Earl of Lancaster around this time . 
 The amount of land in Poulton owned by St. Mary 's Priory increased during the 12th and 13th centuries and caused conflict with local landowners over whose land the tenants and monks of the priory had to cross . In 1276 , Sir Adam Banastre and his supporters assaulted the prior , Ralph de <unk> , as he travelled to Poulton . He and his attendants were taken by Banastre , beaten and imprisoned in Thornton . An investigation into the incident was instigated by the king ; no record survives . In 1330 , a compromise was made when two roads were built through Banastre 's land which enabled the prior and his tenants to travel freely to Poulton . During the 13th and 14th centuries , much of the land at Poulton was given to Cockersand Abbey in Lancaster and rented back to local farm workers . Much of the land in the Fylde was donated either to Cockersand Abbey or Whalley Abbey . To efficiently manage and farm these lands , granges were built at Singleton and Staining . When the alien priories ( those under control of religious houses abroad ) were dissolved in 1415 , the church at Poulton was conveyed to the Abbey of Syon in Middlesex . 
 In the 17th century Civil Wars , townspeople of Poulton fought on both sides , although more men from the Fylde were on the side of the Royalists . No battles occurred in or close to Poulton but the area was affected with the rest of the county by the widespread poverty that resulted from the wars . In 1643 interest was stirred in the parish when a large Spanish vessel dropped anchor off the coast at Rossall . The ship made no movement for several days but fired its guns occasionally . Locals initially feared an invasion , but eventually realised that the crew was in distress and had been signalling for help . The vessel was carrying ammunition for the Parliamentarian forces and the crew had become sick and feeble . The ship was brought by Royalists into the mouth of the River Wyre and the Earl of Derby marched from across the River Ribble . He ordered the ship to be burnt and the Spanish crew to be set free . 
 In the 18th century it was the custom for the wealthy in Poulton to bury their dead at night , following a lamp @-@ lit procession through town . This tradition lasted until 1810 . In 1732 , during the procession preceding the funeral of Geoffrey Hornby , strong winds caused sparks to fly from the lighted tapers carried by mourners . The buildings on the west side of the market place , low cottages with thatched roofs , caught fire and were destroyed . After local fund @-@ raising the houses were eventually replaced with brick buildings with tile roofs .

 Poulton became an important centre for trade in the area . With harbours on either side of the River Wyre , at Skippool and Wardleys , it was able to import goods from as far away as Russia and North America . Flax was imported from Ireland and the Baltic , timber came from across the Atlantic and tallow from Russia . Records from 1806 – 08 show that Poulton imported limestone from Ulverston , oats from Ulverston , Kirkcudbright , Dumfries , Wigtown , Whitehaven and Liverpool , and coal from Preston . Cheese was exported to the same places . By the 18th century , markets for cattle and cloth were being held in the town in February , April and November , with corn fairs every Monday . It is unclear at what point Poulton began life as a market town ; it was never granted a market charter and so markets were held by prescription . The market cross probably dates from the 17th century . 
 The linen industry was widespread in the Fylde during the 18th century and Poulton 's importation of flax was essential . There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys , owned by linen merchants from Kirkham . By the 19th century , craftsmen in Poulton were an important part of the industry . In the early part of the 19th century , there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation , as well as increased demand for labour . In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham , Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders . 
 Poulton 's commercial importance was affected by the growth in the 19th century of two nearby coastal towns . In 1836 the first building was constructed in the new , planned town of Fleetwood , 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of Poulton , at the mouth of the River Wyre . Fleetwood was conceived by local landowner and Preston Member of Parliament ( MP ) Sir Peter Hesketh @-@ Fleetwood as a major port and a link for passengers travelling from London to Scotland . To achieve these ideals , a rail link was needed and the new town soon heralded the arrival of the railway to the area . A line connecting Fleetwood with Preston was completed in 1840 , with Poulton as one of the stops . Although Fleetwood immediately superseded Poulton as a port ( the Customs House was quickly moved to Fleetwood ) , Poulton initially benefited commercially from the rail link . The importation of Irish and Scottish cattle through Fleetwood enabled a fortnightly cattle market to be held in Poulton . At the same time , Blackpool was developing as a resort and for a few years visitors travelled by rail to Poulton and then on to Blackpool by horse @-@ drawn <unk> or omnibuses . A line between Poulton and Blackpool was completed in 1846 . As Fleetwood and Blackpool 's own commercial capabilities developed , and Kirkham 's prominence in the linen industry continued to grow , Poulton 's importance declined .

 Historically , Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde was one of seven ecclesiastical parishes of the Amounderness hundred , an ancient division of the historic county of Lancashire , with a total area of 16 @,@ 691 @.@ 5 acres ( 6 @,@ 755 ha ) . The parish included the townships of Poulton , Carleton , Thornton , Hardhorn @-@ With @-@ Newton and Marton . Poulton was governed by a parish council until 1900 , when the parish was superseded by Poulton Urban District . Today , with respect to civil parishes , Poulton is unparished . In 1974 , following the Local Government Act 1972 , Poulton Urban District merged with those of <unk> and Thornton @-@ Cleveleys , the municipal borough of Fleetwood and the rural district of Garstang to form the borough of Wyre . The town has the borough council 's administrative centre , with its offices in Poulton Civic Centre . 
 The town is governed locally by a two @-@ tier council system , being a part of both Lancashire County Council and Wyre Borough Council with both councils having different responsibilities for the area . Elections are held for Lancashire County Council every four years with elections to Wyre Borough Council also taking place every four years , but two years after the county elections . For borough elections Poulton contains four wards ; Breck , Hardhorn , <unk> and Tithebarn . All four wards elect two councillors each to Wyre Borough Council . Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde is also a county division for the Lancashire County Council elections which is made up of the majority of the four wards and elects one councillor to the county council . At the most recent borough election in 2011 the town 's four wards each elected two Conservative Party councillors , including the mayor of Wyre for 2011 David Bannister and the current leader of the council Peter Gibson . At the most recent county election in 2009 the town elected a Conservative Party councillor , Geoffrey Roper . 
 The town is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of Wyre and Preston North . It elects one MP by the first past the post system of election . Since its creation for the 2010 general election , Wyre and Preston North has been represented at Parliament by Conservative MP Ben Wallace . Prior to the 2010 general election , Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde was part of the constituency of Lancaster and Wyre . The town is also part of the North West England constituency of the European Parliament .

 = = = Population change = = = 
 Typical of rural agricultural settlements , Poulton 's population increased by almost 25 % through the first two decades of the 19th century . In the decades after 1831 , the town 's population growth slowed , reflecting Poulton 's failure to adapt to the changes of industrial society . 
 = = Economy = = 
 In the 13th century , Poulton 's economy was largely agricultural . Over the next centuries , the town became a commercial centre for the area , importing and exporting goods through harbours on the River Wyre at Skippool and Wardleys . Imports of flax were vital for a local linen industry , particularly in nearby Kirkham , and Poulton craftsmen were part of this industry by the beginning of the 19th century . During the early part of this century the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution led to a decline in the craft industries in Poulton . New methods were not embraced by local producers and the town suffered from its location , far from coalfields and large labour markets . Following the development of the new town and port of Fleetwood from 1836 , Poulton 's role as a major commerce centre waned . For some time , the town 's market remained important as a local supply of goods for growing Fleetwood and Blackpool . Eventually Poulton was overshadowed by Fleetwood and Blackpool . In his 1837 work on Blackpool , William <unk> called Poulton the " metropolis of the Fylde " . This was a time when Poulton was still prominent among its near neighbours ; David Foster commented in 1972 that not only was <unk> 's description of the town no longer apt , it had ceased to be accurate even from 1850 with the rapid growth of the coastal resorts . 
 Although the unemployment rate in Wyre is higher than that of the North West and England , in 2004 a Market Town Initiative study noted that the level of unemployment in Poulton was lower than the regional and national averages , at 1 @.@ 41 % . Business in the town is centred at the Poulton Industrial Estate .

 In 2004 a group appointed by Wyre Borough Council carried out a study of Poulton as part of the Countryside Agency 's Market Town Initiative . Their Health Check and Action Plan identified " economic , transport & accessibility , environmental and social strengths and weaknesses " of Poulton . The study noted that the town has no cinemas , theatres , museums or galleries and that there was popular demand for a cinema , a weekly market and more independent retailers . There was also concern among residents that there are not enough facilities for young people . Poulton has a library , operated by Lancashire County Council . 
 Poulton 's public spaces include the Jean Stansfield Memorial and Vicarage Park , Tithebarn Park and the Cottam Hall Playing Fields . The Jean Stansfield Memorial and Vicarage Park is close to the town centre . It was built in 1955 on the grounds of the town 's former vicarage , sold to Poulton Council in 1951 . In 1926 , the park was enlarged when the parents of Jean Stansfield , a child who had died at the age of 10 , donated 2 acres ( 1 ha ) of land to the town in her memory . The park includes a crown green bowling green and a skate park . Tithebarn Park , north @-@ west of the town centre , was built on the site of a former railway halt , Poulton Curve . It features grass play areas . The Cottam Hall Playing Fields to the west of the town centre include sports pitches and allotments . There is a cricket ground to the north @-@ east of the town . Poulton includes part of the Wyre Way footpath . 
 Poulton Gala is held annually in June and a farmers ' market is held on the fourth Saturday of every month . In October 2011 , Wyre Borough Council introduced the return of a weekly market which takes place in the centre of Poulton every Monday .

 = = Landmarks = = 
 Poulton town centre has been a Conservation Area since 1979 and 15 buildings and structures in the town have been designated as listed buildings by English Heritage for their special architectural , historical or cultural significance . These include two religious buildings , the structures in the market place and several houses . 
 The market place at the centre of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic . Lying south of St Chad 's Church and surrounded by shops , the square contains the town 's war memorial as well as a market cross , stocks , whipping post and fish slabs , from which fish were sold on market days . Although many of the buildings surrounding the market place were rebuilt following a fire in the 18th century , a few of the earlier buildings remain . To the south of the market place are town houses that were built for local merchants and professionals . 
 Public houses and inns flourished early on in Poulton due to its status as a market town . One of the most important inns was the Golden Ball , which probably dates from the 18th century . It was also the meeting place of the local court , and at the end of the 19th century the town 's cattle market was moved behind the pub from the market place . The Thatched House pub existed in 1793 and may have been built in the Middle Ages . It was rebuilt in 1910 in the Mock Tudor style and has been identified as one of the town 's " key landmarks " by the Poulton Market Town Initiative . In the 19th century the Ship Inn was a rowdy pub popular with Fleetwood seamen , travelling labourers and locals . In the 1920s it became a working men 's club and from 1928 – 2001 , a Conservative club . It is an Edwardian building constructed in red brick with red sandstone dressings . It has a corner tower and the walls have carvings of ships . Since 2000 it has operated as a café , wine bar and night club called the Cube . 
 = = Religion = = 
 St Chad 's Church , the Anglican parish church , is in the centre of town , bordering the market place . It has been designated a Grade II * listed building by English Heritage . The current structure dates largely from the mid @-@ 18th century when the previous church was demolished , although the tower is from the 17th century . The church is constructed of stone and has a slate roof . A round Norman @-@ style apse was added in 1868 . The churchyard , mainly to the south and east of the building , is noted for its display of crocuses in the spring . 
 After the English Reformation there remained a strong Roman Catholic influence in the parish , with worship particularly focused in Singleton . In the late 16th century there were 13 houses in the parish that were known to shelter seminarians . In 1583 , the family of Cardinal William Allen , a prominent opponent of the Reformation , were holding three or four masses daily at their home at nearby Rossall . In the early 19th century , a Roman Catholic chapel was built in the town of Poulton . St John the Evangelist 's was built in the north of the town on Breck Road . The building , with its attached presbytery is constructed of rendered brick with a slate roof and has been designated a Grade II listed building . Tradition has it that at some time during the 19th century , the vicar of St. Chad 's donated to that church a particularly " papist " vestment . The chapel was replaced by a larger church built a few metres to the south in 1912 . The new building , constructed of rock @-@ faced red sandstone in a stripped Romanesque style , was designed by Cuthbert Pugin of Pugin & Pugin . 
 The first establishment of Nonconformists in Poulton were the Methodists , in 1784 . The group met in a room behind the King 's Arms and initially suffered persecution from other locals . They built a chapel in what is now Church Street in 1819 , the second Methodist chapel to be built on the Fylde . The chapel was enlarged in 1861 and 1909 and finally demolished in 1970 , replaced by a new chapel in Queen Street . The Congregational church established a chapel in the town in 1809 . Its use was intermittent and at one point the building was used as a warehouse . A new chapel was built in 1899 . 
 In the 2001 census 83 @.@ 06 % of respondents in Wyre gave their religion as Christianity . This is higher than the average for the North West ( 78 @.@ 01 % ) and England ( 71 @.@ 74 ) .

A further 9 @.@ 40 % of people in the borough stated that they had no religion , also a lower figure than the regional and national averages . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The development in the first half of the 19th century of Fleetwood led to the arrival of the railway in the Fylde . The Preston & Wyre Railway and Dock Company was formed to connect Fleetwood to Preston and the Preston and Wyre Railway line was completed in 1840 . Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde railway station , on the line between Kirkham and Fleetwood was originally situated at the bottom of the Breck , the road leading north out of Poulton . A branch connecting Poulton to Blackpool opened in 1846 , meeting the existing line in a triangular junction with very tight curves towards Blackpool . By 1892 , plans were underway to realign the tracks and rebuild the station at the top of the Breck . The fears of local people were realised in 1893 when a train travelling too fast derailed at the bend , killing three people . The new station was built in 1896 . A railway halt called Poulton Curve was built in 1923 and was in use for trains between Fleetwood and Blackpool until 1952 . Today , Poulton is a stop on the <unk> Line and the Blackpool Branch Line . It lies between Kirkham and <unk> ( towards Preston ) and Layton ( towards Blackpool North ) . The Fleetwood Branch Line closed to passengers in 1970 ; in 2009 , a report by the Association of Train Operating Companies suggested that there would be a " strong business case " to reopen the line . 
 Poulton is approximately 13 miles ( 21 km ) west of the M6 motorway and is linked to it by the M55 at Greenhalgh . There are A roads to Fleetwood , Blackpool , Preston , Garstang and Lancaster . The town is served by four bus companies ; Blackpool Transport , Stagecoach , Coastal Coaches and <unk> provide links to the Fylde 's coastal towns as well as villages across the River Wyre and Preston . 
 Poulton 's nearest international airport — approximately 6 @.@ 5 miles ( 10 @.@ 5 km ) away — is Blackpool International Airport which has an annual capacity of 350 @,@ 000 passengers .

 Poulton has two secondary schools , the oldest of which dates from the 18th century . In 1717 , local woollen merchant James Baines left money in his will to found three free schools in the parish ; in Poulton , Marton and Thornton . All three still exist .

 = JJ ( Skins series 3 ) = 
 " JJ " is the seventh episode of the third series of the British teen drama Skins , which first aired on 5 March 2009 on E4 in both Ireland and the United Kingdom . The episode was written by the series ' co @-@ creator , Bryan Elsley , and was directed by Charles Martin . The episode focuses on the character of JJ Jones ( Ollie Barbieri ) , who has Asperger syndrome , and his confusion about his life and his desire to be normal . He strikes up a friendship with Emily Fitch ( Kathryn Prescott ) and attempts to solve the dispute between his friends James Cook ( Jack O 'Connell ) and Freddie Mclair ( Luke Pasqualino ) over their shared love interest , Effy Stonem ( Kaya Scodelario ) . 
 " JJ " was filmed in November 2008 . Barbieri undertook various measures to get into his character 's mindset , including research , creating part of the set himself , and later destroying it . The episode featured numerous cameo appearances by the series ' crew members . " JJ " drew just under one million viewers on its first broadcast and was E4 's highest @-@ rated programme of the week . It was received generally well by critics , though the writers ' decision for Emily to have sex with JJ drew criticism from the lesbian community . 
 = = Plot = = 
 JJ visits his psychiatrist , Dr <unk> ( Paul Ridley ) , seeking help for his recent bouts of rage and his confusion about his life and friends . Dr <unk> has poor advice for JJ and prescribes him more drugs to calm him down . As he is leaving , he meets Emily , who came to the clinic to receive counselling in being more honest , but was simply prescribed the same drugs as JJ . She comes out to him and he shares with her his longing to be " normal " for a day so that he could lose his virginity and reunite Freddie and Cook . She advises him to just ask for the things he wants , so they visit Freddie to tell him to make up with Cook . At Freddie 's house , though , they walk in on Freddie having sex with Emily 's twin sister , Katie ( Megan Prescott ) , and JJ accidentally outs Emily as a lesbian , leaving Katie looking visibly shaken . JJ asks Freddie to make up with Cook , but Freddie refuses and tells JJ to choose between him and Cook . 
 Returning home , JJ sees his mother , Cecilia ( Juliet Cowan ) , overwhelmed by all of his issues and blames himself . He calls Cook to tell him how he feels , but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy . When he visits Effy , however , she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days . He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone ; she refuses but offers to be his friend . JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon ( Lisa Backwell ) . Pretending not to have seen this , he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not caring about how he feels . Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs . They are almost arrested and , after running from the police , JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club . In the queue , Effy tells Naomi Campbell ( Lily Loveless ) that she knows about Naomi and Emily 's relationship . Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie , not Cook . JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone ( Merveille Lukeba ) lets them into the club where British electronica duo You Love Her Coz She 's Dead are playing , announcing that Emily is already inside . Cook gets into a fight on the dancefloor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs . 
 Cook , under the influence of JJ 's drugs , is compelled to tell the truth and confesses that Effy loves Freddie . Cook says that he loves Effy , but knows his feelings are not reciprocated and that is why he is having an affair with Pandora . Thomas , Pandora 's boyfriend , overhears this and is furious . JJ leaves the club and finds a tearful Emily , who does not want to go home to face Katie . JJ invites her to spend the night with him and , after they agree to be friends , she gets him to have sex with her , as a " once @-@ only charity event " . JJ 's mother meets Emily the next morning and watches them discuss the night before . She is overjoyed that he has made a real friend and believes that JJ will be alright after all . 
 = = Production = = 
 " JJ " was filmed in November 2008 in the same production block as the series ' eighth episode , " Effy " . Ollie Barbieri did some research to help him in playing JJ , who has Asperger syndrome . He said that , in initial episodes , he played JJ as " quite mad and I jumped around a lot " , though by this episode his portrayal was " watered down a bit " . Charles Martin shot an unscripted scene that involved Barbieri destroying the set of JJ 's bedroom ; Martin believed this would help Barbieri to get into JJ 's mindset . Barbieri was also able to learn more about his character by creating the collage in JJ 's room himself , in which JJ has tried to organise his thoughts about his friends and his life . Martin said that he and Barbieri had a " very involved director @-@ actor relationship " and that he enjoyed " JJ " the most out of all the episodes he directed in the series . According to runner Laurence Wigfield , JJ 's clinic was described in the script as " a desolate shabby place , the kind of place you went to die " , with the bracketed suggestion of Fishponds Studio , where the Skins offices are . Though Wigfield initially " couldn 't believe " this , the studio was used for filming the scene , which Wigfield admitted " worked quite well " . The scene in which JJ and Emily bond after meeting at the clinic was filmed in Bristol 's Brandon Hill Park , near Cabot Tower . 
 Skins ' assistant director , Seth Adams , had a cameo appearance as a nurse at JJ 's clinic , while floor runner Tom <unk> featured in a minor role as a policeman . The men who fight with Cook at the club were played by members of the Skins crew , Chris " Fagin " Lynd , Toby " Ziegler " Welch and " The Slasher " . The show 's location manager appeared in a non @-@ speaking role as a mental patient being pushed in a wheelchair at the psychological clinic . The episode 's soundtrack comprises mostly piano works composed by Claude Debussy and recorded by David McGuinness . This was the result of a suggestion made by Bryan Elsley for Debussy 's music to accompany an entire episode .

 " JJ " was received generally positive reviews from mainstream critics . One critic for PopSugar.com " love [ d ] " JJ 's friendship with Emily and his mother 's smile at the end of the episode , which they felt was " a touching moment to end with " . They credited Cook 's <unk> , in spite of the character 's flaws , to O 'Connell 's " great " acting . Ellie Newton @-@ Syms of <unk> Magazine wrote that " digging into slightly deeper issues is what Skins is good at " and " there is clearly lots left to be revealed " , as signified by Cook 's drug @-@ induced revelation that he has " nothing " . Digital Spy 's Dan French reviewed the episode positively , finding JJ to be a " lovable " character . He considered Cook 's confession that Effy truly loves Freddie and the revelation of Cook 's affair with Pandora to be " shocking " . Fergus Shiel of The Sydney Morning Herald called " JJ " a " top episode " , praising its portrayal of " teenage uncertainty that pack [ s ] an emotional punch " . Keeley Bolger , writing for The Sun , sympathised with JJ , commenting that " JJ 's drama doesn 't end " . 
 The episode drew criticism from the lesbian community , however . Kate Murray of lesbian @-@ based website AfterEllen.com regarded Emily 's willingness to have sex with JJ as the use of a " classic and highly offensive stereotype " and felt that this " undermine [ d ] what it means to be a lesbian " . She thought that the episode fell short of the previous episode , " Naomi " , which focused on Emily and Naomi 's relationship , suggesting that this could be because " Naomi " was written by a 19 @-@ year @-@ old female , <unk> Sen Gupta , while " JJ " was written by Elsley , a 47 @-@ year @-@ old male . The entertainment editor for eurOut.org , a website for European lesbians , was critical of the episode , writing , " Welcome to the wonderful world of television , where being a lesbian and sleeping with men always goes hand in hand . " She did believe , however , that Emily 's coming out to JJ was " very funny " and Effy 's nonchalance about Naomi 's sexuality was " cool " .

 Ina Donna Coolbrith ( March 10 , 1841 – February 29 , 1928 ) was an American poet , writer , librarian , and a prominent figure in the San Francisco Bay Area literary community . Called the " Sweet Singer of California " , she was the first California Poet Laureate and the first poet laureate of any American state . 
 Coolbrith , born the niece of Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith , left the Mormon community as a child to enter her teens in Los Angeles , California , where she began to publish poetry . She terminated a youthful failed marriage to make her home in San Francisco , and met writers Bret Harte and Charles Warren Stoddard with whom she formed the " Golden Gate Trinity " closely associated with the literary journal Overland Monthly . Her poetry received positive notice from critics and established poets such as Mark Twain , Ambrose Bierce and Alfred Lord Tennyson . She held literary salons at her home — in this way she introduced new writers to publishers . Coolbrith befriended the poet Joaquin Miller and helped him gain global fame . 
 While Miller toured Europe and lived out their mutual dream of visiting Lord Byron 's tomb , Coolbrith was saddled with custody of his daughter , and the care of members of her own family , so she set up house in Oakland and accepted the position of city librarian . Her poetry suffered as a result of her long work hours , but she mentored a generation of young readers including Jack London and Isadora Duncan . After she served for 19 years , Oakland 's library patrons called for reorganization , and Coolbrith was fired . She moved back to San Francisco and was invited by members of the Bohemian Club to be their librarian . 
 Coolbrith began to write a history of California literature , including much autobiographical material , but the fire following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake consumed her work . Author Gertrude Atherton and Coolbrith 's Bohemian Club friends helped set her up again in a new house , and she resumed writing and holding literary salons . She traveled by train to New York City several times and , with fewer worldly cares , greatly increased her poetry output . On June 30 , 1915 , Coolbrith was named California 's poet laureate , and she continued to write poetry for eight more years . Her style was more than the usual melancholic or uplifting themes expected of women — she included a wide variety of subjects in her poems , which were noted as being " singularly sympathetic " and " palpably spontaneous " . Her sensuous descriptions of natural scenes advanced the art of Victorian poetry to incorporate greater accuracy without trite sentiment , foreshadowing the Imagist school and the work of Robert Frost . California poet laureate Carol <unk> @-@ Dukes wrote of Coolbrith 's poems that , though they " were steeped in a high tea lavender style " , influenced by a British stateliness , " California remained her inspiration . " 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ina Coolbrith was born Josephine Donna Smith in Nauvoo , Illinois , the last of three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith , brother to Joseph Smith Coolbrith 's father died of malarial fever four months after her birth , and a sister died one month after that ; Coolbrith 's mother then married Joseph Smith , in 1842 , becoming his sixth or seventh wife , depending on whether Fanny Alger is counted as a wife or as a lover . No children came of the union — Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful <unk> marriage , the only such marriage of Smith . Over the next two years , Smith married some 20 to 30 more wives , angering non @-@ Mormons in the area . In June 1844 , Smith was killed at the hands of an anti @-@ Mormon , anti @-@ polygamist mob . Losing her faith and fearful of her life , Coolbrith 's mother left the Latter @-@ day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis , Missouri , where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett . Twin sons were born to the couple , and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train . On the long trek , the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare 's works and from a collection of Byron 's poems . As a ten @-@ year @-@ old girl , Ina entered California in front of the wagon train with the famous African @-@ American scout Jim Beckwourth , riding with him on his horse , through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass . The family settled in Los Angeles , California , and Pickett established a law practice . 
 To avoid identification with her former family or with Mormonism , Ina 's mother reverted to using her maiden name , Coolbrith . The family resolved not to speak of their Mormon past , and it was only after Ina Coolbrith 's death that the general public learned of her origin . Coolbrith did keep in touch with her Smith relations , however , including a lifelong correspondence with her first @-@ cousin Joseph F. Smith to whom and for whom she frequently expressed her love and regard . 
 Coolbrith , sometimes called " Josephina " or just " Ina " , wrote poems beginning at age 11 , first publishing " My Ideal Home " in a newspaper in 1856 , writing as Ina Donna Coolbrith . Her work appeared in the Poetry Corner of the Los Angeles Star , and in the California Home Journal . As she grew into young womanhood , Coolbrith was renowned for her beauty ; she was selected to open a ball with Pío Pico , the last Mexican governor of California . In April 1858 at the age of 17 , she married Robert Bruce Carsley , an iron @-@ worker and part @-@ time actor , but she suffered abuse at his hands , and further emotional pain came from the death of the couple 's infant son . An altercation between Pickett and Carsley resulted in a bullet mutilating Carsley 's hand , requiring amputation . Carsley accused Coolbrith of infidelity , and she divorced him in a sensational public trial ; the dissolution was final on December 30 , 1861 . Her later poem , " The Mother 's Grief " , was a eulogy to her lost son , but she never publicly explained its meaning — it was only upon Coolbrith 's death that her literary friends discovered she had ever been a mother . In 1862 , Coolbrith moved with her mother , stepfather and twin half @-@ brothers to San Francisco to ward off depression , and changed her name from Josephine Donna Carsley to Ina Coolbrith . 
 = = Poet = = 
 Coolbrith soon met Bret Harte and Samuel Langhorne Clemens , writing as Mark Twain , in San Francisco . In 1867 , four of Coolbrith 's poems appeared in The Galaxy . In July 1868 , Coolbrith supplied a poem , " Longing " , for the first issue of the Overland Monthly , and served unofficially as co @-@ editor with Harte in selecting poems , articles and stories for the periodical . She became a friend of actress and poet Adah Menken , adding to Menken 's credibility as an intellectual , but was unable to impress Harte of Menken 's worth . Coolbrith also worked as a schoolteacher for extra income . For a decade , Coolbrith supplied one poem for each new issue of the Overland Monthly . After the 1866 publication of four of her poems in an anthology edited by Harte , Coolbrith 's " The Mother 's Grief " was positively reviewed in The New York Times . Another poem , " When the Grass Shall Cover Me " , appeared unattributed in an anthology of John Greenleaf Whittier 's favorite works by other poets , entitled Songs of Three Centuries ( 1875 ) ; Coolbrith 's poem was judged the best of that group . In 1867 , recently widowed Josephine Clifford arrived at the Overland Monthly to take a position as secretary . She formed a lifetime friendship with Coolbrith . 
 Coolbrith 's literary work connected her with poet Alfred Lord Tennyson and naturalist John Muir , as well as Charles Warren Stoddard who also helped Harte edit the Overland Monthly . As editors and arbiters of literary taste , Harte , Stoddard and Coolbrith were known as the " Golden Gate Trinity " . Stoddard once said that Coolbrith never had any of her literary submissions returned from a publisher . Coolbrith met writer and critic Ambrose Bierce in 1869 , and by 1871 when he was courting Mary Ellen Day , Bierce organized friendly card games between himself , Day , Coolbrith and Stoddard . Bierce felt that Coolbrith 's best poems were " California " , the commencement ode she wrote for the University of California in 1871 , and " Beside the Dead " , written in 1875 . 
 In mid @-@ 1870 , Coolbrith met the eccentric poet Cincinnatus Hiner Miller , newly divorced from his second wife , and introduced him to the San Francisco literary circle at the suggestion of Stoddard . Miller quoted Tennyson in describing Coolbrith as " divinely tall , and most divinely fair " . Coolbrith discovered that Miller was appreciative of the heroic , tragic life of Joaquin Murrieta , and she suggested that Miller take the name Joaquin Miller as his pen name , and that he dress the part with longer hair and a more @-@ pronounced mountain man costume . Coolbrith helped Miller prepare for his trip to England , where he would lay a laurel wreath on the tomb of Lord Byron , a poet they both greatly admired . The two gathered California Bay Laurel branches in Sausalito and took portrait photographs together . Coolbrith wrote " With a Wreath of Laurel " about this enterprise . Miller went to New York by train , calling himself " Joaquin Miller " for the first time , and was in London by August 1870 . When he placed the wreath at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene , Hucknall , it caused a stir among the English clergy who did not see any connection between California poets and the late lord . They sent to Constantine I , the King of Greece for another laurel wreath from that country of Byron 's heroic death , accompanied by some Greek funding which was joined in kind from the purse of the Bishop of Norwich to rebuild and refurbish the 500 @-@ year @-@ old church . The two wreaths were hung side by side over Byron 's tomb . 
 = = Librarian = = 
 Coolbrith had hoped to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller , but stayed behind in San Francisco because she felt obliged to care for her mother and her seriously ill , widowed sister Agnes who was unable to care for herself or for her two children . In late 1871 she took on the care of another dependent when Joaquin Miller brought her a teenaged Indian girl ( widely rumored to be his own daughter ) to care for while he went abroad again , this time to Brazil and Europe . 
 At a literary dinner on May 5 , 1874 , Coolbrith was elected honorary member of the Bohemian Club , the second of four women so honored . This allowed the members of the club to discreetly assist her in her finances , but their help was not enough to cover her full burden . Coolbrith moved to Oakland to set up a larger household for her extended family . Coolbrith 's sister Agnes died late in 1874 , and the orphaned niece and nephew continued to live with Coolbrith . Coolbrith wrote " Beside the Dead " in grief from the loss of her sister . Her mother Agnes died in 1876 . 
 To support the household , in late 1874 Coolbrith took a position as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association , a subscription library that had been established five years earlier . In 1878 , the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library , the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act ( Eureka was first ) . Coolbrith earned a salary of $ 80 per month , $ 1 @,@ 960 in current value , much less than a man would have received . She worked 6 days a week , 12 hours a day . Her poetry suffered as a result . She published only sporadically over the next 19 years — working as Oakland 's librarian was the low point of her poetic career . 
 At the library , her style was personal : she discussed with the patrons their interests , and she selected books she felt were appropriate . In 1886 , she befriended and mentored the 10 @-@ year @-@ old Jack London , guiding his reading . London called her his " literary mother " . Twenty years later , London wrote to Coolbrith to thank her . 
 Coolbrith also mentored young Isadora Duncan who later described Coolbrith as " a very wonderful " woman , with " very beautiful eyes that glowed with burning fire and passion " . Magazine writer Samuel Dickson reported that , at a soirée in 1927 , an aging Coolbrith told him of the famous lovers she had known , and that she had once dazzled Joseph Duncan , Isadora 's father . Coolbrith said that his attentions led to the breakup of his marriage . Duncan 's mother left San Francisco and settled her four children in Oakland , little knowing that Coolbrith would soon meet one of her children , and help the young dancer develop a wider knowledge of the world through reading . Duncan wrote in her autobiography that , as a librarian , Coolbrith was always pleased with the youthful dancer 's book choices , and that Duncan did not find out until later that Coolbrith was " evidently the great passion of [ Joseph Duncan 's ] life " . 
 Coolbrith 's nephew Henry Frank Peterson came to work with her at the library , and began to organize the books into a faceted classification scheme that she specified , one which used one- and two @-@ digit numbers to stand for general subjects , and three @-@ digit numbers to indicate individual books in that subject . Before this , Coolbrith had resisted library trustee attempts to classify the books ; she had wished to continue the reading @-@ room atmosphere that she had established . 
 In 1881 , Coolbrith 's poetry was published in book form , entitled A Perfect Day , and Other Poems . Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , after Coolbrith 's publisher sent him a copy , said " I know that California has at least one poet . " Of the poems , he said " I have been reading them with delight . " Yale poet Edward Rowland Sill , professor at the University of California and a keen critic of American literature , gave Coolbrith a letter of introduction that he wished her to send to publisher Henry Holt . It said , simply , " Miss Ina Coolbrith , one of our few really literary persons in California , and the writer of many lovely poems ; in fact , the most genuine singer the West has yet produced . " Quaker poet and former abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier wrote to Coolbrith from Amesbury , Massachusetts , to share his opinion that her " little volume " of poetry , " which has found such favor with all who have seen it on this side of the Rocky mountains " , should be republished on the East Coast . He told her " there is no verse on the Pacific Slope which has the fine quality of thine . " 
 Beginning as early as 1865 in San Francisco , Coolbrith held literary meetings at her home , hosting readings of poetry , and topical discussions , in the tradition of European salons . She helped writers such as Gelett Burgess and Laura Redden <unk> gain wider notice . 
 Once warmly social with her , in the 1880s Ambrose Bierce turned his caustic pen to criticism of Coolbrith 's work , and thus lost her as a friend . In 1883 , he wrote that her finely @-@ wrought poem " Our Poets " should have been made a dirge , as the great poets of California were dead . He wrote that the periodical she worked for should be named the <unk> @-@ Overland Monthly because it delivered nothing new . Regarding her poem " <unk> " , Bierce complained of " this dainty writer 's tiresome <unk> . " In response , Coolbrith sided with those who said his incessant needling led local writer David Lesser <unk> to suicide . 
 Coolbrith published poems in The Century in 1883 , 1885 , 1886 and 1894 . All four poems were included in Coolbrith 's 1895 book , Songs from the Golden Gate — a re @-@ issue of her earlier 1881 collection , with some 40 poems added . In New York , Coolbrith was acknowledged by a reviewer in the monthly journal Current Opinion as " a true , melodious and natural singer . Her work is characterized by great delicacy and refinement of feeling , and comprises dainty love songs , verses of deep religious feeling , stately odes , written for special occasions , and charming bits of description . " 
 In September 1892 , Coolbrith was given three days ' notice to clear her desk , to be replaced as librarian by her nephew Henry Frank Peterson . A library trustee was quoted as saying " we need a librarian not a poet . " Coolbrith 's literary friends were outraged , and published a lengthy opinion piece to that effect in the San Francisco Examiner . Peterson 's plans for the library were quite successful , however ; under his guidance circulation quickly grew from 3 @,@ 000 to 13 @,@ 000 . Peterson opened the library on Sundays and holidays and increased accessibility to the stacks — he was praised by trustees for his " management improvements " . 
 In 1893 at the World 's Congress of Representative Women , held at the beginning of the World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago , Coolbrith was described by Ella Sterling Cummins ( later Mighels ) as " the best known of California writers ... who stands peerless at the head . " Coolbrith was commissioned to write a poem for the Exposition , and in October 1893 she brought with her to Chicago the poem " Isabella of Spain " to help dedicate Harriet Hosmer 's sculpture Queen Isabella which stood before the Pampas Plume Palace within the California Pavilion . Listening to Coolbrith were well @-@ known women such as suffragist Susan B. Anthony and journalist Lilian Whiting . During Coolbrith 's visit , Charlotte Perkins Stetson , her friend from the Pacific Coast Woman 's Press Association ( the two women served as president and vice @-@ president , respectively ) , wrote to May Wright Sewall on her behalf ; Stetson observed that Coolbrith could benefit from introductions to Chicago 's best writers . 
 Coolbrith 's difficulties in Oakland followed by her trip to Chicago unsettled her friends who did not wish to see her move away and " become an alien " to California . John Muir had long been in the habit of sending Coolbrith letters , and the occasional box of fruit such as cherries picked from the trees on his Martinez estate , and he made such an offering in late 1894 , accompanied by a suggestion for a new career which he thought would keep her in the area — she could fill the position of San Francisco 's librarian , recently vacated by John Vance Cheney . Coolbrith sent a response to Muir , thanking him for " the fruit of your land , and the fruit of your brain " . After signing the letter " your old @-@ time friend " , she added a post @-@ script comment : " No , I cannot have Mr. Cheney 's place . I am disqualified by sex . " San Francisco required that their librarian be a man . 
 In 1894 , Coolbrith honored poet Celia Thaxter with a memorial poem entitled " The Singer of the Sea " . Thaxter had been to the Atlantic Monthly what Coolbrith was to the Overland Monthly : its " lady poet " who submitted verse containing " local color " . 
 A second poetry collection , Songs from the Golden Gate , was published in 1895 ; it contained " The Mariposa Lily " , a description of California 's natural beauty , and " The Captive of the White City " which detailed the cruelty dealt to Native Americans in the late 19th century . As well , the collection included " The Sea @-@ Shell " and " Sailed " , two poems in which Coolbrith described a woman 's love with deep sympathy and an unusually vivid physical imagery , in a way that presaged the later Imagist school of Ezra Pound and Robert Frost . The book included four monochrome reproductions of paintings by William Keith that he had devised as visual representations of the poetry . The book was well received in London where editor Albert Kinross of The Outlook papered the London Underground walls with posters announcing " his great discovery " . 
 Connections among Coolbrith 's circle of friends resulted in a librarian job at San Francisco 's Mercantile Library Association in 1898 , and she moved back to Russian Hill in San Francisco . In January 1899 , artist William Keith and poet Charles Keeler obtained for her a part @-@ time position as librarian of the Bohemian Club , of which Keith and Keeler were members . Her first assignment was to edit Songs from Bohemia , a book of poems by Daniel O 'Connell , Bohemian Club co @-@ founder and journalist , following his death . Her salary was $ 50 each month , less than she had been earning in Oakland , but her duties were light enough that she was able to devote a greater proportion of her time to writing , and she signed on as sometime staff of Charles Fletcher Lummis 's The Land of Sunshine magazine . As a personal project , she began to work on a history of California literature . 
 = = Earthquake and fire = = 
 By February 1906 , Coolbrith 's health was showing signs of deterioration . She was often sick in bed with rheumatism , and hard @-@ pressed to continue her work at the Bohemian Club . Still , in March 1906 she gave a lengthy reading to the Pacific Coast Woman 's Press Association entitled " Some Women Poets of America . " Coolbrith , third vice president and life member of the club , briefly discussed the most prominent early American women poets but focused more fully on ones that became known in the second half of the 19th century , reciting example verse , and critically evaluating the work . A month later , disaster struck in the form of calamitous fire following the April 1906 San Francisco earthquake : Coolbrith 's home at 1604 Taylor Street burned to the ground . Directly after the earthquake but before fire threatened , Coolbrith left her house carrying a pet cat , thinking she would soon return . Her student boarder Robert Norman and her companion Josephine Zeller were unable to carry more than another cat , a few small bundles of letters and Coolbrith 's scrapbook . Immediately after he spotted heavy smoke from across the bay , Joaquin Miller took the ferry from Oakland to San Francisco in order to assist Coolbrith in saving her valuables from encroaching fire , but was prevented from doing so by soldiers who had orders to use deadly force against looters . In the blaze , Coolbrith lost 3 @,@ 000 books including priceless signed first editions , artwork by Keith , many personal letters from famous people such as Whittier , Clemens , George Meredith and , above all , her nearly complete manuscript that was part autobiography and part history of California 's early literary scene . 
 Coolbrith never resumed the work of writing the history , as she was unable to balance its revelatory autobiographical truth with the scandal that would then ensue . In her life , there were rumors that she had accepted men such as Harte , Stoddard , Clemens and Miller as occasional lovers — a book discussing these liaisons was one she considered too controversial . 
 Coolbrith spent a few years in temporary residences while friends rallied to raise money to build a house for her . From New York , Coolbrith 's old associate Mark Twain sent three autographed photographs of himself that sold for $ 10 apiece — he was subsequently convinced to sit for 17 more studio photographs to add further to the fund . In February 1907 , the San Jose Women 's Club hosted an event called " Ina Coolbrith Day " to promote interest in legislating a state pension for Coolbrith , and in a book project being put forward by the Spinners ' Club . In June 1907 , the Spinners ' Club printed a book entitled The Spinners ' book of fiction whose proceeds were to be given to Coolbrith . Frank Norris , Mary Hallock Foote and Mary Hunter Austin were among the authors who contributed stories . The poet George Sterling , a friend from the Bohemian Club , submitted an introductory poem , and Bohemian Maynard Dixon was among the illustrators . The driving force behind the effort was Gertrude Atherton , a writer who saw in Coolbrith a connection to California 's literary origins . When the book failed to produce sufficient funding , Atherton added enough from her own pocket to start construction . A new house was built for Coolbrith at 1067 Broadway on Russian Hill . Settled , there , she resumed hosting salons . In 1910 , she received a trust fund from Atherton . During 1910 – 1914 , with money from Atherton and a discreet grant from her Bohemian friends , Coolbrith spent time going between residences in New York City and in San Francisco , writing poetry . In four winters , she wrote more poetry than in the preceding 25 years . 
 = = Poet laureate = = 
 In 1911 , Coolbrith accepted the presidency of the Pacific Coast Woman 's Press Association , and a park was dedicated to her , at 1715 Taylor Street , one block from her pre @-@ earthquake home . Coolbrith was named honorary member of the California Writers Club around 1913 , a group that quickly expanded to include Lummis and other Southern Californians . In 1913 , Ella Sterling Mighels founded the California Literature Society which met informally once a month at Coolbrith 's Russian Hill home , newspaper columnist and literary critic George Hamlin Fitch presiding . Mighels , who has been called California 's literary historian , credited her breadth of knowledge to Coolbrith and the society meetings . 
 In preparation for the 1915 Panama – Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco , Coolbrith was named President of the Congress of Authors and Journalists . In this position she sent more than 4 @,@ 000 letters to the world 's most well @-@ known writers and journalists . At the Exposition itself on June 30 , Coolbrith was lauded by Senator James D. Phelan who said that her early associate Bret Harte called her the " sweetest note in California literature . " Phelan continued , " she has written little , but that little is great . It is of the purest quality , finished and perfect , as well as full of feeling and thought . " The Overland Monthly reported that " eyes were wet throughout the large audience " when Coolbrith was crowned with a laurel wreath by Benjamin Ide Wheeler , President of the University of California , who called her the " loved , laurel @-@ crowned poet of California . " After several more speeches were made in her honor , and bouquets brought in abundance to the podium , Coolbrith , wearing a black robe with a sash bearing a garland of bright orange California poppies , addressed the crowd , saying , " There is one woman here with whom I want to share these honors : Josephine Clifford McCracken . For we are linked together , the last two living members of Bret Harte 's staff of Overland writers . " McCracken was then ushered up from her seat in the audience to join Coolbrith . Coolbrith 's official status as California Poet Laureate was confirmed in 1919 as the " Loved Laurel Crowned Poet of California " by the California State Senate with no financial support attached . 
 Several months after the San Francisco fair , at the Panama – California Exposition held in San Diego , festivities included a series of Authors ' Days , featuring 13 California writers . November 2 , 1915 , was " Ina Coolbrith Day " : her poems were recited , a lecture on her life was given by George Wharton James , and her poetry was set to music and performed on piano and voice , with compositions by James , Humphrey John Stewart , and Amy Beach . 
 In 1916 , Coolbrith sent copies of her poetry collections to her cousin Joseph F. Smith who publicized her sending them to him and her identity as a niece of Joseph Smith , which upset her . She told him that " To be crucified for a faith in which you believe is to be blessed . To be crucified for one in which you do not believe is to be crucified indeed . " She assured him she was not angry but she certainly was not pleased . 
 Coolbrith continued to write and work to support herself . From 1909 to final publication in 1917 , she painstakingly collected and edited a book of Stoddard 's poetry , writing a foreword and joining her short memorial poem " At Anchor " to verse submitted by Stoddard 's friends Joaquin Miller , George Sterling and Thomas Walsh . At the age of 80 , McCracken wrote to Coolbrith to complain to her dear friend of still having to work for a living : " The world has not used us well , Ina ; California has been ungrateful to us . Of all the hundred thousands the state pays out in pensions of one kind and another , don 't you think you should be at the head of the pensioners , and I somewhere down below ? " 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 In May 1923 , Coolbrith 's friend Edwin Markham found her at the Hotel Latham in New York , " very old , ill and <unk> " . He asked Lotta Crabtree to gather help for her . Crippled with arthritis , Coolbrith was brought back to California where she settled in Berkeley to be cared for by her niece . In 1924 , Mills College conferred upon her an honorary Master of Arts degree . Coolbrith published Retrospect : In Los Angeles in 1925 . In April 1926 , she received visitors such as her old friend , art patron Albert M. Bender , who brought young Ansel Adams to meet her . Adams made a photographic portrait of Coolbrith seated near one of her white Persian cats and wearing a large white <unk> on her head . 
 Coolbrith died on Leap Day , February 29 , 1928 , and was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland . Her grave ( located in Plot 11 at 37 @.@ <unk> ° N 122 @.@ 2390 ° W ﻿ / 37 @.@ <unk> ; <unk> ) was unmarked until 1986 when a literary society known as The Ina Coolbrith Circle placed a headstone . Her name is commemorated by Mount Ina Coolbrith , a 7 @,@ 900 @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) peak near Beckwourth Pass in the Sierra Nevada mountains near State Route 70 . Near her Russian Hill home , Ina Coolbrith Park , established earlier as a series of terraces ascending a steep hill , received a memorial plaque placed in 1947 by the San Francisco parlors of the Native Daughters of the Golden West . The park is known for its " meditative setting and spectacular bay views " . 
 Wings of Sunset , a book of Coolbrith 's later poetry , was published in the year after her death . Charles Joseph <unk> Phillips edited the collection , and wrote a brief memorial to Coolbrith 's life . 
 In 1933 , the University of California established the Ina Coolbrith Memorial Poetry Prize , given annually to authors of the best unpublished poems written by undergraduate students enrolled at the University of the Pacific , Mills College , Stanford University , Santa Clara University , Saint Mary 's College of California , and any of the University of California campuses . 
 In 1965 , the actress June Lockhart played Coolbrith in the episode " Magic <unk> " of the syndicated western television series , Death Valley Days , hosted by Ronald W. Reagan . In the story line , Coolbrith develops a tenuous friendship with the teen @-@ aged " Dorita Duncan " ( Kathy Garver ) , later the dancer Isadora Duncan . The two have identical portions of a broken locket . Sean McClory played the poet Joaquin Miller , author of Songs of the Sierras . 
 The California Writers Club ( CWC ) occasionally selects a member , one distinguished by " exemplary service " , to receive the Ina Coolbrith Award . In 2009 , the award was given to Joyce Krieg , editor of the CWC Bulletin . In 2011 , Kelly Harrison received the award for work on the anthology West Winds Centennial . In his 1997 novel <unk> , author Oakley Hall set Coolbrith and others of her 1870 literary circle as main characters in the story . Hall was sympathetic to Coolbrith 's legacy , himself helping to develop new California writers through the forum Squaw Valley Writer 's Conference . 
 In 2001 , a $ 63 @,@ 000 sculpture by Scott Donahue was placed in Oakland 's central Frank Ogawa Plaza , adjacent to Oakland City Hall . The artist said his 13 @-@ foot @-@ 2 @-@ inch ( 4 @.@ 01 m ) polychrome patchwork statue was a composite image of 20 women , historic and current , important to Oakland , including Coolbrith , Isadora Duncan , Julia Morgan and more . Entitled <unk> / Follow Me , the sculpture elicited protests because the city did not follow its own process for acquiring public art and because " some people " , according to Ben Hazard , Oakland 's Craft and Cultural Arts Department leader , " just don 't like the sculpture 's looks " . By late 2004 , the sculpture had been removed to a remote former industrial site called Union Point Park on the Oakland Estuary , opening to the public in 2005 . 
 The City of Berkeley in 2003 installed a series of 120 poem @-@ imprinted cast @-@ iron plates flanking one block of a downtown street , to become the Addison Street Poetry Walk . Former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Hass determined that one of Coolbrith 's works should be included . A 55 @-@ pound ( 25 kg ) plate bearing Coolbrith 's poem " Copa De Oro ( The California Poppy ) " in raised porcelain enamel text is set into the sidewalk at the high @-@ traffic northwest corner of Addison and Shattuck Avenues . 
 = Aristarchus ( crater ) = 
 Aristarchus , named after the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos , is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the northwest part of the Moon 's near side . It is considered the brightest of the large formations on the lunar surface , with an albedo nearly double that of most lunar features . The feature is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye , and is dazzling in a large telescope . It is also readily identified when most of the lunar surface is illuminated by earthshine . The crater is larger than the Grand Canyon . 
 The crater is located at the southeastern edge of the Aristarchus plateau , an elevated area that contains a number of volcanic features , such as sinuous <unk> . This area is also noted for the large number of reported transient lunar phenomena , as well as recent emissions of radon gas as measured by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Aristarchus is located on an elevated rocky rise , known as the Aristarchus Plateau , in the midst of the Oceanus <unk> , a large expanse of lunar mare . This is a tilted crustal block , about 200 km across , that rises to a maximum elevation of 2 km above the mare in the southeastern section . Aristarchus is just to the east of the crater Herodotus and the Vallis <unk> , and south of a system of narrow sinuous <unk> named <unk> Aristarchus . 
 Aristarchus is bright because it is a young formation , approximately 450 million years old , and the solar wind has not yet had time to darken the excavated material by the process of space weathering . The impact occurred following the creation of the ray crater Copernicus , but before the appearance of Tycho . Due to its prominent rays , Aristarchus is mapped as part of the Copernican System . 
 The brightest feature of this crater is the steep central peak . Sections of the interior floor appear relatively level , but Lunar Orbiter photographs reveal the surface is covered in many small hills , streaky gouges , and some minor fractures . The crater has a terraced outer wall , roughly or polygonal in shape , and covered in a bright blanket of ejecta . These spread out into bright rays to the south and south @-@ east , suggesting that Aristarchus was most likely formed by an oblique impact from the northeast , and their composition includes material from both the Aristarchus plateau and the lunar mare . 
 In November 2011 , the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter passed over the crater , which spans almost 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) and sinks more than 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 5 kilometers ) deep . " The Aristarchus plateau is one of the most geologically diverse places on the moon : a mysterious raised flat plateau , a giant <unk> carved by enormous outpourings of lava , fields of explosive volcanic ash , and all surrounded by massive flood basalts , " said Mark Robinson , principal investigator of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera at Arizona State University . NASA released photos of the crater on December 25 , 2011 . 
 = = Remote sensing = = 
 In 1911 , Professor Robert W. Wood used ultraviolet photography to take images of the crater area . He discovered the plateau had an anomalous appearance in the ultraviolet , and an area to the north appeared to give indications of a sulfur deposit . This colorful area is sometimes referred to as " Wood 's Spot " , an alternate name for the Aristarchus Plateau . 
 Spectra taken of this crater during the Clementine mission were used to perform mineral mapping . The data indicated that the central peak is a type of rock called anorthosite , which is a slow @-@ cooling form of igneous rock composed of plagioclase feldspar . By contrast the outer wall is troctolite , a rock composed of equal parts plagioclase and olivine . 
 The Aristarchus region was part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was investigating the presence of oxygen @-@ rich glassy soils in the form of the mineral ilmenite . Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites , where the chemistry is known , and these were compared to Aristarchus . The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light . The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite , a titanium oxide mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen .

 The region of the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many reported transient lunar phenomena , with a total of 122 such reports by 2007 ; the highest recorded for any lunar feature . Such events include temporary obscurations and colorations of the surface , and catalogues of these show that more than one @-@ third of the most reliable <unk> come from this locale . In 1971 when Apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau , a significant rise in alpha particles was detected . These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of radon @-@ 222 , a radioactive gas with a half @-@ life of only 3 @.@ 8 days . The Lunar Prospector mission later confirmed Radon @-@ 222 emissions from this crater . These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface , or by discrete explosive events .

 Aristarchus is named after the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos . Like many of the craters on the Moon 's near side , it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli , whose 1651 nomenclature system became standardized in 1935 . Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names . Michael van Langren 's 1645 map calls it " <unk> <unk> . Pri . " after Balthazar Charles , then the heir apparent to the kingdoms of Spain . And Johannes Hevelius called it " Mons <unk> " after the mountains near Olbia , Egypt . A particular region of very low ultraviolet albedo is called Wood 's Spot after its discoverer , Robert W. Wood .

 Surrounding Aristarchus are several smaller craters , many of which are probably secondary craters . Secondary craters form when large blocks ejected from the primary crater <unk> the surface at high velocities . By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to the primary crater . 
 The following craters have been renamed by the IAU . 
 Aristarchus A — See Väisälä . 
 Aristarchus C — See <unk> .

She had small roles in a few theatrical films , including Falling in Love Again ( 1980 ) with Susannah York , The Hollywood Knights ( 1980 ) opposite Tony Danza , and Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen ( 1981 ) , none of which met with much critical or box office success . Pfeiffer later said of her early screen work : " I needed to learn how to act ... in the meantime , I was playing bimbos and cashing in on my looks . " She appeared in a television commercial for Lux soap , and took acting lessons at the Beverly Hills Playhouse , before appearing in three further television movies – Callie and Son ( 1981 ) with Lindsay Wagner , The Children Nobody Wanted ( 1981 ) , and a 1981 TV movie remake of Splendor in the Grass . She then landed her first major film role as Stephanie <unk> in Grease 2 ( 1982 ) , the sequel to the smash @-@ hit musical Grease ( 1978 ) . The film was a critical and commercial failure , and Pfeiffer 's single release of " Cool Rider " from the film 's soundtrack on PolyGram failed to dent the music charts . Nevertheless , Pfeiffer received some positive attention for her performance , notably from the New York Times , which said " although she is a relative screen newcomer , Miss Pfeiffer manages to look much more insouciant and comfortable than anyone else in the cast " . Despite escaping the critical mauling , Pfeiffer 's agent later admitted that her association with the film meant that " she couldn 't get any jobs . Nobody wanted to hire her " .

 Director Brian De Palma , having seen Grease 2 , refused to audition Pfeiffer for Scarface ( 1983 ) , but relented at the insistence of Martin Bregman , the film 's producer . She was cast as cocaine @-@ addicted trophy wife Elvira Hancock . The film was considered excessively violent by most critics , but became a commercial hit and gained a large cult following in subsequent years . Pfeiffer received positive reviews for her supporting turn ; Richard Corliss of Time Magazine wrote , " most of the large cast is fine : Michelle Pfeiffer is better ... " while Dominick Dunne , in an article for Vanity Fair titled " Blonde Ambition " , wrote , " [ s ] he is on the verge of stardom . In the parlance of the industry , she is hot " .

Pfeiffer then appeared as chic <unk> Jo Ann <unk> in Tequila Sunrise ( 1988 ) opposite Mel Gibson and Kurt Russell , but experienced creative and personal differences with director Robert Towne , who later described her as the " most difficult " actress he has ever worked with . 
 At Demme 's personal recommendation , Pfeiffer joined the cast of Stephen Frears 's Dangerous Liaisons ( 1988 ) alongside Glenn Close and John Malkovich , playing the virtuous victim of seduction , Madame Marie de <unk> . Her performance won her widespread acclaim ; Hal Hinson of the Washington Post saw Pfeiffer 's role as " the least obvious and the most difficult . Nothing is harder to play than virtue , and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try . Instead , she embodies it . Her porcelain @-@ skinned beauty , in this regard , is a great asset , and the way it 's used makes it seem an aspect of her spirituality " . She won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress .

Pfeiffer herself stated that she took the role because it " wasn 't what people would expect of [ her ] . " Pfeiffer was once again nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance .

" For her portrayal of the eccentric Dallas housewife , she won the Silver Bear Best Actress award at the Berlin International Film Festival . 
 Pfeiffer took the role of Catwoman ( Selina Kyle ) in Tim Burton 's Batman Returns ( 1992 ) opposite Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito .

She was constantly praised for the amount of dimension and authenticity she brought to the character . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised her for giving the " feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit " and called her a " classic dazzler " . Premiere retrospectively lauded her performance : " Arguably the outstanding villain of the Tim Burton era , Michelle Pfeiffer 's deadly kitten with a whip brought sex to the normally neutered franchise . Her stitched @-@ together , black patent leather costume , based on a sketch of Burton 's , remains the character 's most iconic look . And Michelle Pfeiffer overcomes Batman Returns ' heavy @-@ handed feminist dialogue to deliver a growling , fierce performance " . The movie met a big box office success , grossing over $ 266 million worldwide ( equivalent to $ 448 @.@ 5 million ) . 
 The following year , she played Countess Ellen <unk> in Martin Scorsese 's film adaptation of Edith Wharton 's The Age of Innocence ( 1993 ) opposite Daniel Day @-@ Lewis and Winona Ryder .

 Pfeiffer 's subsequent career choices have met with varying degrees of success . After The Age of Innocence , she played the role of Laura Alden opposite Jack Nicholson in Wolf ( 1994 ) , a horror film that garnered a mixed critical reception . The New York Times wrote : " Ms. Pfeiffer 's role is underwritten , but her performance is expert enough to make even diffidence compelling " . The movie grossed US $ 65 million ( equivalent to $ 103 @.@ 8 million ) at the domestic box office and US $ 131 million worldwide ( equivalent to $ 209 @.@ 1 million ) .

Pfeiffer then portrayed Sally Atwater in the romantic drama Up Close & Personal ( 1996 ) opposite Robert Redford . The film 's screenplay , co @-@ written by husband and wife team John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion , was intended to be a biographical account of the career of news anchor Jessica Savitch , but the final version had almost nothing to do with Savitch 's life , leading Dunne to write an exposé of his eight @-@ year battle with the Hollywood producers , Monster : Living Off the Big Screen . 
 She took the role of Gillian Lewis in To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday ( 1996 ) , which was adapted by her husband David Kelley from Michael Brady 's play of the same name .

The film was produced by her company , but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas . 
 The Hitchcockian thriller What Lies Beneath ( 2000 ) with Harrison Ford , was a commercial success , opening number one at the box office in July 2000 . She then accepted the role of highly strung lawyer Rita Harrison in I Am Sam ( 2001 ) opposite Sean Penn . The movie received unfavorable reviews , The Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer wrote : " Pfeiffer , apparently stymied by the bland clichés that prop up her screechy role , delivers her flattest , <unk> performance ever " . Although another journalist blamed her performance on the poor material given to work with . SF Gate wrote : " In one scene , she breaks down in tears as she <unk> herself to him about her miserable life . It 's hard not to cringe , watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material " . 
 For her performance as murderous artist Ingrid Magnussen in White Oleander ( 2002 ) , alongside Alison Lohman ( in her film début ) , Renée Zellweger and Robin Wright Penn , Pfeiffer garnered a substantial amount of critical praise . Stephen Holden of the New York Times wrote that " Ms. Pfeiffer , giving the most complex screen performance of her career , makes her Olympian seductress at once irresistible and diabolical " . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described her as " incandescent , " bringing " power and unshakable will to her role as mother @-@ master manipulator " in a " riveting , impeccable performance " . She earned Best Supporting Actress Awards from the San Diego Film Critics Society and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle , as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination . 
 Pfeiffer also did voice work in two animated films during this period , voicing Tzipporah in The Prince of Egypt ( 1998 ) , in which she introduced the Academy Award – winning song , ' When You Believe ' , and Eris in Sinbad : Legend of the Seven Seas ( 2003 ) .

Her next film , an adaptation of Colette 's Chéri ( 2009 ) , reunited her with the director ( Stephen Frears ) and screenwriter ( Christopher Hampton ) of Dangerous Liaisons ( 1988 ) , a film for which all three were nominees for ( and , in Hampton 's case , recipient of ) an Academy Award . Pfeiffer played the role of Léa de <unk> opposite Rupert Friend in the title role , with Kathy Bates as his mother . Chéri premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2009 , and received a nomination for the Golden Bear award . The Times of London reviewed the film favorably , describing Hampton 's screenplay as a " steady flow of dry quips and acerbic one @-@ liners " and Pfeiffer 's performance as " magnetic and subtle , her worldly nonchalance a mask for vulnerability and heartache " . Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun @-@ Times wrote that it was " fascinating to observe how Pfeiffer controls her face and voice during times of painful hurt " . Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times praised the " wordless scenes that catch Léa unawares , with the camera alone seeing the despair and regret that she hides from the world . It 's the kind of refined , delicate acting Pfeiffer does so well , and it 's a further reminder of how much we 've missed her since she 's been away " .

Other film actors appearing in the play included Jeff Goldblum as Malvolio and Mary Elizabeth <unk> as Viola . Frank Rich 's review in the New York Times was extremely critical of the production , stating " Ms. Pfeiffer offers an object lesson in how gifted stars with young careers can be misused by those more interested in exploiting their celebrity status than in furthering their artistic development " . Rich praised Pfeiffer 's performance in what was then her most recent film , the screwball comedy Married to the Mob , but stating it was " unfortunate that the actress has been asked to make both her stage and Shakespearean comic debut in a role chained to melancholy and mourning " .

 While taking acting classes in Los Angeles , Pfeiffer was taken in by a seemingly friendly couple who ran a metaphysics and vegetarian cult . While they helped Pfeiffer to no longer drink , smoke , or do drugs , the couple took control of her entire life . Much of her money went to the group . " I was brainwashed ...

 Culture commentators noted that in 2014 , Pfeiffer , who was not promoting any movies at the time , had become a " pop @-@ music muse " and was mentioned by name in the lyrics of two separate songs moving up the charts at that time : " Uptown Funk " by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars and " Riptide " by Vance Joy . 
 Pfeiffer is mentioned in Vance Joy 's 2013 song , " Riptide " ( " I swear she 's destined for the screen , Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you 've ever seen " ) Joy told reporters that the Pfeiffer film moment which led him to include her name in his song was her portrayal of Selina Kyle in Batman Returns . He said , " She comes back to her apartment after being thrown out the window by Christopher Walken and she goes mental . Her apartment 's all pink and beautiful , and kind of creepy and infantile , then she just smashes it all up and spray paints stuff and transforms into Catwoman . It ’ s this really kind of sexual scene ; it ’ s amazing . " 
 Pfeiffer is mentioned in Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars 's 2014 song , " Uptown Funk " ( " This hit , That ice cold , Michelle Pfeiffer , That white gold " ) In an interview Ronson answered a reporter saying his favorite Pfeiffer movie was " The Fabulous Baker Boys . I also liked her in Scarface and Tequila Sunrise . She was such a babe " . 
 Australian cricketers speak of " getting a Michelle " when they take five wickets in an innings . This means they have taken " Five for " which has become a " Pfeiffer " and hence a " Michelle " .

 = Kalidas ( film ) = 
 Kalidas ( English : The Servant of Kali ) , also known as Kalidasa , is a 1931 Indian Tamil @-@ language biographical film directed by H. M. Reddy and produced by Ardeshir Irani . It is noted for being the first Tamil language sound film , and the first sound film to be made in South India . The film was based on the life of the Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa ; it featured P. G. Venkatesan in the title role and T. P. Rajalakshmi as the female lead , with L. V. Prasad , Thevaram Rajambal , T. Susheela Devi , J. Sushila and M. S. Santhanalakshmi in supporting roles . 
 Kalidas , principally in Tamil , contained additional dialogue in Telugu and Hindi . While Rajalakshmi spoke in Tamil , Venkatesan spoke only in Telugu due to his lack of fluency in Tamil , and Prasad spoke only in Hindi . Despite its mythological theme , the film featured songs from much later time periods , such as the compositions of carnatic musician Tyagaraja , publicity songs of the Indian National Congress , and songs about Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement . The sound was recorded using the Vitaphone system . Kalidas was shot in Bombay on the sets of India 's first sound film Alam Ara ( 1931 ) and was completed in eight days . 
 Kalidas was released amidst high expectations on 31 October 1931 , coinciding with Diwali day . It was the only Tamil film to be produced and released that year . Despite numerous technical flaws , it received critical acclaim , with praise aimed at Rajalakshmi 's singing performance . The film became a commercial success , grossing over ₹ 75 @,@ 000 ( about US $ 25 @,@ 252 in 1931 ) against a budget of ₹ 8 @,@ 000 ( about US $ 2 @,@ 693 in 1931 ) . The success of Kalidas spawned numerous other films based upon Kālidāsa , including Mahakavi Kalidasa ( 1955 ) , Mahakavi <unk> ( 1960 ) and Mahakavi Kalidas ( 1966 ) . 
 The film became a major breakthrough in Rajalakshmi 's career , and a trendsetter for future Tamil sound films . Because no print , gramophone record or songbook of the film is known to survive , this makes it a lost film .

 Kalidas is the first sound film to be produced in South Indian cinema , and the first in Tamil . It was based on the life of the Sanskrit poet and playwright Kālidāsa . The film was produced by Ardeshir Irani , who directed India 's first sound film Alam Ara , and was directed by his former assistant , H. M. Reddy , for the studio Imperial <unk> @-@ Tone . P. G. Venkatesan was chosen to play the title role . L. V. Prasad — who later founded Prasad Studios — appeared in a comic role as a temple priest . It was his second appearance in a feature film , following Alam Ara . Theatre artiste T. P. Rajalakshmi was chosen to play the female protagonist ; according to film historian Randor Guy , she was the " automatic choice to play the heroine . " Before this , Rajalakshmi had acted in many silent films , and Kalidas was her first sound film . Supporting roles were played by Thevaram Rajambal , T. Susheela Devi , J. Sushila and M. S. Santhanalakshmi . The sound was recorded by German technicians using the Vitaphone system . Kalidas was shot in Bombay ( now Mumbai ) on the sets of Alam Ara ; it was completed in eight days , using either 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) or 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) of film , as per different sources . Film historian Film News Anandan states that Kalidas " was produced in a hurry , and was technically flawed . " 
 While Kalidas ' primary language was Tamil , the characters in the film spoke a variety of languages , including Tamil ( Vidhyadhari ) , Telugu ( Kalidas ) and Hindi ( the temple priest ) . Because Venkatesan 's first language was Telugu and he could not correctly pronounce Tamil words , his dialogue was in Telugu . Irani was initially unsure if the German sound recording equipment would record the Tamil language . To clear his doubts , he had some actors speak and sing in Tamil , Venkatesan in Telugu and because the equipment had already recorded Hindi before , he had other actors speak Hindi ; the equipment recorded all the three languages clearly . Owing to the use of multiple languages , sources including Film News Anandan , Birgit Meyer , G. Dhananjayan and Randor Guy have refused to call Kalidas the first Tamil sound film ; the latter two instead call it India 's first multi @-@ lingual film . In the 2010 book Cinemas of South India : Culture , Resistance , Ideology , Sowmya Dechamma states that Telugu dialogues were included in the film , apparently to " increase its market potential in the two important language markets of southern India . " According to Dhananjayan , the film had dialogues in Tamil and Telugu because during that period , both languages were spoken in the Madras Presidency . 
 = = Music = = 
 Kalidas featured fifty songs composed and written by Bhaskara Das . Film historian S. Theodore Baskaran mentions in his 1996 book , The Eye of the Serpent : An Introduction to Tamil Cinema , that all of the songs were in Tamil . Birgit Meyer contradicted Baskaran in her 2009 book Aesthetic Formations , stating that the film had Telugu songs , a view supported by Sowmya Dechamma in Cinemas of South India : Culture , Resistance , Ideology , and G. Dhananjayan in his books The Best of Tamil Cinema ( 2011 ) and Pride of Tamil Cinema ( 2014 ) . 
 Although the film was based on mythology , it featured compositions from much later time periods , such as those by the carnatic musician Tyagaraja and Indian National Congress publicity songs . Film News Anandan says Reddy was " probably pleased to add on anything artistic that came his way . Relevance was hardly an issue . " The 2008 book Tamil Cinema : The Cultural Politics of India 's Other Film Industry by Selvaraj Velayutham and Aesthetic Formations by Birgit Meyer stipulate that the nationalistic songs featured in the film had nothing to do with the main plot , while Randor Guy states during that period , " Historical accuracy wasn 't as important as the music . It wasn 't uncommon for the deities to sing modern poems or nationalist songs . " 
 The patriotic song " <unk> Kai <unk> " ( English : The <unk> that [ Mahatma ] Gandhi handles ) , also known as " <unk> ... Gandhi Kai <unk> ... " , was sung by T. P. Rajalakshmi , and was unrelated to the story of Kalidas ; the song extolled the charkha ( spinning wheel ) , a Gandhian symbol of nationalism . Rajalakshmi also performed Tyagaraja 's composition " Enta <unk> " for the film , in the raga <unk> . Another song which Rajalakshmi performed , " <unk> <unk> " , became popular among young women , and another , " <unk> <unk> Eno Veen Sandai " , spoke about the Indian independence movement and the need for unity among Indians . According to Dhananjayan , India 's national slogan " Vande Mataram " was featured in some of the songs . Guy described " <unk> <unk> " as the " first hit song of Tamil Cinema " . No songbook of the film is known to survive . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 An advertisement announcing the release of Kalidas was published in 30 October 1931 issue of the Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran , where it was billed as the " First Tamil @-@ Telugu Talking Picture " . Kalidas was first released theatrically at the Madras ( now Chennai ) based theatre Kinema Central ( now known as the Murugan Theatre ) on 31 October 1931 , during the festive occasion of Diwali and coincided with the Civil Disobedience Movement . 
 When the film reels were taken to Madras , thousands of people gathered at the city 's central railway station and followed the reel box along Wall Tax Road to Kinema Central , throwing rose petals , breaking open coconuts and burning incense . The posters of the film read , " Tamil Telugu <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( English : " Tamil Telugu talking singing film " ) . An earlier attempt at producing a Tamil sound film , a four @-@ reel short titled <unk> <unk> Paadal ( English : <unk> Dance and Songs ) , was screened alongside Kalidas as a side attraction . It starred Rajalakshmi and the gypsy dancer Jhansi Bai . In a 2015 interview with The Times of India , Rajalakshmi 's daughter Kamala stated that during the film 's release , " people in Madras used to stand outside theatres for a distance of about 4 @-@ <unk> to witness [ Rajalakshmi ] acting in her first <unk> <unk> . She was welcomed with a roar here . Her name was announced from speakers installed on roads and autorickshaws , as a talkie was something new for the people . " 
 In his 1997 book Starlight , Starbright : The Early Tamil Cinema , Randor Guy described Kalidas as a " crude experiment " that had poor lip sync ; when characters opened their mouths there was no sound , and when dialogue or song was heard , artistes remained silent . He said the public did not care about technical niceties and flocked to see the film . Swadesamitran printed a favourable review for Kalidas on 29 October 1931 , two days prior to its theatrical release . The reviewer stated , " The film will certainly run for a few weeks " and appreciated the singing of Rajalakshmi , calling the film a " must watch " for all . Kalidas was commercially successful , grossing over ₹ <unk> ( about US $ 25 @,@ 252 in 1931 ) and easily covering its budget of ₹ 8000 ( about US $ 2 @,@ 693 in 1931 ) . G. Dhananjayan said the film succeeded because it was a " novelty for the audience to witness an audio visual with dialogues and songs of their language " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The arrival of sound in South Indian cinema , with the release of Kalidas , triggered a migration of theatre artists into cinema . Kalidas was the only Tamil film to be produced and released in 1931 . No print or gramophone record of the film is known to survive , making it a lost film . The Indian Express stated in 2014 that the film had " turned to dust " long before the National Film Archive of India was established in 1964 . The only remaining artefacts include a few stills , a pre @-@ release advertisement and an image of the cover of the songbook . 
 Kalidas became a trendsetter for sound films in Tamil cinema . It was a major breakthrough in Rajalakshmi 's career , and made her a " bankable singing star " . The film was remade in Kannada by K. R. Seetharam Shastry as Mahakavi Kalidasa ( 1955 ) , which was also critically appreciated and commercially successful . Other Kālidāsa @-@ themed films include the Hindi film Kavi Kalidas ( 1959 ) , the Telugu film Mahakavi <unk> ( 1960 ) , the Tamil film Mahakavi Kalidas ( 1966 ) , and the Kannada film <unk> Kalidasa ( 1983 ) . 
 = Love & Monsters = 
 " Love & Monsters " is the tenth episode of the second series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on BBC One on 17 June 2006 . It was written by executive producer and lead writer Russell T Davies and directed by Dan Zeff . 
 The series typically follows alien time traveller the Doctor ( in his tenth incarnation , played by David Tennant ) and his companion ( s ) ( at this time Rose Tyler , played by Billie Piper ) , who travel around time and space in a machine called the TARDIS . However , " Love & Monsters " follows a contemporary ordinary man named Elton Pope ( Marc Warren ) who becomes obsessed with a man called the Doctor and his strange blue box , and joins a group of like @-@ minded people in hopes of finding him . But when the mysterious Victor Kennedy ( Peter Kay ) joins the group , the fun stops and Elton discovers a darker side to his interests . Kennedy ultimately turns out to be a creature called the Abzorbaloff . 
 Due to the addition of a Christmas special in the production schedule , an episode had to be " double banked " with another story ( in this case " The Impossible Planet " and " The Satan Pit " ) for production to finish on time . With " Love & Monsters " , Davies was able to tell a story from a different character 's point of view to allow for only a small appearance by Tennant and Piper . The " Doctor @-@ lite " and " companion @-@ lite " structure has since continued in the programme . The Abzorbaloff was also incorporated into the episode by necessity , as it was the winner of a Blue Peter children 's competition to design a Doctor Who monster . " Love & Monsters " was watched by 6 @.@ 66 million viewers in the United Kingdom and was met with divisive reception by critics and fans . Some praised the complexities of the script , while others felt it was a parody or strayed into offensive humour . Kay and the Abzorbaloff also attracted divided opinions . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode is presented as an excerpt from the video diary of Elton Pope ( Marc Warren ) , a young man who is describing his encounters with the Doctor . Elton 's on @-@ camera narration forms a present @-@ day frame story to a series of flashbacks related to the Doctor . Elton recalls a chance meeting with the Doctor and remembers having seen the same man as a child in his living room one night . On the internet he discovers others , including Ursula Blake ( Shirley Henderson ) , who have also reported similar experiences with the Doctor . Elton and Ursula form a group known as LINDA , the " London Investigation ' N ' Detective Agency " . They are joined by three other people : Bridget ( Moya Brady ) , Bliss ( Kathryn Drysdale ) , and Mr Skinner ( Simon Greenall ) . LINDA meets in a library basement to discuss their experiences , but soon their meetings become more social in nature . 
 One day a man by the name of Victor Kennedy ( Peter Kay ) interrupts a meeting and points out that LINDA has lost focus . He reinvigorates the group 's efforts to locate the Doctor by teaching them spying techniques . Elton is given the task of getting close to Rose Tyler 's mother Jackie ( Camille Coduri ) . He manages to meet Jackie at a laundrette and is invited to her apartment . She tries and fails to seduce him , but when she finds a picture of Rose in Elton 's jacket she demands that he leave her alone . Meanwhile , Bridget and Bliss disappear from the group unexpectedly . Victor explains their absence by saying that they quit to move on with their lives . After a meeting Elton , Ursula and Mr Skinner stage a walkout . Victor persuades Mr Skinner to remain behind , but Elton and Ursula leave . Ursula realises she forgot her phone , and she returns with Elton only to discover that Victor is an alien being known as the Abzorbaloff . They see the faces of the former LINDA members and other victims protruding from Victor 's body . Victor manages to absorb Ursula , but Elton gets away from him . 
 Victor chases Elton into a dead end alley . Before the Abzorbaloff can touch him , the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose step out . Rose begins to chastise Elton for disturbing her mother Jackie before she sees that something is wrong . The Abzorbaloff tries to absorb Elton but the already absorbed members of LINDA use their willpower to hold back the Abzorbaloff 's body . The <unk> drops its cane , which Elton breaks at Ursula 's instruction . The cane contained a field generator that kept the Abzorbaloff in control of its body , without it the creature dissolves into the Earth . The Doctor explains that he was at Elton 's house years ago tracking an elemental shade , but he was too late and the shade killed Elton 's mother . 
 In Elton 's concluding narrative , Ursula 's voice is heard and it is revealed that the Doctor was able to use his sonic screwdriver to keep Ursula 's essence alive . Ursula 's face is alive in a piece of paving stone that Elton keeps in his room . Elton explains that he and Ursula have an unconventional relationship and even have a love life . 
 = = = Continuity = = = 
 This episode contains flashbacks to the events of " Rose " , " Aliens of London " , and " The Christmas Invasion " ; some footage was reused , but most was restaged to be from Elton 's point of view . Rose remarks on the Abzorbaloff as being a little bit Slitheen @-@ ish in appearance ; the Abzorbaloff states that he comes from Clom , the sister planet of the Slitheen homeworld Raxacoricofallapatorius . Victor Kennedy mentions that Rose 's Torchwood files are missing because they were corrupted by a " Bad Wolf virus " , referencing both the recurring phrases of the first and second series . This line was included to establish why Torchwood does not know what Rose looks like later in " Army of Ghosts " . The copy of The Daily Telegraph that the Abzorbaloff reads has the headline " Saxon leads polls with 64 percent " . This is the first appearance of the name of " Mr Saxon " , a feature of a story arc in the third series . " That LINDA lot " is later mentioned by the Fifth Doctor in the Children in Need special " Time Crash " . 
 = = Production = = 
 Unlike the vast majority of Doctor Who stories , " Love & Monsters " has only nominal appearances by the TARDIS crew , and is not from their point of view . This was a production necessity because the Christmas special had increased the number of episodes to produce from 13 to 14 . As such , the production was " double banked " with " The Impossible Planet " / " The Satan Pit " so Tennant and Piper could film those episodes while another unit worked on " Love & Monsters " . The " Doctor @-@ lite " ( and sometimes " companion @-@ lite " ) structure has continued as a tradition , producing episodes such as " Blink " ( 2007 ) , " Turn Left " ( 2008 ) , and " The Girl Who Waited " ( 2011 ) . 
 As such , executive producer and writer Russell T Davies had to come up with a story that had a good reason to keep the Doctor and Rose out . Davies was inspired by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode " The Zeppo " and the Star Trek : The Next Generation episode " Lower Decks " , both of which focused on atypical characters . Davies described the episode , " It 's an experimental script . Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday @-@ night BBC1 , because you can experiment too much . People still want a bit of a monster and a bit of a thrill and a bit of the Doctor , so it still delivers as normal Doctor Who . But just as you think you know everything this programme can do , this puts a little bit of spin on it . " The episode had the working title of " I Love the Doctor " . The acronym " LINDA " was previously used on the British children 's television programme Why Don 't You ? , which featured the " Liverpool Investigation ' N ' Detective Agency " . Russell T Davies worked on the series for some years . 
 According to Davies , in an early draft , Elton would have been witness to more events in Doctor Who history : in this draft , Elton 's third birthday party was evacuated because of the Dalek invasion of Shoreditch ( Remembrance of the Daleks ) , his mother was killed by a plastic daffodil ( Terror of the Autons ) instead of an elemental shade , and he also would have been one of those who saw the Loch Ness Monster rising from the Thames ( Terror of the Zygons ) . Prior to the revival of Doctor Who , Davies had considered pitching this story idea to Doctor Who Magazine as a comics story . Davies had also considered making the viewpoint character of the story a woman but felt that he already had enough focus on female guest characters that series . Davies wanted Elton to be a " normal guy " and not geeky with a " funny voice " . It is noted Elton 's memory may not be entirely reliable , so whether events in the episode happened the way he remembers them is debatable . 
 Another necessity the episode had to fulfill was to include the winner of Blue Peter 's " Design a Doctor Who Monster " competition . The winner , the Abzorbaloff was designed by nine @-@ year @-@ old William Grantham . Davies said of the monster , " I thought the Abzorbaloff was brilliant . It touches people , absorbs them and their face actually appears in the body — terrifying . " According to producer Phil Collinson , William was disappointed with the rendering of the monster because he had envisaged it being " the size of a double @-@ decker bus " , but the production team was never informed of this . Peter Kay had written a letter to Davies after the new series began in June 2005 , and Davies replied to him in September offering a guest spot in an episode . Kay was originally offered the part of Elton , but he felt the " UFO @-@ spotter type " was too similar to his character on Coronation Street and much preferred playing the " baddie " . The creature that Elton sees at the start of the episode is credited as the " <unk> " . Davies notes in the commentary that the name was invented only after the episode was shot and a name was needed for the credits . 
 Director Dan Zeff said of the tone the production team wished to capture , " Working with an inspirational design team , we wanted to emphasise a melancholy feel , an emptiness in the world around our characters – big urban spaces that once may have been full of life , but now lay abandoned , rusting , decayed . Amidst this , Elton and his fragile group of friends would almost feel cast adrift – increasingly vulnerable as they are led astray by the sinister Victor Kennedy . " The episode features the songs " Mr. Blue Sky " , " Don 't Bring Me Down " , and " Turn to Stone " by Electric Light Orchestra ( ELO ) , Elton 's favorite band .

It was then rereleased as part of the Complete Second Series boxset on 20 November 2006 . 
 " Love & Monsters " is noted for having a divided reception . Nick Setchfield of SFX rated the episode 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 , noting how it " finally gives Doctor Who a whole new vocabulary as a television programme . " He wrote , " This may be Russell T Davies ’ s smartest , funniest script . It ’ s certainly the warmest , and somehow it feels like the most personal . " While Setchfield was not a fan of Kay , he found his performance in this episode funny . IGN 's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a score of 9 @.@ 5 out of 10 , particularly praising the dialogue . However , he felt that some of the sadder aspects " seemed out of place in what should have been a purely light @-@ hearted comedic episode " . Slant Magazine reviewer Ross Ruediger was positive towards " Love & Monsters " , saying that " there 's no reason the series can 't do something this quirky and beautiful when an inspired mind conjures up such a scenario . " Ruediger commented on the truths of meeting other fans on the Internet and praised the depth of Jackie 's character . 
 In 2011 , SFX named " Love & Monsters " as one of the best Sci @-@ Fi TV <unk> , saying that it worked as an example of the genre and was not too bad on rewatch . The article noted that criticisms of the episode ranged from " Kay 's overacting and the silly Slitheen @-@ esque monster to annoyance at how , well , lame the members of LINDA are . " Louisa Pearson of The Scotsman noted that hardcore fans would dislike the comedy and the " panto " performance of Kay , but commented , " It 's true , this episode came close to being a spoof , but it was actually quite nice to have a rest from the Doctor . Even saving the world gets boring sometimes . " Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode a grade of D- . He was positive towards the first 30 minutes , which he described as a " touching little tale " with interesting characters , but called the final 10 minutes " juvenile attack on the audience 's intelligence and emotions " that ruined the episode with " a laughable monster and offensive humor at exactly the wrong moment " . Digital Spy 's Dek Hogan criticised Kay 's performance , calling the Abzorbaloff " a marvellous idea and it 's a pity his creativity was absorbed by a turn from a visiting comedian " . In a review of the series , Stephen Brook of The Guardian stated that he " hated " the episode , describing it as a " parody of Doctor Who fans " . The scene where Elton says he and Ursula have " a bit of a love life " was criticised by some commentators , who felt that the resultant implication of having oral sex with a paving slab was unsuitable for Doctor Who 's large family audience ; others , however , dismissed this dialogue as a harmless joke that children would not understand . " Love & Monsters " was placed in 153rd position in Doctor Who Magazine 's Mighty 200 reader survey in 2009 , which ranked every Doctor Who story to that point in order of preference . 
 = Battle of Malvern Hill = 
 The Battle of Malvern Hill , also known as the Battle of Poindexter 's Farm , was fought on July 1 , 1862 between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia , led by Gen. Robert E. Lee , and the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan . It was the final battle of the Seven Days Battles during the American Civil War , taking place on a 130 @-@ foot ( 40 m ) elevation of land known as Malvern Hill , near the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia and just one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the James River . Including inactive reserves , more than fifty thousand soldiers from each side took part , using more than two hundred pieces of artillery and three warships . 
 The Seven Days Battles were the climax of the Peninsula Campaign , during which McClellan 's Army of the Potomac sailed around the Confederate lines , landed at the tip of the Virginia Peninsula , southeast of Richmond , and struck inland towards the Confederate capital . Confederate commander @-@ in @-@ chief Joseph E. Johnston fended off McClellan 's repeated attempts to take the city , slowing Union progress on the peninsula to a crawl . When Johnston was wounded , Lee took command and launched a series of counterattacks , collectively called the Seven Days Battles . These attacks culminated in the action on Malvern Hill . 
 The Union 's V Corps , commanded by Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter , took up positions on the hill on June 30 . McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle , having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison 's Landing , where he intended to locate the base for his army . Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps . Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder to be late for the battle , an excess of caution delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger , and Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson had problems collecting the Confederate artillery . 
 The battle occurred in stages : an initial exchange of artillery fire , a minor charge by Confederate Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead , and three successive waves of Confederate infantry charges triggered by unclear orders from Lee and the actions of Maj. Gens . Magruder and D. H. Hill , respectively . In each phase , the effectiveness of the Federal artillery was the deciding factor , repulsing attack after attack , resulting in a tactical Union victory . After the battle , McClellan and his forces withdrew from Malvern Hill to Harrison 's Landing , where he remained until August 16 . His plan to capture Richmond had been thwarted . 
 In the course of four hours , a series of blunders in planning and communication had caused Lee 's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground , unsupported by Confederate artillery , charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses . These errors provided Union forces with an opportunity to inflict heavy casualties . In the aftermath of the battle , however , the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond . In stark contrast , McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield , a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864 .

 = = = Military situation = = = 
 In spring 1862 , Union commander Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan developed an ambitious plan to capture Richmond , the Confederate capital , on the Virginia Peninsula . His 121 @,@ 500 @-@ man Army of the Potomac , along with 14 @,@ 592 animals , 1 @,@ 224 wagons and ambulances , and 44 artillery batteries , would load onto 389 vessels and sail to the tip of the peninsula at Fort Monroe , then move inland and capture the capital . The bold and sweeping landing was executed with few incidents , but the Federals were delayed for about a month in the Siege of Yorktown . When McClellan 's army finally did attack on May 4 , the defensive earthworks around Yorktown were undefended . After some hours , the Army of the Potomac pursued the retreating Confederates . When Union troops encountered the Confederate rearguard at Williamsburg , the two armies fought an inconclusive battle . The Confederates continued their withdrawal that night . To stymie the Southerners ' retreat , McClellan sent Brig. Gen. William F. " Baldy " Smith to Eltham 's Landing by boat , resulting in a battle there on May 7 . When the Union Army tried to attack Richmond by way of the James River , they were turned back at Drewry 's Bluff on May 15 . All the while , McClellan continued his pursuit of Confederate forces , who were withdrawing quickly towards Richmond . 
 The lack of decisive action on the Virginia Peninsula spurred President Abraham Lincoln to order McClellan 's army to move into positions close to Richmond . By May 30 , McClellan had begun moving troops across the Chickahominy River , the only major natural barrier that separated his army from Richmond . However , heavy rains and thunderstorms on the night of May 30 caused the water level to swell , washing away two bridges and splitting the Federal army in two across the Chickahominy . In the subsequent Battle of Seven Pines , Confederate general @-@ in @-@ chief Joseph E. Johnston sought to capitalize on the bifurcation of McClellan 's army , attacking the half of the Union Army that was stuck south of the river . Johnston 's plan fell apart , and McClellan lost no ground . Late in the battle , Johnston was hit in the right shoulder by a bullet and in the chest by a shell fragment ; his command went to Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith . Smith 's tenure as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia was short . On June 1 , after an unsuccessful attack on Union forces , Jefferson Davis , the President of the Confederacy , appointed Robert E. Lee , his own military adviser , to replace Smith as the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Confederate armies . 
 The subsequent two weeks on the peninsula were mostly quiet . On June 25 , though , a surprise attack by McClellan began a series of six major battles over the next week near Richmond — the Seven Days Battles . On the first day , as Lee led the Army of Northern Virginia toward the Union lines , McClellan preempted him with an attack at Oak Grove . Lee 's men successfully warded off the Union assault , and Lee continued with his plans . The next morning , the Confederates attacked the Army of the Potomac at Mechanicsville . Union forces turned back the Confederate onslaught , inflicting heavy losses . After Mechanicsville , McClellan 's army withdrew to a position behind Boatswain 's Swamp . There , on June 27 , the Union soldiers suffered another Confederate attack , this time at Gaines 's Mill . In the resulting battle , the Confederates launched numerous failed charges , until a final concerted attack broke the Union line , resulting in the only clear Confederate victory during the Seven Days . The action at Garnett 's and Golding 's Farm , fought next , was merely a set of skirmishes . Lee attacked the Union Army at the Battle of Savage 's Station on June 29 and the battles of Glendale and White Oak Swamp June 30 , but all three battles were inconclusive . After this series of conflicts that inflicted thousands of casualties on both armies , McClellan began to position his forces to an imposing natural position atop Malvern Hill . 
 = = = Geography and location = = = 
 Malvern Hill , a plateau @-@ like elevation in Henrico County , Virginia , provided an impressive natural military position about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of the James River . The hill rose some 130 feet ( 40 m ) to its crest to form a crescent about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) in length and 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) wide . Its slope was about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) in length and very gradual , with only one or two notable depressions . Along the western side of the hill ran Malvern Cliffs , a bluff @-@ like formation that overlooked Turkey Run , a tributary of nearby Turkey Island Creek . Western Run was another tributary of Turkey Island Creek , which lay mostly along the eastern side of the hill and slanted slightly into the northern side . One depression dipped some sixty feet ( 18 m ) at the valley of Western Run and slanted upwards to the plateau . Malvern Hill 's center was slightly lower than the flanks . The gentle , bare slant meant that any assailing army could not easily take cover , and artillery would have the benefit of a clear , open field . 
 Several farms were positioned near Malvern Hill . Roughly 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) north of the hill were the Poindexter and Carter farms . Between the two farms was a swampy and thickly wooded area that made up the course of Western Run . The largest in the area was the <unk> family 's farm , usually called the Crew farm for a former owner , situated at the western side of the hill . About a quarter of a mile due east of Malvern Hill was the West farm . Between these two farms lay the Willis Church Road , which some locals called the Quaker Road . This road also ran past the Malvern house , the hill 's namesake , which was perched atop the southern edge of the plateau . " It was , altogether , an exceedingly formidable position " , wrote historian Douglas Southall Freeman . " Had the Union engineers searched the whole countryside below Richmond , they could not have found ground more ideally set for the slaughter of an attacking army . "

 A few days prior to the action on Malvern Hill , McClellan incorrectly believed that the Army of the Potomac was vastly outnumbered by its Confederate foe , and his fear of being cut off from his supply depot left him cautious and wary . On the night of June 28 , McClellan told his generals that he intended to move his army to a position on the north bank of the James River called Harrison 's Landing , where they would be protected by Union gunboats . The Army of the Potomac came to Malvern Hill , the army 's final stop before reaching the Landing , with approximately 54 @,@ 000 men . 
 On the morning of June 30 , 1862 , the Union V Corps under Fitz John Porter , a part of McClellan 's Army of the Potomac , amassed atop Malvern Hill . Col. Henry Hunt , McClellan 's skilled chief of artillery , posted 171 guns on the hill and 91 more in reserve in the south . The artillery line on the hill 's slope consisted of eight batteries of field artillery with 37 guns . Brig. Gen. George Sykes 's division would guard the line . In reserve were additional field artillery and three batteries of heavy artillery , which included five 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 11 cm ) Rodman guns , five 20 @-@ pounder ( 9 @.@ 1 kg ) Parrott rifles and six 32 @-@ pounder ( 15 kg ) howitzers . As more of McClellan 's forces arrived at the hill , Porter continued to reinforce the Union line . Brig. Gen. George Morell 's units , stationed between the Crew and West farms , extended the line to the northeastern section . Brig. Gen. Darius Couch 's division of the IV Corps , as yet <unk> by the skirmishes of the Seven Days , further extended the northeastern line . This left 17 @,@ 800 soldiers from Couch 's and Morell 's divisions at the northern face of the hill , overlooking the Quaker Road , from which the Federals expected Lee 's forces to attack . 
 Early the next day , Tuesday , July 1 , McClellan , having come from nearby Haxall 's Landing the night before , examined his army 's battle line on Malvern Hill . His inspection left him worried most about the Union Army 's right ( eastern ) flank , which lay behind Western Run . Western Run was an area necessary for McClellan 's plans to relocate to Harrison 's Landing , and he feared an attack might come from there . As a result , he posted the largest portion of his army there : two divisions from Edwin Sumner 's II Corps , two divisions from Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman 's III Corps , two divisions from Brig. Gen. William Franklin 's VI Corps and one division from Maj. Gen. Erasmus Keyes 's IV Corps , who were stationed across the James . The division under Brig. Gen. George McCall , badly damaged in the fighting at Glendale with McCall himself wounded and captured , was held in general reserve . 
 McClellan did not believe his army was ready for a battle , and hoped that Lee would not give them one . Nonetheless , he left his troops at Malvern Hill and traveled downstream aboard the ironclad USS Galena to inspect his army 's future resting place at Harrison 's Landing . McClellan did not delegate an interim commander ; Porter , who was in command during the initial attack , became the de facto leader on the Union side of the battle . 
 = = = Lee 's forces advance = = = 
 With around 55 @,@ 000 soldiers , the Army of Northern Virginia was about evenly matched with the Federals , and with Lee at the helm , notably more aggressive . He wanted a final , decisive attack that would effectively scatter the Federals . Several pieces of evidence — abandoned commissary stores , wagons and arms , and the hundreds of Union stragglers and deserters his units had happened upon and captured — led Lee to conclude that the Army of the Potomac was demoralized and retreating . In all the battles up to Malvern Hill , Lee 's plans to destroy the Federal army had failed for one reason or another . Though he was undeterred , his chances for decisive victory were diminishing quickly . 
 Early on the morning of the battle , Lee met with his lieutenants , including Maj. Gens . James Longstreet , A. P. Hill , Thomas " Stonewall " Jackson , John Magruder and D. H. Hill . D. H. Hill , after talking with a chaplain familiar with the geography of Malvern Hill , cautioned against mounting an attack . " If General McClellan is there in strength , " Hill said , " we had better let him alone . " Longstreet laughed off Hill 's objections , saying " Don 't get so scared , now that we 've got him [ McClellan ] whipped . " 
 Lee chose the relatively well @-@ rested commands of D. H. Hill , Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder to lead the Confederate offensive , as they had barely participated in the fighting of the day before . Meanwhile , James Longstreet 's First Corps and A. P. Hill 's Light Division , who had fought the majority of the previous day 's hostilities , would be held in reserve . According to Lee 's plan , the Army of Northern Virginia would form a semi @-@ circle enveloping Malvern Hill . D. H. Hill 's five brigades would be placed along the northern face of the hill , forming the center of the Confederate line , and the commands of Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder would take the left and right flanks , respectively . Whiting 's forces would position themselves on the Poindexter farm , with the outfits of Brig. Gen. Charles Sidney Winder and Richard Ewell nearby . The infantry of these three detachments would provide reinforcement for the Confederate line if necessary . Maj. Gen. Theophilus Holmes would take up a position on the extreme Confederate right flank . 
 = = = Disposition of armies = = = 
 The Army of the Potomac 's disposition in the lead @-@ up to the battle was more orderly than Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia ; all of McClellan 's forces would be concentrated in one place , save for several divisions from Maj. Gen. Erasmus Keyes 's outfit and Keyes himself , who were posted across the James River at Haxall 's Landing . A Confederate scout observed Union soldiers resting in position , and moving about the hill unworried , whilst the disposition of the cannons around the hill 's slope gave him the impression that the position was " almost impregnable " . McClellan 's army was on the hill in force . 
 Throughout the Seven Days Battles , Lee 's forces had been separated and scattered due to swamps , narrow roads and other geographic obstacles , and occasionally due to unclear orders . As the days of marching and fighting wore on the number of stragglers swelled to fill narrow roads and significantly deplete the Confederate ranks , presenting a significant additional strain on their combat readiness . These hindrances continued during the Battle of Malvern Hill , with both Magruder and Huger making mistakes in the deployment of their forces . 
 At first , Magruder 's units were behind Stonewall Jackson 's column while marching down the Long Bridge Road , which led to Malvern Hill . Along this road were several adjoining pathways . One such road , called the Willis Church Road by some locals and the Quaker Road by others , led south from Glendale to Malvern Hill . Lee 's maps labeled this " Quaker Road " . Another of these paths began near a local farm and angled southwest toward an upriver point on the River Road — some locals called this the Quaker Road , including Magruder 's guides , who led Magruder 's army down this road rather than the Quaker Road shown on Lee 's maps . James Longstreet eventually rode after Magruder , and persuaded him to reverse course . This incident delayed Magruder 's arrival to the battlefield for three hours . 
 Huger , worried about clashing with Union forces while marching towards Malvern Hill , had also failed to manage his division effectively . He deployed two of his brigades , commanded by Brig. Gens . Lewis Armistead and Ambrose Wright , to perform a flanking maneuver around any Federals they found , to avoid the Union threat . Longstreet eventually notified Huger that he would be unobstructed by Federal forces if he marched to Malvern Hill . Huger , however , remained in place until someone from Lee 's headquarters came to guide them to the battlefield . 
 As noon drew near with no sight of either Huger or Magruder , who were supposed to be manning the Confederate right flank , Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig. Gens . Armistead and Wright , two of Huger 's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier . Huger and his other two brigades ( under Brig. Gens . Ransom and Mahone ) were still too far north of the scene . Despite the mishaps and disunity , Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to concentrate his force .

 Lee surveyed the left flank himself for possible artillery positions . After a reconnoitering expedition on the right flank , James Longstreet returned to Lee ; the two compared their results and concluded that two grand battery @-@ like positions would be established at the left and right sides of Malvern Hill . The converging artillery fire from the batteries , they reasoned , could weaken the Union line so that a Confederate infantry attack could break through . If this plan did not work out , Lee and Longstreet felt the artillery fire would buy them time to consider other plans . 
 With a battle plan in order , Lee sent a draft to his lieutenants , written by his chief of staff , Col. Robert Chilton ( see right box ) . The orders were not well @-@ crafted , however , since they designated the yell of a single charging brigade as the only signal of attack for a full fifteen brigades . Amid the tumult and clamor of battle , this was bound to create confusion . Moreover , Chilton 's draft effectively left the attack solely at the discretion of Lewis Armistead , who had never before held command of a brigade during battle . The draft also did not note the time that it had been written , which later caused confusion for Magruder . 
 = = = Failed Confederate barrage = = = 
 Beginning around 1 pm , Union artillery fired first , initially upon infantry in the woods , and later upon any Confederate artillery that attempted to move into firing position . On the Confederate left flank , two batteries from Whiting 's division and one from Jackson 's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch 's division of the IV Corps , who were near the center of the Union line . This began a fierce firefight , with the Union 's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns . The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable . The other two Confederate batteries , placed by Jackson himself , were in somewhat better positions , and managed to keep firing . Over a period of more than three hours , a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank , but they were usually engaged only one at a time . 
 On the Confederate right flank a total of six batteries engaged the Federals , but they did so one @-@ by @-@ one instead of in unison , and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire . Moreover , they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank , so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved . 
 In all , the Confederate artillery barrage on both flanks completely failed to achieve its objectives . Confederate fire did manage to kill Capt. John E. Beam of the Union 's 1st New Jersey Artillery , along with a few others , and several Federal batteries ( though none that were actually engaged ) had to move to avoid the fire . Although the barrage by Lee 's forces did claim a few lives , Union forces remained unfazed and continued their fearsome barrage . Indeed , Union Army Lt. Charles B. Haydon supposedly fell asleep during the artillery fight . On both the left and right flanks , several of the batteries that did engage lasted no more than minutes before being rendered incapable of fire . Moreover , in a failure of command that , according to historian Thomas M. Settles , must ultimately be placed on Lee 's shoulders , the movements of the two flanks were never coordinated with one another . D. H. Hill found the failure of the Confederate artillery discouraging and later dismissed the barrage as " most farcical " . 
 Meanwhile , the Union artillery fire was planned and directed nearly flawlessly . As historian Jennings Cropper Wise notes , Col. Hunt , McClellan 's chief of artillery , continuously refocused Union fire on various fronts , in an " enormous sheaf of fire of more than 50 superior pieces , disabling four of Huger 's and several of Jackson 's batteries almost the instant they came into action " . This severely hampered the Confederates ' ability to respond effectively to the Federal barrage . The Union artillery subdued a number of the Southerners ' batteries ; those few that remained attacked piecemeal , and failed to produce any significant result . 
 = = = Confederate infantry assaults = = = 
 Intense Confederate and especially Union artillery fire continued for at least an hour , slackening at about 2 : 30 pm . At about 3 : 30 pm , Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was , nearly within rifle range of them . Armistead sent three regiments ( about half of his brigade ) from his command to push back the skirmishers , thus beginning the infantry part of the battle . The skirmishers were repelled quickly , but Armistead 's men found themselves in the midst of an intense Union barrage . The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill 's slant . This position protected them from the fire , but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill , unsupported by either infantry or artillery . They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire . 
 = = = = Magruder 's charge = = = = 
 Not long after the advance of Armistead 's regiments , John Magruder and his men arrived near the battlefield , albeit quite late because of the confusion regarding the names of local roads — by this time , it was 4 pm . Magruder was told at that morning 's war council to move to Huger 's right , but he was unaware of Huger 's position , and sent Major Joseph L. Brent to locate Huger 's right flank . Brent found Huger , who said that he had no idea where his brigades were . Huger was noticeably upset that his men had been given orders by someone other than himself ; Lee had told Huger 's two brigades under Armistead and Ambrose Wright to advance to the right part of the Confederate line . Upon hearing of this , Magruder was quite confused . He sent Capt. A. G. Dickinson to find Lee and inform him of the " successful " charge of Armistead 's men and request further orders . Contrary to this message , Armistead was in fact pinned down halfway up Malvern Hill . At the same time , Whiting sent Lee an incorrect report that Union forces were retreating . Whiting had mistaken two events for a Federal withdrawal — the movement of Edwin Sumner 's troops , who were adjusting their position to avoid the Confederate fire , and the relaxing of Union fire on his side , which was actually the Union artillery concentrating their firepower to a different front . Whiting and Magruder 's erroneous reports led Lee to send a draft of orders to Magruder via Dickinson : " General Lee expects you to advance rapidly " , wrote Dickinson . " He says it is reported that the enemy is [ retreating ] . Press forward your whole line and follow up Armistead 's success . " Before Dickinson returned with these orders , Magruder was belatedly handed the order sent out three hours previously ( at 1 : 30 pm ) by Chilton . Since no time was affixed to the text of the orders , Magruder was unaware that these orders had been rendered meaningless by the failure of the Confederate artillery during the past few hours , and believed he had received two successive orders from Lee to attack . 
 Believing himself bound by Lee 's order to charge , but with his own brigades not yet in attacking position , Magruder mustered some five thousand men from Huger 's brigades , including those of Ambrose Wright and Maj. Gen. William Mahone and half of the men from Armistead 's brigade who were caught in the open battlefield . Magruder had also sent for Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom , Jr . , also under Huger 's command , who noted that he had been given strict instructions to ignore any orders not originating from Huger , and apologetically said he could not help Magruder . Magruder additionally ordered men under his personal command — three regiments of Brig. Gen. Howell Cobb 's brigade , plus Col. William Barksdale 's full brigade — to the attack . Because of the confusion regarding Quaker Road , however , these brigades were not yet near enough to do more than move into supporting position , and Magruder wanted to attack immediately . Despite this , under Magruder 's order at about 5 : 30 pm , Wright 's brigade with Armistead 's , then Mahone 's brigade , started darting out of the woods and towards the Union line . The artillery of the Confederate left flank , under Jackson 's personal command , also renewed their barrage with the late arrival of two batteries of Richard Ewell 's division . The Confederates were initially engaged solely by Union sharpshooters , but the latter quickly fell back to give their own artillery a clear field of fire . Antipersonnel canister shot was employed with deadly effect . Wright 's men were pinned down in a small depression on the rolling hillside , to the right of Armistead 's ; Mahone 's were driven back into retreat in about the same area . At some point during the first wave of assaults , Cobb moved into close supporting position behind Armistead . Barksdale 's men were also supporting , to the left of Armistead . 
 The firefight also alerted the three Union boats on the James — the ironclad USS Galena , and the gunboats USS Jacob Bell and USS Aroostook — which began lobbing missiles twenty inches ( 510 mm ) in length and eight inches ( 200 mm ) in diameter from their position on the James River onto the battlefield . The explosions and impacts of the gunboat fire impressed the Confederate troops , but the guns ' aim was unreliable , and the large shells did considerably less damage than might have been expected . 
 = = = = Hill 's charge = = = = 
 D. H. Hill had been discouraged by the failure of the Confederate artillery , and asked Stonewall Jackson to supplement Chilton 's draft . Jackson 's response was that Hill should obey the original orders : charge with a yell after Armistead 's brigade . No yell was heard for hours , and Hill 's men began building bivouac shelters to sleep in . Around 6 pm , Hill and his five brigade commanders had assumed that the lack of a signal meant that their army would not attempt any assault . They were conferring together about Chilton 's order when they heard yells and the commotion of a charge from their right flank , roughly where Armistead was supposed to be . Hill took the yell as the signal and shouted to his commanders , " That must be the general advance . Bring up your brigades as soon as possible and join in it . " D. H. Hill 's five brigades , with some 8 @,@ 200 men , had to contend with the dense woodlands around the Quaker Road and Western Run , which destroyed any order they may have had . Men advanced out of the woods towards the Union line in five separate , uncoordinated attacks , and each brigade charged up the hill alone : " We crossed one fence , went through another piece of woods , then over another fence [ and ] into an open field on the other side of which was a long line of Yankees " , wrote William Calder of the 2nd Regiment , North Carolina Infantry . " Our men charged gallantly at them . The enemy mowed us down by fifties . " Some brigades in Hill 's division made it close enough to exchange musket fire and engage in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , but these were driven back . The artillery response on the Federal side to Hill 's charge was particularly withering , and soon , Hill 's men needed support just to hold their ground . In Extraordinary Circumstances : The Seven Days Battles , Brian K. Burton called Hill 's charge " unnecessary and costly . " The successive assaults of Hill 's brigades on the well @-@ entrenched Federals were short @-@ lived , and achieved little . 
 = = = = Final assaults = = = = 
 Preceding attacks by Lee 's army had done barely anything to accomplish Confederate objectives , but this did not deter Magruder , who rode back and forth across the battlefield , calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line . At this point , men who had always been directly under Magruder 's command began to join the battle . Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs . With Toombs 's brigade widely dispersed , the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself . Magruder personally led the men in a short @-@ lived charge , followed by a disordered retreat . Other units nominally under Toombs 's command appeared , charged and retreated at various times throughout the next few hours , with little or no organization . The brigades of Col. George T. Anderson and Col. William Barksdale emerged from the woods to the right of Toombs , but as they did so , Anderson 's men also became separated , as the left side outpaced the right . This created an advance with two of Anderson 's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs , Barksdale 's men in the middle , and three more Anderson regiments on the far right , near the remnants of Wright and Mahone . Anderson 's right flank charged , but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery . Anderson 's left flank never charged . Barksdale 's brigade charged at roughly the same time , and made it considerably farther up the hill , engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in a firefight that lasted more than an hour . 
 Lee received Magruder 's calls for reinforcement and instructed Huger to let Ransom go support the men trapped on the field of battle . He also sent orders to the brigades of Brig. Gens . Joseph B. Kershaw and Paul Jones Semmes , in Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws 's division within Magruder 's command . Robert Ransom 's unit , after they finally showed up with Huger 's permission , first attempted to charge straight up the hill , following the path of other Confederate brigades attempting to aid Magruder . When this proved useless , Ransom ordered them to regroup in the woods to the Confederate right , march double @-@ time a half a mile in a hook to the right around all the other Confederate units and attack the far Union western flank . While Ransom was angling west , Jackson responded to a request for reinforcement from D. H. Hill by sending forward brigades from his own command to move from the east into the area where D. H. Hill had attacked . From his own division Jackson sent Brig. Gens . Alexander Lawton and Charles S. Winder , and from Ewell 's division , Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble and Cols . Leroy A. Stafford and Jubal Early . 
 Ransom 's men managed to come closer to the Union line than any Confederates that day , guided by the flashing light of the cannons amidst an encroaching darkness ; however , George Sykes 's artillery repelled that attack . The brigades of Kershaw and Semmes , sent earlier by Lee , arrived to the front while Ransom was moving to attack in another position . Semmes and Kershaw were quickly sent in ; they too were repulsed not long after . Semmes was west of the junction of Carter 's Mill Road and Willis Church Road , in the vicinity of Barksdale , Mahone and Wright . Semmes made the final charge of the day west of these roads , and like the charges before , it was to little effect . Kershaw angled east , in the area where Toombs , Anderson and Cobb had attacked . This was an area of great confusion . Kershaw 's troops arrived ahead of all the reinforcements sent by Jackson , and took fire from both friendly and hostile forces : from Confederates behind them firing wildly and Federals in front firing effectively . Kershaw 's men retreated in rout . The brigades behind Kershaw charged incoherently , with some men pushing forward , and others getting separated from their units or confused when they encountered groups of retreating Confederates . Disorganized , retreating soldiers from various units were so numerous that they slowed Jackson 's men to nearly a standstill . Jackson 's unit commanders attempted to organize their various regiments and rally the <unk> to join in , but it was all to very little effect . A few units fought fiercely against Union infantry and artillery . In particular , three regiments of Barlow 's brigade made it close enough to Union lines to engage in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with the troops of Brig. Gen. Daniel Sickles before being driven back . 
 Night was falling , however , and eventually all of these troops were ordered to merely hold their positions without charging . In the end , the charges of Semmes and Kershaw were the last coherent Confederate actions , and neither was successful . Brig. Gen. Porter summed up the Confederate infantry charges at Malvern Hill this way : 
 As if moved by a reckless disregard of life equal to that displayed at Gaines ' Mill , with a determination to capture our army , or destroy it by driving us into the river , brigade after brigade rushed at our batteries , but the artillery of both Morell and Couch mowed them down with shrapnel , grape , and canister , while our infantry , withholding their fire until the enemy were in short range , scattered the remnants of their columns , sometimes following them up and capturing prisoners and colors . 
 With the infantry part of the battle over , Union artillery continued to boom across the hill . They stopped firing at 8 : 30 pm , leaving a wreath of smoke upon the crest 's edge , and ending the action on Malvern Hill .

 The human toll of the Battle of Malvern Hill and the Seven Days Battles was shown clearly as both capitals , Washington and Richmond , set up numerous provisional hospitals to care for the dead , wounded and missing . Ships sailed from the Peninsula to Washington carrying the wounded . Richmond was nearest to the battlefields of the Seven Days , and the immense number of casualties meant that graves could not be dug quickly enough , overwhelming hospitals and doctors . People from about the Confederacy descended upon Richmond to care for the conflict 's casualties . 
 The Confederates counted some 5 @,@ 650 casualties . Some 30 @,@ 000 Confederates engaged that day , though several thousand more endured the Union shelling . Whiting 's unit suffered 175 casualties in the Malvern Hill conflict , even though they had limited involvement in the assaults . Charles Winder 's brigade of just over 1 @,@ 000 men suffered 104 casualties in their short involvement in the battle . D. H. Hill spent days removing the wounded , burying the dead and cleaning up the battlefield , with help from Magruder and Huger 's units . One of D. H. Hill 's brigades lost 41 percent of its strength at Malvern Hill alone . He later estimated that more than half of all the Confederate killed and wounded at Malvern Hill were as a result of artillery fire . 
 = = = Reasons for outcome = = = 
 The battle on Malvern Hill was a resounding Union tactical victory . The victory was due in no small part to Henry Hunt , the Union chief artillerist , who did proficient work in accumulating and concentrating the Union guns . Troop placement before the battle by the army 's principal topographical engineer , Col. A. A. Humphreys , was also carried out capably . The ground on Malvern Hill was used effectively and the Union line had depth with a healthy amount of rested troops available to defend it . Fitz John Porter , the de facto commander for the day , played an important role in this . He posted his men well on June 30 , and stationed reinforcements near to the Union line . Darius Couch , whose forces comprised half of the Union center , positioned his reinforcements skilfully as well and cooperated with George Morell , whose units formed the other part of the Union middle . The infantrymen performed well also . As Brian K. Burton notes , " [ the infantrymen ] stayed behind the guns most of the time and did not advance too far during countercharges . This behavior allowed the gunners a clear field of fire . " Furthermore , if more of anything was needed , infantry or artillery , it was available . At the forefront of the Union victory , however , was the overwhelming firepower of their artillery , as later accounts by soldiers from both armies repeatedly attested . 
 A number of shortcomings in planning and execution contributed to the debacle suffered by the Confederates . The Confederate brigade leaders performed well , with the exception of a few minor instances ; Burton surmises that the blame of July 1 must lie with the overall commanders . James Longstreet was overconfident about the artillery strategy , which proved less effective than it could have been largely because both he and Stonewall Jackson had problems gathering the artillery for the assault . The Confederate practice of moving artillery with individual units instead of in one mass and the difficult terrain surrounding Malvern Hill contributed to this issue . A potential solution to this problem lay with Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton 's fourteen batteries in reserve . However , Lee 's headquarters never contacted Pendleton , who spent July 1 " await [ ing ] events and orders , in readiness for whatever service might be called for . " These orders never came , and Pendleton 's batteries went unused . Magruder might also share in the blame ; his late arrival to the battlefield was caused by bad maps and faulty guides . Since Magruder received Chilton 's draft late in the day , and with no time attached to it , there was no way for him to determine the relevance of the order . Burton suggests that Magruder cannot be reasonably blamed for his attacks on the Union line : he was responding to Lee 's orders and did initially try to form a unified attack on the Union line . Finally , Magruder was riding back and forth across the battlefield , making it difficult for him to be found by junior officers seeking guidance . Several other factors may have played into the Confederate repulse , including Theophilus Holmes 's refusal to participate in the battle , dismissing any notion of actively engaging the enemy . 
 Lee 's part in the Confederate defeat at Malvern Hill has been criticized by historians . Though he put rested troops on the field and accepted Longstreet 's suggestions , which did not commit him to a charge , Lee himself was not present on the battlefield to observe the fighting . Historian Stephen Sears points out that Lee 's ineffective communication with his generals and apparent failure to write his own communications to his brigadier generals ( instead leaving orders open to interpretation ) may have contributed to the defeat . Lee could also have countermanded Chilton 's orders when it became apparent they were fruitless , or verified the " success " of Armistead . Consequently , Lee must also share some blame in the repeated lack of coordination of attacks throughout the day . 
 = = = Subsequent events = = = 
 Despite the strength of Malvern Hill , as demonstrated in the battle , McClellan felt he needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison 's Landing , to Fitz John Porter 's chagrin . Porter felt that the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond . McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own , felt he could not protect Harrison 's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill , and feared being cut off from his supply depot . McClellan 's mentality prevailed . The Union batteries and McClellan 's engineers began moving to Harrison 's Landing soon after the end of the Battle of Malvern Hill . Starting at about 11 p.m. unit after unit began to follow . Within hours , nearly all of McClellan 's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison 's Landing . Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge , they destroyed the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit , leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies . 
 The areas around Malvern Hill hosted much of Lee 's army the night after the battle . Some of the Confederates were close enough to hear the sounds made by the Army of the Potomac retreating under cover of darkness , and see the lanterns of Northerners helping their wounded . The day after the Battle of Malvern Hill , Lee and Stonewall Jackson met President Jefferson Davis at Poindexter farm . They considered immediately pursuing McClellan ; however , in view of the rain and confusion , Davis and Lee deemed large @-@ scale pursuit of McClellan 's army too risky . Jackson disagreed , saying , " They have not all got away if we go immediately after them . " Jackson even had the bodies of the dead moved so that his soldiers had a clear line of attack when pursuing McClellan . However , Davis and Lee thought it necessary to rest the army . They did not completely rule out a pursuit though ; Lee even ordered J. E. B. Stuart to reconnoiter McClellan 's position for future attacks . Lee ordered Theophilus Holmes to move to Drewry 's Bluff , and decided to keep the men on Malvern Hill through July 3 to forestall any potential Union attack against that location . 
 On July 4 , 1862 , Lee 's men began marching towards Harrison 's Landing . He made his headquarters a few miles north of <unk> Heights , a sixty @-@ foot ( 18 m ) elevation approximately thirteen miles ( 21 km ) from Harrison 's Landing , and stayed nearby with his army for several days , searching for weaknesses in the Union line at the heights that might allow for an attack . No weakness presented itself though , and by the end of July 8 , the entire Army of Northern Virginia , save for cavalry stations and picket forces , was back near Richmond . The Peninsula Campaign was over .

 Despite the defeat on Malvern Hill , the Seven Days Battles accomplished the original Confederate goal of removing any direct threat to Richmond from the Union Army . The three newspapers in Richmond exulted in this strategic victory and lionized Robert E. Lee as a national hero : " No captain that ever lived , " opined the Richmond Dispatch , " could have planned or executed a better plan . " Similarly , Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory said , " the Great McClelland [ sic ] the young Napoleon now like a whipped cur lies on the banks of the James River crouched under his Gun Boats . " Throughout Richmond and the once @-@ beleaguered South , there was a triumphant mood , and scant attention was paid to the flaws in Lee 's tactics or execution . 
 Lee was not exultant , but " deeply , bitterly disappointed " at the result . " Our success has not been as great or complete as we should have desired " , Lee wrote to his wife . In his official report , he wrote , " Under ordinary circumstances , the Federal Army should have been destroyed . " The North Carolinian D. H. Hill shared Lee 's bitterness , and wrote that the " blood of North Carolina poured like water " . In a post @-@ war article he wrote that the battle " was not war ; it was murder . " Lee did not distribute blame for the failure to reach his desired result , but there were repercussions . Several commanders were reassigned , including Theophilus Holmes and John Magruder , and his army was reorganized into two wings , one under Stonewall Jackson and another under James Longstreet . Further , Confederate artillery would now be moved in battalion @-@ sized units , at the head of Confederate columns . 
 In McClellan 's case , his success on Malvern Hill was overshadowed by his overall defeat in the Seven Days Battles . The Northern public met McClellan 's defeat with despondency , and his reputation was tarnished . Some of McClellan 's soldiers voiced their continued confidence in him . Such opinions were not unanimous , however ; one of McClellan 's engineers , Lt. William Folwell , wondered why " they deify a General whose greatest feat has been a masterly retreat . " A similar opinion was shared by many others in the rank and file of the Union military . Some in politics also abandoned the Democratic McClellan . He was also accused of being on the Galena during the Battle of Malvern Hill , and newspapers and tabloids around the country heaped scorn on him for this , especially when he ran for president in 1864 . President Lincoln was also losing faith in McClellan . On June 26 , the day of Lee 's first offensive during the Seven Days , the Army of Virginia was formed and the command given to Maj. Gen. John Pope . While McClellan was at Harrison 's Landing , parts of his Army of the Potomac were continuously reassigned to Pope . Pope and his Army of Virginia left for Gordonsville , Virginia on July 14 , setting the stage for the subsequent Northern Virginia Campaign . 
 In his Battle @-@ Pieces publication , Herman Melville penned a poem about the battle , titled with the same name as the hill on which it was fought . In the poem , Melville questions the elms of Malvern Hill of whether they recall " the haggard beards of blood " the day of the battle .

 The battlefield at Malvern Hill is credited by the National Park Service as being " the best preserved Civil War battlefield in central or southern Virginia . " Most recent preservation efforts there have been the consequence of cooperative efforts between Richmond National Battlefield Park and the Civil War Trust . The Trust has purchased 953 acres ( 3 @.@ 86 km2 ) at the heart of the battlefield since 2000 . Its efforts have been bolstered by the Virginia Land Conservation Fund , the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities , and officials from Henrico County . Most of this tract wraps around the intersection of Willis Church Road and Carter 's Mill Road . The land includes the starting point for the Confederate assaults on the day of the battle , the Willis Church Parsonage , the ruins of which remain visible today . Recent preservation efforts include the acquisition of the Crew house in 2013 . Some 1 @,@ 332 @.@ 6 acres ( 5 @.@ 393 km2 ) of land is protected on and around Malvern Hill to preserve the battlefield , according to the National Park Service . Driving and walking tours , among other services , are offered at the site . 
 = Coalhouse Fort = 
 Coalhouse Fort is an artillery fort built in the 1860s to guard the lower Thames from seaborne attack . It stands at Coalhouse Point in Essex on the north bank of the river , at a location that was vulnerable to raiders and invaders . It was the last in a series of fortifications dating back to the 15th century and was the direct successor to a smaller mid @-@ 19th century fort built on the same site . Constructed during a period of tension with France , its location on marshy ground caused problems from the start and led to a lengthy construction process . The fort was equipped with a variety of large @-@ calibre artillery guns and the most modern defensive facilities at the time , including shell @-@ proof casemates protected by granite facing and cast @-@ iron shields . However , its lengthy construction and the rapid pace of artillery development at the time meant that it was virtually obsolete for its original purpose within a few years of its completion . 
 The fort 's armament was revised several times during its seventy years of military usage , as its role evolved in the river 's defensive system . It was initially a front @-@ line fortification , supported by Shornemead Fort and Cliffe Fort located to the south and east respectively on the Kent shore . Over time , as batteries and forts further downriver became the front line of the Thames defences , Coalhouse Fort was stripped of its main weapons and its fabric was altered to support smaller quick @-@ firing guns intended to be used against fast @-@ moving surface and aerial targets . Its last military usage was as a training facility for a few years after the Second World War . 
 Decommissioned in 1949 , the fort was used for a time as a storehouse for a shoe company before it was purchased by the local council . The surrounding land was developed into a public park but the fort itself fell into dereliction , despite its historical and architectural significance . Since 1985 it has been leased to a voluntary preservation group , the Coalhouse Fort Project , which has been working to restore the fort and use it for a variety of heritage and educational purposes . It can be visited by the public on regular open days and houses a number of reconstructions , small military museums and open @-@ air displays of military equipment . Funding for its restoration has come from a number of sources including the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Warner Bros. film studio , which used the fort as a location for the opening scenes of the 2005 film Batman Begins .

 = = = Early defences = = = 
 East Tilbury , which stands at the lower end of the section of the Thames known as Gravesend Reach , was fortified long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers . Settlements on both sides of the Thames were raided by the French in 1379 during the second phase of the Hundred Years ' War . The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent 's Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury . 
 Appeals from the local people led to the Crown agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen rampart and towers to protect the settlement . The site of these early defences is not known but may have been near where St Catherine 's Church now stands . A ditch of unknown date in that vicinity may represent a fragment of the medieval defences . 
 = = = Henrician defences = = = 
 Henry VIII ordered the construction of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539 – 40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales . It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church , which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade in order to reimpose Papal authority . Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend , Milton ( near the present New Tavern Fort ) and Higham . 
 The East Tilbury Blockhouse was built partly with stone taken from St Margaret 's Chapel in Tilbury , which was dissolved in 1536 . Its form is not known but it probably consisted of a brick and stone structure , perhaps in a D @-@ shape , with a rampart and ditch to enclose its landward side . It was recorded as having fifteen iron and brass cannon of various calibres in 1540 ; these had been increased to 27 by 1539 – 40 . It had a small permanent garrison , consisting of a commander and his deputy , a porter , two soldiers and four gunners . The blockhouse may have been altered in 1545 but in 1553 it was disarmed . Although the corresponding blockhouse at Gravesend continued in use and that at Tilbury was eventually incorporated into Tilbury Fort between 1670 and 1683 , the one at East Tilbury seems to have been abandoned before the end of the 16th century . By 1735 it had been inundated by the river and was in ruins . Its site by the shoreline has since been eroded away by tidal action , though it is possible that remains from the blockhouse may still survive under the river mud . 
 = = = Coalhouse Battery = = = 
 The June 1687 Raid on the Medway by the Dutch fleet during the Second Anglo @-@ Dutch War exposed the weaknesses of the Thames defences . It took another hundred years for the defences on Gravesend Reach to be improved , in the form of new works at Gravesend and Tilbury built in the 1780s , but even then the potential of forward defence – to prevent enemies reaching that far down the Thames – continued to be neglected . It was not until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars that the need for effective forward defence was addressed . Lt Col <unk> of the Royal Engineers carried out a survey of the Thames in 1794 in which he recommended building a triangle of artillery batteries to guard the entrance to Gravesend Reach and the next reach of the river , Lower Hope Reach . Two of the batteries would be located on the south bank at Shornemead , about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) north @-@ west of Higham ; at Lower Hope Point , about 1 @.@ 8 miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km ) north @-@ west of Cliffe ; and on the north bank at East Tilbury , about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) north of the old Henrician blockhouse . The batteries would have a maximum range of about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) and their arcs of fire would overlap , enabling them to support each other . 
 The new battery was constructed during 1799 on marshy ground a short distance to the south @-@ east of St Catherine 's Church . The soft soil caused many problems but the work was completed by July of that year . It was equipped with four 24 @-@ pdr. cannon mounted on traversing carriages , which enabled the gunners to track targets much more easily than had been the case with traditional garrison carriages . The battery faced the river with a semi @-@ circular earthen rampart on which the guns were mounted . A walled @-@ off area to the rear enclosed a barracks , magazine and shot kiln ( for heating shot to set wooden ships on fire ) . The whole structure was surrounded by a polygonal water @-@ filled ditch . It was modified in 1810 to raise the height of the rampart and to add a small expense magazine ( to store ammunition for immediate use ) . The French did not test the Thames defences , despite an invasion scare in 1804 , and the battery was abandoned along with those at Lower Hope Point and Shornemead following Napoleon 's final defeat in 1815 . 
 = = = First Coalhouse Fort = = = 
 Renewed tension between Britain and France in the 1840s led to a modernisation of some of Britain 's coastal defences . The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded , though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored . In the case of the Coalhouse battery , it was substantially extended between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort . Progress was slow due to the marshy ground again causing problems with subsidence and cracking the foundations , as well as the contractor proving unsatisfactory . 
 The new fort was built as an extension to the north @-@ west of the existing battery , and thus took an irregular plan . The rampart was extended to accommodate more guns – a total of seventeen 32 @-@ pdrs . – and a much enlarged interior replaced the old barracks and magazine . <unk> at the east side and firing positions on the other sides facilitated musketry defence against land @-@ based assailants . The fort was surrounded by a wide water @-@ filled ditch , with a bridge on the west ( landward ) side providing the only access route . 
 = = = Second Coalhouse Fort = = = 
 By the late 1850s , Britain and France were locked in an arms race . A new generation of increasingly accurate and powerful guns had been developed ( of the Rifled Muzzle Loader ( RML ) and Rifled <unk> Loader ( RBL ) types ) , mounted on fast @-@ moving , <unk> steam @-@ powered ironclad warships such as the French La Gloire and the British HMS Warrior . Such vessels posed a serious threat to the important naval installations on the Thames , including the victualling yards at Deptford , the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal , the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich , and the magazines at Purfleet . It was not possible for large warships to reach central London , as the river was not yet deep enough to take ships of more than 400 tons above Deptford . However , as the American Civil War was soon to show , it was quite possible for the warships of the day to run past forts and attack up coastal rivers . 
 The new weapons meant that the existing coastal and riverine forts were rendered largely obsolete . The American Civil War was soon to demonstrate that traditional brick and masonry forts could be reduced to rubble by rifled guns . The government 's response was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom , which published a far @-@ reaching report in 1860 . The Royal Commission recommended that a triangle of forts should be established on the lower Thames , east of Gravesend . This would involve replacing the existing Coalhouse Fort on the Essex shore with a new fortification , similarly replacing the existing Shornemead Fort and building a wholly Cliffe Fort opposite Coalhouse Point , which would replace the abandoned 18th century battery at Lower Hope Point . The location of the forts would enable interlocking arcs of fire from their guns . In addition , a boom defence and a minefield would be installed off Coalhouse Point in wartime to further boost the strength of the defences . 
 The design of the new fort was similar to that of the other Royal Commission forts on the Thames , with an arc of granite @-@ faced casemates , reinforced by iron shields . These , it was believed , would be virtually invulnerable to enemy fire . It was originally envisaged that the fort would have two tiers ( in a design similar to that of Garrison Point Fort at Sheerness ) mounting around 56 guns ; 28 in casemates and the rest en barbette on the fort 's roof . Construction began on this basis in July 1861 but as the work progressed the design was changed , leaving the fort with only a single tier of casemates . Like its predecessors , its construction was seriously affected by the poor ground conditions and was disrupted by shifting and cracking foundations . Its final phases of construction were supervised by Colonel Charles George Gordon , who was later to die in the Siege of Khartoum . The fort 's cost amounted to £ 130 @,@ 000 .

 = = = 19th century = = = 
 It was originally intended that Coalhouse Fort would be armed with 68 @-@ pdr. smooth @-@ bore guns , but these had become obsolete by the time it was completed in 1874 . More powerful armour @-@ piercing weapons were required , so the casemates were provided with four 12 @.@ 5 @-@ inch and thirteen 11 @-@ inch RMLs with a range of about 5 @,@ 500 yards ( 5 @,@ 000 m ) . A further three 9 @-@ inch RMLs were emplaced in the open battery . They were mounted on metal traversing platforms that could be elevated and traversed using hand @-@ operated gearing devices . Operating the guns presented significant challenges ; the 12 @.@ 5 @-@ inch RMLs weighed up to 38 long tons ( 39 t ) apiece , used a charge weighing 172 pounds ( 78 kg ) to fire a shell weighing 827 pounds ( 375 kg ) to their maximum range , and broke windows half a mile away when they were fired . The detonations and clouds of choking black smoke generated when firing them presented a serious physical hazard to the gun crews . 
 The guns were controlled from a Battery Commander 's Post situated on the roof , from where commands to the gun detachments could be relayed via voice pipes . Three Depression Range Finders were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns ' targeting . A well @-@ trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes . Rather than firing all the guns at once , the guns were positioned so that they could be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by . When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore , this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides . 
 The rapid development of artillery weapons in the late 19th century meant that the casemate style of fortification had become virtually obsolete within a decade of the fort 's completion . Its original purpose of defending the river against large warships was taken over by a new East Tilbury Battery , constructed in 1891 about 600 metres ( 660 yd ) to the north @-@ west just outside East Tilbury village . This contained six much more powerful breech @-@ loading ( BL ) guns on disappearing carriages within concealed emplacements facing east up the river . A similar battery was built at Slough Fort on the Hoo Peninsula a few miles downriver . 
 At the same time , a new threat had emerged in the shape of the fast and highly manoeuvrable torpedo boat . Large guns were virtually useless against such vessels , so the fort was supplemented with another new battery built in 1893 some 365 metres ( 399 yd ) to the south where 6 @-@ pdr. quick @-@ firing guns were installed . Similar batteries were built on the opposite shore at Shornemead and Cliffe Forts . 
 = = = Early 20th century = = = 
 By the start of the 20th century the fort 's casemates had been put out of use as they were too vulnerable to modern artillery . Instead , part of the fort 's front was covered with a sloping glacis made of earth , blocking the casemates and filling the inner defensive ditch . At least one of the front caponiers was also demolished around this time . Most of the old RMLs were retired and replaced with four Mk . VII six @-@ inch BL guns and four 12 @-@ pdr quick @-@ firing ( QF ) BL guns , with ranges of 7 miles ( 11 km ) and 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) respectively , mounted on concrete emplacements on the fort 's roof . The larger guns were intended to support those at East Tilbury Battery while the smaller ones provided a defence against fast @-@ moving vessels such as destroyers and torpedo boats . Despite their obsolescence , two of the old 12 @.@ 5 @-@ inch RMLs remained at the fort until as late as 1912 . They were used as " giant blunderbusses " to spray torpedo boats with grapeshot if they got past the other guns . 
 Coalhouse Fort was manned during the First World War by No. 2 Company , Royal Garrison Artillery , which manned the guns , while the 2nd Company London Electrical Engineers operated the electric searchlights . A minefield was installed in the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse Forts , with mechanically operated mines in the shallower parts of the river and remotely detonated mines in the navigable channel . Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore @-@ based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel . Coalhouse Fort took on the role of an Examination Battery controlling the river traffic in conjunction with the River Examination Service . Incoming vessels were checked by tugs based alongside the old HMS Champion , moored in <unk> , and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop , the fort was authorised to fire across its bows . 
 The fort 's armament was reduced during the war as other forts and batteries took over some of its duties . Two of the six @-@ inch guns were shipped across the river to Cliffe Fort in 1914 and the QF guns on the roof were withdrawn . An anti @-@ aircraft battery was established to the north @-@ west of the fort for defence against Zeppelins and enemy bombers . 
 = = = 1920s to 1940s = = = 
 Following the end of the war , it was proposed in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re @-@ equipped with 4 @-@ inch guns but post @-@ war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned . Instead , the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930 . The continuing development of artillery firepower meant that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames . The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence . 
 Coalhouse Fort became an " emergency " battery during the anti @-@ invasion preparations of the early Second World War . The existing 6 @-@ inch guns were replaced in July 1941 with two 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns taken from the ill @-@ fated HMS Hood before its sinking . These had a range of 12 @,@ 500 yards ( 11 @,@ 400 m ) and were installed in two of the old 6 @-@ inch emplacements . A steel shelter was constructed on the fort 's roof to protect the guns , which were also camouflaged with netting . A brick observation post on the roof provided range @-@ finding , while two remotely controlled searchlights installed on the roof of the north caponier could illuminate the riverside below . The purpose of these installations was to protect against raids by cruisers and torpedo boats and to counter any landings in the Thames . 
 The fort 's defences was also enhanced with two light anti @-@ aircraft guns , including a Bofors 40 mm gun installed on the roof in August 1943 , while the fort 's perimeter was surrounded by barbed wire and trenches . Two spigot mortars were installed at the fort 's gorge ; their bases can still be seen today . A detached concrete observation tower was built just north of the fort for use as an Extended Defence Officer 's Post , to control the electrically detonated mines that had been laid in the river . A radar tower manned by naval personnel was also built south of the fort by 1941 to cover the approaches to the minefield , while an anti @-@ aircraft battery was built 1 @,@ 100 metres ( 1 @,@ 200 yd ) to the north @-@ west at <unk> Farm in August 1939 . It was frequently used in defence of the eastern approaches to London and was bombed on more than one occasion . 
 By 1944 the threat of invasion had abated and the fort was handed over to the Home Guard 's No. 356 Coast Battery detachment . Its complement at this time was a captain , two lieutenants and 103 other ranks . They were supplemented by a detachment of Wrens who operated a degaussing range established at Coalhouse Fort in 1943 under the name of HMS St Clement . Outbound ships passed over submerged sensors which detected whether the steel in their hulls had been <unk> to a sufficient extent to make them undetectable by German magnetic mines . If they were detected , they would be recalled for further degaussing . As one of the Wrens later recalled , they found themselves " surrounded by a wonderful array of young men , soldiers and marines of all ranks – and we were the only girls in sight . " 
 HMS St Clement became a Combined Operations base and evolved into HMS St Clement I , II and III . As HMS St Clement III , the fort 's last military designation , it was used after 1946 by the Admiralty for training Sea Cadets and nautical youth groups . It was decommissioned in 1949 . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Casemates = = = 
 Coalhouse Fort is remarkably well preserved ; it provides one of the finest surviving examples of a mid @-@ Victorian armoured casemate fort . It has twelve casemates arranged in an semi @-@ circle facing south and east towards the river , with an annexed open battery facing south @-@ west . The casemates are faced with massive slabs of granite and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from splinters dislodged by incoming fire . 
 Although the casemates have been altered over the years , many of their original features survive . None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place . The casemates were divided into two sections . During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates ' rear , an area known as the war accommodation . The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper , where the loading and firing took place . The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope were hung . These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke . A loading bar above the gun @-@ port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun . These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts on either side of the emplacements . 
 The guns mounted in the open battery were lighter than those in the casemates and were not enclosed but traversed on rails in the open air . A covered section between each emplacement led to an ammunition lift shaft up which the shells and cartridges were raised using lifting gear that still survives . 
 Improvements to artillery technology necessitated significant changes to the fort 's structure towards the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th . Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells . To alleviate this threat , massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate , preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion . The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort 's roof also necessitated the addition of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra weight on the roof . The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof @-@ mounted guns . 
 = = = Magazines , barracks and roof = = = 
 The magazines , situated deep under the casemates , consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage at the front and a lighting passage behind . Great care was taken to reduce the possibility of an accidental explosion . The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the cartridge stores were covered by wooden battens . The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage , which was physically separated from the rest of the magazine . Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates , with which they could communicate via voice tubes . 
 A defensible barracks made of brick , faced in Kentish ragstone on the fort 's exterior , closes off the gorge . Its line is indented to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel shutters . The first floor of the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort 's interior and supported on cast @-@ iron pillars . The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men , though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort . It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients . Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition , two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War . 
 An irregularly shaped parade area occupies the middle of the fort , which is divided by a sloping ramp leading up to the casemates . A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell @-@ filling facility – stands to the right of the ramp . The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side , protected against landward attackers by a caponier . The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch , in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence . A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside . 
 The roof of the fort , accessed via steps up from the open battery , was altered substantially during the first half of the 20th century to accommodate new guns and other structures . These include emplacements for 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch and 6 @-@ inch guns as well as 12 @-@ pdrs , searchlight positions , shelters , an observation post , a fire control building , a machine @-@ gun parapet on the north caponier and a Royal Navy monitoring station . 
 = = = External facilities = = = 
 The fort was linked to a jetty , Coalhouse Wharf , on the riverside a short distance to the south . A standard gauge railway track led from the fort 's interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and supplies from the wharf . The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort ( and other Thames forts ) aboard two specialised gun barges called Gog and Magog , built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s . The remains of the jetty are still visible , as are sections of the track within the fort 's entrance . 
 A two @-@ storey concrete structure situated just to the north of the fort was used during the Second World War as an Extended Defence Officer 's Post to control the minefield outside the fort . It could also serve as a pillbox . A corresponding post was located on the Kent shore . A small concrete structure located 45 metres ( 148 ft ) further north @-@ east may have been an electrical power house . The minefield was overlooked by a hexagonal radar tower about 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) south of the fort , consisting of a concrete structure on a metal frame on which the radar array was mounted . This stands atop a brick building in which the power plant , electrical equipment radar screen and personnel accommodation were located . It was only used for a short time between 1941 and 1943 and is now considered structurally unsafe . Situated nearby is the detached battery built in 1893 to mount four 6 @-@ pdr. quick @-@ firing guns . It is well @-@ preserved and the emplacements , ready @-@ use lockers and magazines are all still largely intact .

 After being decommissioned , Coalhouse Fort was leased and used as a storage facility by Bata Shoes , which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury . It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families . In 1959 , the parade ground was used as a coal store during a miners ' strike . It was purchased in 1962 by Thurrock Urban District Council ( now Thurrock Council ) , who remain its owners to this day . The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the building itself decayed badly through neglect and vandalism . 
 Coalhouse Fort and the adjacent artillery defences to the south of the fort were collectively designated as a scheduled monument in 1962 , in recognition of their status as " a remarkable group of defensive sites " . The fort has been leased to the Coalhouse Fort Project , a heritage charity operated by volunteers , since 1985 . The project has been undertaking the gradual restoration of the fort ever since and hold regular open days . Various items of 20th century military equipment are on display in the interior of the fort , while the casemates house reconstructions and small military @-@ related museums . The magazines and fort roof can be visited on volunteer @-@ led guided tours . 
 The project has been highly commended in the British Archaeological Awards and the fort has featured both in the BBC series Restoration and in the 2005 film Batman Begins , in which it stood in for a Bhutanese prison in the first five minutes of the film . The British director Christopher Nolan had seen the fort featured in the series and decided that he wanted to set the film 's opening scenes there . 
 The poor condition of parts of the structure and its ongoing state of slow decay led to it be listed in 2008 on the Heritage at Risk Register . English Heritage provided an emergency grant in 2009 , supplemented by Thurrock Council and the filming fee from Warner Bros. for Batman Begins , to help make £ 200 @,@ 000 worth of repairs to the gatehouse . These were completed in 2011 .

 = Copenhagen Fire of 1728 = 
 The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest fire in the history of Copenhagen , Denmark . It began on the evening of 20 October 1728 and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October . It destroyed approximately 28 % of the city ( measured by counting the number of destroyed lots from the cadastre ) , left 20 % of the population homeless , and the reconstruction lasted until 1737 . No less than 47 % of the section of the city , which dates back to the Middle Ages , was completely lost , and along with the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 , it is the main reason that few traces of medieval Copenhagen can be found in the modern city . 
 Although the number of dead and wounded was relatively low compared to the extent of the fire , the cultural losses were huge . In addition to several private book collections , 35 @,@ 000 texts including a large number of unique works were lost with the University of Copenhagen library , and at the observatory on top of Rundetårn , instruments and records made by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer were destroyed .

 = = = Wednesday 20 October = = = 
 The exact time that the fire started is unknown . Various sources mention times between 6 : 00 and 8 : 00 p.m. , and 7 : 30 p.m. is the best estimate . However , the exact location of the origin of the fire is known . Almost directly across the street from <unk> ( the West Gate ) was Lille Sankt Clemens Stræde . On the corner facing <unk> , there was a small house on lot " Vester Kvarter 146 " ( according to the cadastre of 1699 ) owned by Signe , widow of Boye Hansen . The lot is almost identical to the one on the corner of present @-@ day <unk> ( the western end of Strøget ) and The City Hall Square . Among the widow 's tenants were restaurant manager Peder Rasmussen and his wife , Anne <unk> . It was on the second floor of the restaurateur 's apartment that the fire started . At the inquiries held after the fire was over , both he and his wife stated that their seven @-@ year @-@ old son had started the fire by accidentally upsetting a candle , but it is more likely that it was the result of carelessness on behalf of the parents while casting candles and that they blamed the child to avoid punishment . 
 The watchmen were quick to sound the alarm , but given the fire department 's relatively primitive equipment , the fact that the streets of Vester Kvarter were too narrow for the fire pumps , the strange dispositions of those fighting the fire , and a series of unlucky events , the fight was nearly hopeless . The wind blew from the southwest that evening , carrying the fire along Lille Sankt Clemens Stræde , Store Sankt Clemens Stræde , <unk> , <unk> and Hellig @-@ Kors Stræde . By 9 : 00 p.m the main street of Vestergade was burning on both sides . From here the fire spread along Store Lars <unk> Stræde , Lille Lars <unk> Stræde and <unk> . 
 Later that evening , the fire reached Sankt <unk> Stræde , where the <unk> <unk> dormitory ( lot " Nørre Kvarter 122 " ) was engulfed in flames . Professor Peder <unk> , who lived at the dormitory , lost most of his possessions . Presumably simultaneously , the fire also reached Professor Hans Steenbuch 's room on <unk> ( lot " Nørre Kvarter 60 " ) . Around midnight , the fire reached the priest 's residence by the church Sankt Petri Kirke . 
 On Nørregade , another fire started at a brewery Wednesday evening – possibly between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Just prior to that the original fire had reached Gammeltorv , where people fought to keep the fire back . For that reason , help was sent late to deal with the new fire . Around midnight the wind shifted to the west , and the situation on Nørregade turned critical as the fire was driven towards the street along a wide front . At first people sought to keep the fire on the western side of Nørregade , but nevertheless it spread to the eastern side during the night . Simultaneously , the fire moved from present day Nørre <unk> towards Nørreport ( North Gate ) . 
 = = = Thursday = = = 
 Early Thursday morning , a final desperate attempt to keep the flames from spreading was made at Gammeltorv . Already @-@ burning houses were fired upon with cannons to make them collapse . When that did not work , an order was given to blow up the houses with black powder charges . The building housing the wine cellar known as " <unk> " on the corner of Vestergade and Nørregade was to be the first demolition , but this dangerous undertaking failed when the gunpowder blew up while men were still carrying in the charges . While the building did go down , people were killed and injured and the explosion ignited nearby buildings , including the church Vor Frue Kirke . By 9 : 30 a.m. the church spire had fallen into the street , and soon after the whole church was engulfed in flames ; the personal property that people had brought to the church to keep them safe from the fire was lost . 
 At Nørregade , the fire reached Sankt Petri Kirke around 8 a.m. By 9 a.m. , the flames reached bishop Christen Worm 's residence ( lot " Nørre Kvarter 112 " ) , which burned to the ground . The bishop who was travelling , was left with the clothes on his back and three prayer books . 
 At Nytorv , the flames consumed Det <unk> <unk> ( The Royal Orphanage ) ( now the location of the Copenhagen District Court ) . The City Hall of Copenhagen – then located between Nytorv and Gammeltorv – was now in peril . Around 10 a.m. , the flames had taken hold of the building and it was soon added to the list of buildings lost . From Gammeltorv the inferno made its way down <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , heading towards Amagertorv , while from Nytorv the fire found fuel on <unk> towards <unk> Canal and <unk> . 
 New fires were reported : Count Adam Christoffer Knuth 's house in <unk> , a cellar in Købmagergade ( Market Street ) and a haystack at Nørreport ( Northern Gate ) all broke out in flames ; the latter likely ignited by embers carried by the wind . 
 When the fire had consumed Vor Frue Kirke , the University of Copenhagen saw one building after another burn . The Community Building ( <unk> ) , which was used to help support students by giving them free meals ; the university 's head building ( <unk> / The Study Courtyard ) , at the same location as the current head building ; and the Anatomy Building ( Domus <unk> ) and Anatomy Theatre ( Theatrum <unk> ) were all lost . <unk> , Professor Hans Steenbuch had sought refuge at Professor Hans Gram 's home , where both he and his possessions found temporary safety . But now the fire reached Gram 's home next to Vor Frue Kirke ( lot " <unk> Kvarter 245 " ) , and there was not enough time to save Steenbuch 's possessions , although Gram saved most of his own from destruction . Along <unk> , one by one University of Copenhagen professors ' homes fell prey to the flames . Several more student dormitories were lost but along Købmagergade a wing of buildings were saved including the church <unk> . 
 The next notable victim of the fire was the church Trinitatis Kirke , which housed the University Library in its attic . The flames got a hold the church around 5 p.m. and when the ceiling gave around 10 p.m. , the entire library 's collection was delivered into a sea of flames . Rundetårn was left for the most part undamaged , but the observatory at the top burned out . 
 From Gammeltorv , the fire spread out to <unk> Plads , now <unk> , around 4 p.m. The monument that shamed traitor <unk> <unk> lost a few letters in the heat . A few hours later , the fire closed in on the church <unk> and at 8 p.m. its carillon bells came to life as they did every half @-@ hour – playing Thomas Kingo 's <unk> din <unk> , <unk> Gud , af <unk> ( Eng . Turn your anger , Lord , by mercy ) – just before they crashed into the fire below . 
 From Trinitatis Church , the fire continued down <unk> towards <unk> . Here , the fire met up with the other branch of the fire which ate its way down present day Nørre <unk> . Around midnight , the church <unk> Kirke was ablaze . The only place in the city where there was some control over the fire was around <unk> . 
 = = = Friday = = = 
 Friday morning the wind shifted again , this time to the north . The firefighting finally started to show some semblance of organization , and efforts were waged to stop the fire in the neighborhood around Magstræde . This failed , though , when the fire took the soap factory on Magstræde around noon . The wind was now blowing northwest and the firefighting moved via Snaregade to <unk> , <unk> and Gammel Strand , but failed to save <unk> . 
 Further east , the fire proceeded south to <unk> and <unk> . Poul <unk> Hospital on <unk> was drowned in flames with some of the residents still inside . Close by , Professor Ludvig Holberg left his home on Købmagergade ( lot " <unk> Kvarter 18 " ) . Around midnight , the blaze was close to <unk> and Store <unk> . 
 = = = Saturday = = = 
 Over the course of the night the wind settled and stopped the forward march of the fire . Thirty @-@ six homes were selected for demolition to create a firebreak , which did stop the fire at the corner of Store <unk> and <unk> . Further west , Amagertorv and the church Sankt Nicolai Kirke had been threatened , but the blaze was stopped close to Amagertorv , where only the three houses furthest north ( " <unk> Kvarter " lots 8 , 10 and 11 ) were lost . 
 The fire on Magstræde at the soap factory was still a threat . The fire ate its way along Snaregade . At the end of Snaregade was the house ( lot " <unk> Kvarter 2 " ) of the vice mayor , Christian <unk> , which the people tried to save . The houses around it were torn down , and the houses on the opposite side of the street were blown up with black powder . The outcome was hardly any better than that of the earlier attempt at the wine cellar , though . The gunpowder went off , people had to run for their lives and the vice mayor 's house was set afire and burned to the ground . After the failed attempt to save the house , the fire was stopped from spreading further , though , and among other things the weigh station of Christoffer <unk> was saved . 
 In line with Christian interpretation of the day , the slowdown of the fire during Saturday was seen as a result of divine intervention . To thank God , king Christian VI introduced on 23 October as a new annual holiday in 1731 on which every church in Copenhagen held a service of thanksgiving . This holiday was abolished at the holiday reform of 1770 .
