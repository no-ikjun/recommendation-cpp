 Kylie had received mixed reviews from music critics . Chris True from AllMusic gave it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars , giving it a mixed review . He said " While the production values on Kylie 's debut are dated at best and the tunes are nothing but standard late- ' 80s Stock @-@ Aitken @-@ Waterman bubblegum , there are some rather endearing qualities to it . Firstly , she shows a lot more personality than the other Stock , et al . " He did say that Minogue would become a pop star and a " European icon " . Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five . The stand out track , he said , was " I Should Be So Lucky " , as he said " but anyone who denies ' I Should Be So Lucky ' classic status has clearly let their tune detection muscles turn to flab " . He also finished saying " The bog @-@ standard <unk> production renders Kylie as dated as that haircut on the album cover , and it 's as loaded with variety as a loaf of bread , but the little Aussie pop rocket is already showing signs of personality and the record 's quintessentially ' 80s charm ultimately wins through .

 Chevelle formed in 1995 in Grayslake , Illinois , when brothers Pete Loeffler and Sam Loeffler started enjoying music . Pete started playing guitar and singing while Sam began playing drums in their parents ' garage . Their youngest brother Joe joined the band in 1995 . While the band started in a small suburb of Chicago , each of the band members were self @-@ taught musicians . The name Chevelle came from the band members ' passion for fast cars . It was also a car their father liked , the Chevrolet Chevelle . The band started playing small outdoor concerts and clubs around Chicago , Illinois , with Joe being only 14 years old . 
 Chevelle recorded a 7 @-@ track demo known as The Blue Album , released in 1998 , and played small concerts for the next three years until they were signed on to Steve Taylor 's Squint Entertainment , a Christian contemporary music label . The band recorded with Steve Albini for 17 days in Electrical Audio studios and released its first full @-@ length album , Point # 1 and in 1999 . Two singles were released from the Point # 1 album with accompanying music videos , " Point # 1 " and " Mia " . The songs received GMA Dove Awards for the more popular song " Mia " in 2000 and " Point # 1 " in 2001 . The album received an award for " Hard Music Album " in 2000 by the Dove Awards . Point # 1 was well received by The Phantom Tollbooth , a Christian music website , and HM Magazine , yet was criticized for its repetitive song structures by Jesus Freak Hideout , a Christian music website . 
 = = = Wonder What 's Next ( 2002 – 2003 ) = = = 
 Chevelle toured as support to bands such as Sevendust , Machine Head , Filter , and Powerman 5000 in this period . Squint Entertainment closed down in 2001 and the band signed with Epic Records in 2002 . In 2002 Chevelle released its second studio album Wonder What 's Next on Epic Records . The band released the single " The Red " , which reached No. 3 on the Mainstream rock charts , and the video was played in regular rotation on MTV . Wonder What 's Next soon peaked at No. 14 on the United States Billboard 200 album chart . Brian O 'Neil of Allmusic stated the album " offers uniqueness not often heard in more commercial fare , no mean feat . " Chevelle released two more singles from the album , " Closure " , and " Send the Pain Below " , the latter of which reached the No. 1 position on both of the mainstream rock and modern rock charts . Wonder What 's Next was certified platinum by the RIAA with excess sales of one million copies sold in the United States alone in 2003 . 
 In 2003 , Chevelle performed at Ozzfest , where the band recorded and later released its first live album , Live from the Road , and a live DVD , Live from the <unk> . The band toured Europe with Audioslave in early 2003 , and later in the year they played on the Music as a Weapon II tour with Disturbed . On the tour with Disturbed , Chevelle appeared on the tour compilation album , titled Music as a Weapon II , featuring the songs " The Red " and " Forfeit " . Keith Miller of <unk> was critical of Chevelle for touring with Ozzfest with bands such as Cradle of Filth , who he claimed incorporated strong satanic and anti @-@ Christian themes into their lyrics . In 2004 Sam Loeffler said , " It 's something that 's probably going to follow us around forever and that 's fine . It 's pretty simple . We originally signed with a record company that was backed by Word ( a Christian label housing John Tesh and Amy Grant ) , so the record [ Point # 1 ] was in Christian bookstores . It was really an accidental thing . " Sam also told the Chicago Tribune , " Our faith is still extremely important to us , but it 's also very personal . None of us feels being a rock band on stage should be a pedestal for preaching . "

 This Type of Thinking ( Could Do Us In ) was recorded in early 2004 , and was released in September 2004 . The album debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 , and was certified gold by the RIAA six weeks later . Johnny Loftus of Allmusic described the songs on the album as " strong dynamically , but sound predetermined — they don 't separate from the general loud rock malaise . " The song " Vitamin R ( Leading Us Along ) " was released as the first single from the album and reached the No. 1 position on the Mainstream Rock chart . Two other singles were released from the album , the titles of which are " The <unk> " peaking at No. 3 on the Mainstream rock chart , and " Panic Prone " which peaked at No. 26 on the same chart . Before the album 's release , Chevelle received attention when " The <unk> " was featured in the video game Madden NFL 2005 . 
 After the release of the album , the youngest of the brothers , Joe Loeffler , was dismissed from Chevelle . Due to different stories from the band members , it is unclear whether he was fired or left the band of his own accord . Pete and Sam stated the following on the band 's official website : " After three years of non @-@ stop touring and recording , Joe is taking a break to be home with family . We 'll miss having him on the road with us , but as his brothers and bandmates we respect his decision and are looking forward to getting out there and playing for the fans . See you on tour . " However , according to Ultimate Guitar Archive , Joe said of his departure : 
 This is exactly what I expected from them . Try and make it look like I didn 't want to be in the band . I was fired plain and simple , in fact there wasn 't even a discussion about it they just dropped it on me . I made no decision and am not taking a break . I will be working on getting a new job immediately . A break also means there 's a chance to come back , and nothing could be farther from reality . 
 In late 2006 , Pete discussed his brother 's departure on MTV.com : 
 " People need to know that he quit many , many times before , and that [ the last ] time , he quit as well . He took a train home from Kansas City , Missouri , and the [ rest of the ] band flew home . And when we did get home , it was the same old thing — Joe quit again . When he was confronted on it , he denied it , and we said , ' Well , too bad , because now , it 's really over . " 
 The band supported This Type of Thinking ( Could Do Us In ) with a headlining tour that included opening acts such as Taproot and Thirty Seconds to Mars , and continued playing small tours in 2005 with Geno Lenardo from the band Filter . In 2006 Chevelle supported Nickelback for an arena tour across the United States , with a new permanent bassist , the Loeffler brothers ' brother @-@ in @-@ law and longtime friend , Dean Bernardini . 
 = = = Vena Sera ( 2007 – 2008 ) = = = 
 In 2006 Chevelle recorded its fourth studio album titled Vena Sera . The album was the first album Chevelle recorded with Bernardini . Vena Sera was released in April 2007 , debuting at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 , and sold 62 @,@ 000 copies during its first week of release . The title of the album translates to " vein liquid " in Latin , representing the blood Chevelle put into making the album , according to Pete . 
 Corey Apar of Allmusic states that " Vena Sera probably won 't disappoint fans , and it didn 't , if for the sole fact that it basically sounds just like Chevelle 's other albums " . He noted that the song " I Get It " " has a relatively lighter underbelly than the rest , which is a nice change of pace , but it 's ultimately too little , too late " . " Well Enough Alone " , the first single from the album , was written about the departure of Joe Loeffler , and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream rock charts . Chevelle toured with Evanescence , Finger Eleven , and Strata during March and April 2007 , followed by a headlining tour with the latter two bands in May and June . The second single from the album , " I Get It " , was released on June 12 , 2007 , and a video for the song debuted on MTV on November 27 , 2007 . In July of the same year Chevelle toured Australia as a supporting act for the band The Butterfly Effect . On the tour in Australia , Chevelle 's band manager Rose died of cancer , much to the distress of the band . 
 On May 9 , 2007 , during a show in Fort Worth , Texas Chevelle 's trailer containing all of the band 's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying . The band posted a notice saying , " Most items are labeled ' Chevelle ' and if you notice anything suspicious on eBay or other online resellers selling ' authentic ' Chevelle items ... guitar , basses , drums , amplifiers , risers , backdrops , tee shirts ... please call the police ... " A month later in an interview , Sam Loeffler stated , " Of the 14 guitars , we got two of ' em , and then we got some amplifiers back and our monitor system . So it 's really , I mean it 's cool because it 's kind of like Christmas , only really weird . People have been calling us and saying , ' Hey , I bought this or that ' , and you know , we 're just doing our best to buy it back from them . And certainly the issue is not a money issue , it 's about having the pieces of gear that you did all your records with . " 
 = = = Sci @-@ Fi Crimes , Hats Off to the Bull and " Stray Arrows " ( 2009 – 2012 ) = = = 
 In 2009 , Chevelle entered a studio in Nashville , Tennessee with producer Brian Virtue . Sam Loeffler stated , " We have spent a lot of time making these songs something different from past records without losing the core of our passion . We are a hard rock , melodic band and it 's still what drives us as musicians . " The new album , titled Sci @-@ Fi Crimes was released on August 31 , 2009 , peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 album chart with sales of about 46 @,@ 000 , the highest entry onto the chart to date for the band . , The album was praised by Jared Johnson of Allmusic for taking a step in a new direction in regards to the lyrics . Pete Loeffler normally wrote lyrics about personal subjects , however on Sci @-@ Fi Crimes , he wrote of stories including apparitions , conspiracy theories , and erratic sleeping conditions . The tour following the release of Sci @-@ Fi Crimes was in the Fall of 2009 . Opening for Chevelle on this tour was Halestorm , Adelitas Way , and After Midnight Project . While on tour , Pete Loeffler was asked in an interview about the band 's earlier association with Christian music , and said : " To us , it was and is , not that big of a deal . Our first label was owned by a distributorship that distributed to Christian bookstores and things like that . And it doesn 't bother us at all to be called a Christian band . Although we have made a specific point to keep our religion out of our band and out of our shows because we believe it is everybody 's choice to go and do whatever they want . And though we do have our individual faiths and all those things , it is not something that we 'll preach to the people out there . So there were never any misconceptions for us or for our label in that regards . It really was what everybody else was putting out there . " 
 In January 2011 , Chevelle released a live CD / DVD combo titled Any Last Words . The release was part of Chevelle 's ten @-@ year anniversary as a recording band . As a special offer for fans , part of the pre @-@ order package included a T @-@ shirt and the fans ' name in the ' thank <unk> ' part of the album booklet . 
 At the end of 2011 , Chevelle released Hats Off to the Bull , their sixth studio album . The album 's first single was titled " Face to the Floor " , which reached No. 3 on Billboard 's Rock songs chart . The album debuted at No. 20 on the Billboard charts and sold 43 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of release . Joe Barresi , who produced Hats Off to the Bull said of the album , " Rather than simply subscribing to a tried @-@ and @-@ true formula , they made a conscious effort to incorporate new sounds and textures into their patented airtight anthems . As a result , Hats Off to the Bull is one of the group 's most infectious and impressive offerings to date . " Allmusic reviewer Gregory Heaney stated the album is " Heavy and dramatic , the album is packed full of tightly coiled , muscular riffs , giving the album a controlled feeling more like a slow burn than an explosive , cathartic release . " 
 Also , a compilation album of band favorites called Stray Arrows : A Collection of Favorites , was released to stores on December 4 , 2012 . The compilation includes 11 songs and a previously unreleased track titled " <unk> " . The Best Buy version has 15 songs and the track " <unk> " .

 After wrapping up touring in support of Hats off to the Bull in 2013 , Chevelle entered the studio to record their seventh album , re @-@ teaming with Joe Barresi to produce the album . Recording and production finished early in 2014 , and the band announced on February 1 that the album , to be released April 1 , 2014 , would be titled La Gárgola ( Spanish for " the gargoyle " ) . The first single from the album , titled " Take Out the Gunman " , debuted on February 3 on the band 's Vevo and YouTube Channel , with the single being released the next day . The album reached the top of the Rock Album chart in April 2014 . 
 On May 22 , 2015 , fan Kyle Kirchhoff died at a concert in Chicago after falling from a catwalk . 
 In an interview with 105 @.@ 7 The Point on May 23 , 2015 , the band stated that after their last show of their tour in St. Louis , they would focus on writing new material , and that future work would be moving in a heavier @-@ sounding direction . 
 On May 10 , 2016 , the band announced that their new album will be titled The North Corridor , which was released on July 8 , 2016 . The first single from the album is " Joyride ( Omen ) " . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Chevelle has been classified as alternative metal , post @-@ grunge , hard rock and nu metal . The band 's albums Wonder What 's Next and This Type of Thinking ( Could Do Us In ) both are described as nu metal . 
 Their primary musical influences as stated by the band members are Helmet , Tool , and The Cure . Chevelle has frequently been compared to Tool throughout its career , specifically when the band released its music video for " Mia " featuring a claymation doll throughout the video , much like the Tool music video for " Sober " or " Prison Sex " . Pete Loeffler 's singing voice was stated to sound a " tiny bit " like that of Tool 's Maynard James Keenan , and the band 's music has been compared to Tool 's " dark " tone of music . 
 Despite comparisons to Tool , many critics such as Andree Farias and Andy Argyrakis of Christianity Today and Robert Rich of The Daily Texan have stated Chevelle as having a unique sound to their music . The Daily Texan described their music as " a kind of controlled chaos , a beautiful darkness , a gentle rampage of aural velocity " , and drew away from the band 's comparisons to Tool by stating " Tool have always embraced their experimental side and released scathing social commentaries and criticisms , while Chevelle write radio @-@ friendly tunes with subtly deep meanings , but with overtones easily grasped by any listener . " Andree Farias of Christianity Today has reviewed Chevelle 's first three albums , praising them as " commanding vocals over jolting guitars and chest @-@ thumping bass beats . "

 Jaime King ( born April 23 , 1979 ) is an American actress and model .

 = Tali 'Zorah = 
 Tali 'Zorah is a fictional character of the quarian alien race in BioWare 's Mass Effect franchise , who serves as a party member ( or " squadmate " ) in all three games in the Mass Effect trilogy . Within the series , she is a skilled technician and the daughter of Rael 'Zorah , a member of the quarian judicial review Admiralty Board . Ash " Liz " Sroka voices Tali in each of her appearances . Outside of the trilogy , Tali appears in Mass Effect : Homeworlds , a comic series with individual issues on each of several Mass Effect 3 squadmates . 
 Tali was initially the only quarian in the series . In the sequels , more extreme variations of her design were discarded in favor of revisions on her previous look . The Mass Effect 3 development team considered her removal from the squad , but ultimately chose to include her due to staff interest . The team also debated whether to reveal her masked face . 
 Tali has been received positively , with placements on several " top character " lists , and is one of the more popular characters in the series . Her unveiled face was a popular online discussion topic , and was criticized after its reveal for its stock photo origins . Various merchandise for the character , as with other of the series ' squadmates , has been released . 
 = = Character overview = = 
 Tali is a quarian , one of a nomadic alien race driven from their homeworld by a race of software @-@ based intelligences which they created , the geth . As a quarian , Tali must wear a full @-@ body environmental suit due to her race 's weaker immune systems , which also has the effect of hiding her physical appearance and facial features . Tali is first introduced on her Pilgrimage , a quarian rite where young adults leave to obtain a gift for a captain so as to be allowed to join their crew . Having completed this after the first game , her design in Mass Effect 2 and 3 reflects her new maturity . In both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 , Tali 's default appearance can be changed to various alternate outfits ; Mass Effect 2 unlocks one outfit by completing her loyalty mission while another requires buying the " Alternate Appearance Pack 2 " , and Mass Effect 3 offers one alternate from the start and unlocks another by buying the From Ashes DLC . 
 She is a skilled technician and engineer , and renowned in the quarian Migrant Fleet , the spaceship collective home to the race . She has additional pressure to excel as the daughter of Admiral Rael 'Zorah , though the Admiralty position is not technically hereditary . Her father was also strict and had high expectations , and tried to set an example for the rest of the fleet ; this made him distant and saddened Tali . Thanks to her father , she also received some of the best military training available on the fleet . Tali is very loyal to the fleet , and her voice actress Liz Sroka describes her as willing to sacrifice her life for it . Sroka uses an accent described as " unidentifiable pseudo @-@ Eastern European , quarian Gypsy " to voice the character . 
 Sroka described her as being " grounded in her beliefs " but also having a certain " humility " to her . Sroka also underlined her vulnerability , which she felt was one of the character 's strengths . She described the possible romance with player @-@ character Commander Shepard as her " sexual awakening " , which she also felt helped demonstrate the character 's vulnerability . 
 Tali 's name changes over the course of the series . Her birth ship was the <unk> , as evidenced by her full name in the first game ( " Tali 'Zorah nar <unk> " ) . At the start of Mass Effect 2 , she is called Tali 'Zorah vas <unk> , showing that , having completed her Pilgrimage , she has become part of the crew of the <unk> . During her loyalty mission in 2 , her name changes to " vas Normandy " , as she officially joins Commander Shepard 's crew . 
 = = Creation and development = = 
 Tali initially served as the only example of a quarian . Initial concept drawings for Tali and the quarians were finished before the geth 's , but the final geth design then influenced the quarian look . More extreme designs for her Mass Effect 2 appearance were discarded for a " more polished " version of her original " iconic " look instead . Her final new appearance was chosen as it distinguished the character from other quarians introduced in the second game . Tali 's Mass Effect 3 redesign proved difficult due to the team 's passionate views about her character , though ME3 's art director , Derek Watts , felt that most fans had been supportive of the changes to characters ' designs . 
 During BioWare 's naming meetings , prior to the release of the first game , Tali 's name had been " Talsi Orah " , with Orah as the familiar name . However , this was changed for both its connotations of softness , which did not fit with the direction they wanted to take the character , and its awkward pronunciation . 
 New York City actress Ash ( " Liz " ) Sroka voices Tali throughout the Mass Effect trilogy , her first role in a video game . Sroka auditioned for three different roles : the female Commander Shepard , Tali 'Zorah , and one other female character . After initially receiving the role of Tali , she was still unsure of how much material there was . Ginny McSwain gave voice direction , and would generally take two takes — the first to use , the second as back @-@ up , and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit with what she wanted . Recording sessions would generally last about four hours . Sroka herself is not a gamer , though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have landed the role . 
 Like Garrus Vakarian , Tali was not an option for player romantic pursuit in the first game as the developers were unsure whether the alien characters would be emotionally compelling . Tali 's romance event tree was added in Mass Effect 2 due to fan demand and her ability to express human emotion . This romance , if pursued in the second game , can be continued in Mass Effect 3 . The romance event tree in 2 was written by Patrick Weekes . Mass Effect 2 lead writer Mac Walters commented that " [ t ] he choice should be in ' who ' you romance , not so much ' how ' " , with each of the characters having different @-@ natured romances depending on their individual personalities . 
 Each squad member in Mass Effect 2 had music composed for them , intended to convey their character ; BioWare gave the composers detailed character studies for each to help . Tali 's theme was created by Jimmy Hinson , who had generally made game remixes beforehand . Hinson worked from his home in Tennessee and made his pieces using FL Studio 9 . Although they were given full access to the game 's content , Hinson chose to avoid looking beyond what he absolutely needed to look at to write the tracks , due to wanting to experience the game fresh upon its release . In addition to Tali , Hinson also wrote tracks for Samara and Grunt , as well as various other tracks in the game . 
 The game artists regularly drafted variations on Tali 's face throughout the series ' development . BioWare 's position on whether to reveal her face was a long @-@ standing internal debate , and the developers announced they were still unsure during Mass Effect 3 's development . Concept artist Matt Rhodes felt it would interesting to see how players compared her personality to her appearance , and how they would respond to an appearance that challenged their expectations as " a little too alien , just a little too repellant " . They were aware that either decision would likely annoy some people , and that no reveal could universally fit all views of Tali . BioWare wished to unveil her face in a " tasteful way " outside of the game engine , and decided that a gift from Tali would be the best way . A stock photo was used to ensure the face 's closeness to a real photograph . An in @-@ game photo of Tali 's face is available as a gift to the player @-@ character Commander Shepard upon pursuing her Mass Effect 3 romance event tree . 
 BioWare considered not making Tali a squadmate in Mass Effect 3 . Some writers , such as Weekes , felt passionately about her inclusion , which led the team to believe that the players could share his passion . Preston <unk> , lead designer for the Mass Effect series , found Tali 's death in 3 was the toughest for him to plan , though felt it needed to be possible due to the option of wiping out the quarians .

 The first game of the trilogy , 2007 's Mass Effect , marks Tali 's first appearance . Whilst on her Pilgrimage , Tali discovers that a rogue Spectre ( elite agent of the galaxy 's central government ) , Saren , is working with the geth and has attacked Eden Prime , humanity 's first space colony . She arranges for a meeting to trade with the Shadow Broker , but is betrayed by its organizer , the thug Fist , who pretends to organize a meeting but instead has sent her into an ambush . Commander Shepard , the player @-@ character , rescues her . Tali gives the evidence to the Commander , and Saren consequently loses his Spectre status . Shepard is then sent to hunt down Saren , and Tali joins the player @-@ character 's squad . Tali can join the player @-@ character on missions and is available for personal conversation aboard Shepard 's spaceship , the Normandy . 
 On board the Normandy , Tali is initially excited to be there , intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy , and stays in the engine room as a result . The next time Shepard speaks to her , though , Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn . She tells Shepard that she 's losing sleep , since the Normandy 's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla , where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter , plus the ship , due to how it 's spread out , seems emptier . This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have . The next time Shepard speaks to her , Tali 's spirits are back up , having adjusted to living on the Normandy , plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own , especially Shepard . She thanks Shepard for this , saying that <unk> are treated as second @-@ class citizens by other races and Shepard is the first to treat her as an equal . If the player completes a particular side @-@ mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards , she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered , explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage . If the player allows her to have a copy , Tali is overly happy , promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren . If the player declines , Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren , but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage .

 Tali returns in the 2010 sequel , during the game 's second mission on the human colony world Freedom 's Progress , leading a group of quarians in search of a quarian named Veetor , who is on his own Pilgrimage . The colony has been attacked by the " Collectors , " its human colonists abducted , and Tali agrees to work with Shepard in order to help search for Veetor , over the objections of her team . The quarian team rush to Veetor 's location only to be defeated by mechanical guards that have been reprogrammed to shoot on sight by the fearful Veetor ; Shepard 's squad arrives too late to save all of the quarians , but they manage to eliminate the guards and calm Veetor . After learning what Veetor witnessed during the attack , Shepard can either send Veetor back to the Migrant Fleet with Tali to be treated for his trauma , or to hand the quarian over to Cerberus , Shepard 's employers , for further questioning about the Collectors . 
 Tali later appears on the planet <unk> , a former quarian colony , where Shepard is sent to recruit her . She and a team of quarian soldiers were sent to investigate a star aging faster than usual and are under attack by a geth patrol that spotted their activity . After Shepard eliminates the attacking geth and meets her in the bunker in which she had been trapped with her equipment , Tali departs with Shepard on the mission to investigate and stop the Collectors , receiving permission from the Admiralty Board after the fact . 
 Tali 's " loyalty mission , " an optional mission that reveals more of a squad member 's past that is meant to increase loyalty , puts her on trial before the Admiralty Board , facing possible exile for bringing active geth parts to the Flotilla , a charge she denies . Tali admits to Shepard that she did send her father inert geth components to develop more effective weapons , but asserts that they could not spontaneously activate . When the Normandy crew arrives on the vessel hosting the trial , Tali is referred to as " Tali 'Zorah vas Normandy , " an unexpected revelation that she has been formally re @-@ assigned without any notice ; this development means that Shepard , as Tali 's captain , will represent her in trial . The admirals reveal during the trial that geth have taken over a ship , the Alerei , and that Tali 's father was on the ship when the geth took over and he is presumed dead . Given the evidence supporting the grave accusations , Tali has the option to board the Alerei to search for evidence of her innocence and to clear the geth infestation ; onboard the Alerei , Tali and Shepard discover her Rael 'Zorah 's remains and logs documenting his experiments on the geth , reactivating and assembling the components Tali sent him , and that he is to blame for the attack . Tali asks Shepard not to reveal the information they discover , as it would disgrace his otherwise good name . At the trial , the player chooses whether Shepard withholds the new evidence ( Tali is exiled with Rael 'Zorah 's good name in tact ) , submits it ( Tali is innocent at the cost of her father 's reputation ) , or incites the crowd to show popular support for Tali and her previous service record ( Tali is found innocent without disgracing her father ) . 
 Tali can die during the final mission of the game — the " Suicide Mission " — depending on the player 's choices . Her chances of dying increase if the player submits the evidence against her will , or does not complete her loyalty mission .

 Unless the player imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Tali cannot appear in Mass Effect 3 , Tali shows when the Commander moves to recruit the quarian fleet in the fight against the Reapers , powerful sapient cyborgs with intentions to destroy all life . Tali joins the squad , and her conversation options tell of the quarians ' new attack on the now Reaper @-@ allied geth , in a bid by the quarians to try and reclaim their homeworld . Depending on the player 's choices in the second game , Tali may either be an Admiral or merely an advisor on how to defeat the geth . Eventually , the player must choose between saving the geth or the quarians , or , if certain conditions are fulfilled , negotiating a stand @-@ down and saving both parties . If the player sides with the geth and lets the quarians die , Tali kills herself ; otherwise , she fully joins the squad and can be found interacting with other Normandy crew members . Admiral Shala <unk> vas <unk> fulfills Tali 's role in saved games where Tali cannot appear in @-@ game . Shala <unk> does not join Shepard 's squad . 
 The downloadable add @-@ on Citadel adds a number of character moments for Tali , including ( depending on dialogue and event choices or whether Shepard is in a romance with her ) revealing her love of romantic movies , her talent for singing and doing impressions of the Normandy , and the fact she cannot hold her liquor very well .

 The second issue of the comic Homeworlds was revealed to focus around Tali 's past . Released on May 30 , 2012 , the issue tells of the beginning of her Pilgrimage , and the events leading up to her appearance in the first game . Originally intending to take the quarian ship Honorata to the planet <unk> , along with Keenah <unk> , in search of valuable items , they discover geth activity on an unidentified ice planet . Tali extracts the memory core from one of the geth , and discovers a recording of a conversation between Saren and Matriarch <unk> discussing the attack on Eden Prime . 
 Once they arrive at <unk> , the crew is attacked a group of mercenaries including Commander Jacobus , hired by Saren , leaving Tali and Keenah the only survivors . The two stowaway on a ship to the Citadel , though are uncovered and turned over to C @-@ Sec once they arrive . Though they try to tell of the evidence they have found , they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel . Later , they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus , injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah . After being chased through the Citadel , Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator , killing him , though Keenah collapses and dies . 
 Tali then arrives at Dr. Michel 's clinic , who treats her wounds . She is told to go to the bar Chora 's Den by Barla Von , and put into contact with the Shadow Broker , setting the stage for her entry into the first Mass Effect game .

 Tali has received a positive critical response . Writing for UGO , Evan Saathoff listed Tali as his fourth best video game companion , comparing her as the " innocent , girl next door experience " to the sexiness of Halo 's Cortana . GamesRadar 's Carolyn Gudmundson listed Tali as one of several video game characters she 'd " go gay for " , noting her " kind personality and air of mystery " , as well as her technical genius and accent . Upon hearing news for a potential Mass Effect film , Dan Ryckert of Game Informer looked at the different characters and felt Famke Janssen would be best suited to play the role of Tali — due to having a similar body to the character and having played Xenia Onatopp , a Russian @-@ accented soldier , in the 1995 Bond film GoldenEye . 
 Within the trilogy , Tali is one of the most popular characters , with various sources describing her as a fan favorite . Steven Hopper , writing for IGN , listed her as his second favorite Mass Effect teammate after Garrus Vakarian , praising her " endearing geekiness " and the story that follows her . Similarly , UGO 's Sal Basile listed her as the fourth best squadmate in Mass Effect 3 , giving credit to her in @-@ game abilities . Kirk Hamilton , of Kotaku , also felt her one @-@ on @-@ one dialogue scene in Citadel was the best out of all the squadmates ' . 
 Nevertheless , PC Gamer 's Andy Kelly listed the character as one BioWare character he hated , expressing confusion at her popularity and calling her " One of the dullest characters in BioWare history . "

 Tali 's unmasked face and its potential appearance has been subject to discussion by both critics and fans . Casey Hudson , in an interview , acknowledged depictions of Tali 's face as the most common fan art . Jordan <unk> , writing for GamesRadar , highlighted a piece of fan art that he enjoyed and which a BioWare developer had retweeted . Before the face was revealed , IGN 's Scott Nichols ran an article about the possibility of revealing the face , concluding that fans did not just want to see her face but also " the expressions it can make , adding yet another level of emotional depth and complexity to a fan favorite character " . GamesRadar 's Mikel Reparaz listed it as one of the 12 gaming mysteries he wanted solved in 2011 , and hoped that it would be something unusual @-@ looking ; this sentiment was echoed by fellow GamesRadar writer Tyler Nagata , who felt that the face should be ugly . PC Gamer 's Tom Francis also included the face in their list of 15 things he wanted to see in Mass Effect 3 . 
 Once the face was revealed , it was met with wide criticism from fans , particularly for being a stock photo ( of Miss England model <unk> <unk> ) . GameZone 's Matt Liebl felt that the issue was not as big as fans had made it out to be . Some fans proceeded to make their own faces , such as a piece by deviantArt artist " <unk> " that Kotaku 's Luke Plunkett compared favorably to the actual face .

 = Barber coinage = 
 The Barber coinage consisted of a dime , quarter , and half dollar designed by United States Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber . They were minted between 1892 and 1916 , though no half dollars were struck in the final year of the series . 
 By the late 1880s , there were increasing calls for the replacement of the Seated Liberty design , used since the 1830s on most denominations of silver coins . In 1891 , Mint Director Edward O. Leech , having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns , ordered a competition , seeking a new look for the silver coins . As only the winner would receive a cash prize , invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable . Leech instructed Barber to prepare new designs for the dime , quarter , and half dollar , and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech 's endorsement , they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891 . Striking of the new coins began the following January . 
 Public and artistic opinion of the new pieces was , and remains , mixed . In 1915 , Mint officials began plans to replace them , after the design 's minimum term expired in 1916 . The Mint issued Barber dimes and quarters in 1916 to meet commercial demand , but before the end of the year , the Mercury dime , Standing Liberty quarter , and Walking Liberty half dollar had begun production . Most dates in the Barber coin series are not difficult to obtain , but the 1894 dime struck at the San Francisco Mint ( 1894 @-@ S ) , with a mintage of 24 , is a great rarity .

 = = = Charles Barber = = = 
 Charles E. Barber was born in London in 1840 . His grandfather , John Barber , led the family to America in the early 1850s . Both John and his son William were engravers and Charles followed in their footsteps . The Barber family initially lived in Boston upon their arrival to the United States , though they later moved to Providence to allow William to work for the Gorham Manufacturing Company . William Barber 's skills came to the attention of Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre , who hired him as an assistant engraver in 1865 ; when Longacre died in 1869 , William Barber became chief engraver and Charles was hired as an assistant engraver . 
 William Barber died August 31 , 1879 of an illness contracted after swimming at Atlantic City , New Jersey . His son applied for the position of chief engraver , as did George T. Morgan , another British @-@ born engraver hired by the Mint . In early December 1879 , Treasury Secretary John Sherman , Mint Director Horatio Burchard , and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent A. Loudon Snowden met to determine the issue . They decided to recommend the appointment of Barber , who was subsequently nominated by President Rutherford B. Hayes and in February 1880 , was confirmed by the Senate . Barber would serve nine presidents in the position , remaining until his death in 1917 , when Morgan would succeed him . 
 Coinage redesign was being considered during Barber 's early years as chief engraver . Superintendent Snowden believed that the base @-@ metal coins then being struck ( the one , three , and five cent pieces ) should have uniform designs , as did many of the silver pieces , and also some gold coins . He had Barber create experimental pattern coins . In spite of Snowden 's desires , the only design modified was that of the five @-@ cent coin , or nickel ; Barber 's design , known as the Liberty Head nickel , entered production in 1883 . The new coin had its denomination designated by a Roman numeral " V " on the reverse ; the three @-@ cent coin had always had a " III " to designate its denomination . Enterprising fraudsters soon realized that the nickel and half eagle ( or five @-@ dollar gold piece ) were close in size , and plated the base metal coins to pass to the unwary . Amid public ridicule of the Mint , production came to a halt until Barber hastily added the word " cents " to the reverse of his design . 
 = = = Movement towards redesign = = = 
 For much of the second half of the 19th century , most U.S. silver coins bore a design of a seated Liberty . This design had been created by Christian Gobrecht , an engraver at the United States Mint in Philadelphia , after a sketch by artist Thomas Sully , and introduced to U.S. coins in the late 1830s . The design reflected an English influence , and as artistic tastes changed over time , was increasingly disliked in the United States . In 1876 , The Galaxy magazine said of the then current silver coins : 
 Why is it we have the ugliest money of all civilized nations ? The design is poor , commonplace , tasteless , characterless , and the execution is like thereunto . They have rather the appearance of tokens or mean medals . One reason for this is that the design is so inartistic , and so insignificant . That young woman sitting on nothing in particular , wearing nothing to speak of , looking over her shoulder at nothing imaginable , and bearing in her left hand something that looks like a broomstick with a woolen nightcap on it — what is she doing there ? 
 Public dissatisfaction with the newly @-@ issued Morgan dollar led the Mint 's engravers to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879 . Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine . Sometime in the early 1880s , he , along with one of his reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs . They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful . The visitors left disappointed , after learning that Burchard considered the much @-@ criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them . 
 In 1885 , Burchard was succeeded as Mint director by James Kimball . The new director was more receptive to Gilder 's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for new designs for the non @-@ gold coinage . These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator Justin Morrill questioned the Mint 's authority to produce new designs . The Mint had claimed authority under the Coinage Act of 1873 in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883 . Morrill was a supporter of coin redesign and had in the past introduced bills to accomplish this ; he felt , however , that this could not be done without an act of Congress . Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers ; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority . All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs : Morrill by introducing and pressing legislation , Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report , and Gilder by orchestrating favorable coverage . With legislators busy with other matters , it was not until September 26 , 1890 that President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate redesign by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury 's approval . Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced ; for example , a coin first struck in 1892 would be eligible for redesign in 1916 . 
 = = Inception = = 
 Three days before the signing of the 1890 act , Barber wrote to the superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint , Oliver Bosbyshell , setting forth proposed terms of a competition to select new coin designs . Barber suggested that entrants be required to submit models , as opposed to drawings , and that the designs be in low relief , which was used for coins . He proposed that the entries include the lettering and denomination , as submissions without them would not adequately show the appearance of the finished coin . He received a reply that due to other work , the Mint would not be able to address the question until the spring of 1891 . 
 On October 16 , 1890 , a new Mint director , Edward O. Leech , took office . Leech , aged 38 at the time , had spent his career at the Bureau of the Mint , and was an enthusiastic supporter of redesign . He took the precaution of obtaining recommendations from Barber as to suitable outside artists who might participate in a competition . Since most of the proposed artists were New York @-@ based , Andrew Mason , superintendent of the New York Assay Office , was given the task of finalizing the list of invitees . Leading Mason 's list of ten names was that of Saint @-@ Gaudens . Mason sent Leech the recommendations on April 3 , 1891 ; the following day , the Mint director announced the competition , open to the public , but he specifically invited the ten artists named by Mason to participate . Besides Saint @-@ Gaudens , artists asked to compete included Daniel Chester French , Herbert Adams , and Kenyon Cox . Although Barber had warned the director that reputable artists would likely not enter a contest in which only the winner received compensation , Leech offered a $ 500 prize to the winner , and no payments to anyone else . He sought new designs for both sides of the dollar , and for the obverses of the half dollar , quarter , and dime — Leech was content to let the reverses of the Seated Liberty coins continue . By law , an eagle had to appear on the quarter and half dollar , but could not appear on the dime . 
 Most of the artists conferred in New York and responded in a joint letter that they would be willing to participate , but not on the terms set . They proposed a competition with set fees for sketches and designs submitted by the invited artists , to be judged by a jury of their peers , and with the Mint committed to replace the Seated Liberty coins with the result . They also insisted that the same artist create both sides of a given coin , and that more time be given to allow the development of designs . Leech was unable to meet these terms , as there was only enough money available for the single prize . In addition to inviting the ten artists , he had sent thousands of solicitations through the country ; a number of designs were submitted in response to the circulars . To judge the submissions , he appointed a jury consisting of Saint @-@ Gaudens , Barber , and Henry Mitchell , a Boston seal engraver and member of the 1890 Assay Commission . The committee met in June 1891 and quickly rejected all entries . 
 Leech was quoted in the press regarding the result of the contest : 
 It is not likely that another competition will ever be tried for the production of designs for United States coins . The one just ended was too wretched a failure ... The result is not very flattering to the boasted artistic development of this country , inasmuch as only two of the three hundred suggestions submitted were good enough to receive honorable mention . 
 Barber wrote years later about the competition , " many [ entries ] were sent in , but Mr. St. Gaudens , [ sic ] who was appointed one of the committee to pass upon designs , objected to everything submitted " . Numismatic historian Roger Burdette explained the artistic differences between the two men : 
 It is likely they were so far apart in their artistic understanding that neither listened to what the other had to say ... Barber was from the English trades @-@ apprentice approach where engraving and die sinking were crafts closely aligned to other metal workers such as machine tool makers . His father and grandfather were both engravers . Saint @-@ Gaudens was a classically trained sculptor who began his career as an apprentice cameo cutter in New York , later moving to Paris and Rome for extensive training while perfecting his artistry . Barber generally worked in small , circular formats — a three @-@ inch medal was a large size for his sculptures . Saint @-@ Gaudens was uncomfortable with small medals and typically designed life @-@ size or larger figures ... the 1891 competition turned the two against each other for the rest of their lives . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Frustrated at the competition 's outcome , Leech on June 11 , 1891 instructed Barber to prepare designs for the half dollar , quarter , and dime . As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck , the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being . For the obverse of the new coins , Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period ; he was content that the current reverses be continued . Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was to be done at the Mint ; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs . Leech had spoken with Saint @-@ Gaudens on the same subject ; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high @-@ quality coin designs ; three lived in France and he was the fourth . 
 Leech announced the decision to have Barber do the work in July , stating that he had instructed the engraver to prepare designs for presentation to Secretary of the Treasury Charles Foster . In a letter printed in the New York Tribune , Gilder expressed disappointment that the Mint was planning to generate the new designs in @-@ house , feeling that the Mint , essentially a factory for coins , was ill @-@ equipped to generate artistic coin designs . Due to Gilder 's prominence in the coinage redesign movement , Leech felt the need to respond personally , which he did in early August . He told Gilder that " artistic designs for coins , that would meet the ideas of an art critic like yourself , and artists generally , are not always adapted for practical coining " . He assured Gilder that the designs which Barber had already prepared had met with the approval of Mitchell , though Leech himself had some improvements to suggest to the chief engraver . 
 Barber 's first attempt , modeled for the half dollar , disregarded Leech 's instructions . Instead of a design based on French coinage , it depicted a standing figure of Columbia , bearing a pileus atop a liberty pole ; an eagle spreading its wings stands behind her . The reverse utilized the heraldic eagle from the Great Seal of the United States , enclosed inside a thick oak wreath , with the required legends surrounding the rim . Leech rejected the design , and Barber submitted a revised obverse in mid @-@ September with a head of Liberty similar to that on the adopted coin . Leech got feedback from friends and from Secretary Foster ; on September 28 , he wrote Barber that Liberty 's lips were " rather voluptuous " and directed him to prepare a reverse without the wreath . Barber did so , and pattern coins based on the revised design were struck . Barber complained , in a letter on October 2 to Superintendent Bosbyshell , but intended for Leech , that the constant demands for changes were wasting his time . Leech replied , stating that he did not care how much effort was expended in order to improve the design , especially since , once issued , they would have to be used for 25 years . Barber 's reply was transmitted to Leech on October 6 with a cover letter from Acting Superintendent Mark Cobb ( Bosbyshell was traveling ) stating that Barber " disclaims any intention to be <unk> and certainly did not intend to question your prerogative as one of the officers designed by law to pass upon new designs for coinage " . The letter from Barber was a lengthy technical explanation for various design elements , and requested further advice from Leech if he had preferences ; the overall tone was argumentative . Leech chose not to write again ; he addressed one concern , about whether the olive branches in the design were rendered accurately , by visiting the National Botanical Garden , obtaining one , and sending it to Barber . 
 The question of how to render the stars ( representing the 13 original states ) on the coin was posed in the letters ; in the end , Leech opted for six @-@ pointed stars on the obverse and five @-@ pointed ones on the reverse . Barber had prepared three versions of the design , each with clouds over the eagle ; Leech approved one on October 31 and ordered working dies prepared , but then began to question the presence of the clouds , and had two more versions made . On November 6 , President Harrison and his Cabinet considered which of the designs to approve , and chose one without the clouds ; the following day , Leech ordered working dies prepared . Barber scaled down his design for the quarter and dime . While the Cabinet approved the designs , members requested that the Mint embolden the words " Liberty " on the obverse and " E Pluribus Unum " on the reverse , believing that these legends would wear away in circulation ; despite the resulting changes , this proved to be accurate . For the reverse of the dime , on which , by law , an eagle could not appear , a slight modification of the reverse of the Seated Liberty dime was used , with a wreath of foliage and produce surrounding the words " One Dime " . 
 It is uncertain when pattern dimes and quarters were struck , but this was most likely in mid @-@ November 1891 . One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known , whereas five different half dollars are extant ; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and none are in private hands . On December 11 , Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid @-@ January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested ; Leech refused . The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2 , 1892 at 9 : 00 a.m. By the end of the day , all three denominations had been coined . 
 = = Design = = 
 All three denominations of the Barber coinage depict a head of Liberty , facing right . She wears a pileus , a crown fashioned from an olive branch , and a small headband inscribed " Liberty " . On the quarter and half dollar , the motto " In God We Trust " appears above her head ; she is otherwise surrounded with 13 six @-@ pointed stars and the date . On the dime , her head is surrounded with " United States of America " and the year . The reverse of the quarter and half dollar depicts a heraldic eagle , based on the Great Seal . The bird holds in its mouth a scroll inscribed " E Pluribus Unum " and in its right claws an olive branch ; in its left it holds 13 arrows . Above the eagle are 13 five @-@ pointed stars ; it is surrounded by the name of the country and by the coin 's denomination . The reverse of the dime depicts a wreath of corn , wheat , maple and oak leaves surrounding the words " One Dime " . Barber 's monogram " B " is on the cutoff of Liberty 's neck ; the mint mark , on the dime , is placed beneath the wreath on the reverse and beneath the eagle on the larger denominations . 
 Barber 's head of Liberty is purely classical , and is rendered in the Roman style . The head is modeled after the French " Ceres " silver coinage of the late 19th century , but bears a resemblance to Morgan 's design for the silver dollar . This did not escape numismatist Walter Breen in his comprehensive guide to U.S. coins , " Barber must have been feeling unusually lazy . He left the [ dime ] rev [ erse ] design as it had been since 1860 , with minor simplifications . His <unk> [ erse ] was a mirror image of the Morgan dollar head , with much of Miss Anna <unk> Williams 's back hair cropped off , the rest concealed ... within a disproportionately large cap . " In his text introducing the Barber quarter , Breen states , " the whole composition is <unk> stolid , <unk> , crowded ( especially on rev [ erse ] ) , and without discernible merit aside from the technical one of low relief " . Burdette terms Barber 's designs , " typically mediocre imitations of the current French @-@ style — hardly better than the arcane seated Liberty type they replaced " . 
 Art historian Cornelius Vermeule , in his work on U.S. coins , took a more positive view of Barber 's coinage , " the last word as to their aesthetic merits has yet to be written . Little admired or collected for more than three generations after their appearance [ writing in 1971 ] , these essentially conservative but most dignified coins have suddenly become extremely popular with collectors " . Vermeule argued that " the designs of Barber 's coins were more attuned to the times than he perhaps realized . The <unk> , matronly gravitas of Liberty had come to America seven years earlier in the person of Frédéric Bartholdi 's giant statue [ the Statue of Liberty ] ... " He suggested that the features of Daniel Chester French 's huge statue Republic , created for the World Columbian Exposition , " were absolutely in harmony with what Charles Barber had created for the coinage in the year of the Fair 's opening " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Leech released the new designs to the press about November 10 , 1891 . According to numismatist David Lange , the new coinage received mixed reviews , " while the general press and public seemed satisfied with the new dime , quarter dollar , and half dollar , numismatists were either mildly disappointed with the new coins or remained silent on the matter . " Moran records a number of unfavorable reviews , without listing any favorable ones . Vermeule stated that " the initial comment on the new coinage concerned the novelty of a contest , its failure , and the inevitable result that the commission would go , as always , to the Chief Engraver [ Barber ] and his staff . " 
 George Heath , editor of The Numismatist discussed the new pieces : " the mechanical work is all that could be desired , and it is probable that owing to the conventional rut in which our mint authorities seem obliged to keep , this is the best that could be done " . <unk> Martin wrote in the American Journal of Numismatics , " The general effect is pleasing , of the three the Dime is to many the most attractive piece . The head of Liberty is dignified , but although the silly story has been started that the profile is that of a ' reigning belle ' of New York , she can hardly be called a beauty ; there is a suggestion ... of the classic heads on some of the Roman coins , and a much stronger suggestion of the head on the French Francs of 1871 and onward ... these coins are an advance on what has hitherto been accomplished , but there is yet a long distance between them and the ideal National coin . " 
 Other reactions were unfavorable . Artist Kenyon Cox , one of the invited artists to the 1891 competition , stated , " I think it disgraceful that this great country should have such a coin as this . " Harper 's Weekly proclaimed , " The mountain had labored and brought forth a mouse . " Saint @-@ Gaudens was also interviewed , and as author Moran put it , " <unk> ranted " : " This is inept ; this looks like it had been designed by a young lady of sixteen , a miss who had taken only a few lessons in modeling . It is beneath criticism ... There are hundreds of artists in this country , any of whom , with the aid of a designer , could have made a very respectable coin , which this is not . " 
 = = Production and collecting = = 
 Soon after issuance of the new quarters , the Mint received complaints that they would not stack properly . Barber made adjustments in his design to remedy this problem . Accordingly , there are two versions of the 1892 quarter , dubbed " Type I " and " Type II " , both for the version without mint mark struck at Philadelphia and for those struck at the New Orleans Mint ( 1892 @-@ O ) and the San Francisco Mint ( 1892 @-@ S ) . They may be distinguished by their reverses : Type I quarters have about half of the letter " E " in " UNITED " covered by the eagle 's wing ; with Type II quarters , the letter is almost entirely obscured . Type I quarters are rarer for each mint . 
 The 1894 @-@ S Barber dime is one of the great numismatic rarities , with a published mintage of 24 proof pieces . Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined . According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist , the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $ 2 @.@ 40 in silver left over from the melting of worn @-@ out coins , just enough to coin 24 dimes . More ten @-@ cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year , but this did not occur . Breen , on the other hand , related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends , giving three to each . He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie , telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was , and she would be able to sell them for a good price . According to the story , she spent one on a dish of ice cream , but kept the other two until 1954 . One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957 , and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen . One sold for $ 1 @,@ 552 @,@ 500 at auction in 2007 . 
 In 1900 , Barber modified the dies . This change resulted in quarters that were thinner , so that 21 of the new coins would stack in the space occupied by 20 of the old . Barber again set to work on the dies . San Francisco Mint officials wanted permission to use the old dies , which was refused , as it was felt that all mints should be producing coins with the same specifications . There are small differences between quarters produced at the different mints . 
 Except for the 1894 @-@ S dime , there are no great rarities in the series , as mintages were generally high . Key dates for the dime include the 1895 @-@ O , 1896 @-@ S , 1897 @-@ O , 1901 @-@ S and 1903 @-@ S. For the quarter , key dates are the 1896 @-@ S , 1901 @-@ S , and 1913 @-@ S. The rarest half dollar is the 1892 @-@ O " Micro O " , in which the mint mark " O " for New Orleans was impressed on the half dollar die with a puncheon intended for the quarter ; other key dates are the 1892 @-@ S , 1893 @-@ S , 1897 @-@ O , 1914 , and 1915 . " Condition rarities " , relatively inexpensive in circulated condition but costly in high grades , include the 1901 @-@ S , 1904 @-@ S , and 1907 @-@ S half dollars . Although most dates are obtainable , many are scarce in uncirculated grades as the coins saw heavy wear . Large quantities of Barber coins were melted for bullion when silver prices rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s . 
 = = Replacement = = 
 According to Burdette , " agitation to replace Barber 's banal 1892 Liberty head began almost before the first coins were cold from the press . " In 1894 , the American Numismatic and Antiquarian Society , in conjunction with various artistic and educational institutes , began to advocate for better designs for U.S. coins , but no change took place in the remainder of the 19th century . 
 In 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt started to push for improvements to U.S. coins , and arranged for the Mint to engage Saint @-@ Gaudens to redesign coins which could be changed under the 1890 act . Before his death in 1907 , the sculptor provided designs for the double eagle and eagle , though the double eagle required adjustment by Barber to lower the relief before it could be released as a circulating coin . Redesign of the smaller gold pieces , Lincoln cent , and Buffalo nickel followed between 1908 and 1913 . By then , the dime , quarter , and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a redesign in the 20th century . As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could be changed without an act of Congress , calls for a new design increased . 
 In 1915 , a new Mint director , Robert W. Woolley took office . Woolley advocated the replacement of the silver coins when it was legal to do so , and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs . He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts , asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint 's engravers and , if they felt they were not suitable , to recommend artists to design the new coins . The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman , Hermon MacNeil , and Albin Polasek . Although Woolley had hoped that each artists would produce one design , different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar , and one by MacNeil for the quarter . 
 Woolley had hoped to begin production of the new coins on July 1 , 1916 . There was heavy demand for small change , and as delays in actual production stretched into the second half of the year , Woolley was forced to have Barber prepare dies for 1916 @-@ dated dimes and quarters bearing the chief engraver 's 1892 design . According to numismatist David Lange , " Barber must have secretly smiled to himself as his familiar Roman bust of Liberty once again dropped from the presses by the thousands , and then by the millions . " There were sufficient half dollars from 1915 available to meet demand ; no Barber halves were struck in 1916 .

 Typhoon Sinlaku was a damaging typhoon that affected Okinawa , Taiwan , and eastern China in September 2002 . The 16th named storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season , Sinlaku formed on August 27 northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands . After initially moving to the north , it began a generally westward motion that it maintained for the rest of its duration . Sinlaku strengthened into a typhoon and attained its peak winds on August 31 . Over the next few days , it fluctuated slightly in intensity while moving over or near the Ryukyu Islands . On September 4 , the typhoon 's eye crossed over Okinawa . It dropped heavy rainfall and produced strong winds that left over 100 @,@ 000 people without power . Damage on the island was estimated at $ 14 @.@ 3 million . 
 After affecting Okinawa , Sinlaku threatened northern Taiwan , which was previously affected by two deadly typhoons in the previous year . Officials enacted many preparations , although damage ended up being minimal on the island . Two people were killed on Taiwan , however . Sinlaku weakened slightly before making its final landfall in eastern China near Wenzhou on September 7 . There , the storm produced a record wind gust of 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) , and just south of the city , high waves destroyed several piers and a large boat . High rainfall and winds from Sinlaku destroyed 58 @,@ 000 houses , and large areas of crops were destroyed . Damage in China was estimated at $ 709 million , and there were 28 deaths there . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring a tropical disturbance on August 26 , noting that an area of convection had an associated circulation . With favorable conditions , the agency assessed a fair potential for development . On August 27 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as tropical depression south of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima , although the circulation was exposed from the convection . The next day , the JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Depression 22W about 945 km ( 565 mi ) northeast of Saipan , after the thunderstorms began wrapping into the center . 
 Initially , the depression moved generally northward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge , strengthening into Tropical Storm Sinlaku on August 29 . The building ridge , located east of Japan , gradually turned the storm westward . As early as August 29 , the JTWC reported that an eye feature was beginning to develop . After further intensification , Sinlaku strengthened , and the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon on August 31 ; the JTWC estimated Sinlaku attained typhoon status a day earlier . 
 Shortly after Sinlaku become a typhoon , the JMA estimated it attained peak 10 minute maximum sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Also on August 31 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . On September 1 , Sinlaku began undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle , although cooler water temperatures caused by previous Typhoon Rusa prevented restrengthening . The typhoon turned more to the west @-@ northwest on September 2 , and without much change in intensity , it passed just south of Iwo Jima that day and very near the Japanese island of Minamidaitojima around 2130 UTC on September 3 . The next day , Sinlaku also passed just south of Okinawa , although its large 110 km ( 70 mi ) eye crossed over the southern portion of the island ; the JTWC estimated the storm had winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while passing near Okinawa . A trough passing north of Sinlaku slowed the typhoon 's westward movement . Dry air in the region , and later increased wind shear caused a steady weakening trend . On September 6 , Sinlaku passed a short distance north of Taiwan , and subsequently a west @-@ northwest motion resumed . The JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm on September 7 in the East China Sea , although the JTWC maintained it as a typhoon . Around 1030 UTC that day , Sinlaku made landfall in east @-@ central China near Wenzhou , a city near the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces . The storm weakened while progressing inland , although its circulation remained well @-@ defined until dissipating on September 9 .

 Typhoon Sinlaku first affected Iwo Jima , producing sustained winds of 131 km / h ( 82 mph ) , with gusts to 183 km / h ( 114 mph ) . Residents on the small island of Minamidaitojima evacuated their homes to safer areas during the storm . Rainfall caused flooding on the island . Offshore Okinawa , a Philippine cargo ship went missing , prompting a rescue mission by the Japanese Coast Guard . The crew was rescued a day later , and no one was injured . 
 Before affecting the island , officials on Okinawa canceled 150 airplane flights and halted bus service . Schools ended early , and only essential personnel were reporting at Kadena Air Base . While striking Okinawa , Sinlaku dropped heavy rainfall , peaking at 453 mm ( 17 @.@ 8 in ) at two locations . Rainfall spread northward through the Amami Islands , reaching 315 mm ( 12 @.@ 4 in ) at <unk> . The highest hourly precipitation total was 56 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) , recorded at Naha , Okinawa . Sinlaku produced winds as strong as 122 km / h ( 76 mph ) , with gusts to 191 km / h ( 118 mph ) on Okinawa . Gale @-@ force winds affected the island for about 21 hours . During its passage , the typhoon destroyed 11 houses and damaged 231 others , and 45 houses were flooded . High winds knocked down power lines , which left 105 @,@ 500 homes without electricity on Okinawa . Sinlaku injured 31 people , four of them severely , but there were no deaths in Japan . Insured damage in Japan totaled $ 14 @.@ 3 million ( ¥ 1 @.@ 7 billion 2002 JPY ) . Sinlaku left about $ 3 @.@ 6 million in damage to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa . 
 In Taiwan , the country 's Central Weather Bureau issued storm warnings for coastal waters and for areas along the coast . Premier Yu <unk> @-@ kun ordered various government agencies fully prepare for the typhoon , including the activation of a disaster contingency system . The typhoon caused the Taiwan Stock Exchange to close at its lowest level of the year , before the exchange was closed during the storm 's passage . Officials also closed schools and government buildings in Taipei , and flights between northern and southern Taiwan were canceled . The typhoon caused a boat race to be delayed by one day . Passing north of Taiwan , Sinlaku dropped about 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) of rainfall in the capital city of Taipei . A station in Ilan County reported a peak rainfall of 387 mm ( 15 @.@ 2 in ) . The high rainfall filled two reservoirs to capacity , both of which had low levels in the previous month . The storm left 200 houses without water , and in Taoyuan County ( now Taoyuan City ) , 700 houses lost power . Storm damage forced about 1 @,@ 500 people to evacuate their houses . High waves lashed the island 's northern coast , forcing hundreds of boats to remain at port . This included thousands of Chinese fishermen who stayed in special shelters , which represented a change in policy ; in previous storms Taiwan officials did not allow Chinese fishermen to stay for fear of Chinese emigration to the island . Sinlaku killed two people , one who was swept away by high surf along Taiwan 's east coast . However , damage was minor on the island , limited to downed tree branches in Taipei . After the storm , Taiwan residents complained that meteorologists over @-@ emphasized the threat of the storm , which was due to heavy damage from typhoons Nari and Toraji . 
 The threat of Typhoon Sinlaku prompted 640 @,@ 000 people in eastern China to evacuate , including 48 @,@ 000 people near Wenzhou who worked on aquaculture farms . About 100 @,@ 000 troops were put on standby before the storm struck to assist in its aftermath . Eight flights were canceled due to the storm . Upon making landfall , the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall along its path , including a 24 ‑ hour total of 215 mm ( 8 @.@ 5 in ) where it moved ashore . Several cities reported over 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in a 12 ‑ hour period . The rainfall caused the Huangpu River to rise to above @-@ normal levels , which prompted officials to close 1 @,@ 000 floodgates to prevent flooding in Shanghai . In Wenzhou , Sinlaku produced a peak wind gust of 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) , which was the highest gust in the city on record . High waves just south of the city , estimated at 16 @.@ 2 m ( 53 ft ) , wrecked five fishing piers and a large boat . Typhoon @-@ force wind gusts were observed along the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces . About 58 @,@ 000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the two provinces ; this included 3 @,@ 800 destroyed houses in Wenzhou where the storm struck .

 = Anole ( comics ) = 
 Anole ( Victor Borkowski ) is a fictional mutant superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . He was created by Christina Weir and Nunzio DeFilippis and first appeared in issue # 2 of New Mutants vol . 2 ( August 2003 ) . A student at the Xavier Institute and junior member of the X @-@ Men , Anole is one of the few openly gay characters in the Marvel Universe . His reptilian mutation grants him superhuman abilities including <unk> , a prehensile tongue , and adaptive camouflage . 
 Initially a supporting character in New Mutants vol . 2 and its relaunched title , New X @-@ Men : Academy X , Weir and DeFilippis intended for the character to commit suicide early in the series after coming out as gay and finding himself rejected by his family and friends . According to the writers , the story was to serve as a message about intolerance . Marvel editors scrapped the story due to concerns about the controversy it might generate . The storyline was rewritten and the character survived . He since became a fan favorite and began to be featured regularly throughout the series and as a main character in subsequent X @-@ Men @-@ related titles , including New X @-@ Men and the short @-@ lived Young X @-@ Men . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Victor Borkowski first appears in New Mutants vol . 2 # 2 in August 2003 . Christina Weir and Nunzio DeFilippis originally wrote a storyline for New Mutants that was to take place between issues 8 and 10 . The plot involved Victor committing suicide after coming out as gay and being rejected by his parents and his friends , serving as " a powerful message about what intolerance can do to people . " Due to the controversial subject matter , the storyline was dropped , with Victor coming from an accepting family and hometown . 
 Despite only rare initial appearances as a supporting character , Victor developed a fan following . Victor was given the codename " Anole " / <unk> / a kind of lizard frequently and incorrectly known as an American chameleon , after it was suggested to Weir and DeFilippis by a fan via a post on their forum . He continued to make numerous appearances during Craig Kyle and Chris Yost 's run on New X @-@ Men ( 2nd Series ) , having a more active role in the plots than most of the other background characters . 
 Anole was featured as a main character beginning in New X @-@ Men vol . 2 # 37 , illustrated by comic book artist <unk> Young . He was later added to the New X @-@ Men as a teammate . Anole was a " pretty early pick " for new additions to the team , according to Yost , who felt that Anole had a decent set of abilities and represented " a kind of level @-@ headed , good , normal kid . " Additionally , Yost and Kyle felt adding Anole and the character Pixie to the New X @-@ Men team gave the roster " tonal balance " and the opportunity to slightly " twist and warp " the characters through darker events to come in the series . While alluded to since his first main appearances in the franchise and confirmed off @-@ panel during their run by <unk> and Weir and in Marvel character profiles , it was during this series in New X @-@ Men ( 2nd Series ) # 43 that Anole 's gay identity was stated and dealt with explicitly on @-@ panel for the first time . 
 When the series ended , Anole was featured in a vignette entitled " Blend In " written and illustrated by Young in X @-@ Men : Divided We Stand # 1 . The story explored the effects of the darker events in Yost and Kyle 's run on younger characters such as Anole , Young feeling that younger characters were often improperly characterized like mature adults in how they dealt with large , traumatic events in comic series . He described his decision to illustrate and write about Anole as " a natural choice " and that he wanted to flesh out his previously unknown backstory , claiming that drawing Anole for a year during his time on New X @-@ Men allowed him to understand the character . In developing Anole 's backstory , Young also established the character 's hometown as his own — Fairbury , Illinois . Young added that he chose to write Anole 's divestment from the X @-@ Men at the conclusion of the story in a way that would allow him to explore more of the character 's future decisions and experiences at another time . Anole would later reappear as a team member in the main cast of Young X @-@ Men as of Young X @-@ Men # 6 and as a supporting character in X @-@ Men franchise crossover events such as X @-@ Men : Manifest Destiny , Secret Invasion : X @-@ Men , and X @-@ Men : Nation X.

 Victor Borkowski is a sixteen @-@ year @-@ old mutant born and raised in Fairbury , Illinois , a small , typical American town in which he lives a normal life despite his reptilian features . The close @-@ knit community accepts him for who he is until anti @-@ mutant sentiment begins to spread . For his own safety , his parents send him to the Xavier Institute where he quickly excels academically . 
 When the advisor system is set up at the Xavier Institute , Victor chooses Karma as his advisor and is given the code name Anole . During the formation of training squads throughout the school , he is reassigned to Northstar 's Alpha Squadron where he serves as the squad leader . At first , he is depicted as close friends with fellow student Julian Keller and the other students in the <unk> Squadron , but later becomes closer to his teammates . He is especially close to his mentor Northstar , who helps him to come to terms with his sexuality . Anole is deeply affected by Northstar 's death , stating that Northstar understood him and was important as a figure he could confide in .

 Anole is one of only 27 students at the Institute who does not lose his mutant powers in the aftermath of House of M , also known as Decimation or " M @-@ Day . " The squad system is dissolved and the remaining students are merged into one group . Shortly afterward , Emma Frost sets up an all @-@ out brawl amongst the remaining students to determine who will become the new team of X @-@ Men trainees ( dubbed the " New X @-@ Men " ) ; Victor is not selected for the squad , but remains at the school . When a resurrected and brainwashed Northstar returns with his sister Aurora and attacks the Institute , Anole finds him and is able to temporarily snap him out of the mind control set in place by the Children of the Vault . Anole 's joy at seeing his former mentor is short @-@ lived , as Northstar returns to his mind @-@ controlled status and knocks him out . The school is later attacked by Reverend William Stryker and his army of mutant @-@ exterminating Purifiers . This results in a bus full of Anole 's classmates being killed and the murder of other friends at the school .

 During the New X @-@ Men story arc " The Quest for Magik , " Anole and his classmates are sucked down into the dimension of Limbo by the demon Belasco . They are soon attacked by a large group of demons , and Anole takes charge , rallying the students around the defenseless Blindfold , only to have his right arm severed at the shoulder by a demon . Later he is trapped in stone by the machinations of <unk> as she attempts to create a powerful <unk> from Pixie 's soul . Anole manages to break himself free and stop <unk> from completing the process , saving Pixie . Anole then finds that he has generated a larger and stronger reptilian arm replacing the one he lost , a previously unknown aspect of his mutation . The arm itself is <unk> , resembling his scalp , with razor sharp claws . After helping to defeat Belasco , Anole and Pixie are made members of the New X @-@ Men squad on recommendation of Rockslide , who threatens to quit if they are not appointed to the team . 
 Rockslide and X @-@ 23 later try to convince Anole to cut off his other arm in order to generate a stronger replacement . When he refuses , Rockslide calls him a sissy , which Anole finds offensive enough for him to reveal his sexual identity to Rockslide and attack him . Rockslide apologizes , swearing that he did not know . Later , in a misguided attempt at group bonding , Rockslide voices his acceptance of Anole 's sexuality , outing him to some of the other students , though Loa states that she was already aware and that everyone already knew . 
 As a member of the New X @-@ Men , Anole takes part in various missions with the team , including the events leading up to X @-@ Men : Messiah Complex and through to its conclusion when Cyclops officially closes the school and disbands the X @-@ Men . With the school closed , Anole returns to his family in Fairbury , Illinois .

 A vignette in the two @-@ part series Divided We Stand explored the after @-@ effects of Anole 's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during his return to his hometown . Northstar , now rehabilitated , is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole , who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute . Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house , unhappy to see his former mentor . At first , Northstar makes jokes , thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen . Anole explains that his town accepts him for who he is and that his problems come from Northstar , along with the other X @-@ Men , for providing the students under their care with a poor education , stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger , and then throwing them away by disbanding . Planning to run away , Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the face — similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past — and tells him to tell all of the former New X @-@ Men not to come looking for him .

 Dani Moonstar personally recruits Anole to the Young X @-@ Men team by visiting him at his new home . Anole is still apprehensive , maintaining his views from Divided We Stand , but is persuaded to join the team when Dani tells him that the X @-@ Men have relocated to San Francisco , California , " a place renowned for its tolerance of mutants and ... other minorities , " a reference to Anole 's gay identity . Moving to San Francisco , he engages in various missions with the Young X @-@ Men , including assisting during the Skrull invasion of San Francisco . 
 When his teammate Dust dies from a hidden medical condition brought on by her fight with Magma , Anole once again voices his opinions about leaving the team as they are constantly put in danger with mortal consequences . Dust is revived by teammate Ink and she convinces the team not to disband .

 During the Utopia storyline , the X @-@ Men leave their San Francisco base and establish the island " Utopia " for mutants on the remains of Asteroid M. The anthology series Nation X explores the characters ' reactions to this relocation , with Anole featuring in his own story , " Big Boy Pants " . The story depicts Cannonball teaching the younger X @-@ Men how to farm their own crops , but Anole argues that it is a waste of time since they could just buy their food from a store . He looks to Magik for agreement , but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water . Eventually she returns to bring him water , and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson : without their own food supply , the mutant race could die . Magik informs him that this was not a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because she was sick of looking at him . She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming , too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened . He is almost killed by the mutant Sack , who wanted his own corner of Utopia . 
 Anole has a minor appearance in the Nation X story in Uncanny X @-@ Men ; he and the other students grant Rogue their combined powers to battle Predator Xs . He also appears in the miniseries X @-@ Men : Pixie <unk> Back , helping save Pixie and the female New X @-@ Men from the demon <unk> , and the one @-@ shot Cloak and Dagger , in which he supports Dagger after she learns she is not a mutant .

Cannonball chooses Anole for the mission to provide moral support for Pixie , whose teleportation ability they require to travel to Limbo . Anole and Pixie are extremely reluctant to risk themselves for Magik , who they believe does not deserve to be saved , but decide to go because they are heroes . In Limbo , Anole fends off demons and <unk> with Cannonball ; he also takes out his teammate Dazzler when she is corrupted by Limbo 's influence . In the end , Pixie and Anole somewhat resolve their issues with Magik and the team return home .

 = = Sexuality and reception = = 
 Early in the character 's publication history , Anole 's sexual identity was alluded to by his close relationship with his squad mentor Northstar , one of Marvel 's most recognized openly gay superheroes . After Northstar 's " death , " Anole 's conversations with his former mentor Karma , an openly lesbian character , discussed how he felt it was important for him to have someone like Northstar , who " understood him , " to talk to in particular . His sexual orientation was later confirmed by DeFilippis on an online forum , who stated that the dialogue intentionally alluded to this , and was reaffirmed in The X @-@ Men : 198 Files . His sexual orientation continued to be mentioned indirectly , and other allusions included him pointing out that Young Avengers characters Wiccan and Hulkling are gay before being cut off and Anole attacking Rockslide for calling him a " sissy , " Rockslide shouting that he " didn 't know " and that he " shouldn 't be so sensitive . " In the following issue , Anole 's sexuality was officially stated outright for the first time when Rockslide announces , " Anole 's gay ! " in an attempt to quickly get the remaining students to bond with each other by opening up about their secrets . Despite Rockslide 's vocal acceptance of his sexuality , Anole was outraged , though Loa stated that his classmates already knew . 
 Since then , Anole 's sexual orientation has been handled more openly , being directly referred to as " gay . " When discussing further story development of Anole 's sexuality during their run on New X @-@ Men , Yost and Kyle stated that they had no plans to further cover the issue , emphasizing that Anole would be able to work out any issues he had regarding his sexuality or his lack of reconciliation with his former mentor Northstar by covering them off @-@ panel with teammate Rockslide . Anole would later confront a rehabilitated Northstar in the X @-@ Men : Divided We Stand vignette " Blend In , " revealing that contrary to Jean @-@ Paul 's assumptions , he experienced no difficulties being accepted as a mutant or gay from his family or residents of his hometown , and instead experienced posttraumatic stress disorder and a sense of being used and abandoned after his time with the X @-@ Men . 
 During his review of X @-@ Men : Divided We Stand , writer Dustin Christian of For the Love of Comics Reviews expressed pleasant surprise upon realizing Anole 's sexuality and praised writers Yost and Kyle for their handling of the character during their creative run on New X @-@ Men , stating , " It ’ s cool to see a gay character depicted in a non @-@ stereotypical fashion so that their orientation doesn ’ t define everything they do and someone like me wouldn ’ t even know that about them . " 
 In the vignette " Abomination " featured in X @-@ Men : Manifest Destiny , Anole and his Young X @-@ Men teammate Jonas Graymalkin have a talk where Graymalkin discusses his past and reveals that he too is gay and was a victim of a near @-@ fatal homophobic attack at the hands of his father . Anole reassures him that he will be all right and the two form a friendship . Lyle Masaki of Logo 's AfterElton.com expressed interest in this development , stating that , " [ w ] ith the small number of gay superheroes out there , camaraderie between gay characters is as rare as same @-@ sex couples .

 = = Alternate storylines = = 
 A scrapped story plot in New Mutants vol . 2 involved Anole committing suicide after coming out at Parent 's Day and being shunned by his parents and two closest friends , Josh and Julian for his sexual orientation . The storyline was originally written to take place in issues 8 – 10 . 
 The storyline involved Anole 's parents and others becoming outraged when some parents witness his instructor Karma kissing another woman . Anole reacts to his parents ' outrage by defending her and outing himself . Rejected and disowned by his parents , he seeks solace in Josh and Julian , but also finds himself rejected by them . This causes him to commit suicide . The story resulted in Josh discovering Anole 's body while attempting to apologize for his reaction , serving as impetus for him to reform his attitudes while Julian would maintain what would later be revealed to be a facade of indifference . Northstar , as Marvel 's " highest profile homosexual , " would be a key character in pointing out Karma 's difficulties being accepted because of her sexuality by the students ' parents , as well as the absurdity of a gay student killing himself over rejection in a school for outcasts . Weir and DeFilippis stated that in addition to being a message about intolerance , the story would serve as a key factor in redeeming Elixir from his initial introduction as an anti @-@ mutant bigot while solidifying Julian 's character as " cruel " . 
 Though issue 8 was printed and issue 9 drawn , Marvel put a hold on releasing the issues due to the storyline 's controversial nature . Both writers state that ideas to " soft @-@ pedal " the issue were fetched to them , including eliminating Karma 's lesbian kiss , having it off @-@ panel , or Northstar never actually stating his sexual orientation . The writers compromised , depicting the same @-@ sex kiss on @-@ panel and silhouetted . Marvel eventually decided to scrap the issues , intending to release issue 10 as issue 8 . The writers objected , noting that issue 10 featured the school still dealing with Anole 's suicide and would leave Josh 's change in character unexplained . Weir and DeFilippis convinced editors to allow them to write a new story last minute from the artwork of the old storyline and changed the dialogue while removing all references to the suicide and changing the reasons for Josh 's reformation . Weir and DeFilippis later stated that they were happier with losing this plot , as they did not like the direction it would have taken Julian as a character , noting that , " [ t ] he Julian who developed since then is not a guy who 'd have a problem with Victor being gay . In fact , he 'd wipe the walls with anyone who did . " 
 Pink Kryptonite staff writer Megan Parker ( " Elf Girl " ) expressed displeasure with the original storyline and relief with the final changes , stating that , " [ killing ] off a gay character to further a straight character 's development to a ' better human being , ' " was understandable as an intended message about intolerance , but " just a bit overused .

John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout described it as a " musical nod to U2 " and felt that the opening of Lifesong with the song was responsible for the album having a " greater appeal " than Casting Crowns ' debut record . David McCreary of CCM Magazine called the song a " powerhouse praise number " . Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today , however , felt the song was one of the weakest on the album , calling it " predictable " and criticizing what he perceived as imitation of U2 's " Where The Streets Have No Name " and Chris Tomlin 's " Forever " . At the 37th GMA Dove Awards , " Lifesong " was nominated for Song of the Year and Pop / Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year . It did not win in either category .

 = New York State Route 128 = 
 New York State Route 128 ( NY 128 ) is a 5 @.@ 53 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 90 km ) long north – south state highway in northern Westchester County , New York . The route begins at an intersection with NY 22 just west of I @-@ 684 in the hamlet of Armonk . Crossing through downtown Armonk , the route connects to NY 117 in the southern end of the village of Mount Kisco . 
 NY 128 was first constructed during the early 1900s with a pair of contracts handed out by the state of New York , which constructed the new alignment between NY 22 and the triangle junction with NY 117 in Mount Kisco . These segments were both added into the state highway system in 1903 . NY 128 itself was designated in the 1930 renumbering of state highways from Armonk to Mount Kisco . This was extended in the mid @-@ 1930s to connect to the Connecticut state line at <unk> Road . However , in 1970 , the state truncated NY 128 back to NY 22 in Armonk and renumbered the short connector as NY 433 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 128 begins at an intersection with NY 22 ( Armonk – Bedford Road ) , an arterial boulevard , in the hamlet of Armonk ( within the town of North Castle ) . NY 128 proceeds north on Main Street , a two @-@ lane commercial street , intersecting with an old alignment of NY 22 , entering the town center for North Castle , where it maintains the commercial backdrop through town . Passing west of Wampus Brook Park , NY 128 intersects with Old Mount Kisco Road , an old alignment as it leaves the town center . NY 128 soon parallels the park and Wampus Brook on its way north , maintaining the Main Street moniker until an intersection with Old Mount Kisco Road . At that junction , the route becomes Armonk – Mount Kisco Road , making a large bend westward near Al Ehrmann Park . 
 Now running northwest , NY 128 crosses through North Castle as a two @-@ lane residential roadway , paralleling Wrights Mill Road into Wampus Pond County Park . Through the parkland , NY 128 bends northwest , running along the northern edge of the park , and passing Wampus Pond . NY 128 soon enters the town of New Castle , where it changes names to Armonk Road on its way north , remaining a two @-@ lane residential street . The route winds its way north via several bends , soon becoming a wooded roadway through New Castle . Residences remain spacious , paralleling NY 128 into the village of Mount Kisco . Now in Mount Kisco , NY 128 retains the name Armonk Road until a junction with Lexington Avenue , where NY 128 proceeds north on Park Avenue , which intersects with NY 117 ( Main Street ) , where the NY 128 designation ends . 
 = = History = = 
 The roadways that make up a majority of NY 128 through Westchester were upgraded to state highway standards in the early 1900s by local contractors . Designated unsigned State Highway 35 ( SH 35 ) , the southern part of NY 128 from NY 22 and School Street in Armonk , along with a segment of NY 22 to NY 120 . The segment was given a contract on July 22 , 1901 at the cost of $ 26 @,@ 000 ( 1901 USD ) , half of which was paid by the state . The segment was completed and accepted into the state highway system on October 1 , 1903 , over two years after construction began on the 3 @.@ 21 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 17 km ) alignment . 
 The other segment of NY 128 , and the majority of the current road , was designated as SH 50 , running from School Street in Armonk to the current triangle junction with NY 117 in Mount Kisco was also contracted on July 22 , 1901 . This segment , 4 @.@ 44 miles ( 7 @.@ 15 km ) long , came at the cost of $ 38 @,@ 103 @.@ 08 ( 1901 USD ) , which was paid by the state at the total of $ 10 @,@ 051 @.@ 54 . While longer than the other segment , this section of NY 128 was completed and accepted into the state highway system on February 9 , 1903 , eight months prior to SH 35 . 
 NY 128 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . In the mid @-@ 1930s , NY 128 was extended southward to the Connecticut state line by way of an overlap with NY 22 and Greenwich Road . It was truncated back to its current southern terminus in the early 1970s . The former routing of NY 128 south of NY 22 was redesignated as NY 433 .

 = WrestleMania I = 
 WrestleMania ( sequentially known as WrestleMania I ) was the first annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event ( only in selected areas ) , produced by the World Wrestling Federation . It took place on March 31 , 1985 , at Madison Square Garden in New York City . The attendance for the event was 19 @,@ 121 . The event was seen by over one million viewers through closed @-@ circuit television , making it the largest showing of an event on closed @-@ circuit television in the United States at the time . 
 The show consisted of nine professional wrestling matches . In the main event , Hulk Hogan and Mr T defeated Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper . Also , Wendi Richter ( accompanied by manager Cyndi Lauper ) defeated Leilani Kai to win the WWF Women 's Championship , and Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik defeated The U.S. Express ( Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham ) to win the WWF Tag Team Championship .

 During the 1980s , Vince McMahon 's World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) ' s main competition in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions . McMahon countered Jim Crockett 's successful Starrcade pay @-@ per @-@ view , which began airing in 1983 , by creating the WrestleMania franchise . 
 For the first WrestleMania , Vince McMahon began cross promoting with MTV , which aired two wrestling specials . The first one was The Brawl to End It All , aired on July 23 , 1984 , in which a match from a live Madison Square Garden broadcast was shown on MTV . Wendi Richter defeated The Fabulous Moolah to win the WWF Women 's Championship on the card , with Cyndi Lauper on her side . At The War to Settle the Score , which aired on February 18 , 1985 , Leilani Kai , accompanied by Moolah , defeated Richter , again accompanied by Lauper , to win the Women 's Championship . Aside from Lauper , other celebrities also appeared during the buildup to and at the event ; most notably Muhammad Ali , Liberace ( with the The Rockettes ) and Major League Baseball manager Billy Martin all appeared during the main event . 
 Two other championships were also defended at WrestleMania : the WWF Intercontinental Championship and the WWF World Tag Team Championship . Prior to the event , Greg Valentine had feuded with Tito Santana over the belt . Valentine defeated Santana on September 24 , 1984 for the championship . Mike Rotunda and Barry Windham won the WWF Tag Team Championship three months before WrestleMania from the team of Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch . 
 In the months leading up to the first WrestleMania , Roddy Piper began a talk @-@ show segment on WWF television entitled " Piper 's Pit " . On one episode of the show , he hit Jimmy Snuka over the head with a coconut , leading to a feud between the two men . As part of the storyline , Piper recruited Bob Orton to be his bodyguard . On another episode of Piper 's Pit , Piper spoke out against the burgeoning Rock ' n ' Wrestling connection , which led to a confrontation with Hulk Hogan . In February 1985 , the two men faced each other at The War to Settle the Score , where Hogan won by disqualification after interference by Paul Orndorff and Mr. T. Their on @-@ going feud led to their match at WrestleMania . 
 As part of the promotion for the event , Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania , where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock — a move that cuts off the flow of blood to the brain . Belzer , however , fell to the floor unconscious and began to bleed profusely . His injury required eight stitches . Belzer later sued Hogan for $ 5 million , but they eventually settled out of court . The night before WrestleMania , Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event .

 Gene Okerlund opened the event by singing " The Star Spangled Banner . " The originally intended singer , a celebrity guest that Okerlund and Vince McMahon refused to name , failed to appear . 
 The first match was between Tito Santana and The Executioner ( Buddy Rose ) . Santana won the match after applying a figure four leglock on The Executioner . Following the match , King Kong Bundy , accompanied by Jimmy Hart and Special Delivery Jones ( Conrad Efraim ) , made their way to the ring . After crushing his opponent against the turnbuckle and landing on him stomach @-@ first , Bundy pinned Jones . The WWF 's official time for the match is a then @-@ record time of nine seconds ( a record since surpassed by The Rock defeating Erick Rowan at WrestleMania 32 ) , although the match actually lasted closer to 24 seconds . 
 The next match was between Ricky Steamboat and Matt Borne . Steamboat took the early advantage in the match @-@ up , until Borne flipped him over and slammed him to the mat using a belly @-@ to @-@ belly suplex . After performing a flying crossbody Steamboat pinned Borne for the win . After the match ended , David Sammartino , accompanied by his father Bruno Sammartino , and Brutus Beefcake , accompanied by Johnny Valiant , made their way to the ring . The action favoured both contestants , as each wrestler alternated having the advantage . After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the ring , Valiant lifted him up and slammed him to the cement floor . He then pushed Sammartino back into the ring before being attacked by Bruno . A short while later , all four men began fighting in the ring , and the match ended in a no @-@ contest . 
 The first championship defense of WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine , who was accompanied to the ring by his manager Jimmy Hart . Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position , performing headbutts and punches on Valentine . As the action went back and forth , Hart climbed on the ring apron , where Valentine accidentally hit him . Later , Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with his feet on the ropes for leverage , which is an illegal maneuver . As a result , Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee what had happened and the match was restarted . Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count @-@ out as Valentine failed to re @-@ enter the ring . Valentine , however , kept his title as titles do not change hands through count @-@ out . 
 The following match was for the WWF Tag Team Championship . Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik , accompanied to the ring by Freddie Blassie , challenged the reigning champions , The U.S. Express ( Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham ) , who were accompanied by Lou Albano . The U.S. Express dominated the early part of the match until Volkoff and The Sheik began to gain the offensive advantage over Rotundo . Rotundo then tagged in Windham , who performed a bulldog on The Sheik . After nearly being pinned , The Sheik hit Windham in the head with Blassie 's cane as the referee had his back turned . After Volkoff got the pin , Volkoff and The Sheik were crowned as the new tag champions . 
 = = = Main events = = = 
 The next match on the card was a $ 15 @,@ 000 Body Slam Challenge between André the Giant and Big John Studd , who was accompanied by Bobby Heenan . The stipulation of the match was that André the Giant had to body slam Studd to win $ 15 @,@ 000 , and if he failed , he would be forced to retire . After beginning the match in the defensive position , André countered with chops and a headbutt . From then on André controlled the match and after weakening Studd 's knees with multiple kicks , André was able to lift Studd over his shoulders and execute a body slam to win the match . After André collected his prize money , he started throwing the money out to the audience . Heenan , however , grabbed the bag holding the remainder of the winnings and ran from ringside . As a result of the match , André was able to continue his career and his WWF undefeated streak was unscathed . 
 After all the men had left ringside , it was time for the WWF Women 's Championship match between Wendi Richter , managed by singer Cyndi Lauper ( with her manager David Wolfe ) , and Leilani Kai , managed by former champion The Fabulous Moolah . Shortly after the match began , Moolah grabbed Richter as she was outside on the floor , but Lauper saved her from an attack . Kai then performed a flying crossbody from the top rope , but Richter used Kai 's momentum to roll @-@ up Kai in a pinning position . With this pin , Richter became the new Women 's Champion . 
 The main event and last match of the night pitted Hulk Hogan , the reigning WWF Champion , and Mr. T , accompanied by Jimmy Snuka , against Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff , accompanied by Bob Orton . Professional boxer Muhammad Ali was the special guest referee ( on the outside of the ring ) , New York Yankees manager Billy Martin was the guest ring announcer while Liberace ( accompanied by The Rockettes ) was the guest time keeper . First , Piper , Orndorff , and Orton made their way to the ring as drums and bagpipes played , causing the crowd to boo . Crowd favorites Hogan , Mr. T , and Snuka made their way to the ring next . The match began with Mr. T and Piper in the ring and the two traded blows . Mid @-@ way through the match , all four men began brawling in the ring , and Muhammad Ali punched Piper in an attempt to restore order . After the match 's order was restored , Orndorff and Piper had the offensive advantage . As Orndorff locked Hogan into a full nelson , Orton climbed the top rope to attempt to knock out Hogan . Instead , Orton mistakenly hit Orndorff , and Hogan pinned him to win the match . In frustration , Piper knocked out the in @-@ ring official , Pat Patterson before he and Orton retreated backstage leaving Orndorff alone in the ring with Hogan , Mr T and Snuka .

 Approximately three months after WrestleMania , on July 6 , 1985 , Greg Valentine lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Tito Santana in a cage match . At about the same time , Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik lost the WWF Tag Team Championship back to The U.S. Express . They held the title until August , when the team of Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine , later known as the Dream Team , became the new champions . 
 After André the Giant defeated Big John Studd at the event , Studd formed a tag team with King Kong Bundy , and the duo faced André and Hulk Hogan on a number of occasions . Later , the team of Studd and Bundy teamed up in Handicap matches — a two against one wrestling match — against André , which renewed the feud between André and Studd . 
 In late 1985 , Wendi Richter lost her WWF Women 's Championship in controversial fashion . She wrestled a masked female wrestler known as The Spider Lady , who pinned Richter to win the title . After the match , the Spider Lady was revealed as the Fabulous Moolah . This finish was a screwjob , i.e. one participant ( in this case Richter ) was unaware of the planned title change . Richter left the WWF shortly after , and Moolah held the title for approximately two years . 
 In a new storyline after WrestleMania , Roddy Piper began training Bob Orton as a boxer . Hulk Hogan accepted a challenge on the behalf of Mr. T to face Orton in a match on the February 15 , 1986 edition of Saturday Night 's Main Event . After Mr. T won the match , Orton and Piper attacked him , leading to a boxing match at WrestleMania 2 between Piper and Mr. T. At the second annual WrestleMania , Piper was disqualified in the Fourth round .

To appease angry fans who pelted the screen with garbage , WrestleMania was broadcast in its entirety on local ABC affiliate WTAE @-@ TV two weeks later . 
 WWF announcer Gene Okerlund sang " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " , and Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura called the action . Okerlund also did interviews backstage , and Alfred Hayes did interviews near the entrance to the locker room , right outside the ring . Howard Finkel was the ring announcer . The opening theme for the event was the instrumental portion of the Phil Collins and Philip Bailey hit " Easy Lover " , while the closing theme for the credits was " Axel F " by Harold Faltermeyer . Celebrity guests in attendance included Billy Martin , Cyndi Lauper , Mr. T , Muhammad Ali , and Liberace accompanied by The Rockettes .

 John Powell of Slam ! Wrestling rated the event as average , citing that it " wasn 't the greatest ... " . Despite his overall rating , he praised several moments , including Orton hitting Orndorff with his cast , King Kong Bundy 's win , and André the Giant throwing the money into the crowd . Powell , however , listed Mr. T wrestling as his least favorite moment of the pay @-@ per @-@ view . He claimed the main event match , in which Mr. T took part , was humorous despite its lack of technical wrestling . 
 In contrast , Pro Wrestling Illustrated awarded the main event match its annual PWI Match of the Year honor . The event was also included in a July 2007 special that aired on the MSG Network titled " The 50 Greatest Moments at Madison Square Garden " , ranking at # 30 . In the December 2002 issue of Wrestling Digest , the main event match @-@ up was listed as number five in the most memorable twenty @-@ five matches of the past twenty @-@ five years . Echoing John Powell 's thoughts , Kevin Eck of Wrestling Digest stated , " The match itself was far from a technical @-@ wrestling classic , but it delivered in terms of entertaining the crowd . " In another Wrestling Digest article , written by Keith Loria , the main event was ranked third in the top ten matches in WrestleMania history . In contrast to Powell , Loria believed that Mr. T " proved to be an adequate <unk> " .

 = Nino Bixio @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Nino Bixio class was a pair of protected cruisers built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1910s . The two ships , Nino Bixio , and Marsala , were built in Castellammare between 1911 and 1914 . They were intended to serve as scouts for the main Italian fleet , and as such required a high top speed . They were overweight as built , which prevented them from reaching their intended maximum speed . They were a disappointment in service , especially compared to the earlier — and faster — cruiser Quarto , which cut their careers short . 
 Both ships saw limited action during World War I , largely a result of the cautious strategies employed by the Regia Marina and its opponent , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . Nino Bixio was involved in the pursuit of a group of Austro @-@ Hungarian raiders in December 1915 , but did not engage them before they escaped . Marsala briefly battled Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917 . Both ships were sold for scrapping in the late 1920s , the victims of very tight naval budgets and their own poor performance .

 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships of the Nino Bixio class were designed as fleet scouts by Engineering Captain Giuseppe Rota , along similar lines to the cruiser Quarto . The ships were 131 @.@ 4 meters ( 431 ft ) long at the waterline and 140 @.@ 3 m ( 460 ft ) long overall . They had a beam of 13 m ( 43 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 1 m ( 13 ft ) . The ships displaced 3 @,@ 575 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 519 long tons ; 3 @,@ 941 short tons ) and up to 4 @,@ 141 t ( 4 @,@ 076 long tons ; 4 @,@ 565 short tons ) at full load . The ships were fitted with a pair of pole masts equipped with spotting tops located at the forward and aft conning tower . Their crew consisted 13 officers and 283 enlisted men . The Nino Bixio @-@ class ships were only lightly armored , with a 38 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) thick deck , and 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick plating on their forward conning tower . 
 = = = Propulsion system = = = 
 The ships ' propulsion system consisted of three Curtiss steam turbines , each driving a screw propeller . Steam was provided by fourteen mixed coal and oil firing Blechynden boilers that were trunked into four funnels ; the first two were closely spaced just aft of the foremast and the other two were farther spaced further aft . The engines were rated for 22 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 16 @,@ 800 kW ) which should have given the ships a top speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) , but neither ship reached that speed in service owing to their being overweight . Nino Bixio 's engines reached 23 @,@ 000 shp ( 17 @,@ 000 kW ) for a top speed of 26 @.@ 82 kn ( 49 @.@ 67 km / h ; 30 @.@ 86 mph ) , while Marsala was slightly faster at 27 @.@ 66 kn ( 51 @.@ 23 km / h ; 31 @.@ 83 mph ) at the same horsepower ; both ships were a disappointment , especially compared to the older but faster Quarto . The Nino Bixio @-@ class ships had a range of 1 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ; 1 @,@ 600 mi ) at a cruising speed of 13 kn ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships were armed with a main battery of six 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 50 guns mounted singly . Two were placed side by side forward , with the other four located on the centerline , two amidships and two in a superfiring pair aft of the mainmast . The guns were the Pattern EE type , the same type employed as secondary guns on the dreadnought battleships of the Dante Alighieri and Conte di Cavour classes , and were manufactured by Armstrong Whitworth . They were 3 @.@ 35 @-@ metric @-@ ton ( 3 @.@ 30 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 3 @.@ 69 @-@ short @-@ ton ) guns that fired a 22 @.@ 5 @-@ kilogram ( 50 lb ) projectile at a muzzle velocity of 860 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ) , at a rate of 6 shots per minute . The ships were also equipped with six 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 50 guns , the same Pattern <unk> type guns used on the Italian dreadnoughts , which provided close range defense . These guns weighed 1 @.@ 14 t ( 1 @.@ 12 long tons ; 1 @.@ 26 short tons ) and fired 5 @.@ 6 kg ( 12 lb ) and 7 kg ( 15 lb ) shells at 815 m / s ( 2 @,@ 670 ft / s ) . They had a rate of fire of 15 shells per minute . They were also armed with two 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes submerged in the hull . The ships were also fitted with equipment to store and launch 200 naval mines .

 Italy had initially declared neutrality at the start of World War I , despite having been allied to Germany and Austria @-@ Hungary . By May 1915 , the Triple Entente had convinced the Italian government to enter the war against their erstwhile allies . The main Italian fleet was kept at the southern end of the Adriatic , at Brindisi , and in the Mediterranean , at Taranto , where it would be safe from Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boats . The Austro @-@ Hungarians , meanwhile , employed a fleet in being strategy while conducting raids with small craft and U @-@ boats . For the duration of the war , Nino Bixio and Marsala were stationed at Brindisi , where they could quickly respond to Austro @-@ Hungarian raids . In December 1915 , Nino Bixio and several other warships , including British cruisers , sortied in response to an Austro @-@ Hungarian attack on transports supplying the Serbian Army through Albania . Nino Bixio pursued the cruiser SMS Helgoland before the latter escaped under cover of darkness . 
 Marsala saw action during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917 , though Nino Bixio did not have steam up in her boilers when the Austro @-@ Hungarians attacked , so she was unable to join her sister ship . Marsala briefly clashed with the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers before Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton , the Italian commander , broke off the engagement following the arrival of the powerful Austro @-@ Hungarian armored cruiser SMS Sankt Georg . The <unk> and funding cuts that followed the end of the war in 1918 continued into the 1920s for the Regia Marina , and disposing of the two Nino Bixio class ships , which had never met design expectations , was an easy means to trim the naval budget . Nino Bixio and Marsala were stricken from the naval register in March 1929 and November 1927 , respectively , and were subsequently sold for scrap . 
 = Vere Bird , Jr . = 
 Vere Bird , Jr . ( c . 1937 - 31 March 2013 ) was an Antiguan lawyer and politician who served as chairman of the Antigua Labour Party ( ALP ) and a government minister . He is the son of Vere Bird , the former Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda , and brother of Lester Bird , who later held the same position . 
 Bird entered politics in 1981 . Three years later he was elected to the House of Representatives and became Minister of Aviation , Public Information and Public Utilities . As minister , Bird conducted a purchase deal for Dominican water before being made Minister of Public Works and Communications on 1 January 1987 . In this role , he oversaw the reconstruction of V. C. Bird International Airport , which was the subject of controversy after it was discovered that he had granted a contract for the construction of a new runway to a company in which he was a shareholder . This led to conflict within the ALP , but Bird remained a minister . He was later fired after a scandal in which Israeli weapons , sold to Antigua and Barbuda , were found in the hands of the Medellín Cartel of Colombian drug smugglers – it was discovered that the weapons had been transferred at Bird 's instruction , and a report by Sir Louis Blom @-@ Cooper recommended that he be prohibited from holding public office again . 
 Despite this decision , Bird returned to government on 15 May 1996 as Minister of Science , Technology and Communications , with a transfer to the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Business Development following the 1999 general election . In 2000 , he became Minister of Agriculture , Lands and Fisheries ; in this role , he negotiated an end to the Antiguan boycott of agricultural goods from Trinidad and Tobago . The ALP lost the 2004 general election and were replaced by a United Progressive Party government under Baldwin Spencer . Bird remained involved in politics , and along with six other senior ALP members was arrested in 2009 after an unauthorised May Day rally . The seven politicians were found guilty of public order offences , although the trial was delayed following a seizure suffered by Bird . He suffered two more seizures in 2010 , after the completion of the trial , and died on 31 March 2013 of heart failure . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Bird , the eldest son of Premier Vere Bird , first entered politics in 1981 when he served as an unelected security official during the general election . In the following election in 1984 , Bird and his brother Lester were both elected to the House of Representatives after the Antigua Labour Party , led by their father , took 16 of the 17 House seats . Bird himself was victorious over George Walter , leader of the Progressive Labour Movement and former Premier of Antigua and Barbuda , gaining 912 votes to Walter 's 358 . Upon election , with his father as Prime Minister , he was given the Ministry of Aviation , Public Information and Public Utilities . As Minister he visited Dominica at the head of a four @-@ person delegation that was dispatched to reach a deal on selling Antigua and Barbuda , a country lacking natural supplies , water . This business was concluded on 16 July 1984 , when it was announced that Dominica would sell Antigua and Barbuda 2 million gallons of water every 10 days , at a cost of around 3 US dollars per thousand gallons . 
 A cabinet reshuffle on 1 January 1987 saw Bird replaced by Robin Yearwood as Minister of Aviation , Public Information and Public Utilities and becoming instead Minister of Public Works and Communications . This followed controversy over Bird 's construction of a new airport , which the opposition charged was " grossly inflated " in cost ; retired Grenadian judge Sir Archibald <unk> was appointed to investigate the project and look for signs of wrongdoing . The independent investigation concluded that Bird had been incorrect in his funding of the project , particularly in granting the contract to build the runway to a company in which he was a shareholder . This scandal threatened to topple the government , with eight ministers , including Bird 's brother Lester , arguing that the Prime Minister should fire him . 
 This scandal led to the Labour Party splitting into two distinct factions , one led by the Prime Minister and one led by Lester Bird . Despite a general election not being due until 1989 , there was widespread speculation that it would be called early . Despite this , no election was called until 9 March 1989 , when the ALP were again victorious . With the Prime Minister delegating most of his work due to his advancing age , and instead spending time with his 27 @-@ year @-@ old companion , the election was seen as a struggle for power between Bird and his brother Lester . Although Lester had long been the frontrunner with most powers delegated to him , Bird , described in The Guardian as " a more single @-@ minded , figure , long resentful at being over @-@ shadowed by his sibling " , was still seen as a close competitor – one with control of the nation 's army . After the election , both Bird brothers retained their respective positions in the Cabinet , but with the Prime Minister 's health getting worse , the struggle continued . 
 = = Scandal and firing = = 
 Bird 's career in the Cabinet was ended by scandal in 1990 after a shipment of Israeli weapons to Antigua and Barbuda were received and then diverted to the Medellín Cartel of Colombian drug dealers . The scandal broke after the Colombian government publicly complained about the use of Antigua and Barbuda as a trans @-@ shipment point ; a diplomatic note from the Israeli government revealed that the weapons had been shipped at the apparent express instruction of Bird , who had given assurances that they would not be passed on to any third parties . The guns were actually ordered as part of a conspiracy by Maurice <unk> and Yair Klein , who forged documents showing that <unk> was an authorised representative of the Antiguan government and that the purchase of weapons had been approved by the Antiguan Minister for National Security , though that position did not exist . The plan was to set up a mercenary training camp on Antigua in order to train and supply Gonzalo Rodríguez <unk> 's Medellin forces . The Prime Minister repeatedly refused to open an investigation , despite demands by community leaders and members of his own government , saying that " conclusive evidence " was needed . An investigation was finally ordered on 25 April , with Bird asking to be temporarily relieved of his position until the inquiry concluded . 
 The inquiry was run by Sir Louis Blom @-@ Cooper ; Bird was formally fired as a Cabinet minister on 10 May , the day Blom @-@ Cooper arrived on Antigua . Blom @-@ Cooper began work on 4 June , with Bird retaining a team of six lawyers for his defence ; the inquiry , concluded in November , recommended banning Bird from holding public office for the rest of his life . The report was acted on and Bird was banned from becoming a minister again , although he retained his seat in the House . The report did not , however , recommend that Bird be forced to resign from the House or prosecuted criminally ; it was felt that the public ridicule the guilty parties had been subjected to was punishment enough . Bird was later re @-@ hired by the government , not as a Minister but as a special advisor to the Prime Minister on the subject of Public Utilities . After the Prime Minister finally retired and Lester became Antigua and Barbuda 's leader on 5 September 1995 , Bird was made Chairman of the ALP . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Despite Blom @-@ Cooper 's recommendations that Bird never be allowed to hold public office again and strong opposition disapproval , he was made Minister of Science , Technology and Communications in a cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 1996 . He soon found himself at odds with the Prime Minister ; after the government announced plans to evict Thomas Bufton and his wife from Guiana Island , where they had lived for 32 years , in order to build a tourist resort , Bird began serving as the <unk> ' lawyer . A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird 's law offices , during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997 ; this followed Bird speaking up for the <unk> ' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to evict them , using force if necessary . Bufton was later acquitted of attempted murder , but still evicted . 
 Following the ALP 's victory in the 1999 general election , Bird was again appointed to the Cabinet , this time as Minister of Trade , Industry and Business Development . By July 2000 , he had become Minister of Agriculture , Lands and Fisheries ; in this role , he held talks with fishermen over the dumping of dredged material in the ocean and signed a trade agreement with Trinidad and Tobago to end a year @-@ long ban on the import of Trinidadian produce . 
 = = Time in opposition = = 
 The ALP government lost the 2004 election , with the United Progressive Party under Baldwin Spencer taking 14 of the 17 seats in House . A year later , Bird was ousted as Chairman of the ALP and replaced by Molwyn Joseph . Following an unauthorised ALP march on May Day in 2009 to protest the Spencer government , Bird and six other senior ALP figures , including the former Prime Minister , were arrested and charged with public order offences . They pleaded not guilty , but were convicted and fined . This followed severe delays after Bird suffered a seizure during the trial , his third since 2008 . Two more seizures occurred in 2010 , the second on 11 March 2010 in court , where Bird was defending an individual accused of grievous bodily harm . 
 On 31 March 2013 , Bird died of heart failure , a few days after being separately diagnosed with liver cancer . The Antiguan government confirmed that he was to receive a state funeral .

 Bird was the son of Vere Bird , the former Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda , who died on 28 June 1999 . His siblings include Lester , also a former Prime Minister , Ivor , who owns a radio station , Curtis , a lawyer , <unk> , a teacher , and Lisette . Ivor was later found guilty of attempted drug smuggling after being caught with a 25 @-@ pound bag of cocaine at Antigua 's main airport ; he was fined 75 @,@ 000 East Caribbean dollars . Bird 's son , Vere Bird III , was convicted of driving offences in 2006 . 
 = No. 37 Squadron RAAF = 
 No. 37 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) medium tactical airlift squadron . It operates Lockheed Martin C @-@ 130J Hercules aircraft from RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales . The squadron has seen active service flying transport aircraft during World War II , the Vietnam War , the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and the military intervention against ISIL . It has also supported Australian humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world , including Somalia , East Timor , Bali , Papua New Guinea , and the Philippines . 
 The squadron was formed at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , in July 1943 , and equipped with Lockheed C @-@ 60 Lodestars that it operated in Australia , New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies . Towards the end of the war it began flying Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . It became part of No. 86 ( Transport ) Wing , headquartered at RAAF Station Schofields , New South Wales , in 1946 but was disbanded two years later . In response to Australia 's increasing air transport needs during the Vietnam War , the squadron was re @-@ formed at Richmond in February 1966 , and equipped with C @-@ 130E Hercules . It converted to the C @-@ 130J model in 1999 , and between 2006 and 2012 also operated C @-@ 130Hs formerly of No. 36 Squadron . No. 37 Squadron came under the control of a re @-@ formed No. 86 Wing from 1987 until 2010 , when it was transferred to No. 84 Wing . 
 = = Role and equipment = = 
 No. 37 Squadron is currently tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas , transporting troops and cargo , and conducting medical evacuation , search @-@ and @-@ rescue , and airdrop missions . It is located at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales , and controlled by No. 84 Wing , which is part of Air Mobility Group . As of July 2013 , the squadron comprised over 400 personnel organised into four flights of aircrew , an administrative and operational section , and a maintenance section responsible for day @-@ to @-@ day aircraft servicing as well as regular maintenance cycles of six weeks ' duration . Intermediate and heavy maintenance is contracted to Airbus Group Australia Pacific ( airframe ) and <unk> ( engines ) . No. 37 Squadron 's motto is " Foremost " . 
 The squadron operates twelve Lockheed Martin C @-@ 130J Hercules , which entered service in 1999 . The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster , the latter being responsible for the loading , carriage and unloading of cargo and passengers . The C @-@ 130J can carry 19 @,@ 500 kilograms ( 43 @,@ 000 lb ) of cargo , or some 120 passengers . It has a range of over 6 @,@ 800 km ( 4 @,@ 200 miles ) without payload , and is able to operate from short and unsealed airstrips . No. 285 Squadron , also based at Richmond under No. 84 Wing , is equipped with a C @-@ 130J full @-@ flight mission simulator , de @-@ commissioned C @-@ 130 airframes , and other instructional tools , and is responsible for training No. 37 Squadron 's aircrew and maintenance personnel . No. 37 Squadron maintains a detachment of two aircraft at Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates to support operations in the Middle East Region under Operation Accordion . The C @-@ 130Js are expected to remain in RAAF service until 2030 .

 No. 37 ( Transport ) Squadron was formed on 15 July 1943 at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , with a staff of two officers and thirteen airmen . Its inaugural commanding officer , Squadron Leader Neville Hemsworth ( late of No. 34 Squadron ) , arrived on 21 July , and its first aircraft , a single @-@ engined Northrop Delta ( also formerly of No. 34 Squadron ) , was delivered on 2 August . The squadron was allocated the first of a batch of ten twin @-@ engined Lockheed C @-@ 60 Lodestar transports on 23 August . The Delta was written off following an accident on 30 September . By then the squadron 's staff numbered 190 , including forty @-@ five officers . It was declared operational on 11 October 1943 , undertaking regular courier flights across Australia to destinations including Perth , Western Australia ; Darwin and Alice Springs , Northern Territory ; Adelaide , South Australia ; Maryborough , Queensland ; and Launceston , Tasmania . 
 By mid @-@ 1944 , the squadron had expanded its operations to New Guinea , making courier flights to Merauke initially , and later Wewak , Noemfoor and Hollandia . It transferred to Essendon , Victoria , on 1 September . The unit was now one of eight Australian transport squadrons , all of which operated under the control of RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . Their primary duty was supporting the Australian military , though they could also be released for urgent requests by General Douglas MacArthur 's South West Pacific Area headquarters . A Lodestar crashed and burned on takeoff at Merauke on 26 January 1945 but all aboard escaped injury ; it was the only hull loss suffered by the type in Australian service . No. 37 Squadron received its first three Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas the following month , and by the end of March had a complement of eighteen aircraft : nine Dakotas , seven Lodestars , a Douglas DC @-@ 2 , and a de Havilland Tiger Moth . The next month it began operating detachments out of Parafield , South Australia , and Morotai in the Dutch East Indies . On 6 July 1945 , one of the squadron 's Dakotas transported the body of Prime Minister John Curtin from Canberra to Perth for burial . By September 1945 , No. 37 Squadron 's strength was 357 staff , including 111 officers , sixteen Dakotas , two Lodestars , a DC @-@ 2 , and a Tiger Moth . 
 Following the end of hostilities , No. 37 Squadron repatriated former prisoners of war from Singapore to Australia . On 27 July 1946 , it moved to RAAF Station Schofields , New South Wales , where it came under the control of No. 86 ( Transport ) Wing along with Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons , also operating Dakotas . Another unit of No. 86 Wing , No. 486 ( Maintenance ) Squadron , was responsible for servicing the Dakotas . On 30 September 1946 , No. 37 Squadron was assigned the regular courier service to Japan that had previously been flown by No. 36 Squadron , to support the British Commonwealth Occupation Force . In January 1947 , No. 37 Squadron handed over the Japan courier run to No. 38 Squadron , and the following month took over the Lae courier service previously flown by No. 36 Squadron ; the Rabaul courier run was added in April . By the end of 1947 , No. 37 Squadron 's personnel numbered fifty @-@ six , including twenty @-@ four officers , and it had an average of ten Dakotas on strength . The unit was disbanded at Schofields on 24 February 1948 .

 On 27 September 1965 , Minister for Air Peter Howson announced that No. 37 Squadron was to be re @-@ raised to operate twelve Lockheed C @-@ 130E Hercules transport aircraft that had been purchased by the Federal government ; the new aircraft would allow the RAAF to support Australian deployments in South East Asia while continuing to meet its domestic commitments . The squadron was formed at RAAF Base Richmond on 21 February 1966 , under the command of Wing Commander Ron <unk> . It joined No. 36 Squadron , which had been operating C @-@ 130A Hercules since 1958 . No. 486 Squadron , inactive since 1964 , was re @-@ formed at Richmond to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons ; major repairs and upgrades to the C @-@ 130s were the responsibility of No. 2 Aircraft Depot ( later No. 503 Wing ) . As the C @-@ 130E had a longer range and could carry a greater payload than the C @-@ 130A , No. 37 Squadron was generally assigned strategic tasks , while No. 36 Squadron 's responsibilities were primarily tactical in nature . No. 37 Squadron began taking delivery of its C @-@ 130Es in August , and by the end of September its staff numbered eighty @-@ six , including twenty @-@ one officers . In February 1967 , the squadron commenced long @-@ range missions in support of Australian forces in the Vietnam War , including aero @-@ medical evacuations conveying wounded soldiers back to Australia , generally via RAAF Base Butterworth , Malaysia . Initially both C @-@ 130A and E models were employed for such evacuations , but only C @-@ 130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 , as they offered more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia if required . By the end of February 1968 , No. 37 Squadron had a strength of 207 personnel : eighty @-@ five aircrew , including fifty @-@ one officers ; and 122 ground staff , including three officers . The squadron transported the last Australian forces out of Vietnam in December 1972 , following the Federal government 's decision to withdraw from the conflict . 
 As well as participating in military exercises and overseas peacekeeping commitments , the Hercules became a familiar sight in the Southern Pacific after being called on for relief following many natural disasters including tidal waves in New Guinea , cyclones in the Solomons and Tonga , and fires and floods throughout Australia . It played a major role in the evacuation of civilians following Cyclone Tracy in Darwin in 1974 – 75 ; a No. 37 Squadron C @-@ 130E was the first aircraft to touch down in Darwin following the disaster . The squadron contributed eleven aircraft to the relief effort , carrying 4 @,@ 400 passengers and 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 pounds ( 590 @,@ 000 kg ) of cargo . No. 37 Squadron aircraft took part in Operation <unk> , the US @-@ led effort to transport the orphaned children of American servicemen out of Vietnam in April 1975 . Later that month , two of the squadron 's aircraft were assigned to the United Nations ( UN ) to transport supplies throughout South East Asia ; the C @-@ 130s ' Australian roundels were painted over with UN symbols to signify the mission 's neutrality . Commencing operations in May , the aircraft flew supplies into Laos and transported cargo between Thailand , Butterworth , Hong Kong and Singapore , completing ninety @-@ one sorties by the time the mission ended in early June . The Hercules also evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Saigon , South Vietnam , and Phnom Penh , Cambodia , following the end of the Vietnam War . No. 37 Squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup by the Governor General in June 1976 for its performance in 1974 – 75 . 
 In January – February 1979 , two No. 37 Squadron C @-@ 130Es evacuated Australian and other foreign embassy staff from Tehran , shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution . The same year , the squadron began operations with two ex @-@ Qantas Boeing 707s , handing them over to No. 33 Flight ( later No. 33 Squadron ) at the beginning of 1981 . No. 37 Squadron transported the <unk> on John Paul II 's 1986 tour of Australia ; its other unusual cargoes have included a stud bull presented to the Chinese government , kangaroos and sheep to Malaysia , and an exhibition of China 's Entombed Warriors . In February 1987 , the unit again joined No. 36 Squadron , along with No. 33 Squadron , as part of a re @-@ formed No. 86 Wing under the newly established Air Lift Group ( later Air Mobility Group ) . The following year , No. 37 Squadron achieved 200 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours on the Hercules . The Australian public had the experience of flying in the C @-@ 130s when the aircraft were employed by the Federal government to provide transport during the 1989 Australian pilots ' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines . In December 1990 and January 1991 , a detachment of C @-@ 130s from Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia 's naval contribution to the Gulf War . No. 37 Squadron transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation Solace in January 1993 , and provided a shuttle service between Kenya and Somalia during May . No. 486 Squadron was disbanded in October 1998 , having transferred its C @-@ 130 maintenance functions to Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons . No. 37 Squadron began re @-@ equipping with new @-@ model C @-@ 130J Hercules in September 1999 . Its aircraft formed part of a detachment of C @-@ 130s supporting INTERFET forces in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000 , under Operation Warden . The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001 , the same year it took delivery of its twelfth and final C @-@ 130J . Five C @-@ 130s of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the Bali bombings in October 2002 . 
 In September 2004 , aircraft from No. 37 Squadron joined the rotating detachment of C @-@ 130s established by No. 36 Squadron in the Middle East Area of Operations ( MEAO ) in February 2003 , following the invasion of Iraq ; the C @-@ 130Js were required to be fitted with self @-@ protection equipment before deploying to the MEAO . No. 37 Squadron was strengthened to create a " super squadron " on 17 November 2006 , when its force of twelve C @-@ 130Js was augmented by No. 36 Squadron 's twelve C @-@ 130Hs , prior to the latter re @-@ equipping with Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemasters and relocating to RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland . Two of the C @-@ 130s joined DHC @-@ 4 Caribous from No. 38 Squadron as part of the RAAF 's initial contribution to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007 . No. 37 Squadron took over full responsibility for the Hercules detachment to the MEAO in mid @-@ 2008 , and in March 2010 one of its C @-@ 130Js completed the detachment 's 20,000th hour of flying operations . The squadron was transferred from No. 86 Wing to No. 84 Wing on 1 October 2010 , as part of a restructure of Air Lift Group . It was presented with the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency in 2011 at a ceremony on 31 May 2012 . The C @-@ 130Hs were retired the same year , the last pair at Richmond on 30 November . In January 2013 , No. 37 Squadron undertook a successful search @-@ and @-@ rescue mission for Alain Delord , a missing round @-@ the @-@ world yachtsman who was found approximately 500 nautical miles ( 930 km ) south of Tasmania . Crews located Delord adrift in a life raft before airdropping supplies , maintaining watch and ultimately guiding in a rescue vessel fifty @-@ eight hours later . 
 No. 37 Squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency in March 2013 . It celebrated its 70th Anniversary on 17 July , undertaking a two @-@ ship flight over Sydney and the Blue Mountains . That November , the squadron deployed to the Philippines to participate in humanitarian relief operations in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan . In August 2014 , aircraft from No. 37 Squadron based in the Middle East were involved in the airdrop of humanitarian supplies to civilians in Iraq following an offensive by Islamic State forces . The first drop occurred on the night of 13 / 14 August , when one of the squadron 's C @-@ 130Js took part in a 16 @-@ aircraft mission including US C @-@ 17s and C @-@ 130Hs and a British C @-@ 130J that delivered supplies to <unk> civilians trapped on Mount Sinjar . According to the Australian Department of Defence , it was the RAAF 's " most complex operational humanitarian air drop mission in more than a decade " . A second drop was conducted to deliver supplies to isolated civilians in the northern Iraqi town of <unk> . By September 2014 , the RAAF 's C @-@ 130Js had accumulated over 100 @,@ 000 flying hours . Later that month , a C @-@ 130J took part in the airlift of arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish @-@ controlled northern Iraq ; the involvement of RAAF transport aircraft in operations in Iraq is ongoing . From 7 to 10 December 2015 , a C @-@ 130J of No. 37 Squadron flying out of Guam joined American and Japanese aircraft in Operation Christmas Drop , a humanitarian aerial supply operation in the west Pacific and Micronesia . No. 37 Squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation in the Queen 's Birthday Honours on 13 June 2016 for " sustained outstanding service in warlike operations throughout the Middle East Area of Operations over the period January 2002 to June 2014 " . 
 = Danny Williams ( politician ) = 
 Daniel E. " Danny " Williams , QC , MHA ( born August 4 , 1949 ) is a Canadian politician , businessman and lawyer who served as the ninth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador between November 6 , 2003 , and December 3 , 2010 . Williams was born and raised in St. John 's , Newfoundland and Labrador . Before entering politics Williams was a highly successful lawyer and businessman . After becoming Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001 , he was elected to the House of Assembly in a by @-@ election for the district of Humber West in Corner Brook . 
 Williams ' premiership was considered controversial outside of Newfoundland and Labrador . Events such as ordering all Canadian flags to be removed from provincial government buildings , and launching the Anything But Conservative campaign in the 2008 federal election , garnered national attention . While Williams remains a controversial politician outside Newfoundland and Labrador , he was continuously ranked as one of the most popular premiers in Canada , with approval ratings in the province consistently in the high seventies and eighties . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Daniel E. Williams was born in St. John 's , Newfoundland and Labrador , Canada , the eldest of four children to Thomas Williams and <unk> ( Galway ) . He received his early education from Saint Bonaventure 's College and then Gonzaga High School . The Williams family have been Progressive Conservatives since the province 's confederation with Canada ; Williams handed out brochures and put up signs in support of John Diefenbaker 's campaign to be Prime Minister . 
 Williams went on to study at Memorial University of Newfoundland , where he received a degree in political science and economics . In 1969 , he was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship and went to Keble College , Oxford , United Kingdom to read Arts in Law . Whilst at Oxford he played hockey for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club . He then attended Dalhousie University , Halifax where he earned a Bachelor of Laws degree .

 All currency is in Canadian dollars . 
 While still in law school , Williams led a consortium of businesspeople that was granted one of Newfoundland 's first cable television licences and started the company " Avalon Cablevision " . Through major acquisitions and the very early adoption of the Internet ISP business ( via <unk> dial @-@ up and later <unk> high @-@ speed cable Internet services ) , he built Cable Atlantic into one of the largest communications companies in Atlantic Canada . As the principal owner , he sold the telecommunications portion of the business for $ 76 million in April 2000 , to GT Group Telecom Inc . The cable TV portion of Cable Atlantic was sold to Rogers Cable Inc. for $ 152 million in November 2000 . This sale plus the success of his extensive law practice gave him the nickname of " Danny Millions " during the early 2000s . 
 Williams has been practising law since 1972 , becoming a financially successful lawyer , and was appointed Queen 's Counsel in 1984 . His firm represented many of the abused altar boys and orphans who sued the Roman Catholic Church , the Christian Brothers and the province of Newfoundland following the Mount Cashel Orphanage scandal . 
 Williams served as president of <unk> Fisher , an oil and natural gas company ( later renamed <unk> Group ) , and has invested in golf courses and resorts throughout the province . He has also served as the Chairman of the Canadian Parliamentary Channel ( CPAC ) , the Newfoundland and Labrador Film Development Corporation as well as the Provincial Government Offshore Oil Impact Advisory Council . 
 While he was the owner of Cable Atlantic Williams purchased the naming rights to a sports complex in St. John 's for $ 600 @,@ 000 from Molson . Before the centre opened , however , Williams had sold Cable Atlantic to Rogers Communications to pursue his political career , but retained the naming rights . Ultimately he chose to name the centre Mile One Centre , based on the venue 's location at the beginning of the Trans Canada Highway .

 In 2000 , after years of speculation Williams announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador ( PC ) , and was returned uncontested on April 7 , 2001 . On June 19 , 2001 , he won a by @-@ election in the Corner Brook district of Humber West . 
 Support for the PC party saw a big bounce when Williams became leader . Four by @-@ elections were held during the two years he was the Opposition Leader and each seat was won by a PC candidate . In September 2001 , Liberal Assemblyman ( MHA ) Ross Wiseman crossed the floor of the House of Assembly to join the Progressive Conservative caucus . During his time as Opposition Leader , Williams donated his legislative salary to charity .

 Since succeeding Beaton Tulk as Premier of Newfoundland in February 2001 , Premier Roger Grimes had been under opposition pressure to legitimize his mandate at the polls after winning the leadership of the Liberal Party ( Liberals ) . On September 29 , 2003 , Grimes called an election for October 21 , 2003 . 
 Polls leading up to and during the election showed that the Progressive Conservatives under Williams had a substantial lead over their main competitor the Liberals , as well as the New Democratic Party ( NDP ) . Williams campaigned for change and promised to control spending , streamline the public service and create jobs . 
 The Progressive Conservatives captured nearly 59 % of the vote and won 34 of the 48 seats in the 2003 general election . This win marked only the third change of government in the 54 years since the province joined Canada , and ended nearly 15 years of Liberal Party rule . As party leader , Williams became the province 's ninth Premier . 
 = = = First term as premier = = = 
 Soon after being elected , Williams announced the province 's debts were so burdensome that he had no choice but to cut spending and freeze wages . Based on the projected $ 840 million budget deficit for 2004 , the government announced sweeping cuts . A number of projects would be cut , and others delayed . Cuts included three health care facilities and a school ; delayed projects included , most notably , the opening of The Rooms , the province 's cultural facility that was under construction . Spurred by the administration 's announcement of pay @-@ freeze and plan to eliminate 4 @,@ 000 public sector jobs , a strike was declared among the 20 @,@ 000 public sector employees two days following the announcement , at midnight April 1 , 2004 . The strike ended nearly a month later when Williams reneged on a campaign promise and legislated the employees back to work . Later that year the Williams government compressed health and education boards in an attempt for a more efficient delivery of services , a move that still receives criticism in the province . 
 An opinion poll conducted in June 2004 showed that support for the Premier and the Progressive Conservatives had plunged . From its nearly 60 percent share of the vote in the general election seven months earlier , support had shrunk to 41 percent , almost tied with the Liberals at 39 percent . His personal support as choice of Premier fell to 39 percent , a marked fall from 65 percent he enjoyed just six months earlier . 
 Williams ' popularity increased when he fought with then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin over a campaign promise Martin had made that would lead to a revised Atlantic Accord . Martin proposed an eight @-@ year deal that the province would keep 100 percent of offshore oil revenues , but with an expenditure a cap to keep the province from surpassing the per capita tax revenue of Ontario . Williams , supported by the other provincial leaders , walked out of talks with Martin , saying that cap would cost the provincial government billions of dollars in lost revenue over the life of its three oil fields . Williams along with Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm , who also wanted the same deal as Newfoundland and Labrador , met with the Prime Minister on several occasions but a deal between Ottawa and the two provinces could not be reached . Williams raised the temperature on December 23 , 2004 , when he ordered the removal of all Canadian flags from provincial government buildings . On January 10 , 2005 , Canadian flags started flying once again in the province , and several weeks later Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia reached a deal with Ottawa . A March opinion poll indicated that support for the Williams government had rebounded to 86 percent . 
 On March 3 , 2006 , Williams appeared on Larry King Live where Paul McCartney and then wife Heather Mills argued the seal hunt was inhumane because seal cubs were being clubbed to death . Williams said the annual hunt is supported by scientists , veterinarians and organizations like the UN and the World Wildlife Fund , and that 90 % of seals are killed by bullet . Williams accused the McCartneys of being used by <unk> , Greenpeace and PETA to help them raise funds . He then invited the McCartneys to visit Newfoundland and Labrador .

 On August 21 , 2007 , Williams signed a Memorandum of understanding for the Hebron offshore oilfield with several major oil companies in which government royalties were exchanged for a 4 @.@ 9 percent equity stake in the project . On September 17 , 2007 , Williams called a provincial election . Williams ' popularity was riding at 75 % , and polls during the campaign showed the Conservatives reaching up to 86 percent of voter support . 
 After the vote count , the Progressive Conservatives emerged with nine more seats than they held at the dissolution of the previous legislature . The party had won 69 @.@ 5 percent of the popular vote , the highest popular vote share ever attained by the PC party in the province . Three Liberal incumbents , as well as NDP leader Lorraine Michael , successfully held their seats . Notably , however , Liberal leader Gerry Reid was not reelected in his own district . The next month Williams ' Progressive Conservatives increased their seat count to 44 out of 48 , after winning a deferred election in Grand Falls @-@ Windsor @-@ Buchans following the death of Liberal candidate Gerry Tobin on October 1 .

 On August 20 , 2008 , Williams and a consortium of oil companies led by Chevron Canada signed a deal to develop the Hebron oil field – the second largest oil field off the coast of the province with an estimated 700 million barrels of oil reserves , worth some $ 20 billion in royalties and up to 3 @,@ 500 jobs from the project . Construction is scheduled to start in 2012 , with oil extraction by 2017 . 
 During the 2008 Canadian Federal election , Williams hit out at incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the federal administration for reneging on a 2006 election pledge to exclude non @-@ renewable energy sources from the equalization formula . In order to thwart Harper 's reelection , Williams launched the " ABC " campaign : Anything But Conservative . The ABC campaign encouraged people to vote for any other party but the Conservatives , with a goal of making sure no Conservative was elected in Newfoundland and Labrador . The campaign , which was supported by all but one member of Williams ' caucus , crippled the federal party 's ability to find candidates and volunteers . On election night the campaign was successful , the Conservative Party lost the three seats they had held prior to the election , and won only 17 % of the popular vote in the province . Despite being shut out of Newfoundland and Labrador the Conservatives did manage to win a second minority government . Following the election Williams announced that it was time to end his battle with Ottawa , and both him and Harper signalled a willingness to work with each other . 
 On June 16 , 2009 , Williams announced the government had concluded an agreement with oil companies to expand the Hibernia oil field in which the province would have a 10 percent equity stake in the " Hibernia South " extension . The deal promised to add $ 13 billion to the province 's coffers . 
 Williams has been outspoken about the Québec Government and their crown corporation Hydro @-@ Québec . On September 3 , 2009 , Williams accused Hydro @-@ Québec of trying to block the Lower Churchill hydroelectric project to protect its own dominance in the marketplace by making a deal with New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham to buy NB Power 's nuclear and hydro generating stations , the transmission system and other assets in a massive deal . On October 29 , 2009 , the premiers of New Brunswick and Québec signed a memorandum of understanding to transfer most assets of NB Power to Hydro @-@ Québec . In the end the deal between New Brunswick and Québec fell apart , Williams dissatisfaction with the deal is thought to have played a role . In a speech given on June 9 , 2010 , Williams strongly denounced " Québec 's self interest is harming the provinces , the nation and our country 's international reputation " . 
 On February 2 , 2010 , it was reported that Williams would travel to the United States to have heart surgery . The move raised questions about the quality and availability of health care services and procedures in Canada 's health care system . According to Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale , " It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province . " Dunderdale refused to answer how the procedure would be paid for , or whether the procedure could have been scheduled to be performed in another province of Canada . On February 8 , 2010 , it was reported that Williams ' surgery had been successful . On his return , Williams later defended his choice saying : " I did not sign away my right to get the best possible health care for myself when I entered politics " . Williams said although he had " the utmost confidence " in his own province 's health care system , his decision was to go to Mount Sinai Medical Center , Miami to undergo " a very specialized piece of surgery [ by ] somebody who 's doing this three or four times a day , five , six days a week . " 
 On November 18 , 2010 , Williams was joined by Premier of Nova Scotia , Darrell Dexter , in announcing a $ 6 @.@ 2 billion agreement to develop the first phase of the Lower Churchill Project . Nalcor Energy , a Newfoundland and Labrador Crown corporation , signed a partnership agreement with Emera Inc. of Nova Scotia to develop the 824 megawatts Muskrat Falls . The hydro development would see power from the falls transferred from Labrador to the island of Newfoundland via an underwater transmission link through the Strait of Belle Isle . Another underwater transmission link across the Gulf of St. Lawrence would bring power to Nova Scotia . Newfoundland and Labrador will use 40 percent of the hydro power itself and will be able to shut down the oil burning Holyrood Thermal Generating Station . Emera Inc. will get 20 percent of the power for $ 1 @.@ 2 billion to sell to customers in Nova Scotia . The remaining 40 percent will be sold by Nalcor Energy to markets in Atlantic Canada and the Northeastern United States .

 Williams ' popularity is said to be unmatched in Canadian political history ; his high approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement . Although Williams ' premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large , except for his first year in office , his own provincial approval ratings and those of his government have been consistently in the seventy to eighty percent range for the majority of the time he was in office . According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates ( CRA ) , Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country . 
 During his first year in office Williams and his government suffered low approval ratings . However , approval for Williams and his government dramatically improved in 2005 . A poll showed support for the Williams government was at 86 percent after Williams secured a deal with Federal Prime Minister Martin over equalization payments . The CRA poll in March 2006 showed 82 percent satisfaction with his government and 71 percent in William 's premiership . Polling conducted throughout 2007 , showed that support for Williams and his government remained high . In August 2007 , the CRA found that 86 percent were satisfied with the government 's performance ; 77 percent supported Williams as premier , and 76 percent endorsed the PC party . 
 A mid @-@ term poll by CRA in November 2009 showed that 77 percent of decided voters backed Williams ' Progressive Conservatives . His popularity had been in the seventies according to polls conducted by the CRA earlier in 2009 . Two other polls conducted in late 2009 showed similar results , the first of which was by Global News and Ipsos and the second was by Angus Reid . The Angus Reid poll surveyed Canadians in nine provinces and found that Williams was by far the most popular premier in Canada . 78 percent of respondents in the province approved of Williams ' performance , the only other premier to receive the support of more than half of respondents in their province was Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall with 58 percent . 
 A CRA poll released in March 2010 showed public support for Williams ' Progressive Conservative Party that had extended to a record 80 percent of decided voters , up from 77 percent from February . Satisfaction with the government was 93 percent voters . After controversies arose surrounding the accidental expropriation of the Grand Falls @-@ Windsor paper mill and the province 's readiness to react to a possible oil spill , the Williams led government as well as his personal popularity took a slight hit . A CRA poll conducted in May 2010 , showed that satisfaction with the government was at 87 percent down from 93 percent in March , the party 's support had fallen five percent to 75 percent and Williams own support fell to 79 percent down from 81 percent . Even with the slight loss in support Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country .

 On November 25 , 2010 , Williams announced that he would step down as premier on December 3 , 2010 , and that Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale would serve as the premier of the province until a new party leader was elected in 2011 . On December 3 , 2010 , Williams tendered his resignation as Premier and Dunderdale was sworn in as the tenth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador , becoming the first woman to hold the office . 
 The week following Williams ' departure from politics , CRA released a poll conducted during November showing that 90 percent of Newfoundlanders and <unk> were either completely or mostly satisfied with the performance of the PC government . 75 percent of the respondents supported the Progressive Conservatives , while 76 percent thought Williams was the best choice to be premier .

The tribute dinner was to be held in conjunction with the leadership convention that would swear Dunderdale in as PC leader . Following this , Williams announced that Premier Dunderdale and her staff were distancing themselves from him . 
 On September 5 , 2011 , Williams campaigned with Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership candidate Gary Mar in Fort McMurray , Alberta . In October 2015 , during the federal election , Williams called Stephen Harper 's tactic of making the <unk> ban for Muslim women at citizenship ceremonies a national issue borderline racist for how it isolated women and minorities .

However , on June 1 , Williams announced tentative deals with St. John 's Sports and Entertainment and True North Sports & Entertainment , the current owner of the AHL Manitoba Moose . On June 10 , a formal announcement was made confirming the deal to move the Manitoba Moose to Mile One Centre .

 The high amounts of spending done by Williams 's government while he was in power have been blamed for the financial situation that Newfoundland and Labrador has been in since 2015 .

David Baron and Jim Hoke were the only two other musicians involved in the EP 's production , and were responsible for the record 's piano , baritone saxophone , tenor saxophone and hammond organ instrumentation . In an interview with The Baltimore Sun , Kadish spoke of the record 's conception , " We were like , ' Let 's do a ' 50s EP and see if anybody likes it , just for fun . ' " Regarding the title of the EP , Trainor told Popjustice , " So I 've called the EP Title . Cos obviously everyone was going , ' what 's the title ' , and I was like , ' hey , I 'm clever , I 'm gonna make it this ' . " The name was deemed " creative " by Idolator 's Mike Wass . Dear Future Husband " was inspired by a joke Trainor made with her father , where she would say that her future husband " is out there somewhere , chilling " . Trainor described the EP as having a " doo @-@ wop feel " reminiscent of " All About That Bass , " but being different lyrically . Trainor noted that Title takes on themes that " not a lot of people think about , " such as commitment and staying true to one 's self . The EP was Epic Records ' idea to prove that Trainor was not a one @-@ hit wonder , following the success of her debut single , " All About That Bass " . In an interview with James Sullivan of the The Boston Globe , the singer said that Title focuses on " an awkward 19- , 20 @-@ year @-@ old , when you 're pretty sure you 're an adult but you 're not , yet .

Sonically , " All About That Bass " comprises an earworm hook , early 1960s soul @-@ pop groove , scatting tempo and shimmying melody . Lyrically , " All About That Bass " serves as a callout to embrace one 's appearance and promote a positive body image . The song metaphorically refers to the appearance of a woman 's bottom . Larger women are described as " bass " and thinner women as " treble " , which Trainor implies as a joke about " thick and thin " . The lyric " I 'm bringing booty back " references Justin Timberlake 's " SexyBack " ( 2006 ) .

 " Dear Future Husband " is a doo @-@ wop song , and lyrically comprises a list of factors Trainor 's love interests should be aware of before proposing to her . Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dubbed the song " a YA dream that 's no pastel @-@ colored fantasy , " and opined , " [ Trainor ] imagines marriage as contract between equals who work and don 't cook " . The melody in " Dear Future Husband " was likened to American singer Dion 's " Runaround Sue " ( 1961 ) , and sonically the song comprises a series of slick production slap @-@ beats , a rock @-@ inspired drum track , zippy piano and ebullient brass instrumentation . The EP 's final track , " Close Your Eyes " is a modern slow dance ballad about ignoring negativity and loving yourself on your own terms .

In a publication by the The Daily Telegraph , Olivia O <unk> analyzed , " If the song 's 908 @,@ 000 likes on YouTube and Meghan 's 90 @,@ 000 followers on Twitter are anything to go by , it would seem that the message most people are taking away from the hit is a positive one " .

Trainor 's song " Title " also became the subject of the same controversy , and was dubbed " just as anti @-@ feminist " as " All About That Bass " . L.V.

 = Battle of Kusonje = 
 The Battle of Kusonje was a two @-@ day clash fought in the village of Kusonje near the town of Pakrac on 8 – 9 September 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence . The battle was initiated when a platoon of the Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) was ambushed by Croatian Serb forces while conducting a reconnaissance patrol . The ZNG deployed reinforcements to extract the ambushed platoon , but failed to reach them . The surviving members of the platoon held out until they ran out of ammunition and surrendered only to be killed by their captors and buried in a mass grave . 
 The fate of the reconnaissance platoon was not known to Croatian authorities for months , adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere in the city of Bjelovar , where the ambushed unit was originally based . This tension erupted a week later with the blockade and capture of the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) barracks in Bjelovar . 
 During a commemoration service held two years later , a landmine exploded killing three and wounding others . The Croatian authorities declared the incident to be a terrorist attack , and it contributed to Croatian government 's decision to launch Operation Medak Pocket the next day . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1990 , ethnic tensions between Serbs and Croats worsened after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( Croatian : Hrvatska demokratska zajednica – HDZ ) . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin ( approximately 60 kilometres ( 37 miles ) north @-@ east of Split ) , parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia . In January 1991 , Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , unsuccessfully tried to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces . The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA request was refused on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milošević 's control . By the end of March , the conflict had escalated with the first fatalities . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to amalgamate the areas under their control with Serbia . These were viewed by the Government of Croatia as breakaway regions . 
 At the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . To bolster its defence , Croatia doubled its police numbers to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the Croatian police force was 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police comprising twelve battalions organised along military lines . There were also 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons . In response to the deteriorating situation , the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) in May by expanding the special police battalions into four all @-@ professional guards brigades . Under Ministry of Defence control and commanded by retired JNA General Martin Špegelj , the four guards brigades comprised approximately 8 @,@ 000 troops . The reserve police , also expanded to 40 @,@ 000 , was attached to the ZNG and reorganised into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions . The guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully equipped with small arms ; throughout the ZNG there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was poor command and control structure above the brigade level . The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to using World War II weapons taken from museums and film studios . At the time , the Croatian weapon stockpile consisted of 30 @,@ 000 small arms purchased abroad and 15 @,@ 000 previously owned by the police . To replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades , a new 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police was established . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Following the first skirmish in Pakrac in March , a predominantly Serb @-@ populated area east of the town , straddling the Pakrac – Bučje – Požega road , remained generally beyond the control of Croatian authorities . In early July , the insurrection spread to the entire area between the towns of Pakrac and Požega and north to the northern slopes of Papuk and Bilogora . This development threatened to interdict the Croatian use of the Varaždin – Osijek road , as it was within range of Croatian Serb artillery near Slatina . After the Serb rebels declared the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia ( SAO Western Slavonia ) and expanded the territory under their control to include the town of Okučani , the most significant transport route between Zagreb and Slavonia — the Zagreb – Belgrade motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška — was severed . SAO Western Slavonia comprised no major settlements . In order to address this deficiency , Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive early on 19 August . The objectives of the offensive were to capture the towns of Grubišno Polje , Daruvar , Pakrac and Lipik , and consolidate the territory of SAO Western Slavonia . The offensive failed after the arrival of Croatian reinforcements from Zagreb and Bjelovar , but the line of control remained in close proximity to the four towns . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 On 2 September , the ZNG deployed A Company , 1st Battalion , 105th Infantry Brigade to Pakrac in order to reinforce police defences in the area . Violence in western Slavonia flared up once more on 3 – 4 September , when Croatian Serb forces attacked the villages of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> south of Slatina , killing two policemen and 21 civilians . 
 On 8 September , A Company 's reconnaissance platoon was tasked with using a gun truck and scouting the area around the village of Kusonje . The platoon encountered no resistance before it reached the village , where it was ambushed by Croatian Serb troops . The platoon 's gun truck was disabled and the ZNG troops abandoned it and took shelter in a nearby house . 
 When it learned of the ambush , the ZNG deployed a force to extract the reconnaissance platoon . The relief force consisted of the rest of A Company , supported by the " Omega " special police unit , reserve police , and ZNG reinforcements from Virovitica . The reinforcements were unable to reach the embattled reconnaissance platoon , which was running low on ammunition . The stalemate continued until the morning of 9 September , when Croatian Serb forces used explosives to demolish a portion of the house in which the reconnaissance platoon had sought cover . Eleven members of the reconnaissance platoon had been killed during the fighting , and the remaining seven had run out of ammunition . They surrendered to the Croatian Serb forces which had surrounded the house , and were then killed by their captors . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As the force which was sent to reinforce and extract the reconnaissance platoon took further casualties , the total Croatian losses in the fighting and its immediate aftermath amounted to 20 killed . The fate of the reconnaissance platoon was not immediately known to Croatian authorities or relatives of the troops for months , adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere in the city of Bjelovar , where the 105th Brigade was originally based . This tension erupted a week later , with the blockade and capture of the JNA barracks in Bjelovar . The JNA denied it had any knowledge on the fate of the Croatian soldiers . Details of their deaths became known in December 1991 . Croatian forces recaptured Kusonje on 30 December in Operation Papuk @-@ 91 , and their bodies were exhumed in January 1992 . Along with the soldiers , the bodies of 23 civilians were also exhumed from a mass grave in the village of <unk> Potok . The soldiers were re @-@ interred in Bjelovar on 5 February 1992 . According to JNA intelligence reports , during the period from the exhumation to the re @-@ interment , 32 Serb @-@ owned houses in Bjelovar were demolished in retribution for the killings . 
 The area was demilitarised following the arrival of the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) to implement the Vance plan and ceasefire to stabilise the areas affected by the fighting until a political settlement was reached . The area adjacent to the Pakrac – Požega road , especially around Kusonje , remained unsafe . There were numerous attacks along the road , resulting in deaths and injuries . These included an attack on a Croatian police patrol on 5 August 1993 , which left four policemen dead and another four wounded . In September 1993 , Croatian authorities placed a commemorative plaque at the site of the 1991 ambush and planned a wreath laying ceremony to mark the second anniversary of the event . At 10 : 20 on 8 September , while the ceremony was in progress , a landmine exploded at the site killing three and injuring eleven . The wounded included one Argentinian member of UNPROFOR . Those killed were members of the ZNG 105th Brigade . The incident , described by the Croatian authorities as an act of terrorism , came on the heels of a series of artillery bombardments and sabotages that resulted in the Croatian government losing its patience with the situation . This contributed to the launching of Operation Medak Pocket the following day . 
 Croatian authorities prosecuted four people in connection with the 1991 killing of the prisoners of war , and convicted and sentenced them to 15 to 20 years in prison . Another person was tried and convicted in connection with the 1993 bombing , and sentenced to 20 years in prison . In 1998 , the Chapel of Nativity of Mary was built in Kusonje at the initiative of the parents of the soldiers who were killed there , and a commemorative plaque containing the names of the 23 killed was placed at the chapel . The events of 1991 and 1993 are commemorated annually in Kusonje , with civilian and military representatives attending . In 2014 , a feature film titled Number 55 , based on the 1991 events in Kusonje , was released . The title of the film refers to the number of the house where the ZNG troops took shelter on 8 – 9 September 1991 .

 Harvard Girl ( full title Harvard Girl Liu Yiting : A Character Training Record ; Chinese : 哈佛女孩刘亦婷 ： <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) is a book written by Liu <unk> ( <unk> ) and Zhang <unk> ( <unk> ) , which describes how they raised their daughter , Liu Yiting ( <unk> ) , to be accepted to Harvard University . Published in 2000 in Chinese by the Writers Publishing House , the book details the rigorous lifestyle that Liu led and includes advice from Liu 's parents on how to raise children to gain acceptance to top @-@ tier universities ; it has been described as a " manual " for child @-@ rearing and early education . 
 The book was a bestseller in mainland China and made both Harvard and Liu Yiting household names among Chinese parents and students . It has since had numerous imitators , spawning an entire genre of how @-@ to books on child @-@ rearing for Chinese parents . 
 = = Biography of Liu Yiting = = 
 Liu was raised in Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan province . Liu 's parents , believers in the value of early childhood education , subjected her to a rigorous education since she was just 15 days old . For example , to ensure that someone was always talking to Liu , they invited relatives over to the house . They also had her participate in " character @-@ building " physical exercises such as swimming , jumping rope , and holding ice in her hands for extended periods of time . Liu also acted in a soap opera when she was five years old . 
 While in high school , Liu participated in a student exchange program and visited America in 1998 . This experience changed her views about life in America , because like many Chinese citizens , most of her impressions about America came from Hollywood , and when she came to the country she was " surprised that [ she ] didn 't see any street fights or police @-@ car chases " . The program also piqued her interest in American universities , where she realized she would be able to study a variety of subjects . 
 Although they had been training her to attend a preeminent university , Liu 's parents had not expected that she would attend an American one ; her mother has said that until Liu came back from America , she had not been aware that Chinese students could apply to American universities . At the time , it was unusual for Chinese students to attend American schools as undergraduates , as most only applied to schools abroad for postgraduate education . However , rather than taking the <unk> , China 's national college entrance examination , and attending one of the National Key Universities , Liu applied to American colleges . She was accepted to several schools , including Harvard , Columbia , Wellesley , and Mount Holyoke , from which she ultimately chose to attend Harvard . Not long afterwards , a local newspaper announced her acceptance and the family was " besieged with thousands of phone calls " . 
 At Harvard , Liu majored in applied mathematics and economics and earned high grades ; she also chaired the Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations , a student organization . She was described as " unassuming " and a " typical student " , to the point that it took her roommate four years to realize Liu was a celebrity in China . In 2003 , Liu graduated and took a job at the Boston Consulting Group in New York City . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Liu <unk> ( Liu 's mother ) and Zhang <unk> ( Liu 's stepfather ) published Harvard Girl in 2000 , after Liu had matriculated at Harvard . According to Liu , her parents had plans early on to write about their parenting methods , but they waited until 2000 to publish the book , relying on Liu 's perceived success to establish themselves as " experts " . The book primarily consists of research @-@ like notes and diary entries , which Liu and her parents began recording and saving before Liu was in first grade . Liu herself helped edit the book , and wrote several of the later chapters . 
 One major element of the child @-@ rearing strategy described in the book was treating Liu as an adult and " encourag [ ing ] her to develop a mature style of thinking " . Liu 's parents never used baby talk when Liu was a child , and they allowed her to argue with them but required her to present reasoned arguments like an adult . According to education scholar Ben <unk> , the book 's focus on independent thinking and intellectual development was a " break with the past " in China , where both early and higher education often emphasize rote learning . 
 In addition , the book details the rigorous " character @-@ building exercises " Liu 's parents had her perform . In addition to having her do physical exercises , Liu 's parents controlled her diet . They also frequently took her traveling , both on short trips to nearby rural areas and on longer trips to historical sites such as Xi 'an . Throughout the book , high value is placed on " full development " , and the writers encourage parents to cultivate more than just academic ability in their children . 
 The book also includes supplementary chapters on topics such as how to select which schools to apply to , and advice for students on filling out applications and taking TOEFL and SAT exams . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The book was at the top of China 's bestseller list for 16 months , during which time it sold at least 1 @.@ 5 million copies and the writers were estimated to have earned at least the equivalent of $ 100 @,@ 000 in royalties . It became a must @-@ have book for middle @-@ class parents in China . The popularity of Harvard Girl made Liu a " national superstar " and an " idol " for Chinese parents , and she frequently received fan mail and drew large crowds at book signings in mainland China . The success of this and similar books ( another bestseller in 2001 and 2002 was Robert <unk> 's Rich Dad Poor Dad ) in mainland China has been said to reflect a " national obsession " among Chinese parents to get their children into top @-@ ranking American schools . 
 Harvard Girl was followed by numerous imitations by parents of other successful students , and is said to have spawned an entire genre of education " manuals " for Chinese parents , including similar books on how to get one 's children into schools such as Oxford University , Cambridge University , or Columbia University . This genre includes titles such as Ivy League is Not a Dream , From Andover to Harvard , How We Got Our Child Into Yale , Harvard Family Instruction , The Door of the Elite , Harvard Boy Zhang <unk> , Harvard Talents : Children Cultivated by the Karl <unk> Educational Law , Tokyo University Boy , Cornell Girl , and Our Dumb Little Boy Goes to Cambridge . 
 Comparable books have also been published in South Korea , although American undergraduate universities are not " revered " in the same way there as they are in mainland China . In addition to imitators , Liu 's parents have written their own follow @-@ up : Harvard Girl 2 : Liu Yiting 's Studying Methods and Upbringing Details ( <unk> 哈佛女孩刘亦婷 <unk> <unk> ： <unk> ) , which describes Liu 's four years in college , was published in 2004 by Writers Publishing House . 
 The book also had an impact on applications to Harvard . It made Harvard a household name in China , and books of this genre caused a significant increase in the number of Chinese applicants to top @-@ tier American universities . In 1999 , Liu and 43 other Chinese students applied to Harvard , and by 2008 , 484 Chinese students had . 
 = = = Criticisms = = = 
 The book has been criticized for increasing the pressure many Chinese students already had to succeed in school , and for taking advantage of the widespread belief that admission into leading universities is necessary for success in life . Some critics have called the book " boastful . " A 2001 study by a group of educators claimed that the strategies described in the book would not work for everyone even though they had worked for Liu , and that many families following the book 's advice would be disappointed . 
 A 2004 book by Xiao Hui ( <unk> ) , entitled Raising Children <unk> Great Wisdom : The Truth About " Harvard Girl Liu Yiting " ( <unk> ： “ 哈佛女孩刘亦婷 ” <unk> ) , harshly criticizes Harvard Girl , calling the methods described in the book " false character building " ( " <unk> " ) and claiming that Liu gained entrance into Harvard not because of her comprehensive or well @-@ rounded education , but by exploiting loopholes and defects in Harvard 's admissions policy for Chinese students or by taking advantage of guanxi , personal relationships and networks . 
 Many successful Chinese students after Liu have tried to distance themselves from the so @-@ called " Harvard Girl Phenomenon ; " Harvard students Yin <unk> and Tang <unk> have both stated they do not want to be compared to " Harvard Girl . " Yin 's mother published a book , From Andover to Harvard , about how her son was accepted by Harvard , but Yin only allowed his full name to appear in the book 's preface . Tang received at least six offers from publishers to have a book written about her , but declined them all . Nevertheless , many of China 's top students are still compared to " Harvard Girl , " and admissions to top overseas universities often make big news in mainland China ; for example , Cheng <unk> ( <unk> ) attracted media attention in Sichuan province when she was accepted to Harvard in April 2009 . 
 = Geology of the Bryce Canyon area = 
 The exposed geology of the Bryce Canyon area in Utah shows a record of deposition that covers the last part of the Cretaceous Period and the first half of the Cenozoic era in that part of North America . The ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now Bryce Canyon National Park varied from the warm shallow sea ( called the Cretaceous Seaway ) in which the Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited to the cool streams and lakes that contributed sediment to the colorful Claron Formation that dominates the park 's amphitheaters . 
 Other formations were also formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70 million years ago ( mya ) . This event created the Rocky Mountains far to the east and helped to close the sea that covered the area . A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15 mya . While not part of this region , the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces . Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5 mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries , including the Paria River , which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park . The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free @-@ standing pinnacles called hoodoos , badlands , and monoliths we see today . 
 The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the Grand Staircase . The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in the Grand Canyon , the intermediate ones in Zion National Park , and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area . A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park . 
 = = Grand Staircase = = 
 The rocks exposed in Bryce Canyon are about 100 million years younger than those in nearby Zion National Park , and the rocks exposed in Zion are younger than those in the Grand Canyon to the south . 
 There are , however , shared rock units between all three , creating a supersequence of formations that geologists call the Grand Staircase . Together the formations of the Grand Staircase record nearly 2000 million years of the Earth 's history . Bryce Canyon 's formations are the youngest known units in the Grand Staircase . Younger rock units , if they ever existed , have been removed by erosion . 
 = = Cretaceous Seaway = = 
 = = = Advance = = = 
 In the Cretaceous , a shallow seaway spread into the interior of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north . Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway . The seaway divided North America into two halves : an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains ; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny . As the shoreline moved back and forth , the Bryce area alternated from being part of the Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway . Alternating layers of nonmarine , intertidal , and marine sediments lay on top of each other as a result . 
 Conglomerate , siltstone , and fossil @-@ rich sandstone that together are up to 300 feet ( 90 m ) thick mark the arrival of the Cretaceous Seaway . Called the Dakota Sandstone , it is the oldest formation exposed in the Bryce Canyon area but the youngest one exposed in the Zion and Kolob canyons area to the southwest . Abundant amounts of petrified wood , oyster beds containing millions of fossils , and coal are all found in the Dakota . In the Bryce Canyon area , this formation can be seen in the Paria Valley where it is found as a lithified blanket sand that probably accumulated on beaches , in lagoons , and vast coal @-@ producing swamps as the Cretaceous Seaway transgressed ( advanced inland ) over the region and later retreated . It sits unconformably on much older Jurassic formations that are not exposed in the immediate area ( see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area for a discussion about these older sediments ) . 
 Mud and silt were deposited on top of the Dakota Formation as the seaway became deeper and calmer in the area . The resulting dark gray to black Tropic Shale records the maximum transgression of the seaway into Utah and is 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) thick in the Paria Amphitheater . It forms the unvegetated badlands seen in the Tropic Valley and is perhaps the most fossil @-@ rich formation in the area ; containing numerous straight @-@ shelled and coiled ammonites . 
 = = = Retreat = = = 
 The Cretaceous Seaway was already retreating east and to the south by the time the locally 1 @,@ 700 feet ( 500 m ) thick Straight Cliffs Formation was deposited . Its members represent various stages in this process . The cliff @-@ forming sandstone of the <unk> Canyon Member was <unk> deposited on top of the Tropic Shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments . Shale and sandstone from the Smoky Hollow Member were deposited on top of its basal layer of coal @-@ rich mudstone in coastal swamps and lagoons on the shore of the seaway . While the alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of the John Henry Member were laid down in swamps , lagoons and fluvial environments , one member , the Drip Tank , is not found in the Bryce Canyon area . This formation erodes into almost <unk> cliffs and escarpments of whitish to yellow @-@ gray sandstones with comparatively thin interbedded layers of shale and mudstone . Shark teeth are found in the lower parts of the formation . 
 Lakes and east @-@ flowing rivers became the dominant resting place for sediment following the retreat of the Cretaceous Seaway . The shales and sandstones of the locally 700 feet ( 200 m ) thick <unk> Formation were deposited in moving water ( fluvial setting ) . This formation is part of the Grey Cliffs of the Grand Staircase mentioned previously . It contains abundant fossils of vertebrates , including dinosaurs such as the hadrosaurs . 
 = = Continental deposition = = 
 = = = Flood plains uplift and erode = = = 
 A flood plain crossed by rivers and lakes developed in the area . Mud and sand accumulated in this setting to become the gray sandstones and mudstones of the Kaiparowits Formation . This formation is up to 100 feet ( 30 m ) thick in the Bryce Canyon area , but other parts of the Kaiparowits in the region are several hundreds of feet ( tens of meters ) thick . Two formations , the Canaan Peak and the Pine Hollow , sit on top of the Kaiparowits elsewhere in the region but are absent in the Bryce Canyon area . The sandstones and conglomerates of these formations record stream and river deposition starting in the Paleocene epoch . 
 Uplift caused by a mountain @-@ building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70 mya to the early Paleocene . This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low @-@ lying basins between them gradually subsided . Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land in the area to form the up to 5 ° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline . All of the Canaan Peak , Pine Hollow , Kaiparowits , and <unk> formations , along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs , were removed from the anticline 's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited . An angular unconformity therefore exists along the anticline 's crest . The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift , which was also formed as a result of the Laramide . 
 = = = Claron flood plain and lake system = = = 
 Uplift from the Laramide paused briefly in the Eocene . Meandering streams flowed slowly over the resulting broad and almost featureless plains . Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1 @,@ 000 years ; spreading mud , cobbles and fine silt over the plains . Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant . Oxidation of the iron in the mud and silt turned the soil into hematite , giving it a pink and red hue . These sediments were later lithified into the up @-@ to- 700 feet ( 200 m ) -thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene @-@ aged Claron Formation ( previously called the Wasatch Formation ) . Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park 's fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos . Geologist Clarence Dutton called the iron oxide @-@ rich lower member of the Claron the Pink Cliffs series due to its colorful appearance . 
 A large system of shallow but expansive lakes and associated deltas covered several thousand square miles of what is now northwest Colorado and southwest Utah and Wyoming . These lakes existed from the Paleocene to mid Oligocene but did not spread to the Bryce Canyon area until Eocene time . Large quantities of lakebed sediments were laid down in this system during the 20 million years of its existence from about 60 to 40 mya . Climate change and cycles caused the lakes in the system to expand and shrink through time . As they did so , they left beds of differing thickness and composition stacked atop one another ; 
 various sand and cobble deposits near shore , 
 calcium @-@ poor muds further from shore , 
 calcium @-@ rich mud in deeper water , and 
 pure limey oozes were deposited in the deepest waters . 
 The limey oozes and mud were later lithified into the limestone and interbedded siltstone of the up @-@ to @-@ 300 foot ( 90 m ) -thick White Member of the Claron . This member erodes into white @-@ colored monoliths that are found only at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau . Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams , indicating that the lakes supported little life . Most arches and natural bridges in the park , including the famous Natural Bridge , were carved from sandstone beds in the Claron . 
 = = = Marysvale volcanics = = = 
 A gap in the geologic record following deposition of the Claron Formation was interrupted 34 to 31 mya by eruptions from the nearby Marysvale volcanic field , which is located northwest of the park . Volcanic ash and lava from these flows are found less than 20 miles ( 30 km ) from Bryce Canyon but at least some volcanic material was likely deposited directly in the park area only to be later removed by erosion . 
 Most of the activity at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals ; ~ 34 – 22 mya , 22 – 14 mya and 9 – 5 mya . <unk> and andesites were erupted above an evolving batholith in the first interval . Crystal @-@ rich ash from the 27 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old ( myo ) Three Creeks caldera , 24 myo Big John caldera and 23 myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into tuff . The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites . Alkali @-@ rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19 myo Mount Belknap caldera . 
 The Marysvale volcanic field collapsed under its own weight around 20 mya ; likely due to weaknesses in the evaporites of the Carmel Formation some 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 000 m ) below . Folding and faulting of the Claron Formation from the collapse created Ruby 's Inn thrust . A slight <unk> running east – west and perpendicular to the thrust motion called the Bryce syncline was also created . Volcanic activity in the Marysvale and Bryce area ceased some 500 @,@ 000 years ago . Basaltic rocks of the same age can be seen along the Sevier Fault near the entrance to Red Canyon ; the dark colored volcanic rocks have been displaced by the fault some 900 feet ( 300 m ) and are now in direct contact with the much older Claron Formation . 
 = = Late Cenozoic tectonics = = 
 = = = Formation of the High Plateaus = = = 
 Younger rock units were laid down but were mostly removed by subsequent uplift @-@ accelerated erosion . Outcrops of these formations can be found in the northern part of the park and in a few places on the plateau rim . Among these are the 50 @-@ to @-@ 100 @-@ foot ( 20 to 30 m ) thick Oligocene or Miocene @-@ aged Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Pliocene to early Pleistocene @-@ aged Sevier River Formation . The Boat Mesa is made mostly of conglomerates with minor amounts of sandstone and some limestone from lakes , representing stream and overbank flood deposits . The brownish @-@ gray sandstone and gravels of the Sevier River Formation were laid down in valleys that were part of the ancestral Sevier River drainage system . 
 Around 15 mya in Miocene time , tensional forces in Nevada to the west were so great that the crust was spread thin , creating the Basin and Range Province . These same forces segmented what is now the western part of the Colorado Plateau into nine different smaller plateaus , including the Paunsaugunt that the park sits astride . Long , north – south @-@ trending normal faults were either newly created or reactivated from older pre @-@ existing faults ; a plateau rose on one side of each fault while valleys subsided on the other as the crust was extended in an east @-@ west direction . Two of these faults bound the Paunsaugunt Plateau ; the Sevier on the west and the Paunsaugunt on the east . Movement along these two faults has displaced the Claron Formation by 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 600 m ) relative to the Paria and Sevier valleys . 
 The Hurricane Fault marks the west edge of the Markagunt Plateau and is the topographic boundary between the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateaus provinces . Cedar Breaks National Monument , which shares almost the same exposed geology and erosional features as Bryce Canyon National Park , sits on the west edge of the Markagunt . 
 The entire Colorado Plateau then started to uplift from near sea level to several thousand feet ( over a kilometer ) in elevation . An alternate theory is that the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau . Whatever the order of events were , the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete . 
 = = = Modern drainage and erosion = = = 
 Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was significantly altered by the opening of the Gulf of California . Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5 mya . The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional <unk> by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf . This significantly decreased the distance from the river 's headwaters and its delta at the sea . Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper , creating the <unk> topography .
