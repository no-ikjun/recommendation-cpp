 With a solid base to build on and a healthy budget , 1996 looked promising for Forti . The team negotiated for the most powerful and expensive Cosworth V8 engines in late 1995 to replace the outdated and underpowered ED models , and its financial security was demonstrated by rumours during the 1995 season that the more competitive but less well @-@ funded Minardi team was considering a merger with Forti as a means of maintaining its own presence in the sport . However , these aspirations were dealt a devastating blow when Pedro Diniz signed for the more competitive Ligier team , taking Martin Brundle 's vacated seat as the latter moved to Jordan . Forti 's sponsors brought in by the Diniz family , including Parmalat and Marlboro , all left ; the budget was significantly dented . For a time it seemed that the team would not compete in 1996 at all , and its survival was constantly questioned . The new car was delayed , and the team was forced to use the uprated <unk> car for the start of the season with the only slightly more competitive Ford <unk> @-@ R V8 engine ( instead of the " JS " unit it had been negotiating for ) , and to rely on temporary sponsors . Nevertheless , Forti remained in the sport for the 1996 season . Moreno was not retained ; the team signed Minardi and Pacific refugees Luca Badoer and Montermini to take the two empty seats ( although Hideki Noda was also considered ) , both drivers bringing a small amount of personal backing . Frenchman Franck Lagorce was also signed as a test driver . Pacific had folded during the off @-@ season , and it was clear that Forti would be some way behind the rest of the field in the slow <unk> . Badoer and Montermini failed to make the new 107 % cut in qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix and thus did not start the race , but both then managed to qualify for the Grands Prix held in Brazil and Argentina , scoring a 10th- and an 11th @-@ place finish between them in the races . Badoer , however , attracted attention in Argentina for a different reason . As Diniz attempted to lap him , the two collided and Badoer 's car flipped over ; the Italian escaping injury . Both cars then failed to qualify at the Nürburgring . 
 Forti produced a new chassis , the FG03 , for the next race of the season in Imola . It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year , with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid @-@ season . Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the old car , with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity , but there was only one FG03 available , and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car . Badoer , however , qualified last , but comfortably within the 107 % cut @-@ off , and only <unk> behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork . Badoer finished 10th and last , but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy 's Minardi . Both drivers qualified in Monaco , but Montermini crashed in the wet warm @-@ up session and did not start the race , whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams . He was fined $ 5000 and received a two @-@ race suspended ban . 
 = = = Deal with Shannon Racing = = = 
 After the Monaco GP , there were rumours that Forti would not survive the season without some form of takeover . In the period before the next race , the Spanish GP , Belco Avia boss Arron Colombo announced that a deal had been reached between Guido Forti and an entity known as Shannon Racing for the latter to buy a 51 % share of the team . The deal was concluded later in the month , on June 30 . Shannon Racing and its parent company <unk> were Irish @-@ registered sections of a Milanese financial group , and had already established teams in various Formula Three championships and in International Formula 3000 in 1996 . The group was keen to move into Formula One , and Forti provided an opportunity for this to happen . It was believed that Colombo had organised the deal , which was scheduled to continue throughout 1996 with an option for 1997 , because Belco Avia was owed money by Forti . As part of the management change , Cesare Fiorio left the team to join Ligier and was replaced by Daniele <unk> , whilst designer George Ryton joined from Ferrari . 
 For the Spanish GP , the cars therefore appeared in a new green @-@ and @-@ white livery , apparently confirming Shannon Racing 's acquisition of 51 % of Forti . This financial boost appeared to ensure the team 's survival . With the off @-@ track confusion , both drivers again failed to qualify . Nevertheless , at the Canadian and French Grands Prix , both Fortis made it to the grid , Badoer even <unk> Rosset in Montréal . However , Forti had lost its good 1995 reliability record , as these starts only resulted in four retirements . By this time , Forti 's financial problems , caused by a conflict of team ownership between Guido Forti and Shannon Racing , were becoming increasingly urgent in nature . Both cars retired with " engine problems " at the French GP , although it was widely rumoured that this was due to the team running out of engine mileage as it went into debt with engine suppliers Cosworth . 
 = = = Bankruptcy and withdrawal = = = 
 Guido Forti alleged that Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six @-@ day deadline after the deal was concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51 % of his team . As the team ran out of money , it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP . In the end , Forti took part , only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify . This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and was running out of engine mileage for its cars , only having enough to make a token effort at participation . The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained <unk> in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off . 
 Guido Forti , after discussing the matter with commercial rights @-@ owner Bernie Ecclestone , had decided to withdraw the team from the German GP as negotiations over the team 's ownership between himself and Shannon continued , despite the threat of the FIA ( F1 's governing body ) imposing a fine on the outfit for missing the race . Following the failure of these negotiations , he then announced that Shannon 's deal had fallen through and that he was back in charge of the team . He hoped to finalise some more sponsorship deals which would allow Forti to compete in the Hungarian GP . Shannon responded by claiming it still owned 51 % of the team , and that it intended to solve Forti 's financial problems itself , in addition to replacing Guido Forti as Team Principal . He duly took the company to court over the matter , an arduous process in the Italian legal system . 
 With the team in limbo whilst the ownership dispute was judged , Forti 's situation was bleak . The team faced the prospect of further heavy FIA @-@ imposed fines for missing races if the situation did not improve , or even exclusion from the championship for bringing the sport into disrepute , as had happened to the Andrea Moda team in 1992 . Forti withdrew his team from the sport ; it did not make an appearance at the Hungarian GP , the Belgian GP , nor at any further point in the championship . Badoer and Montermini were left without drives , and the promising FG03 chassis would no longer race . By the time Shannon Racing won the court case in September , Forti had ceased to exist . Shannon Racing 's teams in the lower motorsport categories also closed down . Coincidentally , Guido Forti had signed the 1997 Concorde Agreement shortly before his team 's demise , which could have given his team a chance of surviving if it had made it into that year due to the extra television revenue that was duly granted to each of the teams under the terms of the agreement . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Forti 's withdrawal marked not only the end of its participation in Formula One , but also terminated a team which had enjoyed success in International Formula 3000 and other minor categories . It is generally agreed that Forti may have succeeded if it had its 1995 budget and the FG03 car at the same time , and that Diniz 's departure meant that it stood little chance of survival , but the team has become another example of a small , <unk> team unable to finance its aspirations ; one of the final " privateer " teams to enter the sport in an era of increasing influence and participation from the large car manufacturers . Forti is often cited along with Pacific and Simtek as prime examples of this tendency . It was also argued that the increasing amount of money involved in financing an F1 team which was forcing many of the smaller teams to withdraw in the early to mid @-@ 1990s was a long @-@ term threat to the future of the sport . Alternatively , some saw Forti and similar tail @-@ enders as undeserving of a place in F1 , and it has been suggested that the imposition of the 107 % rule by the FIA in 1996 was a move to force them to raise their game or leave the sport altogether . 
 However , the Forti F1 cars have since been used for other purposes . Examples of the FG03 are currently being used as part of F1 @-@ themed track days in the United Kingdom at motor racing circuits such as Rockingham .

 = Marcel Lefebvre = 
 Marcel François Marie Joseph Lefebvre ( French : [ <unk> fʁɑ ̃ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; 29 November 1905 – 25 March 1991 ) was a French Roman Catholic archbishop . 
 Ordained a diocesan priest in 1929 , he joined the Holy Ghost Fathers for missionary work and was assigned to teach at a seminary in Gabon in 1932 . 
 In 1947 , he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Dakar , Senegal , and the next year as the Apostolic Delegate for West Africa . 
 Upon his return to Europe he was elected Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers and assigned to participate in the drafting and preparation of documents for the upcoming Council announced by Pope John XXIII , and was a major leader of the conservative bloc during its proceedings . He would later take the lead in opposing certain changes within the Church associated with the Second Vatican Council . 
 Refusing to implement council @-@ inspired reforms demanded by its members , he resigned from the leadership of the Holy Ghost Fathers in 1968 . 
 In 1970 , Lefebvre founded the Society of St. Pius X ( SSPX ) as a small community of seminarians in the village of Écône , Switzerland , with the permission of Bishop François <unk> of Fribourg . In 1975 , after a flare of tensions with the Holy See , Lefebvre was ordered to disband the society , but ignored the decision . 
 In 1988 , against the expressed prohibition of Pope John Paul II , he consecrated four bishops to continue his work with the SSPX . The Holy See immediately declared that he and the other bishops who had participated in the ceremony had incurred automatic excommunication under Catholic canon law , a status Lefebvre refused to acknowledge to his death three years later . 
 In 2009 , 18 years after Lefebvre 's death , Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunication of the four surviving bishops at their request but not to Lefebvre , therefore his excommunication remains until today . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Marcel Lefebvre was born in Tourcoing , Nord . He was the second son and third child of eight children of textile factory @-@ owner René Lefebvre and Gabrielle , born <unk> , who died in 1938 . 
 His parents were devout Catholics who brought their children to daily Mass . His father was an outspoken monarchist , devoting his life to the cause of the French Dynasty , seeing in a monarchy the only way of restoring to his country its past grandeur and a Christian revival . 
 Marcel 's father René had run a spy @-@ ring for British Intelligence when Tourcoing was occupied by the Germans during World War I. René would die at age 62 in 1944 in the German concentration camp at <unk> ( in East Brandenburg , Germany ) , where he had been imprisoned by the Gestapo because of his work for the French Resistance and British Intelligence ; the body was never recovered . 
 = = Initial priesthood = = 
 In 1923 Lefebvre began studies for the priesthood ; at the insistence of his father he followed his brother to the French Seminary in Rome , as his father suspected the diocesan seminaries of liberal leanings . He would later credit his conservative views to the rector , a Breton priest named Father Henri Le <unk> . His studies were interrupted in 1926 and 1927 when he did his military service . On 25 May 1929 he was ordained deacon by Cardinal Basilio <unk> in the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome . On 21 September 1929 he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop ( soon to be Cardinal ) Achille Liénart in Lille , the diocese in which he was incardinated . After ordination , he continued his studies in Rome , completing a doctorate in theology in July 1930 . 
 In August 1930 Cardinal Liénart assigned Lefebvre to be assistant curate in a parish in Lomme , a suburb of Lille . Even before this , Lefebvre had already asked to be released for missionary duties as a member of the Holy Ghost Fathers . But the cardinal insisted that he consider this for a year while he engaged in parish work in the Diocese of Lille . In July 1931 Liénart released Lefebvre from the diocese . In September Lefebvre entered the novitiate of the Holy Ghost Fathers at Orly . A year later , on 8 September 1932 , he took simple vows for a period of three years . 
 = = Holy Ghost Father = = 
 Lefebvre 's first assignment as a Holy Ghost Father was as a professor at St. John 's Seminary in Libreville , Gabon . In 1934 he was made rector of the seminary . On 28 September 1935 he made his perpetual vows . He served as superior of a number of missions of the Holy Ghost Fathers in Gabon . In October 1945 Lefebvre was ordered by the superior general to return to France and take up new duties as rector of the Holy Ghost Fathers seminary in Mortain . 
 = = = Bishop in Africa = = = 
 Lefebvre 's return to France was not to last long . On 12 June 1947 , Pope Pius XII appointed him Vicar Apostolic of Dakar in Senegal ; he received the titular episcopal see of <unk> ( El <unk> near Gaza in Palestine ) . On 18 September 1947 he was consecrated a bishop in his family 's parish church in Tourcoing by Achille Liénart ( who had previously ordained him a priest ) ; acting as co @-@ consecrators were Bishop Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> , <unk> and Bishop Alfred @-@ Jean @-@ Félix Ancel . 
 In his new position Lefebvre was responsible for an area with a population of three and a half million people , of whom only 50 @,@ 000 were Catholics . 
 On 22 September 1948 , Lefebvre , while continuing as Vicar Apostolic of Dakar , received additional responsibilities : Pope Pius XII appointed him Apostolic Delegate to French Africa . In this capacity he was the papal representative to the Church authorities in 46 dioceses " in continental and insular Africa subject to the French Government , with the addition of the Diocese of Reunion , the whole of the island of Madagascar and the other neighbouring islands under French rule , but excluding the dioceses of North Africa , namely those of Carthage , Constantine , Algiers and Oran . " With this new responsibility he was appointed Archbishop of the titular see of Arcadiopolis in Europa . 
 As Apostolic Delegate , Lefebvre 's chief duty was the building up of the ecclesiastical structure in French Africa . Pope Pius XII wanted to move quickly towards a proper hierarchy ( with bishops instead of vicariates and apostolic prefectures ) . Lefebvre was responsible for selecting these new bishops , increasing the number of priests and religious sisters , as well as the number of churches in the various dioceses . 
 On 14 September 1955 , the Apostolic Vicariate of Dakar became an archdiocese , and Lefebvre thus became the first Metropolitan Archbishop of Dakar . Archbishop Lefebvre was the first and foremost advisor to Pius XII during the writing of the encyclical Fidei <unk> ( 1957 ) , which instructed the clergy and laity on the missions in the Third World countries and called for more missionaries . 
 In 1958 Pope Pius XII died and was succeeded by Pope John XXIII , who , in 1959 , after giving Lefebvre the choice between remaining either as Apostolic Delegate or as Archbishop of Dakar , appointed another to the post of Apostolic Delegate for French Africa . Lefebvre continued as Archbishop of Dakar until 23 January 1962 , when he was transferred to the diocese of <unk> in France , retaining his personal title of archbishop . 
 = = Second Vatican Council = = 
 In 1960 , Pope John XXIII appointed Lefebvre to the Central Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council . Lefebvre took part in the discussions about the draft documents to be submitted to the bishops for consideration at the Council . 
 = = = Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers = = = 
 On 26 July 1962 the Chapter General of the Holy Ghost Fathers elected Lefebvre as the Superior General . Lefebvre was widely respected for his experience in the mission field . On the other hand , certain progressive members of his congregation , particularly in France , considered his administrative style authoritarian and desired radical reforms . On 7 August 1962 Lefebvre was given the titular archiepiscopal see of Synnada in Phrygia . 
 = = = Coetus Internationalis Patrum = = = 
 As a member of the Central Preparatory Commission the Archbishop worked for several years upon the draft documents which the Council Fathers were to discuss , a total of seventy @-@ two preparatory schemas . 
 Within the first two weeks of the first session of the Council ( October to December 1962 ) all seventy @-@ two of the preparatory schemas had been rejected from consideration . The council rules had stipulated a necessary two @-@ thirds supermajority to reject the schemas . Although only 60 % had voted against the schemas , they were regardless discarded at the intervention of Pope John XXIII , upon the request of the liberal Council Fathers . 
 Lefebvre became concerned about the direction the Council 's deliberations were taking , taking a leading part in a study group of bishops at the Council which became known as the Coetus Internationalis Patrum ( International Group of Fathers ) , with other traditional @-@ leaning bishops Antônio de Castro Mayer , Bishop of Campos and Geraldo de Proença <unk> , Archbishop of Diamantina . 
 A major area of concern at the Council was the debate about the principle of religious liberty . During the Council 's third session ( September to November 1964 ) Archbishop <unk> <unk> announced that Lefebvre , with two other like @-@ minded bishops , was appointed to a special four @-@ member commission charged with rewriting the draft document on the topic , but it was soon discovered that this measure did not have papal approval , and major responsibility for preparing the draft document was given to the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity . Instead of the draft entitled " On Religious Liberty " , Lefebvre and Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani had supported instead a text dealing with " Relations between the Church and State , and religious tolerance . " 
 The Coetus Internationalis Patrum did , however , manage to get the preliminary vote ( with suggestions for modifications ) on the document put off until the fourth session of the Council , but were unable to prevent the adoption , on 7 December 1965 , of the final text of the declaration <unk> <unk> by the overwhelming majority of the Council . The expressed view of some that this overwhelming majority was only due to intense lobbying by the reformist wing of Council Fathers among those prelates who initially had reservations or even objections , however , is not accepted by all observers . Lefebvre was one of those who voted against the declaration , but he was one of those who added their signature to the document , after that of the Pope , though not all present did sign . Lefebvre later declared that the sheet of paper that he signed and that was " passed from hand to hand among the Fathers of the Council and upon which everyone placed his signature , had no meaning of a vote for or against , but signified simply our presence at the meeting to vote for four documents . " However , the paper on which his signature appears , and which was not " the relatively unimportant attendance sheet which Lefebvre recalled in his interview " , bears " the title <unk> de <unk> Religiosa ( along with the titles of three other documents ) at the top , " and " ( t ) he fathers were informed that if they wished to sign one or more documents , but not all of them , they could make a marginal annotation beside their name , specifying which documents they did or did not wish to sign . No such annotation is found beside the names of either Lefebvre or de Castro Mayer , which proves that they were prepared to share in the official promulgation of that Declaration on Religious Liberty which they later publicly rejected . " 
 = = = Padre Pio and Marcel Lefebvre = = = 
 In April 1967 , three years before founding the SSPX , Archbishop Lefebvre ( left ) briefly met the Italian saint and mystic Padre Pio of <unk> to ask his blessing on a forthcoming general chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers . 
 Pascal <unk> , a priest claiming to be an associate of Padre Pio , claimed in the book " Padre Pio Gleanings " that the saint had prophesied about <unk> . Lefebvre . He wrote : 
 " Padre Pio looked at Lefebvre very sternly and said : " Never cause discord among your brothers and always practise the rule of obedience ; above all when it seems to you that the errors of those in authority are all the more serious . There is no other road than that of obedience , especially for those of us who have made this vow . " ... It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not see things in quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with : " I will remember that , Father . " Padre Pio looked at him intensely and , seeing what would soon happen , said : " No ! You will forget it ! You will tear apart the community of faithful , oppose the will of your superiors and even go against the orders of the pope himself and this will happen quite soon ... " 
 However , Lefebvre dismissed the allegation as a " slander , a fabrication " , giving his own account of the event , as well as photographic evidence backing his counter @-@ claim : 
 " The meeting which took place after Easter in 1967 lasted two minutes … I told him in a few words the purpose of my visit : for him to bless the Congregation of the Holy Ghost which was due to hold an extraordinary General Chapter meeting … Then Padre Pio cried out . ' Me , bless an archbishop , no , no , it is you who should be blessing me ! ' And he bowed , to receive the blessing . I blessed him , he kissed my ring and continued on his way to the confessional ... That was the whole of the meeting , no more , no less ... " 
 Author Griff Ruby pointed out that Padre Pio had no known associate or acquaintance by the name " Pascal <unk> " . 
 = = = Resignation from the Holy Ghost Fathers = = = 
 Lefebvre was increasingly criticized by influential members of his large religious congregation who considered him to be out @-@ of @-@ step with modern Church leaders and the demand of the bishops ' conferences , particularly in France , for modernization and reforms . An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate the direction of the congregation after the changes of the Second Vatican Council . The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter 's sessions instead of Lefebvre . Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI . He would later say that it had become impossible for him to remain superior of an institute that no longer wanted or listened to him . 
 = = Theological and political positions = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Lefebvre belonged to an identifiable strand of right @-@ wing political and religious opinion in French society that originated among the defeated royalists after the 1789 French Revolution . Lefebvre 's political and theological outlook mirrored that of a significant number of conservative members of French society under the French Third Republic ( 1870 – 1940 ) . The Third Republic was <unk> by conflicts between the secular Left and the Catholic Right , with many individuals on both sides espousing distinctly radical positions ( see , for example , the article on the famous Dreyfus affair ) . Thus it has been said that " Lefebvre was ... a man formed by the bitter hatreds that defined the battle lines in French society and culture from the French Revolution to the Vichy regime " . 
 Lefebvre 's first biographer , the English traditionalist writer Michael Davies , wrote in the first volume of his Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre : 
 In France political feeling tends to be more polarized , more extreme , and far more deeply felt than in England . It can only be understood in the light of the French Revolution and subsequent history ... At the risk of a serious over @-@ simplification , it is reasonable to state that up to the Second World War Catholicism in France tended to be identified with right @-@ wing politics and anti @-@ Catholicism with the left ... [ Lefebvre 's ] own alleged right @-@ wing political philosophy is nothing more than straight @-@ forward Catholic social teaching as expounded by the Popes for a century or more ... 
 In similar vein , the pro @-@ SSPX English priest Fr . Michael Crowdy wrote , in his preface to his translation of Lefebvre 's Open Letter to Confused Catholics : 
 We must remember that Lefebvre is writing against the background of France , where ideas are generally more clear ‑ cut than they are in Great Britain .... Take the word " socialism , " for example ; that means to some of us , first and foremost , a social ideal of brotherhood and justice . We have had our Christian socialists . On the Continent , however , Socialism is uncompromisingly anti ‑ religious , or almost a substitute for religion , and Communism is seen as the natural development from it . This is the Socialism the Archbishop is writing about . And when he rejects Liberalism , he is not thinking of the [ British ] Liberal Party ... but of that religious liberalism that exalts human liberty above the claims of God or of His Church ... 
 = = = Theological positions = = = 
 Lefebvre was associated with the following positions : 
 The rejection of ecumenism in favor of Catholic exclusivism ; 
 The espousal of pragmatic religious tolerance instead of the principle of religious liberty ; 
 The rejection of collegiality within the Church in favor of strict Papal supremacy ; 
 Opposition to the replacement of the Tridentine Mass with the Mass of Paul VI . 
 Lefebvre , however , forbade the members of his society from questioning the validity of the reigning Popes , only the prudence of their decisions , referring to <unk> ideology as " imprudent " . 
 = = = Political positions = = = 
 Political positions espoused by Lefebvre included the following : 
 Condemnation of the 1789 French Revolution and what he called its " Masonic and anti @-@ Catholic principles " . 
 Support for the " Catholic order " of the authoritarian French Vichy government ( 1940 – 1944 ) of Marshal Philippe Pétain . 
 Support for authoritarian governments . In 1985 , he spoke approvingly of the governments of Francisco Franco of Spain and António Salazar of Portugal , noting that their neutrality in World War II had spared their peoples the suffering of the war . 
 Support for the French nationalist leader Jean @-@ Marie le Pen . In 1985 , the French periodical <unk> quoted Lefebvre as endorsing Le Pen on the grounds that he was the only leading French politician who was clearly opposed to abortion . 
 Opposition to Muslim immigration into Europe . In 1990 , Lefebvre was convicted in a French court and sentenced to pay a fine of 5 @,@ 000 francs when he stated in this connection that " it is your wives , your daughters , your children who will be kidnapped and dragged off to a certain kind of places [ sic ] as they exist in Casablanca " .

 After retiring from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers , Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure , the rite by which , until 1973 , a seminarian became a cleric . They asked for a conservative seminary to complete their studies . After directing them to the University of Fribourg , Switzerland , Lefebvre was urged to teach these seminarians personally . In 1969 , he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students , moving to Écône , Switzerland in 1971 . 
 Lefebvre proposed to his seminarians the establishment of a society of priests without vows . In November 1970 , Bishop François <unk> of Fribourg established , on a provisional ( ad <unk> ) basis for six years , the International Priestly Society of Saint Pius X ( SSPX ) as a " pious union " . 
 = = = Initial attempts at suppression = = = 
 In November 1972 , the bishops of France , gathered as the Plenary Assembly of French Bishops at Lourdes , whose theological outlook was quite different from Lefebvre 's , treated the then @-@ legal Écône seminary with suspicion and referred to it as Séminaire sauvage or " Outlaw Seminary " . They indicated that they would <unk> none of the seminarians . Cardinal Secretary of State Cardinal <unk> accused Lefebvre before Pope Paul VI of making his seminarians sign a condemnation of the Pope , which Lefebvre vigorously denied . 
 = = = Apostolic Visitors = = = 
 In November 1974 , two Belgian priests carried out a rigorous inspection on the instructions of a commission of cardinals , producing , it was said , a favourable report . However , while at Écône , they expressed a number of theological opinions , such as that ordination of married men will soon be a normal thing , that truth changed with the times , and the traditional conception of the Resurrection of Our Lord were open to discussion , which the seminarians and staff objected to as scandalous . In what he later described as a mood of " doubtlessly excessive indignation " , Lefebvre wrote a " Declaration " in which he strongly attacked the modernist and liberal trends that he saw as apparent in the reforms being undertaken within the Church at that time . 
 " We adhere with all our heart and all our soul to Catholic Rome , guardian of the Catholic Faith and the traditions necessary to maintain it , and to Eternal Rome , mistress of wisdom and truth . On the other hand we refuse and have always refused to follow the Rome of the neo @-@ Modernist and the new Protestant trend which was clearly evident in the Second Vatican Council and , after the Council in all the reforms which flowed from it . " 
 The Commission of Cardinals declared in reply that the declaration was " unacceptable on all points " . 
 In January 1975 the new Bishop of Fribourg , Mgr . Pierre Mamie , stated his wish to withdraw the SSPX 's pious union status . 
 On 13 February , Lefebvre then was invited to Rome for a meeting with the commission of Cardinals , which he described as " a close cross examination of the judicial type " , regarding the contents of his " Declaration " , followed by a second on 3 March . In May , the commission issued a notification that it had decided to grant approval to the Mgr . Mamie to carry out his intentions , with Lefebvre arguing that according to Canon 493 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law , only the Pope , which he interpreted to mean a direct decree from the Pope rather than mere retroactive approbation , could suppress a religious congregation . 
 The Bishop put his intention into effect on 6 May 1975 , thereby officially dissolving the Society . This action was subsequently upheld by Pope Paul VI , who wrote to Archbishop Lefebvre in June 1975 . Lefebvre continued his work regardless because " having taken legal advice from competent canon lawyers who advised him that , despite the letter from Pope Paul dated 29 June 1975 , the entire legal process taken against the Fraternity had been so irregular that it could not be considered as having been legally suppressed . The Archbishop was further advised that , as the Vatican had permitted priests to be incardinated directly into the Fraternity on three separate occasions , it could be considered that the privilege of <unk> priests directly into the Fraternity now existed . " Lefebvre also argued that there were insufficient grounds for suppression as the Apostolic Visitors , by the Commission 's own admission , delivered a positive report , and that since his Declaration had not been condemned by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( CDF , formerly known as the Holy Office , or Inquisition ) , he appealed , twice , to the appellate court of the Church , the Apostolic Signatura . Cardinal <unk> blocked the move , reportedly threatening the Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura Cardinal Staffa with dismissal if the appeals were not struck out . 
 In May 1977 , Mamie warned Marcel Lefebvre that saying a Mass in the Tridentine Rite could be a break with orthodox Catholicism . 
 = = = Clash with the Vatican = = = 
 In the consistory of 24 May 1976 , Pope Paul VI criticized Archbishop Lefebvre by name and appealed to him and his followers to change their minds . 
 On 29 June 1976 , Lefebvre went ahead with planned priestly ordinations without the approval of the local Bishop and despite receiving letters from Rome forbidding them . As a result Lefebvre was suspended a <unk> <unk> , i.e. , forbidden to ordain any priests . A week later , the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops informed him that , to have his situation regularized , he needed to ask the Pope 's pardon . Lefebvre responded with a letter claiming that the modernisation of the Church was a " compromise with the ideas of modern man " originating in a secret agreement between high dignitaries in the Church and senior Freemasons prior to the Council . Lefebvre was then notified that , since he had not apologised to the Pope , he was suspended a <unk> , i.e. , he could no longer legally administer any of the sacraments . Lefebvre remarked that he had been forbidden from celebrating the new rite of Mass . Pope Paul VI apparently took this seriously and stated that Lefebvre " thought he dodged the penalty by administering the sacraments using the previous formulas . " In spite of his suspension , Lefebvre continued to pray Mass and to administer the other Sacraments , including the conferral of Holy Orders to the students of his seminary . 
 Pope Paul VI received Lefebvre in audience on 11 September 1976 , and one month later wrote to him admonishing him and , repeating the appeal he had made at the audience . Pope John Paul II received Lefebvre in audience sixty days after his 1978 election , again without reaching agreement . 
 = = <unk> consecrations = = 
 In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre , at age 81 , experiencing failing health , announced his intention to consecrate a bishop to carry on his work after his death . This was controversial because , under Catholic canon law , the consecration of a bishop requires the permission of the Pope . 
 On 5 May 1988 , Lefebvre signed an agreement with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( the future Pope Benedict XVI ) , who was then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , to regularize the situation of the Society of St Pius X. The cardinal agreed that one bishop would be consecrated for the society . 
 = = = " Operation Survival " = = = 
 Shortly after , however , Lefebvre announced that he had received a note from Cardinal Ratzinger in which he " was asked to beg pardon for [ his ] errors " and thereupon decided that he was obliged both to reject the arrangement he had agreed to and to consecrate a successor — if necessary , without papal approval . As Cardinal Ratzinger did not specify a date for the episcopal consecration , should he have died before the consecration was granted , the Society would be unable to ordain any seminarians and thus forced into capitulation with the Holy See . He dubbed his plan " Operation Survival " . 
 " That is why , taking into account the strong will of the present Roman authorities to reduce Tradition to naught , to gather the world to the spirit of Vatican II and the spirit of Assisi , we have preferred to withdraw ourselves and to say that we could not continue . It was not possible . We would have evidently been under the authority of Cardinal Ratzinger , President of the Roman Commission , which would have directed us ; we were putting ourselves into his hands , and consequently putting ourselves into the hands of those who wish to draw us into the spirit of the Council and the spirit of Assisi . This was simply not possible . " 
 The Pope appealed to him not to proceed in " a schismatic act " , warning of " theological and canonical consequences " . 
 On 30 June 1988 , Archbishop Lefebvre , with Bishop Emeritus Antônio de Castro Mayer of Campos , Brazil , as co @-@ consecrator , consecrated four SSPX priests as bishops : Bernard Tissier de Mallerais , Richard Williamson , Alfonso de Galarreta and Bernard <unk> . 
 Shortly before the consecrations , Lefebvre gave the following sermon : 
 " ... this ceremony , which is apparently done against the will of Rome , is in no way a schism . We are not schismatics ! If an excommunication was pronounced against the bishops of China , who separated themselves from Rome and put themselves under the Chinese government , one very easily understands why Pope Pius XII excommunicated them . There is no question of us separating ourselves from Rome , nor of putting ourselves under a foreign government , nor of establishing a sort of parallel church as the Bishops of <unk> de <unk> have done in Spain . They have even elected a pope , formed a college of cardinals ... It is out of the question for us to do such things . Far from us be this miserable thought to separate ourselves from Rome ! " 
 The next day , 1 July , the Congregation for Bishops issued a decree stating that this was a schismatic act and that all six people directly involved had thereby incurred automatic excommunication . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 On 2 July , Pope John Paul II condemned the consecration in his apostolic letter Ecclesia Dei , in which he stated that the consecration constituted a schismatic act and that by virtue of Canon 1382 of the Code of Canon Law , the bishops and priests involved were automatically excommunicated . 
 Lefebvre declared that he and the other clerics involved had not " separated themselves from Rome " and were therefore not schismatic . He invoked canon 1323 of the 1983 Code of Canon law that they " found themselves in a case of necessity " , not having succeeded , as they said , in making " Rome " understand that " this change which has occurred in the Church " since the Second Vatican Council was " not Catholic " . In a letter addressed to the four priests he was about to consecrate as bishops , Lefebvre wrote : " I do not think one can say that Rome has not lost the Faith . " 
 On July 18 , twelve priests and a some seminarians , led by Father Josef <unk> left the SSPX due to the <unk> <unk> . Father Josef <unk> became the first superior general of the newly formed Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter , coming to a compromise with and placing themselves under the Holy See . 
 = = Death = = 
 Lefebvre died on 25 March 1991 at the age of 85 from cancer in Martigny , Switzerland , less than three years after being excommunicated for carrying out the episcopal consecrations . Eight days later he was buried in the crypt at the society 's international seminary in Écône , Switzerland . Archbishop Edoardo <unk> , Apostolic Nuncio to Switzerland , and Bishop Henri <unk> of Sion , the local diocese , came and prayed at the body of the dead prelate . Later that year , on 18 September 1991 , Cardinal Silvio Oddi , who had been Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy from 1979 to 1986 , visited Lefebvre 's tomb , knelt down at it and prayed , afterwards saying aloud : " Merci , Monseigneur " . Thereafter Cardinal Oddi said he held Lefebvre to have been " a holy man " and suggested that the Society of St Pius X could be granted a personal prelature by the Holy See like that of Opus Dei . In January 1992 , the then @-@ superior general of the society , Fr . Franz <unk> , rejected this hypothetical offer by an unpublished private letter to the Holy See . The letter 's content was described by Bishop Richard Williamson ( subsequently expelled from the SSPX ) as basically saying that , " as long as Rome remains Conciliar , a fruitful and open collaboration between the two [ the SSPX and the Holy See ] does not seem possible . " 
 = = = Lifting of excommunications = = = 
 In 2009 , at the request of the four surviving bishops , Pope Benedict XVI lifted their excommunications . 
 The episcopal lineage originated by the 1988 consecrations amounts to 8 bishops as of 2016 , out of whom 7 are alive :

 = Michael Myers ( Halloween ) = 
 Michael Myers is a character from the Halloween series of slasher films . He first appears in John Carpenter 's Halloween ( 1978 ) as a young boy who murders his older sister , then fifteen years later returns home to murder more teenagers . In the original Halloween , the adult Michael Myers , referred to as The Shape in the closing credits , was portrayed by Nick Castle for most of the film , with Tony Moran and Tommy Lee Wallace substituting in during the final scenes . The character was created by Debra Hill and John Carpenter and has appeared in nine films , as well as novels , a video game , and several comic books . 
 The character is the primary antagonist in the Halloween film series , except Halloween III : Season of the Witch , which is not connected in continuity to the rest of the films . Since Castle , Moran , and Wallace put on the mask in the original film , six people have stepped into the role . Tyler Mane is the only actor to have portrayed Michael Myers in consecutive films , and one of only two actors to portray the character more than once . Michael Myers is characterized as pure evil , both directly in the films , by the filmmakers who created and developed the character over nine films , as well as by random participants in a survey . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 Michael Myers is the primary antagonist in all of the Halloween films except Halloween III : Season of the Witch , which does not feature any of the characters from the preceding two films and had nothing to do with Michael Myers . Michael returned following Halloween III , in the aptly titled Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers . The silver screen is not the only place Michael Myers has appeared : there have been literary sources that have created an expanded universe for Michael Myers . 
 = = = Films = = = 
 Michael Myers made his first appearance in the original 1978 film , Halloween , although the masked character is credited as " The Shape " in the first two films . In the beginning of Halloween , a six @-@ year @-@ old Michael ( Will Sandin ) murders his teenage sister Judith ( Sandy Johnson ) on Halloween , 1963 . Fifteen years later , Michael ( Nick Castle ) escapes Smith 's Grove Sanitarium and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield , Illinois . He stalks teenage babysitter Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) on Halloween , while his psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) attempts to track him down . Murdering her friends , Michael finally attacks Laurie , but she manages to fend him off long enough for Loomis to save her . Loomis shoots Michael six times , before Michael falls over the house 's second @-@ story balcony ledge ; when Loomis goes to check Michael 's body , he finds it missing . Michael returns in the sequel , Halloween II ( 1981 ) . The film picks up directly where the original ends , with Dr. Loomis still looking for Michael . Michael ( Dick Warlock ) follows Laurie Strode ( Curtis ) to the local hospital , where he wanders the halls in search of her , killing security guards , doctors , and nurses that get in his way . Loomis learns that Laurie Strode is Michael 's younger sister , and rushes to the hospital to find them . He causes an explosion in the operating theater , allowing Laurie to escape as he and Michael are engulfed by the flames . 
 Michael Myers does not appear in Halloween III : Season of the Witch , which does not include any story elements from the first two installments . Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers ( 1988 ) picks the story up ten years after the events of Halloween II . Michael ( George P. Wilbur ) and Dr. Loomis are revealed to have survived the explosion , although Michael has been in a coma at the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium for a decade . Michael wakes from his coma when he learns Laurie Strode has died , but also learns that she has a seven @-@ year @-@ old daughter , Jamie Lloyd ( Danielle Harris ) . Returning to Haddonfield , he causes a city @-@ wide blackout and massacres the town 's police force , before being shot down a mine shaft by the state police . Halloween 5 : The Revenge of Michael Myers ( 1989 ) begins immediately after the fourth film ends , with Michael Myers ( Donald L. Shanks ) escaping the mine shaft and being nursed back to health by a local hermit . The next year , Michael kills the hermit and returns to Haddonfield to find Jamie ( Harris ) again , chasing her through his childhood home in a trap set up by Loomis ( Pleasence ) . Michael is eventually captured and taken to the local police station , but an unseen figure kills the officers and frees him . Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers ( 1995 ) takes place six years after the events of The Revenge of Michael Myers ; both Jamie ( J. C. Brandy ) and Michael ( Wilbur ) have disappeared from Haddonfield . Jamie has been kidnapped and impregnated by the Cult of Thorn , led by Dr. Terence Wynn ( Mitchell Ryan ) , Loomis ' friend and colleague from Smith 's Grove . Wynn is revealed to have been manipulating Michael Myers all along , and was his mysterious savior in Halloween 5 . Michael kills Jamie , but not before she hides her infant , who is discovered and taken in by Tommy Doyle ( Paul Rudd ) . While trying to protect the baby from Michael and Wynn , Tommy learns that the cult may be the cause of Michael 's obsession with killing his entire family , in addition to his seemingly supernatural abilities . 
 Ignoring the events of the previous three films , Halloween H20 : 20 Years Later ( 1998 ) establishes that Michael Myers ( Chris Durand ) has been missing since the explosion in 1978 . Laurie Strode ( Curtis ) has faked her death to escape her brother , and is now living in California under an assumed name with her teenage son John ( Josh Hartnett ) . On the twentieth anniversary of their last meeting , Michael tracks Laurie and her son to the private boarding school where she is headmistress , and murders John 's friends . Getting her son to safety , Laurie willingly goes back to face Michael , and succeeds in decapitating him . Halloween : Resurrection ( 2002 ) , which picks up three years after H20 , retcons Michael 's death , establishing that the man Laurie decapitated was a paramedic whom Michael had attacked and swapped clothes with . Michael ( Brad Loree ) tracks down an institutionalized Laurie ( Curtis ) and kills her . Returning to Haddonfield , he finds and kills a group of college students filming an internet reality show inside his childhood home . Contestant Sara Moyer ( Bianca <unk> ) and show producer Freddie Harris ( Busta Rhymes ) escape by trapping Michael in a burning garage . 
 A new version of Michael Myers appears in Rob Zombie 's Halloween ( 2007 ) , a reboot of the franchise . The film follows the basic premise of the original film , with an increased focus on Michael 's childhood : ten @-@ year @-@ old Michael ( Daeg Faerch ) is shown killing animals and suffering verbal abuse from Judith ( Hanna R. Hall ) and his mother 's boyfriend Ronnie ( William Forsythe ) , both of whom he later murders . During his time in Smith 's Grove , Michael takes up the hobby of creating papier @-@ mâché masks and receives unsuccessful therapy from Dr. Sam Loomis ( Malcolm McDowell ) . As an adult , Michael ( Tyler Mane ) returns to Haddonfield to reunite with his beloved younger sister Laurie ( Scout Taylor @-@ Compton ) . Laurie , however , is terrified of him and ends up shooting him in self @-@ defense . Zombie 's story is continued in the sequel , Halloween II ( 2009 ) , which picks up right where the remake leaves off and then jumps ahead one year . Here , Michael ( Mane ) is presumed dead , but resurfaces after a vision of his deceased mother Deborah ( Sheri Moon Zombie ) informs him that he must track Laurie ( Taylor @-@ Compton ) down so that they can " come home " . In the film , Michael and Laurie have a mental link , with the two sharing visions of their mother . During the film 's climax , Laurie apparently kills Michael by stabbing him repeatedly in the chest and face with his own knife . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Michael Myers made his literary debut in October 1979 when Curtis Richards released a novelization of the film . The book follows the events of the film , but includes references to the festival of Samhain . A prologue provides a possible explanation for Michael 's murderous impulses , telling the story of Enda , a disfigured Celtic teenager who butchers the Druid princess Deirdre and her lover as revenge for rejecting him ; the king subsequently has his shaman curse Enda 's soul to walk the earth reliving his crime for eternity . It is later revealed that Michael Myers suffers nightmares about Enda and Deirdre , as did Michael 's great @-@ grandfather before shooting to death two people at a Halloween harvest dance in the 1890s . The novel shows Michael 's childhood in more detail ; his mother voices concern over her son 's anti @-@ social behavior shortly before he murders Judith , and Dr. Loomis notices the boy 's effortless control and manipulation of the staff and patients at Smith 's Grove during his incarceration . Later in the story , Michael 's stalking of Laurie and her friends is depicted as more explicitly sexual than was apparent in the film , with several references to him having an erection . Michael returned to the world of literature with the 1981 adaptation of Halloween II written by Jack Martin ; it was published alongside the first film sequel , with the novel following the film events , with an additional victim , a reporter , added to the novel . The final novelization to feature Michael was Halloween IV , released October 1988 . The novel was written by Nicholas <unk> , and like the previous adaptations , follows the events of Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers . 
 Over a four @-@ month period , Berkley Books published three young adult novels written by Kelly O 'Rourke ; the novels are original stories created by O 'Rourke , with no direct continuity with the films . The first , released on 1 October 1997 , titled The Scream Factory , follows a group of friends who set up a haunted house attraction in the basement of Haddonfield City Hall , only to be stalked and killed by Michael Myers while they are there . The Old Myers Place is the second novel , released 1 December 1997 , and focuses on Mary White , who moves into the Myers house with her family and takes up residence in Judith Myers ' former bedroom . Michael returns home and begins stalking and attacking Mary and her friends . O 'Rourke 's final novel , The Mad House , was released on 1 February 1998 . The Mad House features a young girl , Christine Ray , who joins a documentary film crew that travels to haunted locations ; they are currently headed to Smith Grove Mental Hospital . The crew is quickly confronted by Michael Myers . 
 The character 's first break into comics came with a series of comics published by Brian Pulido 's Chaos ! Comics . The first , simply titled Halloween , was intended to be a one @-@ issue special , but eventually two sequels spawned : Halloween II : The Blackest Eyes and Halloween III : The Devil 's Eyes . All of the stories were written by Phil <unk> , with Daniel Farrands — writer for Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers — assisting on the first issue ; David Brewer and <unk> worked on the illustrations . Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues , focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers . The first issue includes backstory on Michael 's childhood , while the third picks up after the events of the film Halloween H20 . 
 In 2003 , Michael appeared in the self @-@ published comic One Good Scare , written by Stefan Hutchinson and illustrated by Peter Fielding . The main character in the comic is Lindsey Wallace , the young girl who first saw Michael Myers alongside Tommy Doyle in the original 1978 film . Hutchinson wanted to bring the character back to his roots , and away from the " lumbering Jason @-@ clone " the film sequels had made him . On 25 July 2006 , as an insert inside the DVD release of Halloween : 25 Years of Terror , the comic book Halloween : Autopsis was released . Written by Stefan Hutchinson and artwork by Marcus Smith and Nick Dismas , the story is about a photographer assigned to take pictures of Michael Myers . As the photographer , Carter , follows Dr. Loomis ; he begins to take on Loomis 's obsession himself , until finally meeting Michael Myers in person , which results in his death . 
 In 2008 , Devil 's Due Publishing began releasing more Halloween comic books , starting with a four issue mini series , titled Halloween : Nightdance . Written by Stefan Hutchinson , Nightdance takes place in Russellville , and follows Michael 's obsession with Lisa Thomas , a girl who reminds him of his sister Judith . Lisa is afraid of the dark after Michael trapped her in a basement for days , and years later , he starts sending her disturbing , childlike drawings and murdering those around her on Halloween . Meanwhile , Ryan Nichols is hunting Michael down after seeing him attack and kidnap his wife . In the end , Michael frames Ryan for the murders and buries Lisa alive . Hutchinson explains that Nightdance was an attempt to escape the dense continuity of the film series and recreate the tone of the 1978 film ; Michael becomes inexplicably fixated on Lisa , just as he did with Laurie in the original Halloween , before the sequels established that a sibling bond was actually his motivation for stalking her . Included in the Nightdance trade paperback is the short prose story Charlie , which features Charlie Bowles , a Russellville serial killer who taps into the same evil force which motivates Michael Myers . To celebrate the anniversary of the Halloween series , Devil 's Due released a one @-@ shot comic entitled Halloween : 30 Years of Terror in August 2008 , written by Hutchinson . An anthology collection inspired by John Carpenter 's original film , Michael appears in various stories , tampering with Halloween candy , decapitating a beauty queen , tormenting Laurie Strode , and killing a school teacher . 
 = = Characterization = = 
 A common characterization is that Michael Myers is evil . John Carpenter has described the character as " almost a supernatural force - a force of nature . An evil force that 's loose , " a force that is " <unk> " . Professor Nicholas Rogers elaborates , " Myers is depicted as a mythic , elusive bogeyman , one of superhuman strength who cannot be killed by bullets , stab wounds , or fire . " Carpenter 's inspiration for the " evil " that Michael would embody came when he was in college . While on a class trip at a mental institution in Kentucky , Carpenter visited " the most serious , mentally ill patients " . Among those patients was a young boy around twelve to thirteen years @-@ old . The boy gave this " schizophrenic stare " , " a real evil stare " , which Carpenter found " unsettling " , " creepy " , and " completely insane " . Carpenter 's experience would inspire the characterization that Loomis would give of Michael to Sheriff Brackett in the original film . Debra Hill has stated the scene where Michael kills the Wallaces ' German Shepherd was done to illustrate how he is " really evil and deadly " . 
 The ending scene of Michael being shot six times , and then disappearing from the ground outside the house , was meant to terrify the imagination of the audience . Carpenter tried to keep the audience guessing as to who Michael Myers really is — he is gone , and everywhere at the same time ; he is more than human ; he may be supernatural , and no one knows how he got that way . To Carpenter , keeping the audience guessing was better than explaining away the character with " he 's cursed by some ... " For Josh Hartnett , who portrayed John Tate in Halloween H20 , " it 's that abstract , it 's easier for me to be afraid of it . You know , someone who just kind of appears and , you know [ mimics stabbing noise from Psycho ] instead of an actual human who you think you can talk to . And no remorse , it 's got no feelings , that 's the most frightening , definitely . " Richard Schickel , film critic for TIME , felt Michael was " irrational " and " really angry about something " , having what Schickel referred to as " a kind of primitive , obsessed intelligence " . Schickel considered this the " definition of a good monster " , by making the character appear " less than human " , but having enough intelligence " to be dangerous " . 
 Dominique <unk> @-@ Girard attempted to have audiences " relate to ' Evil ' , to Michael Myers 's ' ill ' side " . Girard wanted Michael to appear " more human [ ... ] even vulnerable , with contradicting feelings inside of him " . He illustrated these feelings with a scene where Michael removes his mask and sheds a tear . Girard explains , " Again , to humanize him , to give him a tear . If Evil or in this case our boogeyman knows pain , or love or demonstrate a feeling of regrets ; he becomes even more scary to me if he pursues his <unk> action . He shows an evil determination beyond his feelings . Dr. Loomis tries to reach his emotional side several times in [ Halloween 5 ] . He thinks he could cure Michael through his feelings . " 
 Daniel Farrands , writer of The Curse of Michael Myers , describes the character as a " sexual deviant " . According to him , the way Michael follows girls around and watches them contains a subtext of repressed sexuality . Farrands theorizes that , as a child , Michael became fixated on the murder of his sister Judith , and for his own twisted reasons felt the need to repeat that action over and over again , finding a sister @-@ like figure in Laurie who excited him sexually . He also believes that by making Laurie , Michael 's literal sister , the sequels took away from the simplicity and relatability of the original Halloween . Nevertheless , when writing Curse , Farrands was tasked with creating a mythology for Michael which defined his motives and why he could not be killed . He says , " He can 't just be a man anymore , he 's gone beyond that . He 's mythical . He 's supernatural . So , I took it from that standpoint that there 's something else driving him . A force that goes beyond that five senses that has infected this boy 's soul and now is driving him . " As the script developed and more people became involved , Farrands admits that the film went too far in explaining Michael Myers and that he himself was not completely satisfied with the finished product . 
 Michael does not speak in the films ; the first time audiences ever hear his voice is in the 2007 Rob Zombie reboot . Michael speaks as a child during the beginning of the film , but while in Smith 's Grove he stops talking completely . Rob Zombie originally planned to have the adult Michael speak to Laurie in the film 's finale , simply saying his childhood nickname for her , " Boo " . Zombie explained that this version was not used because he was afraid having the character talk at that point would demystify him too much , and because the act of Michael handing Laurie the photograph of them together was enough . 
 Describing aspects of Michael Myers which he wanted to explore in the comic book Halloween : Nightdance , writer Stefan Hutchinson mentions the character 's " bizarre and dark sense of humor " , as seen when he wore a sheet over his head to trick a girl into thinking he was her boyfriend , and the satisfaction he gets from scaring the characters before he murders them , such as letting Laurie know he is stalking her . Hutchinson feels there is a perverse nature to Michael 's actions : " see the difference between how he watches and pursues women to men " . He also suggests that Michael Myers ' hometown of Haddonfield is the cause of his behavior , likening his situation to that of Jack the Ripper , citing Myers as a " product of normal <unk> - all the repressed emotion of fake Norman Rockwell smiles " . Hutchinson describes Michael as a " monster of abjection " . When asked his opinion of Rob Zombie 's expansion on Michael 's family life , Hutchinson says that explaining why Michael does what he does " [ reduces ] the character " . That being said , Hutchinson explores the nature of evil in the short story Charlie — included in the Halloween Nightdance trade paperback — and says that Michael Myers spent fifteen years " <unk> himself to this force to the point where he is , as Loomis says , ' pure evil ' " . Nightdance artist Tim Seeley describes the character 's personality in John Carpenter 's 1978 film as " a void " , which allows the character to be more open to interpretation than the later sequels allowed him . He surmises that Michael embodies a part of everyone ; a part people are afraid will one day " snap and knife someone " , which lends to the fear that Michael creates on screen . 
 In 2005 , a study was conducted by the Media Psychology Lab of California State University , Los Angeles on the psychological appeal of movie monsters — Vampires , Freddy Krueger , Frankenstein 's monster , Jason Voorhees , Godzilla , Chucky , Hannibal Lecter , King Kong , The Alien , and the shark from Jaws — which surveyed 1 @,@ 166 people nationwide ( United States ) , with ages ranging from 16 to 91 . It was published in the Journal of Media Psychology . In the survey , Michael was considered to be the " embodiment of pure evil " ; when compared to the other characters , Michael Myers was rated the highest . Michael was characterized lending to the understanding of insanity , being ranked second to Hannibal Lecter in this category ; he also placed first as the character who shows audiences the " dark side of human nature " . He was rated second in the category " monster enjoys killing " by the participants , and believed to have " superhuman strength " . Michael was rated highest among the characters in the " monster is an outcast " category .

 In Robot Chicken 's nineteenth episode , " That Hurts Me " , Michael Myers ( voiced by Seth Green ) appears as a housemate of " Horror Movie Big Brother " , alongside fellow horror movie killers Jason Voorhees , Ghostface , Freddy Krueger , Pinhead , and Leatherface . Myers is evicted from the house , and takes off his mask to reveal himself to be the comedian Mike Myers , and utters his Austin Powers catchphrase , " I feel randy , baby , yeah !

Here , a spirit communicates with Hewitt 's character by placing her in scenes from the deceased 's favorite horror movies , and one of the scenes involved Michael Myers . The Cold Case episode " Bad Night " has the main characters reopening a 1978 murder case after new evidence indicates the victim was not killed by a mentally disturbed man who , after seeing Halloween in theatres , went on a killing spree dressed as Michael . Michael Myers makes a cameo appearance in Rob Zombie 's The Haunted World of El <unk> , released on 22 September 2009 . Michael Myers also makes an appearance in the DLC pack for the video game Call of Duty : Ghosts , Onslaught , as a playable character . 
 In one of the various <unk> to feature the character , Michael Myers made his video game debut with the 1983 Atari video game Halloween . The game is rare to find , often being played on emulators . No characters from the films are specifically named , with the goal of the game focusing on the player , who is a babysitter , protecting children from a " homicidal maniac [ who ] has escaped from a mental institution " . Michael was one of several horror icons to be included in the 2009 version of Universal Studios Hollywood 's Halloween Horror Nights event , as a part of a maze entitled Halloween : The Life and Crimes of Michael Myers . Pop artist Eric Millikin created a large mosaic portrait of Michael Myers out of Halloween candy and spiders as part of his " Totally Sweet " series in 2013 . 
 = Hurricane Henri ( 1979 ) = 
 Hurricane Henri was a rare tropical cyclone that entered the Gulf of Mexico without having made landfall ; it was the second of four times this occurred during the 20th century . The eighth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season , it formed on September 14 in the northwestern Caribbean Sea . Throughout much of its duration , Henri moved erratically and initially maintained a general westward track . On September 16 it attained tropical storm status , and a day later it reached hurricane status . By two days later , after experiencing hostile conditions , Henri weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to the northeast , and on September 24 it merged with a frontal low in the northeast Gulf of Mexico . Due to its slow and erratic motion , the hurricane forced evacuations along the Mexican coastline . Its remnants brought rainfall and flooding to the Florida Panhandle . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Henri developed as Tropical Depression Eighteen in the extreme northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 14 from a tropical wave , which had previously moved off the coast of Africa . The formation of a tropical depression was confirmed by reports from Hurricane Hunters . The depression tracked northward , brushing the eastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula . After reaching the Gulf of Mexico it turned sharply westward , with a ridge preventing further northward movement . The depression turned southwestward , and intensified into Tropical Storm Henri on September 16 . 
 Tropical Storm Henri continued to intensify as it tracked through the Bay of Campeche . On September 17 , the storm turned northwestward after the ridge to its north weakened , and later that day Henri reached hurricane status ; six hours later , it reached peak winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) about 150 miles ( 245 km ) northeast of Veracruz . Subsequently , a broad low pressure area developed over the western Gulf of Mexico , causing the motion of Henri to become erratic . On September 18 , the cyclone began a steady weakening trend , believed to have been caused by land interaction and the funneling of moisture toward a developing disturbance near the Texas coast . Henri turned eastward on September 19 and weakened to tropical depression status . It failed to regain significant convection , and it turned northeastward along an extended cold front . On September 24 , Henri merged with the frontal trough in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico . 
 Hurricane Henri was one of only four tropical cyclones to enter the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall during the 20th century . The others were Laurie of 1969 , Jeanne of 1980 , and Alberto of 1982 .

 Although Henri did not affect land in any way as a hurricane , the developing system threatened several states along the southwestern coastline in Mexico . Mexican forecasting officials issued an advisory for the Gulf coast towns of Tampico in Tamaulipas , and Tuxpan and Nautla in Veracruz , to evacuate to higher ground . The government of Veracruz issued warnings on radio and television of possible flooding in oil @-@ rich coastlines . The storm affected cleanup operations of the Ixtoc I oil spill as it passed over the spill area , damaging a 310 @-@ ton steel cap designed to stop the blowout . Henri caused driving rains , strong winds , and floods in Ciudad del Carmen , Campeche , forcing over 2000 people from their homes . Waters swelled in the town to about 12 inches ( 305 mm ) above sea level . Maximum rainfall recorded in Mexico in association with Henri was 19 @.@ 59 inches ( 498 mm ) at <unk> . 
 The remnants of Henri brought showers and thunderstorms to west @-@ central Florida , causing river flooding and some evacuations .

 Joseph Denis Stéphan Bégin ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ̃ <unk> ̃ ] ) ; born June 14 , 1978 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played in 13 National Hockey League ( NHL ) seasons . He was a second @-@ round selection of the Calgary Flames , 40th overall , in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft , and played with the Flames , Montreal Canadiens , Dallas Stars , Boston Bruins and Nashville Predators in his NHL career . After missing a full season due to injury , Bégin made a successful comeback by rejoining the Flames in 2012 – 13 before another injury forced his retirement . 
 Bégin played junior hockey in Quebec with the Val @-@ d 'Or Foreurs where he was a member of their Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) championship winning team in 1998 . He also led the Saint John Flames to the American Hockey League ( AHL ) ' s Calder Cup championship in 2001 and won the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs . Bégin adopted a role as a defensive specialist and grinder in an NHL career where he has played over 500 games . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 A native of Trois @-@ Rivières , Quebec , Bégin grew up in a single parent household , raised by his father Gilles on a welfare income . Gilles worked as a landscaper , while Steve often helped his father at work until he was 18 years old . 
 Introduced to hockey by family friends , Bégin began playing at age six and was an offensively minded player in his minor hockey years . He wore second @-@ hand equipment as his father struggled to pay the costs of hockey , but from a young age expressed his confidence he would make it to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . 
 Bégin moved to Val @-@ d 'Or , Quebec to play junior hockey , where he met his wife , Amélie . The couple have two daughters and eventually settled in Montreal . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = Junior = = = 
 Bégin played three years for the Val @-@ d 'Or Foreurs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) between 1995 and 1998 , where he scored 44 goals and recorded 117 points to go along with 520 penalty minutes in 157 games . The Calgary Flames selected him with their second round pick , 40th overall , in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft . Following the 1996 – 97 QMJHL season , the Flames assigned Bégin to their American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Saint John Flames , with whom he recorded two assists in four playoff games . 
 Bégin earned a spot with the Calgary Flames to begin the 1997 – 98 season . He made his NHL debut on October 1 , 1998 , against the Detroit Red Wings , and appeared in five games before he was returned to Val @-@ d 'Or for the remainder of the season on October 28 . The Foreurs went on to win the President 's Cup as QMJHL champions . 
 Bégin made his lone appearance with the Canadian national team that season , playing and serving as an alternate captain with the junior team at the 1998 World Junior Hockey Championship . He had no points and ten penalty minutes in seven games in what was an eighth place finish for Team Canada . 
 = = = Calgary Flames = = = 
 After graduating from junior hockey , Bégin played his first full professional season with Saint John in 1998 – 99 . He had 20 points and 156 penalty minutes in 73 games , and scored his first professional goal on October 8 , 1998 , against the St. John 's Maple Leafs . Bégin spent the majority of the next two seasons in Saint John , but made sporadic appearances with Calgary . He appeared in 13 games with the Flames in 1999 – 2000 and scored his first NHL goal on February 12 , 2000 , on goaltender Sean Burke of the Phoenix Coyotes . He played in four NHL games in 2000 – 01 while enjoying the best statistical season of his professional career in Saint John , scoring 28 points in 58 games . In the playoffs , Bégin led Saint John to the Calder Cup championship . He scored 17 points in 19 games and was named the recipient of the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the most valuable player of the post @-@ season . His 17 points were fourth best in the AHL , and 10 goals were second . 
 Bégin played his first full NHL season in 2001 – 02 , appearing in 53 games for the Flames where he scored 7 goals and 12 points to go along with 79 penalty minutes . He had 4 goals and 4 assists in 50 games for Calgary in 2002 – 03 . He left Calgary in the offseason as he was part of a three team trade on July 3 , 2003 . Bégin was dealt to the Buffalo Sabres along with Chris Drury in exchange for Rhett Warrener and Steve Reinprecht , whom the Sabres acquired from the Colorado Avalanche to complete the deal . 
 = = = Montreal Canadiens = = = 
 Bégin was promoted by Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff as a hard working , " blue collar " type player that Sabres fans would enjoy watching , but he never played a game with the Sabres . He was exposed to the waiver draft prior to the start of the 2003 – 04 NHL season and claimed by the Montreal Canadiens . He played an energy role for the Canadiens , and scored 10 goals for Montreal in 52 games . 
 After playing through injury in 2003 – 04 , Bégin underwent shoulder surgery that caused him to miss five months of playing time . When he returned to action , an ongoing labour dispute in the NHL led to his being assigned to the AHL 's Hamilton Bulldogs in February 2005 , with whom he was immediately counted upon to play a leadership role . Bégin returned to the Canadiens in 2005 – 06 and set career highs in goals ( 11 ) , points ( 23 ) and penalty minutes ( 113 ) . The Montreal media named him the recipient of the Jacques @-@ Beauchamp Molson Trophy , a team award given to a Canadiens ' player who played a " dominant role " with the team , without earning any other honours . Plagued by injuries , Bégin missed time due to rib and shoulder injuries . He appeared in only 52 games in 2006 – 07 and 44 games in 2007 – 08 and scored 18 points combined over the two seasons . 
 = = = Dallas , Boston and Nashville = = = 
 Bégin was increasingly left out of the Canadiens ' playing lineup in 2008 – 09 , and after being sat out of the lineup for five consecutive games , expressed a desire to be traded if the team had no use for his services . The Canadiens obliged , completing a deal on February 26 , 2009 , that sent him to the Dallas Stars in exchange for defenceman Doug <unk> . Stars ' general manager Les Jackson promoted Bégin 's qualities as a checking @-@ line forward : " Steve is a gritty , honest player with a very strong work ethic . He 's good on the penalty kill and he is a competitor in every sense of the word . " Bégin had 12 points in 62 games combined between Montreal and Dallas . 
 Leaving Dallas following the season , Bégin signed a one @-@ year contract with the Boston Bruins for the 2009 – 10 season . He played in 77 games for Boston , the most of any single season in his career , and recorded 14 points . He scored his first career playoff goal , in his 30th post @-@ season game , against the Philadelphia Flyers . The Bruins opted not to re @-@ sign the 32 @-@ year @-@ old Bégin , due both to their salary cap constraints and a desire to build a younger lineup . 
 Without a contract , Bégin remained a free agent as the 2010 – 11 season began . He eventually signed a one @-@ year contract with the Nashville Predators on October 22 , 2010 , but was assigned to their AHL affiliate , the Milwaukee Admirals . Bégin spent the majority of the season in Milwaukee and appeared in only two games with Nashville .

 Plagued by a hip injury , Bégin was again left a free agent prior to the 2011 – 12 season . He signed a professional tryout offer with the Vancouver Canucks , but was released by the team during the pre @-@ season . Bob Hartley , coach of ZSC Lions in the Swiss National League A offered him a spot on their team . Though he had already scheduled surgery to repair his hip , Bégin was willing to put it off to play in Switzerland , but was convinced by Hartley to complete the procedure . His recovery prevented Bégin from playing anywhere during the season . 
 When Hartley took over as the Flames ' head coach prior to the 2012 – 13 NHL season , he offered Bégin a tryout in Calgary . Bégin 's work ethic during the team 's training camp prior to the lockout @-@ shortened season earned him a contract with the Flames , who believed he could serve as a penalty killer and energy player . Over two years since his last NHL game , Bégin returned to the league , and appeared in his 500th game on February 24 , 2013 , against the Coyotes . He appeared in 36 games for the Flames , scoring four goals and adding four assists . In recognition of his successful comeback , the Calgary chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers ' Association named him the Flames ' nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and perseverance . 
 Bégin was signed to a one @-@ year , AHL contract with the Abbotsford Heat for the 2013 – 14 season . He was unable to play due to another injury and , after doctors informed him that he would miss the entire season , Bégin announced his retirement on January 16 , 2014 . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Bégin 's father taught his son that his best chance of making a career in hockey was as a defensive specialist and impressed on him the need for a strong work ethic . He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay , Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky . Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder , willing to play a physical game . His style often results in bruises and injuries , a part of the game he relishes . Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013 , he noted : " What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey . The pain from blocking shots , getting hit , hitting people ... I missed it a lot . " That attitude impressed his coaches ; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity : " Players with the commitment of Steve Begin , I really believe that there ’ s not enough ( of them ) in the NHL . I always admired the way that he played . I look at the spirit , the leadership . Pretty amazing what he ’ s done for us . "

 No. 33 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) strategic transport and air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling squadron . It operates Airbus KC @-@ 30A Multi Role Tanker Transports from RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland . The squadron was formed in February 1942 for service during World War II , operating Short Empire flying boats and a variety of smaller aircraft . By 1944 it had completely re @-@ equipped with Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakota transports , which it flew in New Guinea prior to disbanding in May 1946 . 
 The unit was re @-@ established in February 1981 as a flight , equipped with two Boeing 707s for VIP and other long @-@ range transport duties out of RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales . No. 33 Flight was re @-@ formed as a full squadron in July 1983 . By 1988 it was operating six 707s , four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling . The 707s saw active service during operations in Namibia , Somalia , the Persian Gulf , and Afghanistan . One of the transport jets was lost in a crash in October 1991 . No. 33 Squadron relocated to Amberley and was temporarily without aircraft following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008 . It began re @-@ equipping with KC @-@ <unk> in June 2011 , and achieved initial operating capability with the type in February 2013 . One of its aircraft was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014 , as part of Australia 's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS . 
 = = Role and equipment = = 
 No. 33 Squadron is responsible for aerial refuelling and long @-@ range transport . It is located at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , and controlled by No. 86 Wing , which is part of Air Mobility Group . The unit headquarters comprises executive , administrative and operational components . As well as aircrew , the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular aircraft service . Heavier maintenance is conducted by Northrop Grumman Integrated Defence Services ( formerly Qantas Defence Services ) . 
 The squadron operates five Airbus KC @-@ 30A Multi Role Tanker Transports , the first of which entered service in June 2011 . Two more are due for delivery in 2018 . The aircraft are crewed by pilots , refuelling operators and flight attendants . Air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling is considered a force multiplier , permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft . The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise . 
 The KC @-@ 30 can carry up to 100 tonnes of fuel . Its dual delivery systems — probe @-@ and @-@ drogue in the wings and boom under the tail — are designed to refuel the RAAF 's McDonnell Douglas F / A @-@ 18 Hornet and Boeing F / A @-@ 18 Super Hornet multi @-@ role fighters , Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III heavy airlifters , Boeing E @-@ 7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft , or other KC @-@ 30s . The tanker is also capable of refuelling future acquisitions including the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35A Lightning II stealth fighter , the Boeing EA @-@ 18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft , and the Boeing P @-@ 8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft . In its transport configuration , the KC @-@ 30 can carry 270 passengers or 40 tonnes of cargo . As well as its aircraft , No. 33 Squadron operates a KC @-@ 30 simulator at Amberley .

 During February and March 1942 , the RAAF formed four transport units : Nos. 33 , 34 , 35 and 36 Squadrons . No. 33 Squadron was established on 16 February at Townsville , Queensland , under the control of North @-@ Eastern Area Command . It was equipped with four ex @-@ Qantas Short Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron , along with several smaller types including de Havilland Dragons and Tiger Moths , Avro Ansons , and Vultee <unk> . Less than two weeks later the squadron suffered its first loss when one of the Empires crashed on landing at Townsville ; the six crew members were killed . A second Empire was destroyed at its mooring during a Japanese air attack on Broome , Western Australia , on 3 March ; another Empire was impressed from Qantas to replace the lost aircraft . One of the squadron 's tasks was search @-@ and @-@ rescue ; it lost another Empire on 8 August 1942 after it sank in heavy seas off the coast of New Guinea while trying to rescue survivors of a torpedoed ship . 
 No. 33 Squadron transferred to Port Moresby in January 1943 , providing air transport to Australian forces involved in the New Guinea campaign . Transport needs were so desperate in New Guinea that even the Tiger Moths were employed , delivering a total of 77 kilograms ( 170 lb ) per trip . In September – October 1943 , the squadron began taking delivery of fifteen Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas to replace its assortment of aircraft . By the time it transferred to Milne Bay on 1 January 1944 , it was operating Dakotas exclusively , and continued to do so for the rest of the war . The squadron relocated to Lae on 15 January 1945 . Following the end of hostilities in August 1945 , it was tasked with repatriating service personnel and former prisoners of war . No. 33 Squadron returned to Townsville on 11 March 1946 , and disbanded there on 13 May .

 In 1978 , the Australian government decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport , primarily to mitigate what it saw as the risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights . Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but , in December , Qantas agreed to sell the government two Boeing 707s for $ 14 @.@ 5 million . Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial , but the 707s were also intended for general long @-@ range transport , being capable of carrying cargo or up to 160 passengers . The first was transferred to the RAAF in March 1979 , and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22 April . Located at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales , the 707s were initially operated by No. 37 Squadron . They were formed into No. 33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2 February 1981 . The flight 's first mission took place the same day , when it ferried RAAF members and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth , Malaysia , a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter . 
 On 1 July 1983 , after the government procured two more 707s for $ 7 @.@ 5 million from <unk> Canada , No. 33 Flight was reorganised as No. 33 Squadron under Grierson 's command . Responsible for transporting VIPs such as members of the British Royal Family , the Governor @-@ General , the Prime Minister , and the Pope , the 707 also became the first RAAF aircraft to land in the Soviet Union , the occasion being the funeral of Konstantin Chernenko in 1985 . Along with Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons , operating Lockheed C @-@ 130 Hercules , No. 33 Squadron came under the control of No. 86 Wing , part of the newly established Air Lift Group ( later Air Mobility Group ) , in February 1987 . Routine servicing of the 707s and Hercules was the responsibility of No. 486 Squadron , another component of No. 86 Wing . Qantas undertook heavier maintenance of the 707s at its jet base in Mascot . The RAAF acquired three more 707s on 25 February 1988 , following a $ 25 million purchase from Boeing Military . One of the airframes was non @-@ flying , for spares only , and was nicknamed " <unk> " . 
 A consortium of Israel Aerospace Industries and Hawker de Havilland converted four of No. 33 Squadron 's six serviceable aircraft to in @-@ flight refuelling tankers between December 1988 and May 1992 . Their probe @-@ and @-@ drogue configuration allowed them to refuel the RAAF 's F / A @-@ 18 Hornets and the Royal New Zealand Air Force 's Douglas A @-@ 4K Skyhawks , but not the RAAF 's General Dynamics F @-@ 111 bombers , which required a boom system ; the other two 707s continued to be used purely for long @-@ range transport . The RAAF had argued for an air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling capability for both the F / A @-@ 18s and the F @-@ 111s , but the Australian government refused to fund the latter , considering the F @-@ 111 's existing range sufficient for deterrent purposes . Observers such as journalist Frank Cranston speculated that aside from any cost issues , the government was concerned that extending the bombers ' range would signal to the region that Australia was adopting a more aggressive defence posture . 
 In April 1989 , one of the 707s transported 300 Australian Army personnel in two flights to Namibia as part of the Australian contribution to UNTAG , the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country 's transition to independence . Later that year , the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute ; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of Compass Airlines . On 29 October 1991 , one of the transport @-@ configured 707s crashed into the sea during a training flight out of East Sale , Victoria ; all five crew members were killed . The <unk> inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient , and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the handling characteristics of its 707s . No. 33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace in 1993 . 
 In January 1998 , still based at Richmond , No. 33 Squadron joined Nos. 32 and 34 Squadrons under No. 84 Wing . Two of No. 33 Squadron 's aircraft were soon employed to form No. 84 Wing Detachment A in Kuwait , as part of Operation Southern Watch . On 5 March , one of the 707s undertook the first operational aerial tanker mission since the squadron 's re @-@ formation in 1983 , when it refuelled six Panavia Tornados of the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) over Saudi Arabia . The detachment subsequently refuelled US F / A @-@ 18 Hornets , Northrop Grumman EA @-@ 6 Prowlers and McDonnell Douglas AV @-@ 8 Harriers , and RAF British Aerospace Harriers , as well as the Tornados . From March to September 2002 , two 707s formed No. 84 Wing Detachment as part of Australia 's contribution to the war in Afghanistan . Located at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan , the 707s provided aerial refuelling to coalition aircraft operating in the theatre , their efforts earning No. 84 Wing a Meritorious Unit Citation .

 By the mid @-@ 1990s , the ageing 707s carrying Australian VIPs overseas were no longer compliant with foreign noise and emission regulations . No. 33 Squadron relinquished its VIP transport role in 2002 , following the entry into service of No. 34 Squadron 's Boeing 737 Business Jets and Bombardier Challenger 604s . The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in May 2007 , " in recognition of its high levels of proficiency demonstrated over the year " in spite of the challenges of operating the obsolescent 707s , and for having " performed superbly on a number of high @-@ profile missions " . The 707s were retired in 2008 , bringing to an end the 29 @-@ year operational history of the type in the RAAF . The last one in service , an ex @-@ Qantas jet named " Richmond Town " , made a low @-@ level farewell flight over Sydney on 30 June in the company of smaller aircraft filming the occasion , which gave rise to fear in some quarters that a 9 / 11 @-@ style terrorist attack was in progress . Three 707s remained at Richmond until 2011 , when they were flown out by their new operator , the US @-@ based Omega Air Services ; Omega also procured the RAAF 's Boeing simulator , which had been operated by No. 285 Squadron . 
 Following the retirement of the Boeing 707 , No. 33 Squadron relocated to RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , on 1 July 2008 . It was presented with a Squadron Standard by Queensland Governor Penelope Wensley on 2 June 2010 , to commemorate " 25 years of faithful and outstanding service " . Having been without aircraft for three years , the squadron began re @-@ equipping with the first of five Airbus KC @-@ 30A Multi Role Tanker Transports on 1 June 2011 . The KC @-@ 30 could carry one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half times as much fuel as the 707 and was configured with both probe @-@ and @-@ drogue and boom delivery systems . These aircraft had originally been scheduled to enter service late in 2008 , and the RAAF had to lease tankers from the United States Air Force and Omega Air to meet its aerial refuelling needs while Airbus rectified problems with the boom system and completed essential technical documentation . In March 2012 , one of the KC @-@ 30s set a record for the number of passengers carried on an RAAF aircraft , 220 cadets from the Australian Defence Force Academy . 
 The squadron received its fifth KC @-@ 30 on 3 December 2012 , and achieved initial operating capability in February 2013 . It expected to reach final operating capability , with both boom and probe @-@ and @-@ drogue delivery systems , in 2014 . On 14 September that year , the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron 's KC @-@ 30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates , as part of a coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq . The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe @-@ and @-@ drogue system , as by this stage the boom system was not ready . The KC @-@ 30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1 October 2014 . The first successful contact using the boom system ( in concert with another RAAF KC @-@ 30 ) took place near Amberley on 13 May 2015 . In July , the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC @-@ 30s for delivery in 2018 , taking No. 33 Squadron 's fleet to seven aircraft ; the airframes were to be ex @-@ Qantas A330 @-@ 200 passenger liners , converted by Airbus Defence and Space at Getafe , near Madrid . The KC @-@ 30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of the boom system in late October 2015 , refuelling an RAAF E @-@ 7 Wedgetail . In March 2016 , No. 33 Squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF 's most proficient squadron of the previous year , as well as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy .

 " Fix You " is a song by British alternative rock band Coldplay . It was written by all four members of the band for their third studio album , X & Y ( 2005 ) . The track is built around an organ accompanied by slow tempo drums and vocals . 
 It was released on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X & Y and has reached number four on the UK Singles Chart . The song reached number 18 in the United States Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks . Promo singles were released for the UK and US . Blythe Danner , the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow and former mother @-@ in @-@ law of Chris Martin , stated in an interview in May 2012 that Martin ' wrote the song for Gwyneth when her father died and I weep every time I hear it ' . 
 " Fix You " was critically acclaimed by music critics . It has been widely sampled , with different covers and sounds . The song was nominated for multiple awards in the categories of Best Song Musically and Lyrically and Anthem of the Summer . The music video was garnered as a tribute to the 7 July 2005 London bombings . The guitar solo of " Fix You " is currently used as the player introduction at all of the National Hockey League 's Montreal Canadiens ' home games , during the three stars of the game selection after every Los Angeles Kings home win , and was played at Staples Center as the Stanley Cup was brought on the ice after the Kings ' victory in the 2014 Stanley Cup Final . The song is also used for the 2015 – 16 New York Islanders inaugural season in Barclays Center . 
 The song was played live at the Steve Jobs memorial / celebration @-@ of @-@ life event at Apple headquarters on 19 October 2011 in Cupertino , California .

However , in other instances Martin has claimed that " Fix You " is influenced by English alternative rock band Elbow 's 2003 anthem " Grace Under Pressure " . 
 When asked about the development of the song , Martin said : " My father @-@ in @-@ law Bruce Paltrow bought this big keyboard just before he died . No one had ever plugged it in . I plugged it in , and there was this incredible sound I 'd never heard before . All these songs poured out from this one sound . Something has to inspire you , and something else takes over . It 's very cloudy . " Martin also noted that the song is " probably the most important song we 've ever written " . 
 During a track @-@ by @-@ track reveal , bassist Guy Berryman admitted that the song takes " a bit of inspiration " from Jimmy Cliff 's 1969 song " Many Rivers to Cross " . Berryman also added , " It becomes its own thing , kind of like points of inspiration that kind of lead you down certain paths . Whenever you want to write a song like someone else , it ultimately ends up sounding like something different anyway . " 
 While studying at University College London the band lived in Ramsay Hall , reminiscing on the experience they said that the lyric " lights will guide you home " comes from living next to the BT Tower , a notable landmark in London which they would follow coming back from nights out .

 The song , which is written in the key of E @-@ flat major , features an organ and piano sound . The song starts with a hushed electric organ ballad , including Martin 's falsetto . The song then builds with both acoustic guitar and piano . The sound then shifts with a plaintive three @-@ note guitar line , ringing through a rhythmic upbeat tempo . Subtle instrumentation includes the background sound of church @-@ style organ <unk> piano notes , acoustic and electric guitar riffs , drums , and a singalong chorus . 
 The message throughout the song , in which Martin sings , is words of encouragement : " Lights will guide you home / And ignite your bones / And I will try to fix you . " Michele <unk> of USA Weekend reported that Martin sings about recovering from grief in the song . Travis Gass of the Bangor Daily News wrote that Martin offers his sympathies for the downtrodden , with " When you love someone but it goes to waste / Could it be worse ? " . Gass goes on to interpret that the " booming drums " and chorus is that of Queen 's 1975 song " Bohemian Rhapsody " .

The group 's performance was led by former chorus member Fred Knittle , who suffered from congestive heart failure and breathed with assistance from an oxygen tank . The performance was originally planned to be a duet between Knittle and Bob Salvini , another former chorus member , but Salvini died shortly before the show . Knittle performed it as a solo , as a tribute to his friend . The performance was initially recorded for a British documentary that aired on Channel 4 ; footage of the performance was uploaded to YouTube in November 2006 to positive response . An expanded version of the film , titled Young @ Heart , debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival and was released in US theatres in 2008 . 
 = = Music video = = 
 The music video for " Fix You " was directed by Sophie Muller , who had previously worked with the band for their 2002 video " In My Place " . The video was filmed at the end of two concerts on 4 and 5 July 2005 at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton , England . The concert goers doubled as extras for the video shoot , which required two takes on each day to complete . 
 In the first half of the video the band 's lead singer , Chris Martin , wanders the streets of London starting at Tooley Street under London Bridge Station , while the slogan " Make Trade Fair " is projected onto the Royal National Theatre , using the same ITA2 colour scheme on the cover of X & Y. The tunnels that Martin is seen wandering within are located both in and around London St Pancras and King 's Cross railway stations , and the filming for the video took place during the time of the redevelopment and expansion of London St Pancras International . Martin is then seen walking across Waterloo Bridge , which crosses the River Thames , connecting the Southbank with The Strand . As soon as the electric guitar kicks in , Martin 's walk turns into a run as he darts through streets of London , until very quickly reaching the side of the stage at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton , where he joins the rest of the band for the song 's finale . The audience sings along with the song 's final refrain , and at the end of the video Martin thanks them for their support and wishes them goodnight . 
 The video debuted on 1 August 2005 . The music video was nominated at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards in the category of Adult Contemporary . After its release , the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings , although it was filmed before they occurred .

 = George Went Hensley = 
 George Went Hensley ( May 2 , 1881 – July 25 , 1955 ) was an American Pentecostal minister best known for popularizing the practice of snake handling . A native of rural Appalachia , Hensley experienced a religious conversion around 1910 : on the basis of his interpretation of scripture , he came to believe that the New Testament commanded all Christians to handle venomous snakes . 
 Hensley was part of a large family that had moved between Tennessee and Virginia , before settling in Tennessee shortly after his birth . Following his conversion , he traveled through the Southeastern United States , teaching a form of Pentecostalism that emphasized strict personal holiness and frequent contact with venomous snakes . Although illiterate , he became a licensed minister of the Church of God ( Cleveland , Tennessee ) in 1915 . After traveling through Tennessee for several years conducting Church of God @-@ sanctioned services , he resigned from the denomination in 1922 . Hensley was married four times and fathered thirteen children . He had many conflicts with his family members because of his drunkenness , frequent travels , and inability to earn steady income , factors cited by his first three wives as reasons for their divorces . 
 Hensley was arrested in Tennessee on moonshine @-@ related charges during the Prohibition era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse , from which he escaped and fled the state . Hensley traveled to Ohio , where he held revival services , though he and his family rarely stayed long in one location . He established churches , known as the Church of God with Signs Following , in Tennessee and Kentucky . His services ranged from small meetings held in houses to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees . Although he conducted many services , he made little money , and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice . During his ministry , Hensley claimed to have been bitten by many snakes without ill effect , and toward the end of his career , he estimated that he had survived more than 400 bites . In 1955 , while conducting a service in Florida , he was bitten by a snake and became violently ill . He refused to seek medical attention and died the following day . Despite his personal failings , he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God , and his followers continued the practice after his death . Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries , Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hensley told his children he was from West Virginia and that his family 's roots were in Pennsylvania . In reality , his family lived in Hawkins County , East Tennessee , in 1880 , the year historian David Kimbrough argues Hensley was born . One of 13 children , Hensley lived in Tennessee in Hawkins County and Loudon County in the 1880s . His family lived in Big Stone Gap , Virginia , in the 1890s , and there he witnessed an elderly woman handle a snake during a revival service at a coal mining camp . His mother and sisters were very religious , and he was reared a Baptist . 
 Hensley left the Baptist church in 1901 , the year he married Amanda <unk> . The couple moved to her brother 's 400 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 6 km2 ) farm in Ooltewah , where they lived in a shack . Hensley worked in local ore mines , helped in his brother @-@ in @-@ law 's lumber business , and was involved in making moonshine , a common practice in the region . Hensley experienced a conversion while attending a Holiness Pentecostal Church of God service in Ooltewah , led by an evangelist 's teenage son . He forsook alcohol , tobacco , and friendships with those he deemed " worldly " . 
 = = Ministry = = 
 Hensley was initially content following his experience at the Church of God , but he began to question whether he was living a sufficiently righteous life . He became fixated on a passage in the Gospel of Mark ( Mark 16 : 17 – 18 , KJV : " And these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name ... They shall take up serpents " which suggested that Christians might take up " serpents " without injury . Psychologists Ralph W. Hood and W. Paul Williamson , as well as one of Hensley 's children , have proposed that his preoccupation with this verse arose from a childhood memory of witnessing snake handling in Virginia . Hensley later recalled that he began to doubt his salvation and withdrew to a nearby hill to pray and seek God 's will . In a 1947 newspaper interview , he claimed to have seen a snake while walking on the hill . He said that he knelt in prayer , took hold of it , then brought it to his church and told the congregation to also prove their salvation by holding the snake . 
 Hensley 's first experience with snake handling occurred between 1908 and 1914 , after which he held snake @-@ handling services in parts of rural Tennessee . His supporters later asserted that a revival broke out at the start of his ministry , a claim considered dubious by historians . At first , the Church of God did not object to his snake @-@ handling services , and , in 1914 , he held a snake @-@ handling meeting with a Church of God bishop in Cleveland , Tennessee . The next year , Hensley applied to be licensed as a Church of God minister , but required his wife 's assistance to complete the paperwork owing to his illiteracy . He had memorized some Bible verses but also stated that he received divine revelation while speaking . After being licensed , Hensley held Church of God services throughout Tennessee , including revival services at church general assemblies . He preached about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit , a Pentecostal teaching that referred to an additional spiritual experience after conversion . His ministry was often mentioned in Church of God newsletters , and his wife Amanda contributed an article about him . In the 1910s , Hensley is thought to have led churches in Grasshopper Valley ( northwest of Cleveland , Tennessee ) ; Cleveland ; and Birchwood , Tennessee . 
 Hensley was short , normally soft @-@ spoken , and friendly with churchgoers . Most attendees at his services were miners or farmers from the Appalachian Mountains ; congregants typically arrived at services on horseback or in a Ford Model A. Many were from Holiness Pentecostal backgrounds , but unfamiliar with the snake @-@ handling practice . Hensley 's sister Bertha , who lived in Ohio , was also a licensed minister with the Church of God . In 1922 , he conducted services with her in Ohio . Around that time , more articles documenting his ministry were published in the denomination 's newsletter , and by the early 1920s snakes were regularly handled in Church of God services . 
 = = = Resignation and return to ministry = = = 
 In 1922 , Hensley resigned from the Church of God , citing " trouble in the home " . His resignation marked the zenith of the practice of snake handling in the denomination . He separated from Amanda around this time , possibly owing to his temper or drunkenness . Arrested on moonshine @-@ related charges in 1923 , he was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $ 100 . ( This occurred during the Prohibition Era , when alcohol production and consumption were illegal in the U.S. ) In lieu of jail time , he was permitted to serve the sentence at the Silverdale workhouse . He was initially placed on a chain gang constructing roads , but the guards found him likable and gave him other assignments . After being sent to a nearby well for water , Hensley fled and evaded recapture , possibly by hiding in the mountains near his sister 's farm in Ooltewah . While a fugitive , he may have been arrested and released on unrelated charges . He ultimately fled Tennessee to his sister 's house in Ohio . 
 After arriving in Ohio , Hensley returned to his personal ministry and held services in the area . Because he was illiterate , Bertha would read passages from the Bible during services , after which Hensley would deliver a sermon on a theme drawn from the verses . He also frequently preached on the topic of faith healing during this period . He remained in Ohio for several years , divorcing Amanda in 1926 . 
 While ministering at a Salvation Army church in Ohio in 1926 , Hensley met Irene <unk> . He married her in 1927 , although he was about 25 years her senior . After the wedding , they moved to Washingtonville , Ohio , near one of Hensley 's brothers . There Hensley found employment at a coal mine and Irene gave birth to their first child . They later moved to nearby Malvern , Ohio , where she bore their second child . 
 In 1932 , Hensley and his family moved to Pineville , Kentucky , after a religious layman , who had seen Hensley handle snakes in Chattanooga , entreated him to come to the area . He returned to ministry and built the Pineville Church of God . Hensley established the church himself and characterized it as a " free Pentecostal " church . He continued to move frequently , a practice which Thomas Burton of East Tennessee State University attributes to " wanderlust " . In July 1935 , Irene gave birth to a child in Pennington Gap , Virginia , and a month later , they were living in St. Charles , Virginia , while Hensley performed snake @-@ handling services in the area . He successfully drew crowds to his preaching . In Norton , Virginia , 500 people attended an event , although that service was thrown into disarray after a boy in the audience killed one of the snakes . In 1936 , Hensley built a house on the back of a trailer truck and drove to Florida to hold revival services . By March 1936 , he had reached Tampa , Florida , where he drew over 100 people to a snake @-@ handling service . He traveled to Bartow , Florida , where over 700 people attended one of his tent meetings . He subsequently ministered in Bloomingdale , Florida , before traveling north to Barrow County , Georgia , in late April . During a service in Barrow , a young agricultural worker was bitten by a snake and became ill . Hensley spoke to reporters and claimed that the man was bitten because he was " not quite ready for the demonstrations of the power " . He predicted that the young man would miraculously recover , but the man died . This was the first death by snakebite to occur at one of Hensley 's services . He conducted the man 's funeral and left the area for fear of prosecution . His conduct was condemned by a local newspaper . 
 Hensley traveled to Ohio to bring one of his sons to live with a sister of Irene while attending school . Hensley then returned to Pineville , where he worked as a railroad conductor and pastored the East Pineville Church of God . He was arrested for handling snakes and moved to Knoxville , Tennessee , in 1939 . He subsequently bought a farm near Knoxville . 
 = = = Ministry in Tennessee and final years = = = 
 Hensley lived in Tennessee until at least late 1941 . He then moved to Evansville , Indiana , after separating from Irene . After a brief stay in Pineville , Hensley returned to Ooltewah in 1943 . There he stayed with family members and held religious services . Snake handling had lost popularity since the late 1920s and groups that promoted <unk> had become popular . Various churches in the area barred those who practiced snake handling from membership . 
 In 1943 , Raymond Hayes , a young adherent of Hensley 's teachings , arrived in the Ooltewah area and began successfully preaching about snake handling . Hensley and Hayes started a church together in 1945 , which they named the " Dolly Pond Church of God with Signs Following " . Later in 1945 , a member of the church was bitten by a snake and died . The members of the church continued to handle snakes at services , including at the funeral of the man who died from snakebite . The man 's death was viewed as ordained by God to test the faith of the congregants , and to demonstrate to non @-@ believers that the snakes they handled were , in fact , dangerous . That year , Hensley was arrested for snake handling in Chattanooga , Tennessee . He was given a $ 50 fine , which he refused to pay even when threatened with a workhouse sentence . He was released after members of his church appealed to authorities . 
 Hensley continued to travel around Tennessee , receiving a mixed reception from those who were aware of his past . Some who knew him were willing to forgive him and welcome him back in a ministerial role , but he remained estranged from most of his family . His son Roscoe saw him preach in 1944 . The younger Hensley was also a pastor by then , but had never seen his father conduct a service . 
 In 1946 , Hensley married for the third time , but his wife , Inez Hutcheson , left him after less than a year of marriage . After their separation , Hensley began to preach in Chattanooga . During services , he began asserting that he had been miraculously healed after being paralyzed for a year following a coal @-@ mining accident . Kimbrough disputes his claim , noting that there is no one @-@ year gap in the records of Hensley moving or actively ministering . Hensley continued to live in Chattanooga until the early 1950s ; he moved to Athens , Georgia , in the early to mid @-@ 1950s . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Hensley was the father of eight children with his first wife , Amanda . They separated in 1922 . One of their children claimed that the separation occurred after an incident in which Hensley became drunk and fought a neighbor . Amanda left the area and found work in a Chattanooga hosiery mill but soon became ill and bedridden . Hensley 's sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law traveled to Chattanooga to care for her . 
 Hensley had five children with his second wife , Irene . She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse . She and her family had hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse , but ultimately felt that he was unable to . The marriage was contentious because of Hensley 's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene . He found intermittent work , including bricklaying , but Irene 's family had to help support them ; her mother provided the family with clothing . After seven years of marriage , Irene left Hensley and returned to her family , although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him . One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley , whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present . Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941 . The cause of the estrangement is unknown , although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested . She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment , and they returned to Pineville with their children . Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him , but she refused . After a visit from her sister , Irene again left him ; she and her children went to live with Hensley 's children from his first marriage . A divorce was granted in 1943 . Irene later died of complications following surgery for goiter . Hensley attended the wake and visited his children , but departed without them and did not return . 
 Hensley met Inez Hutcheson , a widow with ten children , in 1946 while performing a service in Soddy @-@ Daisy , Tennessee . After Hensley spoke with her , she accepted the doctrine of snake handling . He soon proposed marriage , which she accepted . They lived in the Soddy @-@ Daisy area for several months . Although he had hoped that she would travel with him and read Bible passages during his services , she left him after less than a year of marriage , and their union was soon dissolved . In 1951 , Hensley married Sally Norman in Chattanooga . After their marriage , she traveled with him as he ministered in Tennessee and Kentucky . 
 = = Death = = 
 In early July 1955 , Hensley began a series of meetings near <unk> , Florida . He conducted the meetings without snakes for three weeks , before procuring a 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) snake and bringing it to a Sunday afternoon service on July 24 . Several dozen people gathered at an abandoned blacksmith shop for the observance . During the service , Hensley loudly delivered a sermon on the topic of faith . He removed the snake from the lard can in which it was stored , wrapped it around his neck , and rubbed it on his face . He walked around the audience while preaching and then returned the snake to the can . As he placed the snake into the can , it bit him on his wrist . After a few minutes , Hensley became visibly ill , experiencing severe pain , a discolored arm , and <unk> . He refused medical attention , although he remained in pain and was urged to seek treatment both by congregants and the Calhoun County Sheriff . One eyewitness claimed that Hensley attributed his suffering to the congregation 's lack of faith , although his wife Sally stated that she believed it was the will of God . Hensley died early the next morning . Calhoun County Judge Hannah Gaskin ruled his death a suicide . 
 Hensley 's relatives traveled from Tennessee to Florida for his funeral , at which a country music band played . He was buried two days after his death at a cemetery 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the blacksmith shop where he was bitten . After the funeral , some of the congregants met and declared their intention to continue handling snakes . Sally resolved to continue spreading her late husband 's teachings , saying after the incident that she had not lost " an ounce of faith " . 
 = = Theology = = 
 Hensley 's theology , with the exception of his snake handling , was typical of other fundamentalist Pentecostal churches . His teachings on personal holiness bore a resemblance to doctrines of the Wesleyan Holiness tradition . In his sermons he condemned a number of practices as sinful , including gambling , consuming alcohol , wearing lipstick , and playing baseball . 
 The 17th and 18th verses in chapter 16 of the Gospel of Mark , the " longer ending " of disputed authenticity , formed the core of Hensley 's justification of snake handling and other miraculous activities ( he also drank poison in some services , including strychnine and battery acid ) . He interpreted the passage as a command , rather than an observation of events that occurred in the lives of some Apostles , as Christians have traditionally interpreted the verses . By handling snakes , he saw himself as part of a continuing tradition that originated in a New Testament injunction . He upheld the ability to handle venomous snakes without harm as proof of salvation and evidence of steadfast faith , linking the practice to speaking in tongues . To him , snake handling was a modern @-@ day confirmation of God 's power to supernaturally deliver people from harm . He often cast snakes as a representation of the Devil and interpreted the legal difficulties he encountered as religious persecution . He labeled those who rejected the observance of snake handling " unbelievers " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Many writers have attempted to designate one person , often Hensley , as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling . Although these writers have emphasized Hensley 's role in propagating the practice , Kimbrough notes that claims that he originated it are usually unsubstantiated by research , and the origins of the observance are unclear . Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to a single person , and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions . There is no doubt among historians , however , that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast , and that media coverage of Hensley 's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services . 
 Media coverage of the movement has focused on popular leaders , such as Hensley , and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention . Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man . Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley 's personal failings as slanderous fabrications . His advocacy , leadership , and – in particular – his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of the movement .

The recorded history of Vedaranyam is known from medieval Chola period of the 9th century and has been ruled , at different times , by the Medieval Cholas , Later Cholas , Later Pandyas , Vijayanagar Empire and the British . During India 's independence struggle , C. Rajagopalachari , who would later become independent India 's first Governor @-@ General , launched a salt march in Vedaranyam parallel to the Dandi March launched by Gandhi in 1930 to protest against the sales tax levied on salt extraction .

 = = Etymology and legend = = 
 Vedaranyam is named after Vedaranyeswarar , the presiding deity of the Vedaranyeswarar Temple , a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva . The place was earlier known as " <unk> " , meaning the place where Vedas , oldest scriptures of Hinduism , originated . The 7th century Saiva canonical work Tevaram by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar mentions the place as " <unk> " . As per Hindu legend , the Vedas worshipped Shiva in this place , giving the name " Vedaranyam " to the place . According to another Hindu legend , Rama , the seventh avatar of god Vishnu , is believed to have visited Vedaranyam to absolve himself from sins committed in the war against the demon king Ravana . The footprints of Rama is preserved in a place called <unk> Padam near Vedaranyam . According to a Tamil legend , the Vedas locked the gates of the temple after worshipping Shiva . The Nayanmars ( Saiva saints ) Appar and Tirugnanasambandar could not enter the locked temple . At this , on Tirugnanasambandar 's request , Appar sang devotional hymns praising Shiva , after which the gates opened . Tirugnanasambandar 's devotional hymns locked the gates again . 
 = = History = = 
 The recorded history of Vedaranyam is found from the inscriptions in Vedaranyeswarar Temple . The inscriptions date from the reign of Aditya Chola ( 871 – 907 ) , Rajaraja Chola I ( 985 – 1014 ) , Rajendra Chola I ( 1012 – 1044 ) and Kulothunga Chola I ( 1070 – 1120 ) indicating various grants to the temple . Paranjothi Munivar , a 13th @-@ century saint , who wrote the book Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam , was born at Vedaranyam . 
 Vedaranyam continued to be a part of the Chola Empire and the Chola region emerged as a centre of Saivism during the reign of Kulothunga Chola I ( 1070 – 1120 ) . After the fall of Cholas during the reign of Rajendra Chola II in the 13th century , the erstwhile Chola region was caught under a power struggle between Pandyas and Hoysalas . The royal patronage continued to the temple during the rule of the Nayaks . The Negapatam region ( modern day Nagapattinam district ) was briefly captured by French troops led by Lally ( 1702 – 66 ) in 1759 . The Tanjore district was annexed by British after the French failed to subdue the king of Tanjore . During the British period , Vedaranyam was part of Thiruthuraipoondi Taluk under Tanjore district . Salt from Vedaranyam was transported to Nagapttinam port through a 32 mi ( 51 km ) long canal . The channel was constructed in 1869 because road transportation facilities between these two towns were limited . 
 During India 's independence struggle , Gandhi launched the Dandi March along India 's west coast to protest against the sales tax levied on salt extraction . His close associate C. Rajagopalachari , who would later become independent India 's first Governor @-@ General , carried out a salt march in parallel , on the east coast starting from <unk> ( modern day Tiruchirappalli ) in Vedaranyam . His group , having people like Sardar Vedaratnam , started from Tiruchirappalli , in Madras Presidency ( now part of Tamil Nadu ) , to the coast of the town . After making illegal salt there on 30 April 1930 , the group was arrested by the British . After India 's independence , Vedaranyam continued to be a part of Thanjavur district until 1991 , and later became part of the newly created Nagapattinam district . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Vedaranyam has an average elevation of 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) and is located on the Coramandel coast of Bay of Bengal . The Vedaranyam swamp is located parallel to the Palk Strait for 48 km ( 30 mi ) . The river Cauvery was flowing south easterly direction from Trichy and had its confluence at Vedaranyam due to the emergence of Vedaranyam nose ( the nose shaped stretch from Vedaranyam to <unk> ) during the pleistocene period . Due to the rise of <unk> rocks in the Pattukottai – Mannargudi region and also due to the increase of sediments in the Vedaranyam area , the river migrated northwards . There is lesser marine activity in the Vedaranyam shore due to the presence of Vedaranyam nose in the north and Sri Lanka in the south , both causing weak shore currents . 
 The quality of ground water is poor compared to the northern shores of Tamil Nadu due to the presence of marine and semi @-@ marine origin in sediments . The images from the satellite IRS 1A shows Thiruthuraipoondi was a coastal town ( which is an inland in modern times ) and the sea has regressed up to Vedaranyam in modern times . The analysis of backwaters from 1932 to 1992 indicates considerable enlargement in the region and occurrence of number of <unk> . 
 Modern day Vedaranyam has five fresh water channels from river Cauvery draining into the swamp . The total area of the swamp is about 349 km2 ( 135 sq mi ) , with 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) width in the northwestern part and 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) width in the western side . The <unk> wildlife reserve is located in the extreme eastern portion of the swamp . The northern tip of the swamp obtains continuous source of fresh , saline or brackish water during the south west monsoon and dries up during the summer season . The swamp is used for salt extraction and other marine based industries . The swamps are filled by two periodical high tides that occur during the full moon days of May and June . The swamp along with the sanctuary is the important wintering and staging area for waders and water birds .

 Charles Robert Forbes ( February 14 , 1878 – April 10 , 1952 ) was appointed the first Director of the Veterans ' Bureau by President Warren G. Harding on August 9 , 1921 and served until February 28 , 1923 . Caught for army desertion in 1900 , he returned to the military and was a decorated World War I veteran . He first became active in politics in the Pacific Northwest . In 1912 , Forbes moved to Hawaii and served as chairman on various federal commissions . While Senator Warren G. Harding was on vacation in Hawaii the two met by chance and became friends . After the 1920 U.S. Presidential election , President Harding appointed Forbes director to the newly created Veterans ' Bureau , a powerful position in charge of millions of dollars in government expenditures and supplies . 
 His tenure as the first Veterans ' Bureau director was characterized by corruption and scandal . Forbes was considered the " dashing playboy " of Washington and a favorite of President Harding . Having returned to the United States after fleeing to Europe in 1923 , he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Government and sent to federal prison in 1926 , where he was a cellmate of Frederick Cook , the person who often claimed to be the first to reach the North Pole . Forbes was released eight months later in 1927 . He died in 1952 .

While in Hawaii , he served in four federal government appointments as Commissioner of Public Works , Chairman of the Public Service Commission , Chairman of the Harbor Commission and chairman of the Reclamation Commission appointed by President Woodrow Wilson . During this time in Hawaii , Forbes became acquainted with then Senator Warren G.

 Initially , Forbes desperately tried to be appointed chairman of the United States Shipping Board , a board that controlled vast amounts of government shipping resources to private shippers . President Harding , however , denied him the position and instead appointed Forbes to the Bureau of War Risk Insurance on April 28 , 1921 . Forbes 's salary at the War Risk Bureau was $ 10 @,@ 000 a year . On August 9 , 1921 Congress passed what was known as the " Sweet Bill " creating the Office of the Veterans ' Bureau . After World War I , thousands of wounded and disabled veterans did not have adequate facilities for proper care and needed job skills . The Veterans ' Bureau was created to remedy this dilemma for the World War I veterans who desperately needed medical attention , hospitals , and employment . Across the country there were fourteen regional offices that were semi @-@ independent from Washington D.C. Bureau . Congress awarded the Veterans ' Bureau millions of dollars in expenditures to take care of the needs of the veterans . In August 1921 , President Harding appointed Forbes the first director of the Veterans ' Bureau . Forbes controlled $ 500 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( 5 @.@ 99 billion 2009 ) a year in government expenditures for the World War I veterans .

 With millions of dollars at his disposal , Forbes hired 30 @,@ 000 new workers at the Veterans ' Bureau , many of whom were personal friends to Forbes . The Veterans ' Bureau under Forbes was overstaffed and many appointed agents looked for means to justify their paid positions . During his tenure as director , Forbes ignored the needs of the wounded veterans . In the less than two years that Forbes held his position , he embezzled approximately $ 2 million , mainly in connection with the building of veterans ' hospitals , from selling hospital supplies intended for the bureau , and from kickbacks from contractors . The budget for the Veterans ' Bureau during his tenure was $ 1 @.@ 3 billion in total . Forbes had rejected thousands of legitimate claims by veterans . 
 Although 300 @,@ 000 soldiers had been wounded in combat , Forbes had only allowed 47 @,@ 000 claims for disability insurance , while many were denied compensation for reasons that Congress called " split hairs " . Even fewer veterans received any vocational training under Forbes ' direction of the bureau . According to the Charleston Gazette , Forbes toured with his contractor friends to the Pacific Coast , known as " Joy @-@ Rides " , inspecting veterans ' hospital construction sites . Forbes and his contractor associates allegedly indulged in parties and drinking . Forbes and corrupt contractors developed a secret code in order to communicate insider information and ensure government contracts . According to congressional testimony , in Chicago , on one of his many inspection trips , Forbes gambled and took a $ 5 @,@ 000 bribe from contractor J. W. Thompson and E. H. Mortimer at the Drake Hotel to secure $ 17 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in veterans ' hospital construction contracts . Mortimer was the middleman man who had handed Forbes the bribe in one of the rooms at the Drake . Forbes said the $ 5 @,@ 000 payment was a loan . Mortimer stated that Forbes had an affair with Mortimer 's wife while on the inspection tours . After Forbes returned from his inspection tours he began to sell hospital supplies at severely discounted prices . According to a <unk> Business report , he sold nearly $ 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 of much needed hospital supplies for $ 600 @,@ 000 , a fraction of their worth . Forbes was suspected of receiving kickbacks from contractors . When President Harding ordered Forbes to stop , Forbes <unk> disobeyed and kept selling supplies . 
 On January 24 , 1923 Forbes awarded Hurley @-@ Mason Construction a sizable contract of $ 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 to construct a new veterans ' hospital at American Lake , near Tacoma . Forbes had resigned his vice presidency at Hurley @-@ Mason Construction upon assuming his federal position under the Harding Administration . By January 1923 , rumor was spread by Forbes 's close friends that Forbes would resign from the Veterans ' Bureau on June 1 , 1923 . During the summer of 1922 on one of Forbes 's " joy rides " , Forbes had come back to Spokane and visited the F. Lewis Clark House while he was looking for a possible site for a veterans ' hospital at Hayden Lake , Idaho . Forbes was accompanied by Dr. Stanley Rhinehart . The F.

Colonel Forbes stayed there for several days . The Spokane division office of Hurley @-@ Mason Construction had been closed down .

 Forbes 's resignation , however , would come earlier than June 1 , 1923 as his friends had predicted . When President Harding was informed that Forbes had disobeyed a direct order to stop selling hospital supplies , Harding summoned him to the White House in January 1923 . Forbes pleaded with Harding to allow him to go to Europe to settle family matters . Harding allowed him to flee to Europe only on the condition he would resign from the Veterans ' Bureau . While in Europe , he voluntarily resigned from office on February 15 , 1923 . When Forbes took Elias H. Mortimer 's wife to Europe with him , Mortimer decided to testify against him in a Congressional investigation that started on March 2 , 1923 . Upon his return from Europe , Forbes visited President Harding at the White House . The six @-@ foot @-@ tall President grabbed Forbes by the throat and began violently shaking him " as a dog would a rat " . Forbes was saved from this attack when a guest who had an appointment with the President interrupted the altercation . President Harding was angered over Forbes ' duplicity in stopping the Perryville shipments . The Senate investigation revealed Forbes had left 200 @,@ 000 unopened pieces of mail from veterans at the Bureau . Belligerent before the Senate committee , Forbes renounced involvement in illegal activities .

 After being released from prison , in an effort to exonerate President Harding , Forbes wrote an article for the New York World , published December 4 , 1927 , that alleged Harding was " duped " by his appointees and cabinet known as the Ohio Gang .

Smith was an aide to President Harding 's U.S. Attorney General Harry Daugherty . While he helped Smith pick up the money from the floor , Smith told him the money was Daugherty 's . Forbes said that the ability to buy narcotics was rampant at Atlanta and Leavenworth federal prisons while Daugherty was attorney general . Forbes stated that Harding 's personal physician , Charles E. Sawyer , was a " pernicious <unk> " . Forbes made a blanket statement that President Harding had not profited in any way from the scandals during the Harding Administration .

 = New Jersey Route 58 = 
 Route 58 is a former state highway in the city of Newark , New Jersey and nearby borough of Harrison , New Jersey . The highway ran from Orange and Hecker Streets in Newark , eastbound as a four @-@ lane freeway across the William A. Stickel Memorial Bridge ( known as the Stickel Bridge ) to Harrison , where it terminated at an intersection with County Route 508 . The route originates as an alignment of Route 25A , a suffixed spur designated in 1939 of State Highway Route 25 . The route was rechristened as Route 58 in the 1953 state highway renumbering . The highway was constructed into Interstate 280 in the 1950s , and the route persisted internally until the 1990s , when it was finally removed as a designation . A stub alignment of Route 58 remains near Hecker and Orange Streets . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 58 began at an intersection with Orange Street and Hecker Street in the center of Newark . Paralleling Lackawanna Drive , the highway crossed over the Gladstone Branch , Montclair Branch and Morristown Lines maintained by New Jersey Transit . A four @-@ lane divided highway , Route 58 headed eastward along the Essex Freeway , a short freeway in Newark . The highway interchanged with Clifton Avenue heading westbound and Martin Luther King Boulevard a short distance later . The interchange with Martin Luther King Boulevard accessed the nearby Newark Broad Street Station . A short distance later , Route 58 interchanged with Route 21 nearby . After Route 21 , the Essex Freeway crossed on the Stickel Bridge over the Passaic River and into Harrison , where Route 58 interchanged with County Route 508 . There the designation terminated .

 Route 58 originates as an alignment of State Highway Route 25 @-@ A , designated in 1939 as a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 25 from Jersey City to Clifton Avenue in Newark . The route was designated to cross through Kearny and Harrison , crossing the Passaic at the Bridge Street Bridge in Harrison . From there , it continued along , intersecting with State Highway Route 21 and Clifton Avenue . In 1949 , a new bridge for the four @-@ lane road was constructed , this bridge was named after William Stickel , an engineer from Essex County . That year , the New Jersey State Highway Department proposed construction of a new freeway to help alleviate traffic on the State Highway Route 10 corridor , designated as the Essex Freeway from the New Jersey Turnpike in Hudson County westward to U.S. Route 46 in Morris County . 
 On January 1 , 1953 , as part of the 1953 state highway renumbering , State Highway Route 25 @-@ A was rechristened as Route 58 . In 1954 , the State Highway Department decided to find a state highway to include in the new Eisenhower Interstate System . Originally proposed to use the Route 3 alignment for Federal Aid Interstate Route 105 , the upgrading of Route 3 for standards would be too great . After Route 3 was deemed unusable , they moved focus to short portion of Route 58 that was constructed . In 1958 , the State Highway Department gave Route 58 its official new designation , Interstate 280 , when construction began on an extended Essex Freeway . Although Interstate 280 was designated onto Route 58 's alignment , the Route 58 designation persisted throughout maps and straight line diagrams until at least 1997 , when the designation was removed . A short , unused concrete portion of Route 58 remains at the northern end of Hecker Street , crossing over the New Jersey Transit tracks ending near Interstate 280 .

 = HMS Duncan ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Duncan was a D @-@ class destroyer leader built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s . The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935 where she remained until mid @-@ 1939 . Duncan returned to the Mediterranean Fleet just after World War II began in September 1939 . She was transferred to the Home Fleet in December 1939 , although she was badly damaged in a collision the following month , and required repairs that lasted until July 1940 . The ship joined Force H at Gibraltar in October , escorting the larger ships and various convoys until March 1941 when she was transferred to West Africa for convoy escort duties for a few months . Duncan rejoined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla at Gibraltar in July and escorted several convoys to Malta during the rest of the year . After a refit , she briefly returned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla before joining the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean to participate in Operation Ironclad in May 1942 . The ship was recalled home to be converted into an escort destroyer in late 1942 . 
 Duncan was assigned to Escort Group B @-@ 7 in the North Atlantic after her conversion was complete in May 1943 . She escorted a number of convoys before she required a lengthy refit from November to May 1944 . She helped to sink two German submarines in October 1943 . The ship was assigned to anti @-@ submarine duties in the Western Approaches after her refit was finished in May 1944 , and Duncan remained there until April 1945 . At that time she was transferred to coastal anti @-@ submarine patrols to counter any last @-@ gasp effort by the Kriegsmarine to interfere with the Allied supply lines to the Continent . Placed in reserve the following month , Duncan was in bad shape and was sold for scrap later that year . The demolition , however , was not completed until 1949 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Duncan displaced 1 @,@ 400 long tons ( 1 @,@ 400 t ) at standard load . The ship had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . Duncan carried a maximum of 390 long tons ( 400 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 870 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 870 km ; 6 @,@ 760 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 175 officers and men . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' and ' Y ' from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Duncan had a single 12 @-@ pounder AA gun between her funnels and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Vickers Mark III machine guns mounted on the sides of her bridge . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . In 1936 , the 12 @-@ pounder was replaced by two QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II AA guns . Sometime after the Dunkirk evacuation , the ship 's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun and the quadruple 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch machine guns were replaced by 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Oerlikon AA guns . 
 Duncan was ordered under the 1930 Naval Estimates on 2 February 1931 from Portsmouth Dockyard . She was laid down on 25 September 1931 , launched on 7 July 1932 and finally commissioned into the Navy on 31 March 1933 . Built as a flotilla leader , she displaced 25 long tons more than the rest of her class and carried an extra 30 personnel . These personnel formed the staff of the Captain ( D ) of the flotilla . 
 = = Career = = 
 The ship was initially assigned as the leader of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September – November 1933 . After refitting at Portsmouth between 3 September and 23 October , Duncan led most of her flotilla to the China Station , arriving at Hong Kong on 3 January 1935 . The next few years were spent " showing the flag " around the Far East , and visiting Japan , the Philippines , the Dutch East Indies , Singapore , Thailand and Malaya . The ship was under repairs between 14 December 1936 and 4 January 1937 from damage sustained when testing refuelling at sea techniques . She was in Shanghai during the Japanese invasion of 1937 and evacuated British civilians to <unk> , together with the sloop HMS Falmouth . On 28 October 1938 , Duncan was struck by the Greek steamer <unk> whilst lying at anchor at Foo Chow , China . The ship was repaired and given a refit at Hong Kong between 31 October and 14 January 1939 . She was lightly damaged when struck by a high @-@ speed target at Wei Hai Wei , China , in July 1939 .

 With the outbreak of war , Duncan and her sisters Diana , Daring , and Dainty , were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet , arriving at Alexandria on 30 September . All the ships were in poor condition , and , after repair , they conducted contraband control duties . In December Duncan , along with her sister Duchess , was assigned to escort the battleship Barham back to the UK , and they departed Gibraltar on 6 December . During the morning of 10 December , Barham collided with Duchess off the Mull of Kintyre in heavy fog , sinking the destroyer with the loss of 124 lives . Duncan was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet on 12 December . 
 She was damaged in a collision with a merchant vessel on 17 January whilst escorting Convoy <unk> , causing a twenty @-@ foot hole in her side but fortunately she did not sink and was taken under tow . After temporary repairs at Invergordon , she was towed to Grangemouth for repairs that were not completed until 22 July . She carried out post @-@ refit trials and returned to Scapa Flow to rejoin the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla . She transferred to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla based at Gibraltar in October , escorting the aircraft carrier Ark Royal , Barham , the heavy cruiser Berwick , and the light cruisers Glasgow and Sheffield from the Firth of Clyde to Gibraltar . Joining Force H , she escorted Ark Royal during Operation Coat , the carrier Argus when she flew off Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta during Operation White and escorted Force F to Malta during Collar during November . During the Battle of Cape Spartivento in late November , Duncan was detailed to escort the convoy away from the Italians . 
 On 1 January 1941 , she led four ships of the 13th Destroyer Flotilla as they intercepted a Vichy French convoy near Mellila and seized all four merchant ships of the convoy . A few days later she took part in Operation Excess , a military convoy taking stores to Piraeus and Alexandria . During Operation Grog in early February , the ship escorted the larger ships of Force H as they bombarded Genoa . She then escorted the battlecruiser Repulse and the carrier Furious from Gibraltar to West Africa in early March and remained there afterwards . Based at Freetown , the ship escorted convoys through West African waters until July when she was recalled to the Mediterranean to escort the Operation Substance convoy from Gibraltar to Malta in July 1941 Reassigned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla , Duncan remained at Gibraltar and was part of the close escort for the Operation Halberd convoy in late September . 
 In October she was assigned as part of the escort for Convoy HG 75 , from Gibraltar to Liverpool , because she was scheduled for a refit in the Sheerness Dockyard . It began on 16 November and lasted until 23 January 1942 , after which Duncan rejoined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla at Gibraltar . In late February and March , the ship escorted the carriers Eagle and Argus as they flew off fighters for Malta . The following month , Duncan was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Eastern Fleet to support Operation Ironclad , the invasion of Diego Suarez . After four months of operations in the Indian Ocean , the Admiralty decided to convert her to an escort destroyer , and accordingly she returned to the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope as an escort for the battleship Royal Sovereign . The ship arrived in Greenock on 16 November , but did not begin her conversion at Tilbury until 24 November . 
 This involved the replacement of ' A ' gun by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar , the removal of her director @-@ control tower and rangefinder above the bridge in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar , exchanging her two 2 @-@ pounder AA guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns , the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform , and the removal of her 12 @-@ pounder AA gun . ' Y ' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to 98 depth charges . 
 In March 1943 , Duncan carried out sea trials and went to Tobermory to work up . In April she joined Escort Group B @-@ 7 as the Senior Officer 's ship , with Commander Peter Gretton in command at the height of the Battle of the Atlantic . She escorted Convoy ONS @-@ 5 in early May , a major convoy battle which saw the destruction of six U boats for the loss of thirteen ships , although Duncan was forced to withdraw for lack of fuel before the battle was over . Later that month , she escorted Convoy SC @-@ 130 , in which three U @-@ boats were destroyed for the loss of no ships . Duncan continued on North Atlantic escort duty until October 1943 ; on 16 October the ship rescued 15 survivors from U @-@ 470 which had been sunk earlier by an Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberator bomber of the Royal Air Force . Whilst defending Convoy ON @-@ 207 on 23 October , Duncan , together with the destroyer Vidette and a Liberator of No. 224 Squadron RAF , sank U @-@ 274 . Later the same month , on 29 October , Duncan shared the sinking of U @-@ 282 with Vidette and the corvette Sunflower whilst protecting Convoy ON @-@ 208 . 
 By this time the ship was in poor shape and required an extensive refit ; the work last from 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich , London shipyard of Harland and Wolff . After working up , she was assigned to the 14th Escort Group for anti @-@ submarine operations in the Western Approaches . Duncan conducted convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool . The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May and was transferred to Barrow on 9 June . She approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons of water a day . Duncan was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards , but demolition was not completed until 1949 .

 Annabel Breuer was born on 23 October 1992 . She lives with her three siblings , her parents and her dog in <unk> , a small town in Swabia roughly halfway between Lake Constance and Ulm . She became a paraplegic as a result of an automotive accident when she was a child . 
 Breuer started playing wheelchair fencing recreationally . She won silver at the 2006 Wheelchair Fencing World Cup in Turin at the age of 13 @.@ but was unable to participate in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing due to surgery on her spinal cord . At the 2009 European Championships in Warsaw she won gold with the German <unk> team , and silver and bronze in the singles . As a result , the German Sports Foundation named 16 @-@ year @-@ old Breuer as its Junior Sportsman of the Year for 2009 in Disability Sport . She competed in the 2010 World Championships in Paris , but was placed fifth and did not medal . She was awarded the Hilde Frey Prize in 2011 , and said that her goal was to be at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London . 
 Breuer attended the Paralympics in London , but as a wheelchair basketball player rather than as a fencer . She was introduced to the sport by a friend , and spot by a national trainer . Breuer played for Sabines Ulm , where she was the only woman on a mixed gender side . She is classified as a 1 @.@ 5 point player , but women get a 1 @.@ 5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team , making her in effect a zero @-@ point player . Her classification , along with her high technical acumen , means that she is a valuable asset on any team . 
 Breuer was part of the German national team which won win gold at the 2011 European Championships in Nazareth , Israel , defeating the Netherlands in the final , 48 – 42 . In June 2012 she was named as one of the team that competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London . In the Gold Medal match , the team faced the Australia women 's national wheelchair basketball team , a team that had defeated them 48 – 46 in Sydney just a few months before . They defeated the Australians 44 – 58 in front of a crowd of over 12 @,@ 000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal , They were awarded another Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012 , and were again named Team of the Year for 2012 . In a ceremony in Ulm , Breuer was congratulated by the Lord Mayor , Ivo <unk> , and her name was entered in the Golden Book of the city . In December 2012 , it was announced that in addition to playing for second division Sabres Ulm , she would also play for five @-@ time Champions League winning first division club RSV Lahn @-@ Dill in 2013 . 
 As of February 2013 , due to the constant interruptions to her education due to training and competitions , Breuer , who speaks English , French , German and Spanish , had yet to complete her final high school examinations at Matthias Erzberger school in Biberach .

 = 1994 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 1994 Pacific hurricane season was the final season of the eastern north Pacific 's most recent active string of hurricane seasons that unofficially started in 1981 . The season officially started on May 15 , 1994 in the eastern Pacific , and on June 1 , 1994 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1994 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . The first tropical cyclone formed on June 18 , while the last system dissipated on October 26 . This season , twenty @-@ two tropical cyclones formed in the north Pacific Ocean east of the dateline , with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes . A total of 10 hurricanes occurred , including five major hurricanes . 
 Of note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms . Hurricanes Emilia , Gilma , John , and Olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars . Longevity @-@ wise , no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as Hurricane John , which lasted 31 days . Elsewhere , Hurricane Rosa caused four casualties in Mexico as the basin 's lone landfalling tropical storm or hurricane , and later was responsible for flooding in Texas . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 This season , twenty @-@ two tropical cyclones formed in the north Pacific Ocean east of the dateline . All but two of them became tropical storms or hurricanes . In the Eastern Pacific region ( 140 ° W to North America ) , nineteen tropical depressions formed , of which seventeen became tropical storms , nine further intensifying into hurricanes , and five ultimately reaching major hurricanes of Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir Simpson Scale . These numbers are slightly above the long @-@ term averages of fifteen tropical storms , nine hurricanes , and four major hurricanes . 
 In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility ( 140 ° W to the International Date Line ) , three depressions , two tropical storms , and one hurricane formed . Overall , there were eleven tropical cyclones , eight tropical storms , five hurricanes , and three major hurricanes that formed or entered the Central Pacific region . These numbers are well above the long @-@ term average of four tropical cyclones , two hurricanes , one tropical storm , and two depressions . The exceptionally high activity was contributed to by an El Niño ongoing at the time . 
 The only named storm to make landfall this year was Hurricane Rosa , which killed four people in Western Mexico and forced over 400 to be evacuated . Other notable storms include Hurricane Olivia , a high @-@ end Category 4 system , the three Category 5 hurricanes Emilia , Gilma , and John . Both John and Hurricane Li existed in two of the three basins ( East , and West ) of the Pacific Ocean . 
 This season marked the end of the Northeastern Pacific 's most recent active period , which began in 1982 , and includes the five most active Pacific hurricane seasons . Beginning in 1995 , multi @-@ decadal factors switched to a phase that suppresses Pacific hurricane activity . Since then , Pacific hurricane seasons have generally been below normal ; the lone abnormally active season since then was in 1997 , where a strong El Nino event was observed . 
 The 1994 Pacific hurricane season set several records . First , three hurricanes reached Category 5 intensity on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , setting a record later tied in 2002 . Hurricane John lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on Earth in recorded history . Eleven tropical cyclones entered or formed in the central Pacific , a record shared with the 1992 season until the 2015 season broke the record . Finally , of the four most intense hurricanes recorded in the Central Pacific , three of them occurred this season . 
 The season began with the formation of Tropical Depression One @-@ E on June 18 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Nona on October 26 . No named systems formed in May , three in June , four in July , five in August , six in September , two in October , and none in November . The total length of the season , from the formation of the first depression to the dissipation of the last , was 130 days . 
 Accumulated Cyclone Energy ( ACE ) is a measure of how active a hurricane season is . It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm @-@ force winds every six hours , summing the results , and dividing that total by 104 . As a tropical cyclone does not have gale @-@ force winds until it becomes a tropical storm , tropical depressions are not included in these tables . For all storms , ACE is given to three significant figures . The ACE in the east Pacific proper ( 140 ° W to North America ) is given ; the ACE in the central Pacific ( the International Date Line to 140 ° W ) is given in brackets . The table includes the ACE for Li and John only during those storm 's time east of the dateline . Their ACE west of the dateline is part of the totals of the 1994 typhoon season . 
 The National Hurricane Center uses ACE to rank hurricane seasons as above @-@ normal , near @-@ normal , and below @-@ normal . It defines below @-@ normal as having an ACE less than 95 * 104 kt2 kt2 ; It defines above normal as having an ACE above 150 * 104 kt2 along with the numbers of any two of the following above average : tropical storms ( 15 ) , hurricanes ( 9 ) , or major hurricanes ( 4 ) ; It defines near @-@ normal as having an ACE between 100 * 104 kt2 and 150 * 104 kt2 , or an ACE above 150 * 104 kt2 with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average : tropical storms ( 15 ) , hurricanes ( 9 ) , or major hurricanes ( 4 ) . 
 This season has a total of seventeen tropical storms , nine hurricanes , and five major hurricanes . The total ACE of this season is 185 * 104 kt2 . This qualifies this season as above @-@ normal .

Aletta 's remnant low , however , could be tracked on satellite images for days following the storm . The low finally dissipated north of Hawaii . Aletta never affected land , and no damage or casualties were reported .

 Tropical Depression Two @-@ E formed on June 27 about 575 miles ( 925 km ) south @-@ southwest of the tip of the Baja California Peninsula . The depression headed west @-@ northwest , gradually turned to the northwest , and strengthened into Tropical Storm Bud on June 27 . Early the next day , Bud peaked in intensity . Shear caused by a nearby upper level low slowly weakened Bud . Later on June 28 , a second center of circulation developed . The two centers started a Fujiwhara interaction . The second center then became dominant and the first one vanished . This confused structure is similar to what happened to 1993 's Tropical Storm Arlene . This confused structure also weakened Bud to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the same day the second center formed . Bud then headed westward over cool waters and dissipated on June 29 . Tropical Storm Bud spent its entire life over the open ocean far from land areas . No casualties or damage was reported .

 The tropical depression that would be Carlotta formed on June 28 . It quickly became Tropical Storm Carlotta , and a large eye became visible . Because of this , the NHC upgraded the storm to a hurricane . Carlotta peaked in intensity on July 1 , as a 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) hurricane . It gradually weakened as it moved into cooler waters , dissipating on July 5 . Carlotta did not threaten land . 
 Carlotta buffeted Socorro Island with sustained winds of 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) on June 30 . Other than there , Carlotta caused no damage or deaths . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Daniel = = = 
 On July 8 , a disturbance located about 1 @,@ 000 miles ( 1 @,@ 600 km ) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula developed a circulation and became Tropical Depression Four @-@ E. Convection increased , and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daniel . Upper @-@ level outflow improved , and Daniel peaked in intensity on July 9 . Daniel slowly declined as it continued westward . It entered the central Pacific on July 11 . Wind shear weakened Daniel as it approached the Big Island , and by July 15 had degenerated into an open wave . 
 When Daniel was approaching Hawaii , moderate surf of 4 to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) impacted the south and southeast shores of the Big Island on July 13 and 14 . Daniel 's remnants also passed about 100 miles ( 160 km ) south of South Point , Hawaii on July 15 . That day , they caused rainfall on windward slopes of the Big Island locally reaching 5 inches ( 130 mm ) . No reports of damage or casualties were received .

It continued intensifying , reaching Category 5 intensity on July 19 , the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane since Ava . Emilia started weakening quickly on July 21 . It weakened to a tropical storm on July 23 and dissipated two days later . 
 Emilia passed south of the Hawai ’ ian Islands , producing swells of 6 to 10 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 0 m ) in height near the Puna and Ka ‘ <unk> coasts . Winds caused minor damage , and rain was moderate . No one was killed .

Shortly after entering the central Pacific , Gilma reached Category 5 intensity on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , the second of the season . It then suddenly weakened for unexplained reasons , and weakened into a tropical storm on July 27 . It became a depression three days after that and dissipated on July 31 . Hurricane Gilma had minor impact on Johnston Atoll . That atoll received light rain , wind gusts to near gale force , and surf . No casualties or damage were reported . 
 Hurricane Gilma was the second most @-@ intense Pacific at the time . As of 2016 , it remains the ninth @-@ most intense . Gilma is also the strongest July storm in the eastern or central Pacific . 
 = = = Hurricane Li = = = 
 A tropical disturbance southwest of Cabo San Lucas organized into Tropical Depression Eight @-@ E on July 31 . It headed west @-@ northwest without strengthening much , and crossed into the central Pacific on August 2 . Eight @-@ E developed a second center of circulation , which became dominant , and then became bound up in the intertropical convergence zone . Eight @-@ E then became disorganized , with multiple centers of circulation , and advisories were discontinued on August 5 . The depression 's remains continued their westward path well south of the Hawaiian Islands . The depression regenerated on August 8 . It soon strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Li , which is Hawaiian for " Lee " . Li approached the dateline on its generally westward heading . Just before crossing , it intensified into a minimal Category 1 hurricane . It crossed the dateline on August 12 and became a storm in the 1994 Pacific typhoon season . Wind shear from a tropical upper @-@ tropospheric trough weakened back into a tropical storm as it crossed the dateline , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded Li with its first advisory . Li stayed a tropical storm until August 16 , where it weakened into a tropical depression . The system then began recurving , and dissipated on August 18 . A weakening Tropical Depression Li caused showers on Wake Island . Other than there , Li had no impact on any land , and no casualties or damage were reported . 
 Hurricane Li is one of only seven tropical cyclones to exist on all three tropical cyclone basins in the Pacific Ocean . It is also one of only five systems to form as a depression in the east Pacific but be named in the central ; the others are Lala , Iniki , Lana and Ela . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Hector = = = 
 On August 7 , a tropical depression formed from a tropical wave a few hundred miles south of Baja California . It became Tropical Storm Hector quickly , and as it paralleled the coast of Mexico , it began to weaken , dissipating on August 10 . No damage was reported anywhere . 
 Tropical Storm Hector was forecast to approach the Baja California Peninsula . A tropical storm watch was issued for part of the peninsula on August 8 . It was lifted later the same day . Hector 's most significant impact was rain . The tropical storm dumped rain along a discontinuous zone of coastal and inland Mexico . The highest point maxima were 7 @.@ 87 inches ( 200 mm ) at Cerro de Ortega / <unk> and 7 @.@ 60 inches ( 193 mm ) at <unk> / Santiago . No damage or casualties were reported . 
 = = = Tropical Depression One @-@ C = = = 
 An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on August 9 while located 740 miles ( 1 @,@ 190 km ) southeast of Hilo , Hawaii . The depression moved westward without organizing , and dissipated on August 14 . 
 Moisture from the system produced heavy rainfall over the island of Hawaii , totaling to over 15 inches ( 380 mm ) . The flooding closed all major roads in Hilo , and was considered the worst flooding in 40 years . The rainfall destroyed two homes and damaged 214 , 14 severely . It also damaged roads and businesses . Damage throughout the island totaled to $ 5 million ( 1994 USD ; $ 7 @.@ 98 million 2016 USD ) . Flooding occurred in Maui as well , where landslides blocked portions of the Hana Highway . One @-@ C 's point maximum of 15 in ( 380 mm ) makes it Hawaii 's seventh wettest known tropical cyclone . 
 = = = Hurricane Ileana = = = 
 A disturbance that was part of the intertropical convergence zone developed several centers of circulation . After it organized , it separated from the ITCZ and became Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E on August 10 while the system was about 690 miles ( 1 @,@ 110 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ileana at the second advisory , at the same time as John , the next storm . An eye appeared , and Ileana became a hurricane on August 12 . It began weakening almost immediately thereafter , as it passed over cooler waters and encountered increasing wind shear . Ileana was a tropical storm on August 13 , and the next day it was a dissipating swirl low @-@ level clouds located about 520 miles ( 840 km ) west of Punta Eugenia . Although Ileana paralleled the coast of Mexico , watches and warnings were not issued because winds of tropical storm @-@ force were not expected to affect land . No one was killed and there was no damage reported in association with this cyclone . 
 = = = Hurricane John = = = 
 Tropical Depression Ten @-@ E formed on August 11 south of Mexico . It headed generally westward , and was upgraded into a tropical storm twelve hours after it formed and was named John . John fluctuated in strength as it headed west , always managing to stay at tropical storm strength . On August 20 , steady intensification began , and John was a major hurricane when it entered the central Pacific . It continued westward , reaching Category 5 intensity on August 23 . It passed around 245 miles ( 394 km ) south of Hawaii , and passed just north of Johnston Atoll on August 26 . John stayed at hurricane intensity until it crossed the dateline on August 28 , becoming a typhoon of the 1994 Pacific typhoon season . After weakening into a tropical storm , John recurved , looped , and recurved again . It reintensified , and was a hurricane when it recrossed the dateline to reenter the central Pacific . John headed north @-@ northeast until it went extratropical on September 10 , thirty one days after it formed . 
 Ahead of the hurricane , the 1100 people at Johnston Atoll evacuated . On the atoll , John caused $ 15 million ( 1994 USD ; $ 23 @.@ 9 million 2016 USD ) in damage . No deaths were reported . Other than on Johnston , Hurricane John had minor effects in Hawaii . Its remnants also affected Alaska . 
 Hurricane John was the longest lasting and farthest traveling tropical cyclone on Earth in recorded history . It is also one of six tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of the Pacific Ocean , an uncommon west @-@ to @-@ east dateline crosser , and one of the few tropical cyclone to cross the dateline more than once . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Twelve @-@ E = = = 
 On August 14 , an area of convection organized enough to be considered a tropical depression . It was steered by John 's circulation , and it was never expected to strengthen much because it was close to cool waters . The cyclone drifted north , then northeast , north again , northwest , and then west . The National Hurricane Center declared the depression dissipated on August 15 . The depression had no effects anywhere . 
 = = = Hurricane Kristy = = = 
 On August 28 , Tropical Depression Thirteen @-@ E formed about 1 @,@ 300 miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas , Mexico . It was named Tropical Storm Kristy on August 30 . As it crossed into the central Pacific , a banding @-@ type eye formed and it became a hurricane . Twelve hours later , it reached Category 2 intensity . Kristy weakened steadily from that point due to wind shear . It passed about 300 miles ( 480 km ) south of Hawaii , and dissipated on September 5 . The lowest central pressure of Kristy is unknown . The last estimate was made when Kirsty was still a tropical storm . 
 As it approached the Hawaiian Islands , a high surf advisory and a high wind warning were issued for the Big Island of Hawaii . No damage or deaths were reported in association with this system . Its remnants crossed 180th meridian very early on September 7 and was absorbed by a tropical depression which became Typhoon Melissa in the Western Pacific basin . 
 = = = Hurricane Lane = = = 
 The same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Depression Five in the Atlantic became Tropical Depression Fourteen @-@ E on September 3 . It quickly became Tropical Storm Lane . A high pressure ridge centered itself north of Lane , keeping the storm on a westward track . This brought Lane into very favorable conditions , and Lane intensified . When the tropical storm reached hurricane strength , it entered a phase of rapid intensification , reaching winds of about 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) , making it a category four hurricane . The high pressure ridge shifted eastward , and allowed Lane to enter unfavorable conditions . Lane dissipated on September 10 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Mele = = = 
 A tropical disturbance became Tropical Depression Two @-@ C on September 6 . It reached tropical storm strength the next day , being named Mele . The name Mele means " song " in the Hawaiian language and is also the Hawaiian form of " Mary " . Mele headed west @-@ northwest and weakened back into a tropical depression on September . It dissipated later that day without incident . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Miriam = = = 
 Miriam formed from a weak disturbance on September 15 . It strengthened slightly into Tropical Storm Miriam , and dissipated on September 21 , having led an uneventful life without impact . In an interesting occurrence , the low @-@ level remnants of Miriam were still visible for weeks after the storm dissipated near 140 ° W. 
 = = = Tropical Storm Norman = = = 
 A tropical depression formed on September 19 , and became Tropical Storm Norman the next day . After tracking northwest , it began to turn north in response to a trough , and convection began to diminish . Norman dissipated on September 22 without having ever affected land . 
 = = = Hurricane Olivia = = = 
 Hurricane Olivia ultimately formed from a disturbance that had separated from the intertropical convergence zone and become distinct by September 19 . The disturbance slowly headed westward and it organized into a tropical depression on September 22 while located about 720 miles ( 1 @,@ 160 km ) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . The depression headed west @-@ northwestwards and strengthened into Tropical Storm Olivia on September 22 . It steadily intensified and was a hurricane on September 24 . It then rapidly strengthened into a powerful major hurricane . It slowly curled to the northwest as it was observed by NOAA research aircraft . Olivia peaked in intensity on September 25 . Meanwhile , a large cyclone off the extreme southern part of California induced a northward path . As Olivia started a small anticyclonic loop , wind shear began to weaken the hurricane . When Olivia was finished the loop , it had weakened to a tropical storm . It then headed westward . It weakened into a tropical depression on September 28 and dissipated the next day . No impact was reported . 
 At the time , Olivia was the third @-@ most intense Pacific hurricane on record . It has since dropped to Eleventh . The storm also had the lowest barometric pressure of a Category 4 Pacific hurricane on record . In 2001 , Hurricane Juliette joined Olivia as the most intense Cat . 4 on record . In 2014 , Hurricane Odile beat both storms when it attained a minimum pressure of 918 <unk> . Olivia was also the most intense September hurricane . Since , Hurricane Linda beat Olivia . Olivia remains the third most intense September hurricane . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Paul = = = 
 A nearly stationary cluster of thunderstorms and convection that had been hanging around since September 15 and escaped destruction by Tropical Storm Miriam organized into Tropical Depression Eighteen @-@ E on September 24 . It was located between Miriam 's remnants and the developing Olivia . It became Tropical Storm Paul on the afternoon of September 25 . It peaked in intensity on September 27 . Then , upper outflow from the nearby Olivia started shearing the tropical cyclone . Paul had been completely destroyed by September 30 . The tropical cyclone never threatened land , and consequently , no damage or deaths were reported . 
 = = = Hurricane Rosa = = = 
 An area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression at midday on October 8 . It had trouble organizing , and advisories were discontinued for a while . The cyclone finally became a tropical storm on October 11 and was named Rosa . It moved glacially , but eventually a trough steered Rosa north and then northeast . Rosa intensified quickly , peaking at Category 2 intensity just before landfall near La Concepción on the morning of October 14 . Rosa quickly decayed over the mountains of Mexico , and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through the United States , spreading moisture . 
 On October 12 , a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from Culiacán to Manzanillo and the Baja California Peninsula south of latitude 24 ° N. At the same time , a tropical storm warning was issued from Manzanillo to Tepic . On October 14 , a hurricane warning was issued for the coast between Culiacán and Cabo Corrientes , and a tropical storm warning south of Cabo Corrientes to Manzanillo . All watches and warnings were lifted later that day . 
 Four deaths , two in each of Nayarit and Durango , were reported . Four people were missing in Sinaloa . All of the deaths were due to drowning . More than 100 @,@ 000 people had their homes damaged in Nayarit . Telephone poles and power lines were downed in Sinaloa . Rain caused landslides and flash @-@ flooding in mountainous areas . In Jalisco , mudslides forced the evacuation of 400 people from two coastal villages . The highest rainfall total in Mexico was 14 @.@ 09 inches ( 358 mm ) at Mesa de Pedro Pablo . The moisture Rosa sent into the United States was a contributing factor in record rains in parts of southeastern Texas from October 15 to 19 . Those rains caused flooding that killed 22 people , destroyed over 3000 homes , and caused US $ 700 million in damage . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Nona = = = 
 Tropical Depression Three @-@ C formed on October 21 in the Central Pacific basin . It traveled westward for about 4 days before strengthening to Tropical Storm Nona on October 25 . The name " Nona " is Hawaiian for the Latin name spelled the same way . Nona immediately weakened back into a tropical depression . Upper @-@ level westerlies from a nearby trough destroyed the depression on October 26 . No deaths or damage were reported . Nona was a tropical storm for six hours , the minimum possible time .

 = = = Tropical Depression Yuri = = = 
 According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and Japan Meteorological Agency , on October 21 a tropical depression formed west of the International Dateline , and soon it exited CPHC 's area of responsibility ; however , this storm wasn 't included into CPHC database . As it entered into western Pacific , it strengthened as a tropical storm and received the name Yuri .

 The following names were used for named storms that formed in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean during 1994 . Names that were not assigned this season are marked in gray . No names were retired , so this same list was used again in the 2000 season . This is the same list used for the 1988 season except for Ileana , which replaced Iva and was used for the first time in 1994 . 
 For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line , all names are used in a series of four rotating lists . The next four names that were slated for use in 1994 are shown below . Three of them , Li , Mele , and Nona , were used throughout the course of the year .

 = United States Institute of Peace Headquarters = 
 The United States Institute of Peace Headquarters houses staff offices and other facilities for the government @-@ funded think tank focused on peacemaking and conflict avoidance . The building is the first permanent home for the United States Institute of Peace ( USIP ) , established in 1984 . The headquarters is sited on a prominent location near the National Mall and Potomac River in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington , D.C. The environmentally friendly building , noted for its unique roof , was designed by architect Moshe Safdie and completed in 2011 . Critics ' reviews of the building 's design have been mixed . 
 = = History = = 
 In the 1980s , Democratic Senator Jennings Randolph of West Virginia led a group of lawmakers calling for a federal peace institute . USIP was established by Congress in 1984 and for many years rented office space in various buildings in downtown Washington , the last being 1200 17th Street NW . In 1996 , Congress approved a site on the National Mall for USIP . The site chosen for a new headquarters , the first permanent home for the USIP , was on the corner of 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue NW in Foggy Bottom . It was previously a parking lot for Bureau of Medicine and Surgery employees at the adjacent Old Naval Observatory . The land was transferred to the USIP without charge with an agreement that underground parking spaces would be built for the Navy employees . The site is on the northwest corner and last buildable site available on the National Mall , overlooking the Lincoln Memorial , and across the street from the historic American Institute of Pharmacy Building . 
 In 2004 , Congress authorized $ 100 million for construction of USIP 's headquarters , in part due to the efforts of Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , while the institute was required to raise the remaining $ 86 million . The funds raised by USIP included a $ 10 million donation from Chevron Corporation . Another corporate donor to the building fund , defense contractor Lockheed Martin , was named a " Founding Corporate Partner " after donating $ 1 million . William Hartung of the Center for International Policy criticized the USIP for " taking money from the world 's largest producer of the weapons of war . " 
 In April 2001 , USIP issued solicitations for a design and twenty @-@ six architects submitted proposals . Moshe Safdie had never heard of USIP before receiving the design request , but he was one of the five finalists chosen . The other four were Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects , Michael Graves and Associates , Polshek Partnership ( now known as Ennead Architects ) , and Weiss / Manfredi ( which withdrew ) . According to USIP president Richard H. Solomon , Safdie 's design was chosen because the other designs " were basically square buildings . " USIP 's headquarters is the second building in Washington , D.C. designed by Safdie . The first was the fortress @-@ like headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , completed in 2008 , which dominates the busy intersection of Florida and New York Avenues NE . 
 The National Capital Planning Commission ( NCPC ) unanimously approved plans for the building in 2007 . The groundbreaking ceremony took place the following year in June . Dignitaries in attendance included President George W. Bush , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci , and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger , George P. Shultz , and Madeleine Albright . During the ceremony , some of the speakers hinted their opposing views of Bush 's use of preventive war . Construction of the 154 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 14 @,@ 300 m2 ) headquarters , which is LEED Gold certified , was carried out by Clark Construction Group of Bethesda , Maryland . The U.S. Green Building Council certified it as the first environmentally friendly building on the National Mall . The headquarters , which is managed by real estate services firm Akridge , was dedicated in October 2011 . That same year , the Samuel W. Lewis Hall was dedicated in honor of the former ambassador to Israel and USIP president . "

 According to Safdie , the building " is by definition the physical symbol of peace in the capital 's skyline " and needed to convey the spirit of peace . Safdie stated : " I 'm not one who believes in overt symbolism , but my sense of a building dedicated to peace was a sense of the lightness of being , ... It should be a serene building . It should not be an aggressive building . It should be full of light . " Safdie achieved this by designing a glass curtain wall facing the Lincoln Memorial and a billowing glass ceiling . The ceiling is one of the building elements in common with Safdie 's design for the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Israel . The 8 inches ( 20 cm ) thick roof is made of 1 @,@ 482 white glass panels and supported by steel frames while the interior of the roof is covered by a translucent plastic film . It is opaque and white during the day and glows at night . 
 There are two main entrances to the building , one facing Constitution Avenue , and another facing 23rd Street NW . The building is made of acid @-@ etched precast @-@ concrete and resembles limestone . The design is centered around two atria , a large one facing the National Mall that is designed for the public , and a smaller private one for staff that overlooks the Potomac River . The larger atrium , the George P. Shultz Great Hall , measures 11 @,@ 800 sq ft ( 1 @,@ 100 m2 ) and features the 80 ft ( 24 m ) high glass curtain wall facing the National Mall . The 230 @-@ seat Frank C. Carlucci III Auditorium , Jacqueline and Marc Leland Atrium , and 20 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 1 @,@ 900 m2 ) Global Peacebuilding Center , an interactive museum dedicated to peacemaking , are accessible via this atrium . The roof over the Great Hall , designed to convey a dove 's wings , is called Ansary Peace Dove . The second atrium , also known as the International Women ’ s Commons , measures 3 @,@ 600 sq ft ( 330 m2 ) and is lined with offices , a library , meeting rooms , conference center , and the Farooq <unk> Amphitheatre . The roof over this atrium is a simplified version of Ansary Peace Dove . There is a 2 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 190 m2 ) outdoor terrace and adjoining boardroom facing the Lincoln Memorial . A three @-@ story underground parking garage can accommodate 230 vehicles ; 140 of those spaces are reserved for Navy personnel . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Katherine Gustafson of <unk> thought the building " succeeds as a monumental edifice befitting its place in the urban frame of the National Mall " while Nathan Guttman of The Jewish Daily Forward described the headquarters as an " architectural gem . " Architect Roger K. Lewis , professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Maryland , had mixed feelings about the building . He said it was " most visible and aesthetically enticing after dark " , while its " unique , idiosyncratic form appears somewhat less enticing " during the day . During the NCPC meeting in 2007 giving final approval to the building , a National Park Service representative said " This building will be a foreign object in the landscape of classical architecture of this city " , criticizing the design compared to the neoclassical and Beaux @-@ Arts buildings along Constitution Avenue . The building is highly visible to commuters on Interstate 66 as they enter the city , a fact lamented by Philip Kennicott , Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning critic for The Washington Post . In two scathing reviews of the headquarters , Kennicott said " If it were not for the roof , the building would be unexceptional , just another exercise in boxy architecture pierced by deadening rows of identical rectangular windows " and " The institute ’ s design marks yet another low point in Safdie ’ s long descent into repetitive corporate architecture .

 = Wilfrid Eggleston = 
 Wilfrid Eggleston OBE ( 25 March 1901 – 13 June 1986 ) was an Anglo @-@ Canadian journalist , author and civil servant . Born in Lincoln to middle @-@ class English parents , he relocated to Netherfield , Nottinghamshire where his father was convinced to move the family to a ranch in Orion , Alberta . Suffering from boredom in his teenage years , Eggleston advanced his basic English education through a fast @-@ track course at Regina College , which qualified his entrance to Queen 's University in 1926 . Graduating in 1928 , he found journalistic work at the Lethbridge Herald before occupying his role as Ottawa correspondent for the Toronto Star by the following year , becoming parliamentary correspondent before his resignation in 1936 . 
 Joining the civil service through his productive membership of the secretariat in the Rowell @-@ Sirois Commission of 1937 , the Canadian government entrusted him with the position of Chief Censor of the nation in 1942 to combat negative coverage of Canada 's role in the Second World War at home and overseas . Resigning in 1944 , much to the regret of the authorities , Eggleston found work as an academic at Carleton University in 1947 , establishing the Carleton School of Journalism upon accepting his lectureship ; he directed the faculty until 1966 . Eggleston died in Ottawa on 13 June 1986 at the age of 85 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Wilfrid Eggleston was born on 25 March 1901 in Lincoln to English parents who had moved from Spalding two years earlier , where his older sister Margaret had been born . His father was a former tax collector , his mother , a shop assistant and dressmaking apprentice ; they had married in Grantham come 1897 after meeting as choristers in the town 's Methodist chapel . Eggleston 's father , one of nine children from a Nottinghamshire farm , relocated the family regularly through his successful work at an insurance firm . His mother , similarly privileged , is said to have received an education from a " Victorian private school for young ladies " . The family purchased a grocer 's shop in Netherfield , Nottinghamshire , briefly resettling there until 1909 . During this short period , Wilfrid was educated at the newly established Chandos Street Secondary School , which amalgamated in 1973 to form Carlton le Willows School . 
 Following this , Wilfrid moved to a ranch in the emerging settlement of Orion , Alberta with his family on the advice of a neighbor ; the farming of wheat was a predominant activity . However , following a major crop failure in 1917 , he became the town 's bank clerk after employment in a convenience store , but later left for <unk> , Saskatchewan due to a combination of poor business and boredom ; the family ranch was later abandoned in 1923 . After skipping several years of high school education through a fast @-@ track course at Regina College , Eggleston enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts program at Queen 's University in 1926 . 
 = = Career = = 
 After graduating from Queen 's in 1928 , Wilfrid Eggleston began writing for the locally printed Lethbridge Herald . He wrote under Canadian Senator William Ashbury Buchanan , whom had acquired ownership of the newspaper in 1905 . Eggleston held Buchanan and his politics in high regard during his short stay at the publication . After just one year writing in Lethbridge , he became Ottawa correspondent for the Toronto Star in 1929 , and witnessed significant political events in this position , including the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932 . 
 He also began writing through the media agency Reuters in the late 1920s by means of a syndicated weekly newspaper column , with a selection of his political pieces featuring in Time Magazine and a plethora of other noted publications . By the time Eggleston had resigned from the Toronto Star in 1936 , he had risen to become the newspaper 's parliamentary correspondent ; he 'd finished reporting through Reuters within the same year . 
 Whilst maintaining his journalistic status as a freelance reporter , he began governmental service in 1937 . He was a member of the secretariat in the Rowell – Sirois Commission , which sought to ease the encumbrance of the Great Depression by analyzing perceived flaws in the Canadian constitution . The outcome of the commission , supported by Eggleston , allowed for greater involvement in regard to unemployment insurance and pensions from the federal government . During this time he liaised with notable figures including Newton Rowell , James McGregor Stewart and Henry Angus ( all of whom were also members of the venture ) . 
 After gaining the trust of the Canadian government , he became Chief Censor for war @-@ time Canada from 1942 until 1944 ; Eggleston 's predecessor , Major James Haig @-@ Smith , was ordered to ban some 600 published works due to leftist sympathies . Among the high @-@ profile censorship requests that Eggleston didn 't oblige to include the Battle of the St. Lawrence , after he discovered that it was merely an attempt to , as he put it , " give the Minister of Naval Affairs a scoop when he announced it to the House " , and the Conscription Crisis of 1944 , to which he was personally objected , despite pressure from then Prime Minister , Mackenzie King . Upon being discharged from the post , General Léo Richer <unk> commented in the Ottawa Citizen that he was " largely responsible for the efficient functioning of censorship in Canada " . He was succeeded in the role by fellow journalist <unk> Charpentier . 
 Later in life , Wilfrid was involved in more academic pursuits . He had received a basic teacher @-@ training education from the Calgary Normal School ( latterly a part of the University of Alberta ) , and taught for some years in the Golden Prairie School District before lecturing at Carleton University in 1947 . In the same year , he became founder and director of the Carleton School of Journalism , a post he held until 1966 . The Canadian Encyclopedia claims that Eggleston " was considered the father of journalism education in Canada , emphasizing its roots in the liberal arts and social sciences " . 
 = = Honours , recognition and death = = 
 He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1943 by George VI in the Birthday Honours of that year , shortly after resigning his censor post . Approaching the conclusion of the Second World War , Eggleston made several public appearances in his native United Kingdom on behalf of the Ministry of Information , including at the White Rock Pavilion on 20 April 1945 , where he expressed Canadian support for the British war effort , with particular admiration for the Battle of Britain . 
 Becoming a prominent author on Canadian history and politics upon retirement from the civil service , Eggleston earned the recognition of the Writers ' Guild of Alberta , which established the ' Wilfrid Eggleston Award for Nonfiction ' in 1982 . Dying in Ottawa on 13 June 1986 at 85 years of age , Eggleston 's extensive book collection of some 3 @,@ 000 works was donated to the University of Lethbridge in 2006 , despite interest from Carleton and Queen 's universities , his academic institution and alma mater respectively . 
 = = Published works = = 
 Eggleston published a total of 17 books throughout his life ; these included seven on Canadian history , five on its politics and three personal memoirs . He further published poetry anthologies in 1927 , and again in 1978 with his wife Magdalena <unk> , herself a noted Lithuanian @-@ Canadian author , to commemorate their fiftieth wedding anniversary . Perhaps most notable of their children was classical pianist and composer Anne Eggleston ( 1934 – 1994 ) , who through her association with the The Royal Conservatory of Music became a distinguished contemporary of figures including Robert Fleming , John <unk> , Oskar <unk> and Godfrey Ridout , in addition to others .

 Iloilo International Airport ( Hiligaynon : <unk> nga <unk> sang Iloilo , Tagalog : <unk> <unk> ng Iloilo ) ( IATA : ILO , ICAO : <unk> ) , also known as Iloilo Airport , and as Cabatuan Airport , after the municipality of Cabatuan , Iloilo where it is located and sometimes Santa Barbara Airport for the nearby municipality of Santa Barbara , Iloilo . The airport serves the Province of Iloilo , including its capital city , Iloilo City , the regional center of the Western Visayas region in the Philippines . It opened its doors to commercial traffic on June 14 , 2007 after a decade of planning and construction , replacing the old Iloilo Airport in Mandurriao , Iloilo City and inherited its IATA and ICAO airport codes . It is the fourth @-@ busiest airport in the Philippines , from its predecessor . It is the first airport in both Western Visayas and the island of Panay to be built to international standards , and one of the four airports in the region planned to be an international gateway . 
 The airport is located in Cabatuan , Iloilo , 19 kilometers ( 12 mi ) northwest of Iloilo City on a 188 @-@ hectare ( 460 @-@ acre ) site in Barangay <unk> , Barangay <unk> , Barangay Duyan @-@ Duyan and Barangay <unk> , all in Cabatuan , Iloilo . The airport can be reached using either the Barangay <unk> and Barangay Tiring access road , or the Barangay Duyan @-@ Duyan , Cabatuan access road . The airport complex consists of a single runway , various administrative and maintenance buildings , waste @-@ sorting and water @-@ treatment facilities , a power @-@ generating station , a cargo terminal , and a main passenger terminal . Its location on the Tomas Confesor Highway , a major highway <unk> the island , makes the airport accessible from all parts of Iloilo and Panay by road , while its proximity to the currently defunct Panay Railways network could potentially link the airport to the rest of Panay by rail . 
 Built in slightly over 30 months , Iloilo International Airport is one of the largest airports to be constructed in the Philippines . At its inauguration , President Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo remarked that the airport was the most beautiful and modern in the country and called it a symbol of both political will and economic maturity .

 = = = The situation at Mandurriao Airport = = = 
 Prior to the construction of Iloilo International Airport , Iloilo City was served by the old Iloilo Airport in Mandurriao , Iloilo City , which had been in operation since 1937 . Though continually expanded in order to accommodate the changing demands of the city throughout much of its history , Iloilo City 's rapid urbanization had made this feat impossible by the 1990s . The 2 @,@ 202 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 23 @,@ 700 sq ft ) terminal building , constructed in 1982 to handle the passenger demands of a single airline ( Philippine Airlines , being the Philippines ' aviation monopoly at the time ) , was unable to cope with the liberalization of the Philippine aviation industry and the subsequent boom in air travel , when as many as four airlines served the airport at the same time and where the passenger terminal needed to have an area of at least 7 @,@ 800 square meters ( 84 @,@ 000 sq ft ) in order to absorb all peak @-@ hour demand . 
 The airport 's problems continued to linger with it into the new millennium . The increasing incidence of terrorism in the Philippines for example forced aviation officials to restrict airport access only to passengers , the sealing of doors and windows at airport terminals being an essential component thereof . However , the airport 's architecture ( which took advantage of natural ventilation ) and lack of air conditioning made the airport 's pre @-@ departure and arrival areas very uncomfortable for passengers to stay in . To counteract this , the Air Transportation Office ( the forerunner of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines ) installed six air @-@ conditioning units at the pre @-@ departure area . Although the installed units were able to provide a degree of comfort to passengers , the ATO recognized that their efforts were inadequate : in order to effectively provide a comfortable environment for passengers throughout the entire terminal building , twenty @-@ three air conditioners needed to be installed . Passenger complaints meanwhile were not limited to just the lack of air conditioning : despite the existence of a baggage X @-@ ray machine , passengers flying other airlines were forced to have their baggage manually checked as the machine was ostensibly for the sole use of Philippine Airlines passengers . 
 In addition to problems with the terminal building , both the airport 's location and surrounding infrastructure were the subject of much complaint as well . For one , although some 1 @,@ 700 cars visited the airport daily , the parking lot had only 129 slots , and could not be expanded any further . The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares , in particular the city 's main highway , the Tomas Confesor Highway , which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area . At one point , the ATO , which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport , proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building . However , the city government did not respond . 
 Beset with a myriad of problems , authorities eventually concluded that a new airport had to be built outside the city , and thus Iloilo International Airport was born . 
 = = = Planning and construction = = = 
 In October 1995 , the Iloilo city government announced its intention to construct a new airport outside the city in cooperation with the private sector . A year later , the Department of Transportation and Communications ( DOTC ) announced its intention to construct a new airport in Iloilo with German assistance , originally to serve as a reliever for a larger airport to be built in <unk> City , Negros Occidental ( which would later become the Bacolod @-@ <unk> International Airport ) . Although two sites were initially proposed : north of the city in Santa Barbara and south of the city in the province of Guimaras , the ATO decided to keep the airport in Iloilo , citing the lack of demand in Guimaras to justify construction there . The Regional Development Council for Western Visayas ( RDC ) endorsed the project to the National Economic and Development Authority ( NEDA ) in July 1997 . Despite the endorsements , the NEDA , citing an internal rate of return below the set " hurdle rate " of fifteen percent and the impossibility of acquiring some 415 hectares ( 1 @,@ 030 acres ) of land for the project in one year , rejected the airport proposal in February 1998 , and the project was subsequently excluded from the 1998 development cooperation program of the German government . 
 Concurrent though with the planning of the new airport , the Japan International Cooperation Agency ( JICA ) initiated a study on the master planning and long @-@ term development plans of four key domestic airports in the Philippines . The report cited Mandurriao Airport , Bacolod City Domestic Airport , Legazpi Airport and Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport in Tacloban City as these key domestic airports , noting the high growth of passenger and cargo volume there and the eventual need for expansion . Heeding the recommendations of the JICA report , President Joseph Estrada signed a memorandum in November 1998 creating the Iloilo Airport Coordinating Committee , headed by Iloilo @-@ born senator Franklin Drilon . The coordinating committee decided that a new airport was needed for Iloilo City as Mandurriao Airport was deemed <unk> due to operational obstacles and the presence of slums and other natural and civic structures that would restrict expansion efforts . In addition , the committee , objecting to the idea that the new airport would serve merely as a reliever for the new Bacolod airport , successfully lobbied for an international airport to be built in lieu of a domestic one . The project finally received NEDA approval in March 2000 , with Cabatuan as the location of the new airport based on a study performed by both the DOTC and the JICA later that year . 
 Although multiple funding sources were originally considered by the NEDA to fund the airport 's construction , it was decided that the project should avail of an official development assistance facility offered by the Japanese government through the then @-@ newly formed Japan Bank for International Cooperation ( <unk> ) . After almost two years of negotiations , and after initially refusing to bankroll the project , the <unk> extended a 6 @.@ 2 billion peso ( US $ 152 million ) loan to the Philippine government in August 2000 . 
 The Iloilo International Airport project was inaugurated by President Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo on January 25 , 2004 , and construction work on the new airport started on April 14 that year . The original expected deadline of completion was June 2007 , although this was moved to the first quarter of 2007 . A joint venture between the Taisei Corporation and the Shimizu Corporation of Japan served as the contractor for the project , with Phil @-@ Japan Airport Consultants , Inc. managing the project and serving as the government 's consultant to the project . The project was 75 percent complete as of July 14 , 2006 and fully complete by March 18 , 2007 . While construction was completed ahead of schedule , the airport was constructed over budget , with a final cost of around 8 @.@ 8 billion pesos ( $ 201 million ) caused by increases in the cost of civil works and consultancy services . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 During construction , the airport was officially called the New Iloilo Airport Development Project , or <unk> . However , as the airport was nearing completion , there were three main contenders for the airport 's name : Iloilo International Airport , the original name of the airport which had the support of the Iloilo provincial and city governments ; Panay International Airport , proposed by the President and supported by the RDC , which at the time was led by Antique governor <unk> Perez ; and Graciano Lopez @-@ Jaena International Airport , named after the Iloilo @-@ born Graciano López Jaena , proposed by the Dr. Graciano Lopez @-@ Jaena Foundation with the support of the RDC and Antique governor Perez , who is also a member of the foundation , and endorsed by the National Historical Institute . 
 Out of the two proposals , the name Panay International Airport was dropped due to opposition by the Iloilo city and provincial governments , the mayor of Cabatuan and Justice Secretary Raul Gonzalez , all citing that it is illogical to rename an airport after an island as large as Panay . Prospects for Graciano Lopez @-@ Jaena International Airport were better , with then Iloilo governor Niel Tupas , Sr. saying that the feasibility of renaming the airport after López Jaena or any other <unk> should be studied first . 
 Local newspaper The News Today issued an informal survey asking Iloilo City residents what should be the name of the airport and why . Although the survey is non @-@ scientific , a plurality of the nineteen respondents suggested that the name be kept as Iloilo International Airport . 
 More recently , after the opening of the airport , the local government of Cabatuan suggested renaming the airport after Tomas Confesor , a native of Cabatuan who once served as governor of Iloilo , a senator , and is known for being one of the founders of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines . This was opposed by Tupas ' successor , Arthur Defensor , Sr. , who says that the current name has geographic value . Opposition to the proposed name change has also come from Senator Drilon , the Iloilo Business Club , and the regional office of the Department of Tourism . 
 = = = Inauguration and start of operations = = = 
 Iloilo International Airport was originally scheduled to open on March 19 , 2007 , when its inaugural flight would land ; however , this was moved to April 16 , with commercial operations commencing on April 21 . This date was likewise scrapped due to the inability of the President to attend because of the hospitalization of First Gentleman Jose Miguel Arroyo , with a new date scheduled for sometime in late April . Some sources indicated that the airport would open on May 10 , 2007 during a major TEAM Unity rally in Iloilo City that President Arroyo was expected to attend , although this date was not considered in favor of a date after the 2007 elections , specifically in June , in order to avoid political overtones from dominating the airport 's opening . The final date chosen for the airport 's inauguration was June 13 , 2007 , with commercial services commencing the next day . By that time , airlines had already transferred their offices to the new airport . 
 The airport was formally opened on June 13 with the arrival of the presidential aircraft at the new airport at around 9 : 50 am PST , with Governor Tupas leading provincial and city officials in welcoming the President to the new facility . The inauguration of the new airport also included figures such as Japanese ambassador <unk> Yamazaki and Transportation and Communications Secretary Leandro Mendoza , who assisted the President in leading the inaugural rites . The facility itself was formally commissioned at 5 : 00 am PST on June 14 , coinciding with the simultaneous decommissioning of Mandurriao Airport . The first commercial flight to land at the new airport was Air Philippines Flight 987 , a Boeing 737 @-@ 200 that departed from Ninoy Aquino International Airport ( Manila ) and landed at 6 : 05 am PST the same day . 
 Operations on the first day of the airport 's commercial activity ran smoothly , although a baggage conveyor belt and X @-@ ray machines malfunctioned due to a sudden surge in passengers trying to catch their early morning flights . Some tension marred the airport 's first day after baggage porters who worked at the old airport insisted on working at the new airport . The ATO , DOTC and the porters have since agreed to a closed @-@ door conference and later on to refer the problem to DOTC Assistant Secretary Red <unk> , the person in charge of international airports in the Philippines .

 = = = Runway = = = 
 Iloilo International Airport has one primary 2 @,@ 500 @-@ meter ( 8 @,@ 200 ft ) runway 45 meters ( 148 ft ) wide . The runway runs at a direction of 02 ° / 20 ° , the same as Mandurriao Airport . Unlike the runway at Mandurriao , the longer runway at Iloilo International Airport can support aircraft as large as the Airbus A321 , Airbus A330 , Airbus A340 , Boeing 757 , Boeing 767 and Boeing 787 . Runway lights and an Instrument Landing System were installed , making the airport capable of supporting low @-@ visibility and night landings under any weather condition .
