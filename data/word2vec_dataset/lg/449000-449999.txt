 = U.S. Route 59 in Oklahoma = 
 U.S. Highway 59 ( US @-@ 59 ) heads along the eastern portion of the state of Oklahoma . US @-@ 59 's 216 @.@ 47 @-@ mile ( 348 @.@ 37 km ) route through Oklahoma takes it through the mountainous terrain of the eastern Oklahoma Ouachitas and Ozarks . US @-@ 59 serves several lakes and towns through Oklahoma 's Green Country , including Grand Lake , a major recreation center . The route enters the state from Arkansas near Fogel , Arkansas , and ends at the Kansas state line south of <unk> , Kansas . 
 US @-@ 59 was first designated in Oklahoma around 1935 . The highway 's route at that time was largely the same as it is today ; however , between the Afton area and Welch , US @-@ 59 passed through Vinita instead following the modern @-@ day route passing east of it . US @-@ 59 was changed to follow the present @-@ day route in 1951 . Since then , US @-@ 59 has undergone only minor adjustments , many of which eliminated curves and provided a more direct route for travelers using the highway to traverse eastern Oklahoma .

 US @-@ 59 enters Oklahoma in Le Flore County , in the Ouachita National Forest , at the state line at Fogel , Arkansas . US @-@ 270 is concurrent with US @-@ 59 as it crosses the line . The two routes head westward from the state line , passing through a valley between Black Fork Mountain and Rich Mountain . The first Oklahoma town the two routes pass through is unincorporated Page . Northwest of town , US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 270 form the northern terminus of US @-@ 259 , which heads south toward Nacogdoches , Texas . After this junction , US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 270 curve around to the north and pass through the two small hamlets of Zoe and Stapp . US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 270 head north , paralleling the Black Fork Poteau River as they leave the national forest , into <unk> . North of <unk> , the highways cross the main branch of the Poteau River and pass through the Wister Wildlife Management Area . Upon landing on the north bank of the river , US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 270 curve to the northeast as they enter Heavener , where SH @-@ 128 terminates . On the north side of the town , US @-@ 270 splits away to the west . US @-@ 59 parallels the Kansas City Southern Railroad and passes Heavener Memorial Cemetery . The highway turns to the northwest , passing through Howe , and intersects with SH @-@ 83 at its northern terminus . North of this junction , US @-@ 59 crosses the Poteau River again . 
 US @-@ 59 heads northward , coming to an interchange with US @-@ 271 just north of the Choctaw Country Club in the city of Poteau , county seat of Le Flore County . At this interchange , US @-@ 59 exits from the mainline to join US @-@ 271 ; continuing north through the interchange places the motorist on the Poteau Bypass , an unnumbered state highway . US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 271 proceed through Poteau , coming to an interchange at the southern terminus of SH @-@ 112 , which is also the northern terminus of the Poteau Bypass . The two concurrent roads head north through the towns of Shady Point and Panama . North of Panama , US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 271 form the eastern terminus of SH @-@ 31 . At Sunset Corner , US @-@ 59 turns to the west and US @-@ 271 turns to the east , ending the concurrency . SH @-@ 9 passes straight through this intersection from west to east ; upon turning west , US @-@ 59 follows SH @-@ 9 for five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) , splitting away southeast of <unk> . Just north of this junction , US @-@ 59 widens to a four @-@ lane divided highway . It crosses the Arkansas River on a bridge just downstream of the dam that impounds Robert S. Kerr Reservoir . Upon crossing the river , the highway enters Sequoyah County .

 US @-@ 59 's first highway junction in Sequoyah County is with SH @-@ 141 west of Gans , where the latter highway reaches its western terminus . US @-@ 59 continues northward , crossing <unk> Mountain as well as Little Sallisaw Creek , just upstream of where it empties into Robert S. Kerr Reservoir . The highway then enters the county seat of Sequoyah County , Sallisaw , where it has an interchange with Interstate 40 at Exit 308 . North of the interstate , US @-@ 59 intersects US @-@ 64 , turning east to follow the latter route into downtown Sallisaw . US @-@ 59 splits away to the north , becoming a two @-@ lane highway . North of town , the highway serves as the western terminus of SH @-@ 101 . US @-@ 59 then passes through unincorporated Brushy . North of Brushy , the highway winds through the Brushy Mountains . The road exits Sequoyah County north of this group of mountains . 
 The next county US @-@ 59 enters is mountainous Adair County . The route continues to follow a winding course as it makes its way northeast to unincorporated Cherry Tree . The highway continues northeast past Cherry Tree , before turning back to a due north course as it makes its way into the county seat of Stilwell . Here , the U.S. route has brief concurrencies with SH @-@ 100 and SH @-@ 51 . US @-@ 59 leaves Stilwell , twisting through mountainous terrain alongside Peavine Creek until the stream 's mouth at the Baron Fork of the Illinois River . The highway crosses the Baron Fork , then passes west of the unincorporated location of Baron . About twelve miles ( 19 km ) north of Stilwell , the highway intersects with US @-@ 62 in Westville . From Westville , US @-@ 59 heads northward . The highway passes just east of Mission Mountain ; north of the mountain , the road begins paralleling a Kansas City Southern railroad line . In northern Adair County , US @-@ 59 serves unincorporated Ballard and the town of Watts , where it runs just west of Lake Frances . North of Watts , the highway crosses the Illinois River and continues northward into Delaware County .

 In Delaware County , US @-@ 59 enters West Siloam Springs and becomes concurrent with US @-@ 412 . This junction is only 0 @.@ 07 miles ( 0 @.@ 11 km ) west of the Oklahoma – Arkansas state line . The two roads head westward through West Siloam Springs before coming to unincorporated Flint . US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 412 split here , with US @-@ 412 following the Cherokee Turnpike , which begins at this interchange . The eastern terminus of US @-@ 412 Alternate is also at this interchange ; it becomes concurrent with US @-@ 59 as the two routes head west . The two highways enter Kansas , Oklahoma , where they part ways at an intersection with SH @-@ 10 ; US @-@ 412 Alternate continues to the east , while US @-@ 59 turns north along SH @-@ 10 . Just north of this intersection lies an interchange with mainline US @-@ 412 , which is still on the Cherokee Turnpike at this point . US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 10 head north out of the town of Kansas , intersecting with SH @-@ 116 at its western terminus west of Colcord . As US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 10 follow a course with many curves as they approach <unk> Lake , which they bridge the east arm of . In Jay , SH @-@ 20 joins the concurrency as US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 10 turn east toward downtown Jay . There , the three highways form the southern terminus of SH @-@ 127 . On the east side of Jay , US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 10 turn north , leaving SH @-@ 20 as it heads east towards its intersection with Arkansas Highway 43 . North of Jay , US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 10 intersect with SH @-@ 127 again , this time at its northern terminus . US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 10 cross over the Honey Creek arm of Grand Lake o ' the Cherokees before coming to Grove , where SH @-@ 10 turns east and US @-@ 59 turns west . As it leaves Grove , US @-@ 59 turns northwest , running the length of a peninsula out into the lake . At the end of the peninsula , US @-@ 59 crosses the lake yet again , landing on the north shore near Copeland . The highway then passes into Ottawa County . 
 The next highway junction for US @-@ 59 , the first in Ottawa County , is with SH @-@ 125 . US @-@ 59 turns due west shortly after this junction , then curves to due north . Just east of Afton , US @-@ 59 joins US @-@ 60 and US @-@ 69 , and the three highways head northeast . However , only 0 @.@ 8 miles ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) northeast of the junction , US @-@ 60 splits off at a cloverleaf interchange which also provides access to I @-@ 44 , the Will Rogers Turnpike . US @-@ 59 and US @-@ 69 continue northward to Narcissa , where they are the site of SH @-@ 25 's eastern terminus . Further north , at <unk> , US @-@ 59 meets SH @-@ 10 again , turning west along it , while US @-@ 69 heads east along SH @-@ 10 toward Miami . US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 10 continue west , turning north for one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) before turning back to the west . Southwest of Dawes , the highways cross into Craig County . The northernmost town that US @-@ 59 serves in Oklahoma is Welch . Here , US @-@ 59 splits away from SH @-@ 10 , turning northward along unsigned SH @-@ 2 , its final stretch in Oklahoma .

 Before US @-@ 59 was designated in Oklahoma , what would become its route was designated as US @-@ 270 between the Arkansas state line and Poteau , US @-@ 271 between Poteau and Sunset Corner , SH @-@ 10 along the modern @-@ day SH @-@ 9 concurrency , SH @-@ 17 between Sallisaw and West Siloam Springs , SH @-@ 33 between West Siloam Springs and the town of Kansas , and SH @-@ 10 between Kansas and Grove . There was no road between modern @-@ day SH @-@ 9 and Sallisaw . US @-@ 59 first appeared on the official state map in 1935 . At this time , the road south of Sallisaw was marked as " Conditional Location " , and between Grove and the Kansas state line , the highway followed a different route : it proceeded west out of Grove to meet US @-@ 60 / US @-@ 66 south of Afton , concurring with those two highways to Vinita , where it turned north along SH @-@ 2 , following it to Welch and the state line . 
 The gap between SH @-@ 10 and Sallisaw was filled by the designation of a state highway there by the Oklahoma State Highway Commission on November 15 , 1935 . The commission designated this highway as US @-@ 59 , effective upon the completion of its construction . Maintenance of the portion of this road in Sequoyah County was authorized on October 22 , 1936 . 
 On October 3 , 1951 , the highway commission approved the realignment of US @-@ 59 between the highway junction northeast of Afton and Welch . The old highway between Vinita and Welch became the northern SH @-@ 2 . The Highway Commission modified US @-@ 59 's route through Westville on February 5 , 1952 . Previously , at the site of the present @-@ day US @-@ 59 / US @-@ 62 intersection , US @-@ 59 turned east along US @-@ 62 , splitting off at Williams Avenue , then followed Williams Avenue north to Main Street , where it turned east . At the eastern city limit of Westville , US @-@ 59 turned north , joining its modern @-@ day alignment 3 @.@ 2 miles ( 5 @.@ 1 km ) north of the US @-@ 62 junction . With the 1952 realignment , US @-@ 59 continued straight through the intersection , bypassing Westville to the west . The next change to US @-@ 59 was a realignment between the SH @-@ 33 junction in the town of Kansas and downtown Jay . The new highway had several curves straightened , reducing this segment 's length from 20 @.@ 6 miles ( 33 @.@ 2 km ) to 18 @.@ 9 miles ( 30 @.@ 4 km ) . This change was approved by the Highway Commission on August 19 , 1952 . 
 On July 6 , 1964 , the Oklahoma State Highway Commission approved a realignment to US @-@ 59 's route through Poteau . Another change , further north , was approved on March 4 , 1968 . This moved US @-@ 59 onto a new bridge over the Arkansas River upon completion of its construction , with the old highway being turned over to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . An application for this change was received by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) on March 26 , 1968 , and approved by that body on June 18 , 1968 . 
 The highway commission approved another alteration to US @-@ 59 in the Poteau area on February 5 , 1973 . On that date , the commission approved a realignment of US @-@ 59 from a point south of the intersection with US @-@ 270 and US @-@ 271 , to that junction , and on into Poteau . The realignment was submitted to AASHO on April 10 of that year , received on April 13 , and approved on June 26 . A section of highway north of Jay was straightened on October 7 , 1974 . Another straightening was approved the following year , this time in the vicinity of Heavener ; this change was approved by the highway commission on August 19 , 1975 , and approved by AASHO , now renamed to AASHTO , on July 13 , 1976 . On March 7 , 1977 , the Oklahoma State Transportation Commission ( which had replaced the highway commission ) approved another straightening in the Howe area . The realignment was approved by AASHTO on July 7 , 1977 . 
 The next change to US @-@ 59 came on November 2 , 1981 , when the transportation commission approved moving just over 5 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) of highway between Flint and West Siloam Springs to the north of the previous alignment . AASHTO approved the realignment on June 29 , 1982 . A section of highway , south of Stilwell , in Sequoyah and Adair counties , was straightened , shortening the highway by 0 @.@ 22 miles ( 350 m ) . The transportation commission approved on October 4 , 1982 . 
 On September 7 , 1999 , the Oklahoma State Transportation Commission approved an item realigning US @-@ 59 and SH @-@ 100 in Stilwell , removing US @-@ 59 from Second Street and placing it on Front Street . On March 3 , 2003 , the commission approved elimination of two sharp curves in western Ottawa County , shortening the highway by 0 @.@ 57 miles ( 0 @.@ 92 km ) . 
 The section of US @-@ 59 between I @-@ 40 and SH @-@ 9 was pressed into service as a detour for eastbound I @-@ 40 traffic after the collapse of its bridge over the Arkansas River on May 26 , 2002 .

 = = Synopsis = = 
 Roy Anderson ( David Denman ) enters the office and attacks Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) for kissing Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) , his former fiancé , but Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) subdues him with pepper spray . Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) and Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) fire Roy , and Jim , feeling guilty about all of his pranks over the years , tries to show his appreciation to Dwight for saving him , but each gesture is coolly rejected , as Dwight believes he only acted in the line of duty and is undeserving of any special praise . 
 Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy attacked him but her assurance that her relationship with Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism . Roy picks up his last paycheck , apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter , and asks Pam to join him for coffee . Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship ( and even friendship ) appearing to be over ; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face . Roy does not understand his long @-@ time fiancée , especially her choice to not pursue Jim . 
 Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) interviews people from the office repeatedly to hear the tale of Dwight 's heroics . Believing themselves to be alone at the end of the day , the two kiss passionately . Jim sees them and decides that keeping their relationship secret will be his gift to Dwight to make things " even " . Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) returns from anger management , and Dwight , unprovoked , subdues him with pepper spray . Toby confiscates the rest of Dwight 's arsenal , previously hidden in various locations in the office . 
 Meanwhile , Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) asks Michael for a 10 percent raise due to the extra workload resulting from Roy 's absence . When he discovers that the raise would make him higher @-@ paid than Michael , Darryl goads Michael into going to Corporate to negotiate his own raise . Jan Levinson ( Melora Hardin ) initially tries to keep their romantic relationship out of the negotiations but ultimately gives Michael the maximum 12 percent raise that was authorized despite his continued inability to negotiate properly . 
 Elsewhere , Toby becomes considerably annoyed with Ryan Howard ( B.J. Novak ) and Kelly Kapoor ( Mindy Kaling ) ' s constant making out and arguing in the cubicle next to his .

 " The Negotiation " was written by supervising producer Michael Schur and directed by Jeffrey Blitz . It featured the end of the story arc featuring Roy Anderson 's attempt to win back Pam , his former fiancée . Roy 's portrayer , David Denman , reported he was " really grateful " that executive producer Greg Daniels allowed his character to develop , " where all of a sudden , he wasn ’ t just a complete idiot but felt bad for being a bad boyfriend and wanted to try to get the girl back . It ’ s so rare to have that on a television show , because so often everyone wants you to be the same character every week . It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that . " Referring to Jim and Pam , Denman felt it was " inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together " and end the series ' love triangle . " Otherwise , " he explained , " it gets kind of tiring and old . I think it was the appropriate time [ to leave ] , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys . " Denman also added that Daniels ' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim – Pam storyline " to the next stage , " rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself . Denman briefly returned in the series ' fifth , seventh , and ninth seasons . 
 Actress Kate Flannery , who plays Meredith Palmer , attributed her love of the episode to Craig Robinson , because the two shared an enjoyment of singing together ever since the first season episode " Basketball " . She explained , " We sing on the set and in the hair and makeup trailer . We sound good together , but sometimes people are not in the mood to hear our amazing duets , mostly from the ' 80s . " Flannery believed that Robinson 's performance in the episode was " very funny , " as his character served as a " great foil for Michael Scott . " " The Negotiation " featured the return of character Andy Bernard , who had last been seen in the episode " The Return " , as he was attending anger management classes . At the time " The Return " aired , no one was certain Helms would be returning , but in early February , NBC confirmed Helms had been hired on as a series regular for the rest of the year . 
 In early 2007 , the first half of " The Negotiation " was screened before fans at Paleyfest , along with its preceding episode , " Cocktails " . According to Eric Goldman of IGN , " the crowd reacted gleefully to watching the series in the group setting , with many females ... laughing uproariously at the never ending stream of terrifically funny material . " Part of " The Negotiation " involved Michael Scott reading the Wikipedia entry on negotiations for advice in his attempt to fend off Darryl 's request for a pay raise . This scene triggered a plethora of activity around that particular article , as viewers added their own thoughts on the subject . It was ultimately placed into " semi @-@ protection " mode by Wikipedia administrators to discourage false information and vandalism among anonymous IP users . One hundred edits were added before the security protection was added .

 " The Negotiation " first aired on April 5 , 2007 in the United States on NBC as a " super @-@ sized " episode , a term used by the network and media outlets to indicate an unusually long episode . According to Nielsen Media Research , it was viewed by an estimated 6 @.@ 7 million people and earned a 3 @.@ 2 / 10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49 , the highest of the night . This means that it was seen by 3 @.@ 2 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 10 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . 
 The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics . IGN 's Brian Zoromski rated " The Negotiation " 9 @.@ 7 out of 10 , an indication of an " amazing " episode . He opined that it " had something for everyone -- uncomfortable moments , laugh @-@ out @-@ loud ridiculous situations , and scenes progressing various ongoing storylines . " Writing for AOL TV , Jay Black sympathized with Roy 's actions but faulted the writers for " just treading water " with the Jim @-@ Pam relationship . Though he called the episode a " let down " , Black did find some episode highlights , such as Angela 's " lusty " responses to Dwight 's defense of Jim . Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A. 
 In her review for Give Me My Remote , Kath Skerry wrote that the episode " left me satisfied and smiling , " ( a reference to a line from the episode " Sexual Harassment " ) partly attributing this to Roy 's attack as a " way to make a very heavy , not do funny moment hysterical . " She again expressed her dislike for Karen , but thought it " was a fun episode for my two favorite Dunder Mifflin couples : Ryan & Kelly and Dwight & Angela . " Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed the Dwight @-@ Angela scenes , asserting that " some of the best moments on screen are when those two let their freak flags fly .

 = Bramshill House = 
 Bramshill House , in Bramshill , northeast Hampshire , England , is one of the largest and most important Jacobean prodigy house mansions in England . It was built in the early 17th century by Baron Edward la Zouche of <unk> , but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later . The design shows the influence of the Italian Renaissance , which became popular in England during the late 16th century . The house was designated a Grade I listed building in 1952 . 
 The mansion 's southern façade is notable for its decorative architecture , which includes at its centre a large oriel window above the principal entrance . Interior features include a great hall displaying 92 coats of arms on a Jacobean screen , an ornate drawing room , and a 126 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 38 @.@ 6 m ) long gallery containing many portraits . Numerous columns and friezes are found throughout the mansion , while several rooms have large tapestries depicting historical figures and events on their panelled walls . The house is set in 262 @-@ acre ( 106 ha ) of grounds containing an 18 @-@ acre ( 7 @.@ 3 ha ) lake . The grounds , which received a Grade II * listing in 1984 , are part of a Registered Historic Park that includes about 25 acres ( 10 ha ) of early 17th @-@ century formal gardens near the house . The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland . 
 Bramshill appears to have been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century . The cricket ground at the house played host to a first @-@ class match in 1823 when an early Hampshire team played an England XI , and it hosted three other matches in 1825 – 26 . During the Second World War , the mansion was used as a Red Cross maternity home , before becoming the residence of the exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania for a number of years . It became the location of the Police Staff College in 1960 , and was later home to the European Police College . As a result , many campus buildings have been added to the estate . Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014 . Among the 14 ghosts reputed to haunt the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later . 
 = = Location = = 
 Bramshill House is at the approximate centre of a triangular shape formed by Reading , Basingstoke and Farnborough , about 47 miles ( 76 km ) by road southwest of central London . It lies to the northeast of Hartley <unk> , east of <unk> off the <unk> road , southeast of the village of Bramshill , which lies on the B3011 road . Three main lanes approach the property : Mansion Drive from the B3011 in the southwest , Reading Drive South from the B3011 to the east of Bramshill village from the north , and the shorter <unk> Drive which approaches it from the southeast from <unk> 's Copse , just north of the course of the River Hart . There is also a private lane within the grounds , known as Lower Pool Road , which connects Mansion Drive to Reading Drive South , passing the pond and several outer buildings .

 The 1086 Domesday Book lists one of the two manors of <unk> ( the Anglo @-@ Norman spelling of <unk> ) as held by Hugh de Port , whose family were in possession of it for nine generations . The last of the de Port line , William de Port ( who had assumed the name St. John ) , died in 1346 without leaving a male heir . In the early 14th century , Sir John Foxley , Baron of the Exchequer , ( c . 1270 – c . 1325 ) , built and endowed a chapel in the village of Bramshill . His first wife , Constance de Bramshill , may have been the heiress of the Bramshill family . Their son , Thomas Foxley ( c . 1305 – 60 ) , became MP for Berkshire in 1325 , and was appointed constable of Windsor Castle in 1328 , soon after the accession of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Edward III . In 1347 he obtained a licence to build a manor house or small castle at Bramshill , which included a 2 @,@ 500 @-@ acre ( 1 @,@ 000 ha ) wooded park . The house , built between 1351 and 1360 , had thick walls , vaulted cellars , and an internal courtyard measuring 100 feet ( 30 m ) by 80 feet ( 24 m ) . Based on the similarity of the surviving vaults under Bramshill House and those under what became the servants ' hall and steward 's room at Windsor Castle , it may have been a copy of William of Wykeham 's work there . The estate remained in the hands of the Foxley family and their heirs , the Essex family , until 1499 , when it was sold to Giles Daubeney , 1st Baron Daubeney . Giles 's son Henry Daubeney ( later Earl of Bridgewater ) sold the property to Henry VIII , and in 1547 Edward VI granted the estate to William Paulet , whose heirs sold it in 1600 to Sir Stephen Thornhurst of Agnes Court , Kent . 
 = = = New manor house = = = 
 In March 1605 , Edward la Zouche , 11th Baron Zouche , a favourite of James I , bought the property from Thornhurst . A house was earlier planned on the site for Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales ( 1594 – 1612 ) , whose heraldic feathers are displayed above the central pediment . Lord Zouche demolished a large part of the building and began to build the Bramshill House of today . Henry Shaw describes the new house which Zouche built as a " specimen of Elizabethan [ sic ] architecture [ which ] merits particular attention , exhibiting all the stateliness for which the period referred to was remarkable , with a suite of apartments both large and lofty . The amplitude of its dimensions indicate a princely residence . " 
 An inventory taken in 1634 after Zouche 's death listed the library as having 250 books and a collection of mathematical instruments , and revealed that the maids ' chamber was of a very high standard . James Zouch , grandson of Edward la Zouche , sold the property to the Earl of Antrim in 1637 , at which time the house 's furniture was valued at £ 2 @,@ 762 . During the reign of Charles I , the house was partly destroyed by a fire . On 25 June 1640 , Lord Antrim sold Bramshill for £ 9 @,@ 500 to Sir Robert Henley . In 1673 it was the property of his son , Sir Andrew Henley , 1st Baronet . 
 Sir John Cope purchased the property in 1699 , and his descendants occupied the premises until 1935 . The Cope family shortened the wings on the south side in 1703 , converted most of the chapel to a drawing room and introduced a mezzanine on the west side during the 18th century . They were responsible for much of the interior , with significant renovation work done in the 19th century and in 1920 . After his victory over Napoleon , the Duke of Wellington was offered his choice of house by Parliament ; he visited Bramshill but in 1817 chose <unk> Saye instead .

 Bramshill House became a Grade I listed building on 8 July 1952 , and was acquired by the British government the following year as a dedicated site for police training . It became the location of the National Police College in 1960 . From 2005 , two buildings on the site housed the European Police College ( <unk> ) until it was moved to Budapest in 2014 . 
 By the late 1980s the estate had become expensive to maintain , and according to Sir John Wheeler , Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee , by 1989 it was " in a poor state of repair " . The Daily Mail reported that the police were criticised for subsequent lavish spending on the estate , including £ 1 @,@ 800 for a beehive , £ 750 @,@ 000 on restoring a bridge and £ 2 million for the access drive . In July 2013 the Home Office placed the house and estate on the market for £ 25 million , citing costs of £ 5 million annually to run it . It was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014 .

 The 15 @-@ bedroom Bramshill House is one of the largest and most important Jacobean mansions in England , described as one of the " glories of English architecture " by the historians Anthony Blunt and James Lees @-@ Milne . The architecture of the three @-@ storey building was inspired by the Italian Renaissance , and was executed mainly by German builders . It is approximately 140 feet ( 43 m ) in length . The design is traditionally attributed to the architect John Thorpe , although no records remain to confirm the attribution . The building stands on the edge of a plateau , overlooking the park to the south . The plan of the house is unusual , partly because of its incorporation of the earlier building ; it extends at right angles to the primary ( southern ) façade . The elevations are symmetrical , facing outwards , but the interior court is narrow , and projecting wings lie at either end of the eastern and western sides . Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east . There are three vaulted cellars to the west . The house is built of red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone , with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings . Stone dressings are featured on numerous large mullion windows . An open carved parapet surmounts the building . The roof consists of red tiles , and there are large gables on the west side . The chimney stacks are rectangular . 
 = = = = North and south = = = = 
 The north façade has three bays separated by windows and features a loggia , typical of early 17th @-@ century houses , with a central arched entrance to accommodate coaches . The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a <unk> Dutch gable , which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at either side of the gable . Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on this side , building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house . 
 The southern façade was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as " among the most fanciful pieces of Jacobean design in [ England ] " . It is three storeys high and features three sets of three bays in either wing , with five inner sections . The outer two of the inner sections feature eight angular windows , aligned in rows of four on the first two floors and then a row of four windows on the top floor . The inner two sections feature the same layout on the first and top floors with eight windows aligned in rows of four on the first floor and four windows on the top floor , but the ground floor features two arches , which form part of the central loggia . The stone central bay , 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide , is emphasised by superimposed double decorated pilasters on all floors and the central archway of the loggia in the Doric , Ionic , and Corinthian orders , surmounted by a florid perforated pediment . In addition there is an oriel window on the first floor above the main entrance . 
 An important difference from the other sides of this building is a terrace , 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) in width , between the projecting wings , a kind of architectural foreground to the garden . The terrace is bounded by a 3 feet 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 99 m ) high balustrade . The arcade on the terrace of the southern front is a good example of Italian domestic architecture , used in villas . The triglyphs and ornamented metopes , together with the simple capitals of the columns , indicate the Doric order , but are light enough to be Ionic . 
 = = = = East and west = = = = 
 The east façade is the longest , about 124 feet ( 38 m ) wide , and two storeys high . It features four full @-@ height angular bays with two windows between , while its upper walls have two arches set within a rectangular panel . On this side there is a <unk> Terrace with a lawn , as well as two arcaded openings at the side on either wing of the house . The southernmost arcaded opening contains a bench with eight arches and has three tables , one of which is older and octagonal . Carved in the wall at the side is a frieze consisting of four squares , each depicting an animal : a lion , an elephant , a wild boar and a camel . 
 The west façade dates to the 18th century and is the only one with multiple gables ; the windows on the ground floor are sashed . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The mansion is richly furnished with period pieces . Many of the rooms have large tapestries on their panelled walls depicting historical figures and scenes . Those in the drawing room contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by Peter Paul Rubens , who supervised the work in Brussels . These tapestries were initially made for Dudley Carleton , 1st Viscount Dorchester , Zouche 's brother @-@ diplomat , but in the end he rejected them for another set ; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known . Rubens ' sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in the Munich gallery , Alte Pinakothek . 
 The ground floor contains , in the west section , the former dining room and kitchen . The openings in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope , uncovering an original doorway with a four @-@ centred pointed arch . Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room , which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted . The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance on the north side of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard , and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas . 
 The Great Hall , to which an arcaded porch gives direct access , retains the basic design of the original construction . It has a dais and a Jacobean stone screen , 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) high , decorated with 92 shields . Resident families emblazoned the shields with the arms of ancestors and family members . The entablature of the screen has a double row of 40 sculptured shields and has a depth of 2 feet 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) . Beyond the dais , double doors lead into the Terrace Hall at the foot of the staircase . Across from this is the former dining room , containing a large tapestry , believed to be made by an English artist , " representing forest scenery in very subdued colours " . During the time of the Cope family in the 1880s , the kitchen near the south hall was used as a dairy . The kitchen and the adjoining room had back @-@ to @-@ back fireplaces . 
 = = = = Drawing room and library = = = = 
 The drawing room , containing four bay windows of different sizes , is panelled with oak for its entire height of about 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) . One of the upper panels , surmounted by its Corinthian entablature , is a frieze depicting a fig , grape , and pomegranate , each with foliage and blossoms . One of the lower panels , part of the dado in the same room , has a section of projecting mouldings . The upper panel is 2 feet 10 inches ( 0 @.@ 86 m ) by 2 feet 4 inches ( 0 @.@ 71 m ) ; the lower , 2 feet 7 inches ( 0 @.@ 79 m ) by 2 feet 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) . 
 The massive chimneypiece in the drawing room is classically designed , believed to be inspired by one of the great Italian architects of 16th @-@ century Mannerism , Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola . It is two storeys in height , the lower being Doric and the upper Ionic . The distribution of the members is regular , and the shafts of the columns are variegated marble . The upper compartment of the chimney @-@ piece is composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material , and the frieze of the upper order also consists of coloured marble in the centre . The fireplace is 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) wide and 4 feet 8 inches ( 1 @.@ 42 m ) high , and retains the ancient <unk> , used for burning wood . These are large and well adorned , particularly in the lower part . 
 The ceilings of the drawing room and library are the most elaborate in the house . The plaster frieze in the library also displays fine workmanship ; 1 foot 7 inches ( 0 @.@ 48 m ) wide , it is designed in a striking arabesque pattern , with an evident Florentine influence . In the 1880s the library had a collection of 5 @,@ 000 volumes , about half the number of books the Cope family owned at the time . 
 = = = = Staircase and first floor = = = = 
 The standards and balusters of the stairs on the north side of the hall came from <unk> Manor House and probably date to the mid @-@ 17th century , although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid @-@ 16th century . The walls above the stairs and on the first @-@ floor landing contain some very large paintings , including several portraits . 
 Beyond the staircase are the state rooms and what was known as the " Wrought Room " . The room has an ornamental ceiling with a Renaissance chimneypiece . Two of the bedrooms , the two " White Rooms " , were originally connected to what was called the Flower @-@ de @-@ luce Room , but the doors were boarded up . 
 The Long Gallery fills the first floor of the northern range : 126 @.@ 5 feet ( 38 @.@ 6 m ) long and with a richly decorated stucco ceiling and a complex wooden chimneypiece , it formerly contained a " very curious collection of portraits of distinguished characters " . 
 Also on the first floor is the " Chapel Drawing Room " in the south wing , connected to the Drawing Room . The Copes created this room by reducing the size of the original chapel , which is entered through it . The current chapel has an altar reredos with paintings of the Virgin Mary , St. Stephen , St. Mary Magdalene and St. John the Evangelist , by Alexander Rowan and dated by Pevsner to about 1840 . The tapestry in the chapel room is older than the house , and was assessed by an expert as dating to 1450 or earlier ; in the early 19th century it had hung in the Red Drawing Room . When the chapel ceiling was restored by Sir William Cope , it was discovered that one section of the plaster work had previously been replaced with carved wood . The large window in the south wall of the courtyard was presumably moved from the original chapel . 
 = = Grounds and garden = = 
 The house is set in 262 @-@ acre ( 106 ha ) of grounds , which include an 18 @-@ acre ( 7 @.@ 3 ha ) lake north of the house . The grounds form part of a Registered Historic Park that received a Grade II * listing in 1984 . Under this designation are the 25 acres ( 10 ha ) of early 17th @-@ century formal gardens near the house , the wider 490 acres ( 200 ha ) medieval park , landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century , with 250 acres ( 100 ha ) of woodland and buildings including an icehouse and a folly known as Conduit House . Parts of the park have been used for commercial softwood production since the 19th century . 
 To the west of the house is <unk> Copse and to the east Bramshill Forest , and the grounds contained what was known as the " Green Court " and the " Flower Garden " at the time of William Henry Cope in the 1880s . The Grade I listed gatehouse dates to the time of the <unk> . The fir trees in the grounds are reputed to have been planted " as a memento of his former home " by James I , who brought them from Scotland . The formal gardens were first laid out by Edward la Zouche , who was a horticulturist . Sir John Cope redesigned the gardens and continued the planting of trees in the park . At the close of the 18th century the grounds were re @-@ landscaped to be less formal , and some areas in the south were returned to parkland . 
 Bramshill Park was conceived as a " hunting box " for Henry Frederick and became a popular estate for hunting . On 24 July 1621 , while hunting in the park , George Abbot , Archbishop of Canterbury , accidentally shot and killed one of the gamekeepers with his crossbow . An inquiry cleared him of murder . Another notable clergyman / hunter who frequented Bramshill was Charles Kingsley , rector of <unk> , who hunted fox and deer and collected butterflies there and frequently took his family and friends . Kingsley was reportedly especially enamoured with the fir trees , which he considered " a source of constant delight " , fondly naming them " James the First 's gnarled giants " . In the 19th century , Sir John Cope , a friend of Kingsley 's , was known as a supporter of the fox hunt and especially as a breeder of fox hounds . The opening of the season at Bramshill in the late 1840s was noted in the British hunting press . 
 The main avenue approaches from the southwest , through an arched gateway formed by two Grade II listed early 19th @-@ century lodges , before crossing the Broad Water formed by the River Hart by a Grade I listed early 19th @-@ century bridge with two arches . There are separate listings for other structures near the house , including the Grade I listed early 17th @-@ century triple @-@ arched gateway on the route to Reading to the northeast of the house , Grade I listed early 17th @-@ century boundary walls and turrets to the south and west , Grade II listed boundary walls and gate @-@ piers to the west , including the kitchen garden , Grade I listed garden walls and gateways to the north and east , and the Grade II listed late 18th @-@ century stable block to the north . 
 = = Legends = = 
 Bramshill has been cited as one of the most haunted houses in England . According to one UK police officer who worked at the college , 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified , although another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously . They include a Grey Lady ( one story suggests that her husband , a religious dissenter , was beheaded in the 17th century ) and a Green Man ( a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806 , according to the journalist P. Lal , or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton , according to the author Penny Legg ) . The Green Man , dressed as his name suggests , reportedly manifests near the lake , as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there . The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace , the library , and the chapel . Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance , with a sad , tear @-@ stained face and golden hair , and smelling of the lilies of the valley ; Lal argues that she has reddish @-@ brown hair and wears a grey , sleeveless robe . The Grey Lady 's husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room . The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room ; the child has supposedly been heard crying , and attempts to hold visitors ' hands . Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child 's mother . A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne , and a knight in armour , are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room . The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th @-@ century dress , and by that of a nun . A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb , reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train , has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house . A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century . 
 In addition , Bramshill House was cited by the historian William Page as a possible location for the Legend of the Mistletoe Bough , a ghost story associated with several English country mansions . This legend tells of a bride who supposedly hid in a wooden chest during a game of hide and seek on her wedding night . In the case of Bramshill House , the story has it that this happened at Christmas time , and that the bride was found fifty years later still wearing her wedding dress and with a sprig of mistletoe in her hand ; the chest is on display in the entrance hall . The woman is sometimes identified as John Cope 's daughter Anne , who married Hugh Bethell of Yorkshire . An alternative claim is that she was <unk> Orsini , who was married in 1727 , and that her ghost came to Bramshill from Italy together with the chest . In his monograph on the house , the Victorian writer Sir William Cope preferred this theory and added that the chest on display was not the original , which had been proved large enough by " a woman of comely proportions " who had tested it by lying down in it , but which had been taken away by Sir Denzil Cope 's widow in 1812 . The ghost of the bride is referred to as the White Lady , and she is said by Legg to haunt the Fleur de Lys room . According to Legg , Michael I of Romania asked to be moved to another room during a stay there , in order to not be disturbed by the young woman in white who passed through his bedroom every night . An old man with a grey beard , thought by Legg to be the father or husband of the White Lady , is reported to stare through windows and at the Mistletoe Chest . 
 = California State Route 186 = 
 State Route 186 ( SR 186 ) is a route that connects Interstate 8 ( I @-@ 8 ) with the U.S. – Mexico border near the Colorado River . Its southern terminus is near Los Algodones , Baja California , and its northern terminus is near Winterhaven , California in the location of Araz Junction . The route is only 2 @.@ 070 miles ( 3 @.@ 331 km ) long , heading along the length of the Alamo Canal and the All @-@ American Canal within the boundaries of the Fort Yuma @-@ Quechan Reservation . The route was assigned in 1972 in Imperial County , and the interchange with I @-@ 8 was constructed a year later . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 186 begins at the United States – Mexico border ( near Avenue International ) in the community of Los Algodones . The route heads to the northeast along the Alamo Canal and crosses the center of the Fort Yuma @-@ Quechan Reservation . Most of the surroundings of SR 186 are desolate , compared to the developed region across the border in Mexico . The highway continues northward , crossing the All @-@ American Canal , where it turns to the north . SR 186 continues northward to an interchange with I @-@ 8 in Araz Junction , where the route terminates at the northbound ramps . The route continues northward as locally maintained Araz Road . Near the interchange is a casino operated by the Quechan Native American tribe that opened in 2009 . 
 SR 186 is not part of the National Highway System , a network of highways that are essential to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . In 2013 , SR 186 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 3 @,@ 700 at the southern end , and 8 @,@ 100 at the junction with I @-@ 8 , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway .

 = Vicinage Clause = 
 The Vicinage Clause is a provision in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution regulating the vicinity from which a jury pool may be selected . The clause says that the accused shall be entitled to a jury " of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law " . The Vicinage Clause limits the vicinity of criminal jury selection to both the state and the federal judicial district where the crime has been committed whereas the venue provision of Article Three of the United States Constitution regulates the location of the actual trial . 
 The Vicinage clause has its roots in medieval English criminal procedure , the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti @-@ federalist objections to the United States Constitution . The clause is one of the few constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts , along with the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and ( maybe ) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment . 
 The Clause has led to very little litigation , in part because of its overlap ( as a practical matter ) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure . Further , with the exception of the District of Wyoming , which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana ( see below ) , no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states ( although the short @-@ lived District of Potomac once did ) .

 The Oxford English Dictionary defines " vicinage " as " A number of places lying near to each other taken collectively ; an area extending to a limited distance round a particular spot ; a neighbourhood . " The OED cites Thomas Fuller 's Church History ( 1655 ) : " King Ethelred . . . began the <unk> of Causes by a Jury of twelve men to be chosen out of the <unk> . " According to Blackstone , in medieval England , the " vicinage of the jury " referred to a jury drawn from the relevant county . 
 A 1543 statute of Henry VIII of England permits treason committed outside the " realm " to be tried " before such commissioners , and in such shire of the realm , as shall be assigned by the King 's majesty 's commission . " Parliament renewed the statute in 1769 . This law was used to try colonists accused of treason in England . 
 A 1772 statute of George III of the United Kingdom permits destruction of dockyards , magazines , ships , ammunition , and supplies committed outside the " realm " to be tried in any " shire or county within this realm . " A 1772 statute permitted capital crimes committed in Massachusetts to be tried in England or a neighboring province if " an indifferent trial cannot be had within " Massachusetts .

 The Virginia House of Burgesses condemned the renewal of the treason law on May 16 , 1769 in the Virginia Resolves : 
 [ A ] ll Trials for Treason , <unk> for Treason , and for any Felony or Crime whatsoever , committed and done in this his Majesty 's said Colony and Dominion , by any Person or Persons residing therein , ought of right to be had , and conducted in and before his Majesty 's Courts , held within the said Colony , according to the fixed and known Course of Proceedings ; and that the seizing of any Person or Persons , residing in this Colony , suspected of any Crime whatsoever , committed therein , and sending such Person or Persons to Places beyond the Sea , to be tried , is highly derogatory of the Rights of British subjects . . . . 
 The same resolution referred to the " inestimable Privilege of being tried by a Jury from the Vicinage . " 
 The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress adopted on October 14 , 1774 , resolved : 
 That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England , and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage , according to the course of that law . 
 On October 26 , 1774 , the Continental Congress approved an address to the people of Quebec , drafted by Thomas Cushing , Richard Henry Lee , and John Dickinson , arguing that : 
 [ One ] great right is that of trial by jury . This provides , that neither life , liberty nor property , can be taken from the possessor , until twelve of his unexceptionable countrymen and peers of his vicinage , who from that neighbourhood may reasonably be supposed to be acquainted with his character , and the characters of the witnesses . . . .

" The proposals of Alexander Hamilton and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney were similar . The Committee of Detail and Committee of the Whole amended this language and included it within Article Three , Section Two , Clause Three . Article III provides : " The Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed . " This provision received almost no debate in the Constitutional Convention . 
 The omission of a vicinage right from the United States Constitution was among the objections of the Anti @-@ federalists to the ratification of the Constitution . James Madison explained the omission of a vicinage clause in the Virginia Ratifying Convention as follows : 
 It was objected yesterday , that there was no provision for a jury from the vicinage . If it could have been done with safety , it would not have been opposed . It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county . Suppose a rebellion in a whole district , would it not be impossible to get a jury ? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America . There are deviations of it in England : yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence , than have taken place there for a long time , though it be left to the legislative discretion . It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from , yet in some cases it is necessary . It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances . This is a complete and satisfactory answer . 
 Virginia ratified the Constitution , with a proviso that a Bill of Rights , including a right to " trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage , " be added by amendment . North Carolina adopted the same proviso as Virginia , but refused to ratify the Constitution in its absence . New York and Rhode Island ratified the constitution with similar <unk> as Virginia ( but , in the case of Rhode Island , the Sixth Amendment had already been sent to the states for ratification ) . The ratifying <unk> of Massachusetts did not include a vicinage right ; a proviso including a vicinage right was considered and rejected in Pennsylvania .

 James Madison 's ( A @-@ VA ) original draft of the jury provision of the Sixth Amendment provided : 
 The trial of all crimes ( except in cases of impeachment , and cases arising in the land or naval forces , or the militia when on actual service , in time of war or public danger ) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage , with the requisite of unanimity for conviction , of the right of challenge , and other accustomed requisites . . . provided that in cases of crimes committed within any county which may be in possession of an enemy , or in which a general insurrection may prevail , the trial may by law be authorized in some other county of the same state , as near as may be to the seat of the offence . 
 Madison intended this language to replace Article Three , Section Two , Clause Three , rather than be appended to the Constitution . The Committee of Eleven of the House amended Madison 's language as follows : 
 The trial of all crimes ( except in cases of impeachment , and in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia when on actual service in the time of war , or public danger , ) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage , with the requisite of unanimity for conviction , the right of challenge , and other accustomed requisites . . . . [ B ] ut if a crime be committed in a place in the possession of an enemy , or in which an insurrection may prevail , the indictment and trial may by law be authorized in some other place within the same State ; and if it be committed in a place not within a state , the indictment and trial may be at such place or places as the law may have directed . 
 <unk> Burke ( A @-@ SC ) proposed that " vicinage " be replaced by " district or county in which the offence has been committed . " Richard Henry Lee ( A @-@ VA ) argued that " vicinage " was better , " it being a term well understood by every gentleman of legal knowledge . " Rep. Burke 's amendment was defeated . As amended by the Committee of Eleven , this language passed the House . The Committee of Three , undertaking the task of transforming the amendments to the body of the Constitution into a separate Bill of Rights , moved the language to Article X and deleted the language concerning crimes not committed within a state . 
 = = = Senate = = = 
 The Senate debated the Bill of Rights from September 2 to September 9 and returned a version to the House on September 10 . The Senate deleted every clause from the House version of the Sixth Amendment , with the exception of the grand jury indictment clause . A motion to restore the House wording failed . 
 Little is known about the Senate debate due to the illness of Senator Samuel Maclay whose journal is a key source for the proceedings of the Senate during the first Congress . A September 14 , 1789 letter from Madison to Edmund Pendleton reports : 
 The Senate have sent back the plan of amendments with some alternations , which strike , in my opinion , at the most salutary articles . In many of the States , juries , even in criminal cases , are taken from the State at large ; in others , from districts of considerable extent ; in very few from the County alone . Hence a dislike to the restraint with respect to vicinage , which has produced a negative on that clause . . . . Several others have had a similar fate . 
 = = = Conference Committee = = = 
 The altered form in which the Senate returned the Bill of Rights to the House lead to a conference committee composed of members of both bodies . The members of the committee from the House proposed that the jury simply be defined as <unk> with " the accustomed requisites . " 
 The members of the committee from the Senate were opposed to <unk> the vicinage requirement , believing that the vicinage provisions of the first Judiciary Act ( already being debate ) were sufficient . A second letter from Madison to Pendleton recounts that the Senators were 
 inflexible in opposing a definition of the locality of Juries . The vicinage they contend is either too vague or too strict a term ; too vague if depending on limits to be fixed by the pleasure of the law , too strict if limited to the county . It was proposed to insert after the word Juries , " with the accustomed requisites , " leaving the definition to be construed according to the judgment of professional men . Even this could not be obtained . The truth is that in most of the States the practice is different , and hence the irreconcilable difference of ideas on the subject . In most States , jurors are drawn from the whole body of the community indiscriminately ; in others , from large districts comprehending a number of Counties ; and in a few only from a single County . The Senate suppose , also , that the provision for vicinage in the Judiciary bill will sufficiently quiet the fears which called for an amendment on this point . 
 The committee adopted the version that passed Congress and was ratified by the states : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 " Jury ... " 
 The Vicinage Clause applies only to petit juries , not grand juries ( although some cases finding no violation of the Clause have assumed without deciding that the Clause does apply to grand juries ) . 
 " ... of the State and district ... " 
 In murder cases arising from the Indian Territory , <unk> Island , and the No Man 's Land of the Oklahoma Panhandle , the Supreme Court has held that the Clause places no limits on the prosecution of crimes committed outside the territory of a state . 
 The Clause does not require a jury drawn from the judicial division ( a subset of a federal judicial district ) within which the crime occurred ; rather , the jury may be drawn from any division of the district . Nor does the Clause prevent the jury from being drawn solely from a judicial division , or any other subset of a judicial district ( rather than the entire judicial district ) . 
 " ... wherein the crime shall have been committed , ... " 
 The " wherein the crime shall have been committed " language of the clause is in parallel with the venue provision of Article Three — " where the said Crimes shall have been committed .

" The three provisions have been interpreted in tandem to refer to the locus delicti of the offense . 
 " ... which district shall have been previously ascertained by law " 
 Lower courts are split on whether the Clause requires that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence at the time the crime was committed . Some courts have held that it does . Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial . Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district , but retains the former configuration for past offenses .

 The Third , Fifth , and Sixth Circuits have held that the Vicinage Clause was not incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment . 
 = = = The perfect crime ? = = = 
 Professor Brian C. Kalt of Michigan State University College of Law argues that the Vicinage Clause may permit the commission of the " perfect crime " in the portion of Yellowstone National Park within the state of Idaho because the entire park is within the District of Wyoming and the Idaho portion of the park has no residents ( and that a less perfect crime could be committed in the lightly populated Montana portion of the park ) . Kalt argues that two arguments the government might make in favor of prosecution would be unsuccessful : that the Idaho portion of the park is not part of a state and that the judicial district could be changed after the crime . 
 However , Kalt argues that the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial strategies that would at least partially close this loophole . First , the government might be able to charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park ( for example , if the defendant ( s ) conspired elsewhere ) . Second , the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less , to which the jury right does not attach . Third , the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime . Fourth , the government might argue for a purposive , rather than textualist , interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause . Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice . 
 This same problem also was cited by the Nevada Legislature as a reason to dissolve Bullfrog County , Nevada , a short @-@ lived county specially created in 1987 for purposes of shifting federal transfer payments related to the creation of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility directly to the state treasury .

 Before the adoption of the federal Constitution , only two state constitutions provided an explicit vicinage right . The Virginia Constitution of 1776 provided : " in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to . . . an impartial jury of twelve men of his vicinage . " The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 read similarly , but said " county " instead of " vicinage " ; it was amended in 1790 to say " vicinage . " 
 By contrast , four of the original thirteen state constitutions contained explicit criminal venue provisions . New Hampshire ( 1784 ) and Georgia ( 1777 and 1789 ) required crimes to be tried in the county where committed . Maryland ( 1776 ) and Massachusetts ( 1780 ) contained similar provisions . 
 In Coleman 's Appeal ( 1874 ) , the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that " a man shall only be liable to be called on to answer for civil wrongs in the forum of his home , and the tribunal of his vicinage . " 
 = Alucard ( Castlevania ) = 
 Adrian Fahrenheit Ţepeş ( <unk> ・ <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , better known as Alucard ( <unk> , <unk> ) , is a character in Konami 's Castlevania series of video games . His first appearance in the series was in the 1989 game Castlevania III : Dracula 's Curse , but he is best known for his role in the critically acclaimed Castlevania : Symphony of the Night , released in 1997 . His design in Symphony of the Night was created by Ayami Kojima , marking her first contribution to the Castlevania franchise . 
 In the series , Alucard is the son of Dracula , the antagonist of the Castlevania series . Due to his human mother , Lisa , Alucard is a dhampir , a half @-@ human , half @-@ vampire . His mother 's death and admonition not to hate humanity caused him to take up arms against his father . In Dracula 's Curse and Castlevania Legends , he fights against his father alongside the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan , and he is featured as the protagonist of Symphony of the Night . Alucard additionally is present in Castlevania : Aria of Sorrow and the follow @-@ up sequel Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow , where he interacts with the protagonist of both games , Soma Cruz , as the Japanese government agent Genya Arikado ( <unk> <unk> , Arikado Gen 'ya ) . The Lords of Shadow reboot series , starting with the character 's introduction in Castlevania : Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate , changes Alucard 's backstory , revealing him as Trevor Belmont , once a mortal who was transformed into a vampire after his death at the hands of his biological father , the remorseful Dracula . 
 Several video game publications have provided praise and criticism on Alucard 's character . In Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow , where Alucard was present as Genya Arikado , reviewers noted that although he fell into a stereotypical character mold , the greater concentration on supporting characters was a welcomed change from previous Castlevania games . 
 = = Conception and design = = 
 Alucard debuted in Castlevania III : Dracula 's Curse for the Nintendo Entertainment System , where he was designed by T. Fujimoto and I. Urata . He was intended to be a mirror image of his father , as evidenced by his name , his father 's name spelled backwards . Much of the original artwork for the game was lost during the Great Hanshin earthquake . Alucard 's subsequent appearances would largely be designed by Ayami Kojima , who managed the character designs for Castlevania : Symphony of the Night and Castlevania : Aria of Sorrow . 
 Kojima 's work in Symphony of the Night was her first breakthrough into the gaming industry , and her dark , gothic style borrows heavily from bishōnen @-@ style art . In Aria of Sorrow , Kojima 's designs followed the " different route " theme that producer Koji Igarashi was attempting to pursue with Aria of Sorrow by placing it in a futuristic setting . Following this theme , Alucard 's appearance as Genya Arikado was made much more contemporary , featuring modern attire as versus the medieval appearance of previous Castlevania characters . Kojima was not present in the design team for Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow , and Arikado , along with the rest of the cast , were drawn in an anime style . Igarashi , also the producer of Dawn of Sorrow , wished to utilize the anime style as a marketing technique due to his belief that the Nintendo DS targeted a younger audience than previous Castlevania games had . The anime style would also serve as a litmus test as to whether future Castlevania games would incorporate the style . 
 = = = Voice actors = = = 
 Symphony of the Night was the second Castlevania game to use voice actors for the characters ( the first being the Akumajō Dracula X Chi no Rondo for the PC Engine Super CD @-@ ROM ² , which released only in Japan at the time ) . The Japanese voice actor for Alucard was Ryōtarō Okiayu , and the English voice actor was Robert Belgrade . In Castlevania The Dracula X Chronicles , Castlevania Judgment and Castlevania : Harmony of Despair , Alucard was English voiced by Yuri Lowenthal . Igarashi noted that due to fan complaints over the poor voice acting in a majority of the original cast in Symphony of the Night , a new script for the game better translating the original Japanese text , as well as a set of new voice actors were used .

 In the 1989 Castlevania III : Dracula 's Curse for the NES , Alucard is initially a boss encountered over the course of the game by the primary protagonist , Trevor Belmont . If the player defeats Alucard , he can be utilized as a playable character in the game . This was a significant departure from the first two Castlevania games for the NES , and the fourth installment on the Super NES , which only featured Simon Belmont as the primary playable character , and Alucard 's abilities , a fireball attack and the ability to transform into a bat , were unique elements introduced into the series . Following the defeat of Dracula and the game 's conclusion , Alucard voluntarily goes into a protracted sleep to ease his feelings of patricide and to prevent his powers from harming the world . 
 Alucard 's following appearance in the series is in the 1997 Castlevania : Symphony of the Night for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn , where he is featured as the game 's protagonist and primary playable character . He is described as a man of great strength and inhuman beauty . Due to the brainwashing of the current member of the Belmont clan , Richter Belmont , Alucard heads to his father 's castle to find Richter and ensure that Dracula does not return into the world . He encounters Richter , who has been controlled by the dark priest Shaft into believing he is the lord of Dracula 's castle , and Alucard manages to free him from the spell controlling him . In response , Shaft creates an inverted version of Dracula 's castle for Alucard to travel through , and Alucard defeats Shaft , and ultimately , Dracula as well . Symphony of the Night also expands on Alucard 's background , revealing how his human mother , Lisa , was hunted down and executed by humans who believed her to be a witch . Despite this , Lisa admonished Alucard to respect humans and not hate them as his father did . Alucard 's placement as a protagonist was unusual for the series up to that point , as previous Castlevania games had featured often members of the Belmont clan as the protagonists . Symphony of the Night would later be re @-@ released as part of the Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 , on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 , and part of Castlevania The Dracula X Chronicles , a compilation that contained Symphony of the Night alongside Akumajō Dracula X Chi no Rondo . Aside from the changing of the script and Alucard 's voice actor to Yuri Lowenthal , his role in the Symphony of the Night portion of The Dracula X Chronicles remains the same . 
 The 1997 Castlevania Legends for the Game Boy was Alucard 's third appearance in the series . Similar to his initial appearance in Dracula 's Curse , he is a boss challenging the skills of the game 's protagonist , Sonia Belmont . After she defeats him , he accepts her strength and decides to submerge his powers by sleeping , believing that she will defeat Dracula in his stead . Koji Igarashi later removed Castlevania Legends from the official canon of the series , meaning that the plot of the game never occurred in the series ' continuity . 
 In the 2003 Castlevania : Aria of Sorrow for the Game Boy Advance , Alucard is present in disguise as the enigmatic Japanese government agent Genya Arikado in order to prevent the powers of his father , who was finally killed by Julius Belmont , from ending up in the wrong hands . He meets the game 's protagonist , Soma Cruz , and explains his " power of dominance , " or his ability to absorb the souls of the monsters he defeats and use their abilities . He instructs him to seek out the castle 's throne room , where Soma realizes that he is Dracula 's reincarnation . Arikado subsequently advises Soma to destroy the flow of chaos in the castle to free himself from his fate , which Soma succeeds in doing . 
 Alucard reprises his role as Arikado in the sequel to Aria of Sorrow , the 2005 Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow for the Nintendo DS , where he works to stop the machinations of a cult headed by Celia Fortner to create a new dark lord by killing Soma . Arikado initially requests that Soma does not become involved , but gives him a letter and talisman from Mina when he encounters him later in the game . After both of Celia 's " dark lord 's candidates , " Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi , are defeated , Arikado stops Celia 's attempt to force Soma to awaken into the new dark lord , but inadvertently allows Dmitrii to revive himself . He confronts him , but is stopped when Dmitrii uses Celia as a sacrifice to seal his powers . Following Soma 's battle with Menace , a giant demon that sprouts from Dmitrii , Arikado explains to Soma that he is not destined to become the dark lord , nor does he need to . In the game 's Julius Mode , Arikado is playable as Alucard after he is found in the castle . 
 Alucard was one of the playable characters in Castlevania Judgment for the Nintendo Wii , a fighting game based on the series . 
 = = = Lords of Shadow = = = 
 Alucard appears in Castlevania : Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate , a chapter of the Lords of Shadow reboot series . It is revealed that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont , the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont , conceived before Gabriel was turned into a vampire and became the dark lord Dracula . Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were . Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood , he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land . After infiltrating the castle , Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room , where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son , or telling Dracula his name . Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort , in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross . Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him , calling him his father . Dracula , confused , gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along . <unk> and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time , Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood , which seems to be in vain . Dracula mourns over his loss , and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard , since he never learned his son 's real name . Many years later Alucard awakens , with pale white skin , white hair , and glowing orange eyes . He meets up with Dracula and his own son , Simon . Alucard tries to finish what he started , angry that his father turned him into a vampire . Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood , but Alucard refuses . Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont , wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life . Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula , and part ways as Dracula 's castle crumbles . 
 Alucard appears in the sequel Castlevania : Lords of Shadow 2 as a supporting character . Since the game takes place centuries later , Alucard 's personality and standing towards his father has drastically changed . He believes that Dracula can still be redeemed and makes it his goal to free the world from tyranny and vanquish the evil that had corrupted him and his father . He concocts a centuries spanning plan to put his father into a deep sleep by piercing his heart with the <unk> sword , in order to make both the lord of the dead , Zobek and Satan himself , believe that Dracula is dead , so they can come out in the open . Once they do , Alucard would remove the sword so Dracula can resurrect and then destroy Zobek and Satan for good . Dracula agrees with his son 's plan and awakens centuries later during modern times . Throughout the game Alucard also appears as a younger Trevor Belmont and guides Dracula through his Castle to help him recover his old powers and missing memories . In order to not draw suspicion to his plan , Alucard masquerades himself as Zobek 's Lieutenant and eventually reveals his true identity to his father once he remembers their pact . They destroy Zobek and Satan and appear to be on good terms in the end . Alucard is also the protagonist of the DLC Revelations , taking place shortly prior to the events of the game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Alucard has received praise and criticism from several video game publications , primarily concentrating on his role in Symphony of the Night . GameSpot featured him in their article " All Time Greatest Game Hero " . In a review of Symphony of the Night , RPGFan celebrated the fact that Alucard was not a member of the Belmont clan , the protagonists of most Castlevania games , and that the fact he was Dracula 's son added " an element of depth to the plot " due to the varied reactions he would receive from the inhabitants of Dracula 's castle . RPGamer disagreed with this assessment , noting that the plot and Alucard 's role " isn 't very deep " and secondary to the concentration on gameplay . GameSpot called Alucard 's sprite and running animation " easily some of the most impressive visuals in the entire Castlevania library . " James Paul Gee of <unk> noted that " even though Alucard is a vampire hunter , he has no distinctive skills associated with this profession " . In 2012 , GamesRadar ranked him as the 91st best hero in video games . Empire also included Alucard on their list of the 50 greatest video game characters , ranking him as 34th . 
 Alucard 's appearance in Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow as Genya Arikado was also noted by reviewers . RPGamer celebrated how the greater concentration on supporting characters , including Arikado , were a welcome change from previous Castlevania games . RPGFan derided Arikado 's " cool and impassive personality " as stereotypical , but praised the game 's character development as setting him apart from previous supporting characters in the series . The switch to an anime style for the character designs in Dawn of Sorrow was notably criticized , as many reviewers preferred the designs made by Ayami Kojima . GameSpy deplored the " shallow , lifeless anime images " and IGN called the images " down to the level of ' generic Saturday morning Anime ' quality . " 
 = To Kill a Mockingbird = 
 To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960 . It was immediately successful , winning the Pulitzer Prize , and has become a classic of modern American literature . The plot and characters are loosely based on the author 's observations of her family and neighbors , as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936 , when she was 10 years old . 
 The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor , despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality . The narrator 's father , Atticus Finch , has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers . One critic explains the novel 's impact by writing , " In the twentieth century , To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America , and its protagonist , Atticus Finch , the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism . " 
 As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman , the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence . Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class , courage , compassion , and gender roles in the American Deep South . The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice . Despite its themes , To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms , often challenged for its use of racial epithets . 
 Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication . Literary analysis of it is sparse , considering the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education . Author Mary McDonough Murphy , who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures , calls the book , " an astonishing phenomenon " . In 2006 , British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one " every adult should read before they die " . It was adapted into an Oscar @-@ winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan , with a screenplay by Horton Foote . Since 1990 , a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee 's hometown of Monroeville , Alabama . 
 To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee 's only published book until Go Set a Watchman , an earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird , was published on July 14 , 2015 . Lee continued to respond to her work 's impact until her death in February 2016 , although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964 . 
 = = Biographical background and publication = = 
 Born in 1926 , Harper Lee grew up in the Southern town of Monroeville , Alabama , where she became close friends with soon @-@ to @-@ be famous writer Truman Capote . She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery ( 1944 – 45 ) , and then studied law at the University of Alabama ( 1945 – 49 ) . While attending college , she wrote for campus literary magazines : Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine <unk> Jammer at the University of Alabama . At both colleges , she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice , a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time . In 1950 , Lee moved to New York City , where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation ; there , she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville . Hoping to be published , Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote . An editor at J. B. Lippincott , who bought the manuscript , advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing . Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year . 
 After finishing the first draft and returning it to Lippincott , the manuscript , at that point titled " Go Set a Watchman " , fell into the hands of Therese von Hohoff Torrey — known professionally as Tay Hohoff — a small , wiry veteran editor in her late 50s . Hohoff was impressed . “ [ T ] he spark of the true writer flashed in every line , ” she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott . But as Hohoff saw it , the manuscript was by no means fit for publication . It was , as she described it , “ more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel . ” During the next couple of years , she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill a Mockingbird . 
 Lee had lost her mother , who suffered from mental illness , six years before she met Hohoff at Lippincott ’ s offices . Her father , a lawyer on whom Atticus was modeled , would die two years after the publication of To Kill a Mockingbird . 
 Ultimately , Lee spent over two and a half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird . The book was published on July 11 , 1960 . After rejecting the " Watchman " title , it was initially re @-@ titled Atticus , but Lee renamed it " To Kill a Mockingbird " to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait . The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies . In 1964 , Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said , " I never expected any sort of success with ' Mockingbird . ' ... I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but , at the same time , I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement . Public encouragement . I hoped for a little , as I said , but I got rather a whole lot , and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick , merciful death I 'd expected . " Instead of a " quick and merciful death " , Reader 's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part , which gave it a wide readership immediately . Since the original publication , the book has never been out of print . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The story takes place during three years ( 1933 – 35 ) of the Great Depression in the fictional " tired old town " of Maycomb , Alabama , the seat of Maycomb County . It focuses on six @-@ year @-@ old Jean Louise Finch ( Scout ) , who lives with her older brother , Jem , and their widowed father , Atticus , a middle @-@ aged lawyer . Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill , who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer . The three children are terrified of , and fascinated by , their neighbor , the reclusive Arthur " Boo " Radley . The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo , and few of them have seen him for many years . The children feed one another 's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden , and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house . After two summers of friendship with Dill , Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place . Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children , but , to their disappointment , he never appears in person . 
 Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson , a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman , Mayella Ewell . Although many of Maycomb 's citizens disapprove , Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability . Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus 's actions , calling him a " nigger @-@ lover " . Scout is tempted to stand up for her father 's honor by fighting , even though he has told her not to . Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom . This danger is averted when Scout , Jem , and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus ' and Tom 's points of view . 
 Atticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson 's trial . No seat is available on the main floor , so by invitation of Rev. Sykes , Jem , Scout , and Dill watch from the colored balcony . Atticus establishes that the accusers — Mayella and her father , Bob Ewell , the town drunk — are lying . It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom , and that her father caught her and beat her . Despite significant evidence of Tom 's innocence , the jury convicts him . Jem 's faith in justice becomes badly shaken , as is Atticus ' , when the hapless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison . 
 Despite Tom 's conviction , Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial , Atticus explaining that he " destroyed [ Ewell 's ] last shred of credibility at that trial . " Ewell vows revenge , spitting in Atticus ' face , trying to break into the judge 's house , and menacing Tom Robinson 's widow . Finally , he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout while they walk home on a dark night after the school Halloween pageant . One of Jem 's arms is broken in the struggle , but amid the confusion someone comes to the children 's rescue . The mysterious man carries Jem home , where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley . 
 Sheriff Tate arrives and discovers that Bob Ewell has died during the fight . The sheriff argues with Atticus about the prudence and ethics of charging Jem ( whom Atticus believes to be responsible ) or Boo ( whom Tate believes to be responsible ) . Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff 's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife . Boo asks Scout to walk him home , and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again . While standing on the Radley porch , Scout imagines life from Boo 's perspective , and regrets that they had never repaid him for the gifts he had given them . 
 = = Autobiographical elements = = 
 Lee has said that To Kill a Mockingbird is not an autobiography , but rather an example of how an author " should write about what he knows and write truthfully " . Nevertheless , several people and events from Lee 's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout . Lee 's father , Amasa Coleman Lee , was an attorney , similar to Atticus Finch , and in 1919 , he defended two black men accused of murder . After they were convicted , hanged and mutilated , he never tried another criminal case . Lee 's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper . Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus , he gradually became more liberal in his later years . Though Scout 's mother died when she was a baby , Lee was 25 when her mother , Frances Cunningham Finch , died . Lee 's mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent . Lee had a brother named Edwin , who — like the fictional Jem — was four years older than his sister . As in the novel , a black housekeeper came daily to care for the Lee house and family . 
 Lee modeled the character of Dill on her childhood friend , Truman Capote , known then as Truman Persons . Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer , Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City . Like Dill , Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories . Both Lee and Capote were atypical children : both loved to read . Lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight , but Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp . She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old Underwood typewriter Lee 's father gave them . They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers ; Capote called the two of them " apart people " . In 1960 , Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote 's nonfiction novel In Cold Blood . 
 Down the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up ; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys . The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24 years out of shame . He was hidden until virtually forgotten ; he died in 1952 . 
 The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear , although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models . When Lee was 10 years old , a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her . The story and the trial were covered by her father 's newspaper which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death . After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused , his sentence was commuted to life in prison . He died there of tuberculosis in 1937 . Scholars believe that Robinson 's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the Scottsboro Boys , in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence . However , in 2005 , Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational , although the Scottsboro case served " the same purpose " to display Southern prejudices . Emmett Till , a black teenager who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955 , and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement , is also considered a model for Tom Robinson . 
 = = Style = = 
 The strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee 's talent for narration , which in an early review in Time was called " tactile brilliance " . Writing a decade later , another scholar noted , " Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story @-@ telling . Her art is visual , and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition . " Lee combines the narrator 's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman 's reflecting on her childhood , using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives . This narrative method allows Lee to tell a " delightfully deceptive " story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition . However , at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout 's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding . Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson 's life . 
 Writing about Lee 's style and use of humor in a tragic story , scholar Jacqueline Tavernier @-@ Courbin states : " Laughter ... [ exposes ] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it ; one can hardly ... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at . " Scout 's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspire National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her " hysterically funny " . To address complex issues , however , Tavernier @-@ Courbin notes that Lee uses parody , satire , and irony effectively by using a child 's perspective . After Dill promises to marry her , then spends too much time with Jem , Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up , which she does several times . Scout 's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education ; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write , and forbids Atticus from teaching her further . Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony , however , as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society . Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier @-@ Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book 's title : Lee is doing the mocking — of education , the justice system , and her own society by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval . 
 Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot . When Atticus is out of town , Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach . This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church , which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life , as well as Tom Robinson 's . Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage , causing the audience to laugh uproariously . She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume , which saves her life .

 Scholars have characterized To Kill a Mockingbird as both a Southern Gothic and coming @-@ of @-@ age or Bildungsroman novel . The grotesque and near @-@ supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house , and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel . Lee used the term " Gothic " to describe the architecture of Maycomb 's courthouse and in regard to Dill 's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley . Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem 's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Despite challenging the town 's systems , Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others , because he believes that following one 's conscience is the highest priority , even when the result is social ostracism . However , scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification , noting that Boo Radley is in fact human , protective , and benevolent . Furthermore , in addressing themes such as alcoholism , incest , rape , and racial violence , Lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically . She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society . 
 As children coming of age , Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them . Lee seems to examine Jem 's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout 's . Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial , " It 's like bein ' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon ... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world , least that 's what they seemed like " . This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class . Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces , it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood . As one scholar writes , " To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman , for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be . "

 Despite the novel 's immense popularity upon publication , it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics . Don Noble , editor of a book of essays about the novel , estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one . Christopher Metress writes that the book is " an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined " . Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best @-@ seller ( " If that many people like it , it can 't be any good . " ) and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation . 
 Harper Lee has remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid @-@ 1960s . However , she gave some insight into her themes when , in a rare letter to the editor , she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused : " Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that To Kill a Mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct , Christian in its ethic , that is the heritage of all Southerners . "

 When the book was released , reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts , and opinion was mixed about Lee 's ability to connect them . The first part of the novel concerns the children 's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood . Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem 's observations of their quirky neighbors . One writer was so impressed by Lee 's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism . This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee 's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character 's behavior in the novel . Scout 's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb 's inhabitants ' faults and advantages to genealogy ( families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks ) , and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb . This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell 's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson , and Scout 's definition of " fine folks " being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have . The South itself , with its traditions and taboos , seems to drive the plot more than the characters . 
 The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed " the spirit @-@ corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro " . In the years following its release , many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations . Claudia Durst Johnson considers it " reasonable to believe " that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama : Rosa Parks ' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person , which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott , and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after <unk> Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted ( Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled , but reinstated in 1980 ) . In writing about the historical context of the novel 's construction , two other literary scholars remark : " To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict @-@ ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction . Inevitably , despite its mid @-@ 1930s setting , the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts , tensions , and fears induced by this transition . " 
 Scholar Patrick Chura , who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson , enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced . Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the " mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood " . Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused . Tom Robinson 's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence , as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury 's decision . Furthermore , the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired , which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of , but also crippled him in other ways . Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as " stupid , pathetic , defenseless , and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites , rather than his own intelligence to save him " . Although Tom is spared from being lynched , he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison , shot seventeen times . 
 The theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well . For example , Atticus must shoot a rabid dog , even though it is not his job to do so . Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb , and Atticus , who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog , must fight against the town 's racism without help from other white citizens . He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom 's trial . Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes . Jones writes , " [ t ] he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson .... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury , he literally bares himself to the jury 's and the town 's anger . " 
 = = = Class = = = 
 In a 1964 interview , Lee remarked that her aspiration was " to be ... the Jane Austen of South Alabama . " Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing . When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate , Walter Cunningham , at the Finch home one day , Calpurnia , their black cook , chastises and punishes her for doing so . Atticus respects Calpurnia 's judgment , and later in the book even stands up to his sister , the formidable Aunt Alexandra , when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia . One writer notes that Scout , " in Austenian fashion " , satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify . Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors : " affirmation of order in society , obedience , courtesy , and respect for the individual without regard for status " . 
 Scholars argue that Lee 's approach to class and race was more complex " than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to ' poor white trash ' ... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice , silence the voices that might challenge the existing order , and greatly complicate many Americans ' conception of the causes of racism and segregation . " Lee 's use of the middle @-@ class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader , regardless of class or cultural background , and fosters a sense of nostalgia . Sharing Scout and Jem 's perspective , the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose ; the lower @-@ class <unk> , and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways ; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond ; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community . The children internalize Atticus ' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person 's skin , gaining a greater understanding of people 's motives and behavior . 
 = = = Courage and compassion = = = 
 The novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of courage . Scout 's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him . Atticus is the moral center of the novel , however , and he teaches Jem one of the most significant lessons of courage . In a statement that foreshadows Atticus ' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose , who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction , Atticus tells Jem that courage is " when you 're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what " . 
 Charles Shields , who has written the only book @-@ length biography of Harper Lee to date , offers the reason for the novel 's enduring popularity and impact is that " its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal " . Atticus ' lesson to Scout that " you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view — until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it " exemplifies his compassion . She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell 's testimony . When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus ' question if she has any friends , Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley . Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives , Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo 's perspective . One writer remarks , " ... [ w ] hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice , heartache and loss , it also carries with it a strong sense [ of ] courage , compassion , and an awareness of history to be better human beings . " 
 = = = Gender roles = = = 
 Just as Lee explores Jem 's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society , Scout realizes what being female means , and several female characters influence her development . Scout 's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider . Scout 's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie , both of whom are strong willed , independent , and protective . Mayella Ewell also has an influence ; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him . The female characters who comment the most on Scout 's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and <unk> points of view . For example , Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole , and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so , in addition to insulting Atticus ' intentions to defend Tom Robinson . By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie , one scholar writes , " Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South , for with the use of first @-@ person narration , she indicates that Scout / Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child . " 
 Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel . Scout and Jem 's mother died before Scout could remember her , Mayella 's mother is dead , and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo 's confinement to the house . Apart from Atticus , the fathers described are abusers . Bob Ewell , it is hinted , molested his daughter , and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom . Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not , and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray . Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity ; as one scholar explains : " It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism , bravery , and an <unk> knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality , to set the society straight . " 
 = = = Laws , written and unwritten = = = 
 Allusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird , particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom , has drawn the attention from legal scholars . Claudia Durst Johnson writes that " a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals " . The opening quote by the 19th @-@ century essayist Charles Lamb reads : " Lawyers , I suppose , were children once . " Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem 's childhood world , compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one 's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children : is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season ? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms : Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common @-@ law wife and having interracial children ; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson ; by being turned into a non @-@ person , Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him . Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them . For example , she refuses to wear frilly clothes , saying that Aunt Alexandra 's " fanatical " attempts to place her in them made her feel " a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [ her ] " . Johnson states , " [ t ] he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of ( their ) small worlds . " 
 = = = Loss of innocence = = = 
 Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel . The family 's last name of Finch also shares Lee 's mother 's maiden name . The titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme , which first appears when Atticus , having given his children air @-@ rifles for Christmas , allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot . Atticus warns them that , although they can " shoot all the <unk> they want " , they must remember that " it 's a sin to kill a mockingbird " . Confused , Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie , who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures . She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs , saying , " They don 't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us . " Writer Edwin <unk> summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964 , " ' To kill a mockingbird ' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless — like Tom Robinson . " Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point . 
 Tom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel . However , scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley : " Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun ( as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history ) , Scout comes to see him as a ' mockingbird ' — that is , as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished . " The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her , and in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson states about a character who was misunderstood , " when they finally saw him , why he hadn 't done any of those things ... Atticus , he was real nice , " to which he responds , " Most people are , Scout , when you finally see them . " 
 The novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face , or even suffer defeat , the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy . In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat , Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools . She guides the reader in such judgments , alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony . Scout 's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her , gossip , and " reflect a smug , colonialist attitude toward other races " while giving the " appearance of gentility , piety , and morality " . Conversely , when Atticus loses Tom 's case , he is last to leave the courtroom , except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony , who rise silently as he walks underneath them , to honor his efforts . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Despite her editors ' warnings that the book might not sell well , it quickly became a sensation , bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles , in her hometown of Monroeville , and throughout Alabama . The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the Book of the Month Club and editions released by Reader 's Digest Condensed Books . 
 Initial reactions to the novel were varied . The New Yorker declared Lee " a skilled , unpretentious , and totally ingenuous writer " , and The Atlantic Monthly 's reviewer rated the book " pleasant , undemanding reading " , but found the narrative voice — " a six @-@ year @-@ old girl with the prose style of a well @-@ educated adult " — to be implausible . Time magazine 's 1960 review of the book states that it " teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life " and calls Scout Finch " the most appealing child since Carson McCullers ' Frankie got left behind at the wedding " . The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even @-@ handed approach to the narration of the novel 's events , writing : " This is in no way a sociological novel . It underlines no cause ... To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance . " 
 Not all reviewers were enthusiastic . Some lamented the use of poor white Southerners , and one @-@ dimensional black victims , and Granville Hicks labeled the book " melodramatic and contrived " . When the book was first released , Southern writer Flannery O 'Connor commented , " I think for a child 's book it does all right . It 's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don 't know they 're reading a child 's book . Somebody ought to say what it is . " Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review , writing to a cousin : " Well , honey , one thing we know is that she 's been poaching on my literary preserves . " 
 One year after its publication To Kill a Mockingbird had been translated into ten languages . In the years since , it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages . The novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback , and has become part of the standard literature curriculum . A 2008 survey of secondary books read by students between grades 9 – 12 in the U.S. indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades . A 1991 survey by the Book of the Month Club and the Library of Congress Center for the Book found that To Kill a Mockingbird was rated behind only the Bible in books that are " most often cited as making a difference " . It is considered by some to be the Great American Novel . 
 The 50th anniversary of the novel 's release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact . Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune praises Lee 's " rich use of language " but writes that the central lesson is that " courage isn 't always flashy , isn 't always enough , but is always in style " . Jane Sullivan in the Sydney Morning Herald agrees , stating that the book " still rouses fresh and horrified indignation " as it examines morality , a topic that has recently become unfashionable . Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian states that Lee , rare among American novelists , writes with " a fiercely progressive ink , in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question " , comparing her to William Faulkner , who wrote about racism as an inevitability . Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland 's The Herald notes the connections between Lee and Jane Austen , stating the book 's central theme , that " one ’ s moral convictions are worth fighting for , even at the risk of being reviled " is eloquently discussed . 
 Native <unk> Allen Barra sharply criticized Lee and the novel in The Wall Street Journal calling Atticus a " repository of cracker @-@ barrel epigrams " and the novel represents a " sugar @-@ coated myth " of Alabama history . Barra writes , " It 's time to stop pretending that To Kill a Mockingbird is some kind of timeless classic that ranks with the great works of American literature . Its bloodless liberal humanism is sadly dated " . Thomas Mallon in The New Yorker criticizes Atticus ' stiff and self @-@ righteous demeanor , and calls Scout " a kind of highly constructed doll " whose speech and actions are improbable . Although acknowledging that the novel works , Mallon blasts Lee 's " wildly unstable " narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama , following with his observation that " the book has begun to cherish its own goodness " by the time the case is over . Defending the book , Akin Ajayi writes that justice " is often complicated , but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all . " Ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race , class , and society , but that it was not written to resolve them . 
 Many writers compare their perceptions of To Kill a Mockingbird as adults with when they first read it as children . Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including Oprah Winfrey , Rosanne Cash , Tom Brokaw , and Harper 's sister Alice Lee , who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled Scout , Atticus , and Boo . 
 = = = Atticus Finch and the legal profession = = = 
 One of the most significant impacts To Kill a Mockingbird has had is Atticus Finch 's model of integrity for the legal profession . As scholar Alice Petry explains , " Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person . " Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer , and Richard Matsch , the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial , counts Atticus as a major judicial influence . One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was To Kill a Mockingbird , and an article in the Michigan Law Review claims , " No real @-@ life lawyer has done more for the self @-@ image or public perception of the legal profession , " before questioning whether " Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun " . 
 In 1992 , an Alabama editorial called for the death of Atticus , saying that as liberal as Atticus was , he still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered . The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero . Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb . However , in 1997 , the Alabama State Bar erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville , marking his existence as the " first commemorative milestone in the state 's judicial history " . In 2008 , Lee herself received an honorary special membership to the Alabama State Bar for creating Atticus who " has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor " . 
 = = = Social commentary and challenges = = = 
 To Kill a Mockingbird has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963 . The book 's racial slurs , profanity , and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States . The American Library Association reported that To Kill a Mockingbird was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000 – 2009 . 
 One of the first incidents of the book being challenged was in Hanover , Virginia , in 1966 : a parent protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral . Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers , which ranged from amusement to fury ; those letters expressing the most outrage , however , complained about Mayella Ewell 's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape . Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book 's appropriateness for the classroom , Harper Lee sent $ 10 to The Richmond News Leader suggesting it to be used toward the enrollment of " the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice " . The National Education Association in 1968 placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizations — after Little Black Sambo . 
 With a shift of attitudes about race in the 1970s , To Kill a Mockingbird faced challenges of a different sort : the treatment of racism in Maycomb was not condemned harshly enough . This has led to disparate perceptions that the novel has a generally positive impact on race relations for white readers , but a more ambiguous reception by black readers . In one high @-@ profile case outside the U.S. , school districts in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia attempted to have the book removed from standard teaching curricula in the 1990s , stating : 
 The terminology in this novel subjects students to humiliating experiences that rob them of their self @-@ respect and the respect of their peers . The word ' Nigger ' is used 48 times [ in ] the novel ... We believe that the English Language Arts curriculum in Nova Scotia must enable all students to feel comfortable with ideas , feelings and experiences presented without fear of humiliation ... To Kill a Mockingbird is clearly a book that no longer meets these goals and therefore must no longer be used for classroom instruction . 
 Furthermore , despite the novel 's thematic focus on racial injustice , its black characters are not fully examined . In its use of racial epithets , stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks , and Calpurnia , who to some critics is an updated version of the " contented slave " motif and to others simply unexplored , the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters . One writer asserts that the use of Scout 's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict . Scout 's voice " functions as the not @-@ me which allows the rest of us — black and white , male and female — to find our relative position in society " . A teaching guide for the novel published by The English Journal cautions , " what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another " . A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students , but that black students found it " demoralizing " . Another criticism , articulated by Michael Lind , is that the novel indulges in <unk> stereotyping and demonization of poor rural " white trash " . 
 The novel is cited as a factor in the success of the civil rights movement in the 1960s , however , in that it " arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions ( of ) the accelerating civil rights movement " . Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement , despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them . Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book 's effectiveness is that it " inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion " and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set . Young views the novel as " an act of humanity " in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices . Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom 's Cabin , a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War . Childress states the novel " gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they 've been brought up with and to find another way . And most white people in the South were good people . Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc ... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do , because it was popular art , because it was told from a child 's point of view . " 
 Diane McWhorter , Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning historian of the Birmingham civil rights campaign , asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists , and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality . This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised , which for many children is what the novel does . McWhorter writes of Lee , " for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual — by its very existence an act of protest . " Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave : " I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism ... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed , but in many ways I feel ... the moral bar 's been lowered . And that 's really distressing . We need a thousand Atticus Finches . " McBride , however , defends the book 's sentimentality , and the way Lee approaches the story with " honesty and integrity " . 
 = = = Rumors of authorship by Truman Capote = = = 
 Lee 's childhood friend , author Truman Capote , wrote on the dust jacket of the first edition , " Someone rare has written this very fine first novel : a writer with the liveliest sense of life , and the warmest , most authentic sense of humor . A touching book ; and so funny , so likeable . " While Capote may have helped Lee to edit the book , the National Endowment for the Arts considers rumors that he contributed heavily " baseless " . In 2003 , a Tuscaloosa newspaper quoted Capote 's biological father , <unk> Persons , as claiming that Capote had written " almost all " of the book . In 2006 , a Capote letter was donated to Monroeville 's literary heritage museum ; in a letter to a neighbor in Monroeville in 1959 , Capote mentioned that Lee was writing a book that was to be published soon . Extensive notes between Lee and her editor at Lippincott also refute the rumor of Capote 's authorship . Lee 's older sister , Alice , responded to the rumor , saying : " That 's the biggest lie ever told . " 
 = = = Honors = = = 
 During the years immediately following the novel 's publication , Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her , granting interviews , visiting schools , and attending events honoring the book . In 1961 , when To Kill a Mockingbird was in its 41st week on the bestseller list , it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize , stunning Lee . It also won the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in the same year , and the Paperback of the Year award from Bestsellers magazine in 1962 . Starting in 1964 , Lee began to turn down interviews , complaining that the questions were monotonous , and grew concerned that attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought . Since then , she declined talking with reporters about the book . She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction , writing in 1995 : " Introductions inhibit pleasure , they kill the joy of anticipation , they frustrate curiosity . The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come . Mockingbird still says what it has to say ; it has managed to survive the years without preamble . " 
 In 2001 , Lee was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor . In the same year , Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley initiated a reading program throughout the city 's libraries , and chose his favorite book , To Kill a Mockingbird , as the first title of the One City , One Book program . Lee declared that " there is no greater honor the novel could receive " . By 2004 , the novel had been chosen by 25 communities for variations of the citywide reading program , more than any other novel . David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts , who supervised The Big Read , states " people just seem to connect with it . It dredges up things in their own lives , their interactions across racial lines , legal encounters , and childhood . It 's just this skeleton key to so many different parts of people 's lives , and they cherish it . " 
 In 2006 , Lee was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Notre Dame . During the ceremony , the students and audience gave Lee a standing ovation , and the entire graduating class held up copies of To Kill a Mockingbird to honor her . Lee was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 5 , 2007 by President George W. Bush . In his remarks , Bush stated , " One reason To Kill a Mockingbird succeeded is the wise and kind heart of the author , which comes through on every page ... To Kill a Mockingbird has influenced the character of our country for the better . It 's been a gift to the entire world . As a model of good writing and humane sensibility , this book will be read and studied forever . "

 The book was made into the well @-@ received 1962 film with the same title , starring Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch . The film 's producer , Alan J. Pakula , remembered Universal Pictures executives questioning him about a potential script : " They said , ' What story do you plan to tell for the film ? ' I said , ' Have you read the book ? ' They said , ' Yes . ' I said , ' That 's the story . ' " The movie was a hit at the box office , quickly grossing more than $ 20 million from a $ 2 @-@ million budget . It won three Oscars : Best Actor for Gregory Peck , Best Art Direction @-@ Set Decoration , Black @-@ and @-@ White , and Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Horton Foote . It was nominated for five more Oscars including Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Mary Badham , the actress who played Scout . 
 Harper Lee was pleased with the movie , saying : " In that film the man and the part met ... I 've had many , many offers to turn it into musicals , into TV or stage plays , but I 've always refused . That film was a work of art . " Peck met Lee 's father , the model for Atticus , before the filming . Lee 's father died before the film 's release , and Lee was so impressed with Peck 's performance that she gave him her father 's pocketwatch , which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for best actor . Years later , he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in London Heathrow Airport . When Peck eventually did tell Lee , he said she responded , " ' Well , it 's only a watch . ' Harper — she feels deeply , but she 's not a sentimental person about things . " Lee and Peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made . Peck 's grandson was named " Harper " in her honor . 
 In May 2005 , Lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at the Los Angeles Public Library at the request of Peck 's widow Veronique , who said of Lee : " She 's like a national treasure . She 's someone who has made a difference ... with this book . The book is still as strong as it ever was , and so is the film . All the kids in the United States read this book and see the film in the seventh and eighth grades and write papers and essays .

 The book has also been adapted as a play by Christopher Sergel . It debuted in 1990 in Monroeville , a town that labels itself " The Literary Capital of Alabama " . The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast . White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury . During the courtroom scene the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated . Author Albert Murray said of the relationship of the town to the novel ( and the annual performance ) : " It becomes part of the town ritual , like the religious underpinning of Mardi Gras . With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse , it 's part of a central , civic education — what Monroeville aspires to be . " 
 Sergel 's play toured in the UK starting at West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds in 2006 , and again in 2011 starting at the York Theatre Royal , both productions featuring Duncan Preston as Atticus Finch . The play also opened the 2013 season at Regent 's Park Open Air Theatre in London where it played to full houses and starred Robert Sean Leonard as Atticus Finch , his first London appearance in 22 years . The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season , prior to a UK tour . 
 According to a National Geographic article , the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture ; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances , because " she abhors anything that trades on the book 's fame " . To underscore this sentiment , Lee demanded that a book of recipes named Calpurnia 's Cookbook not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum . David Lister in The Independent states that Lee 's refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more , and her silence " makes Bob Dylan look like a media tart " . Despite her discouragement , a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination , hoping to see Lee 's inspiration for the book , or Lee herself . Local residents call them " Mockingbird groupies " , and although Lee was not reclusive , she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic " Hell , no ! " 
 = = Go Set a Watchman = = 
 An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird , titled Go Set a Watchman , was controversially released on July 14 , 2015 . This draft , which was completed in 1957 , is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative . This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father , Atticus Finch , in Maycomb , Alabama , where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community . The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee 's lawyer <unk> Carter discovered it ; however , this claim has been widely disputed . Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird . According to Lee 's agent Andrew Nurnberg , Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy : " They discussed publishing Mockingbird first , Watchman last , and a shorter connecting novel between the two . " This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe , who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee 's attorney and found them to be only another draft of " To Kill a Mockingbird " . The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler 's description of how " Watchman " was seen as just the first draft of " Mockingbird " . Instances where many passages overlap between the two books , in some case word for word , also refutes this assertion . 
 = Interstate 355 = 
 Interstate 355 ( I @-@ 355 ) , also known as the Veterans Memorial Tollway , is an Interstate Highway and tollway in the western and southwest suburbs of Chicago in the U.S. state of Illinois . Like most other toll roads in the northeastern portion of the state , I @-@ 355 is maintained by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority ( <unk> ) . I @-@ 355 runs from I @-@ 80 in New Lenox north to I @-@ 290 in Itasca , a distance of 32 @.@ 5 miles ( 52 @.@ 3 km ) . With the exception of a four @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) expansion in 2009 , from U.S. Route 34 ( US 34 , Ogden Avenue ) to 75th Street , the highway is six lanes wide for its entire length . 
 The tollway authority opened I @-@ 355 as the North – South Tollway in 1989 to ease congestion on Illinois Route 53 ( IL 53 ) , a parallel two @-@ lane state highway in central DuPage County . Initially , I @-@ 355 ran from I @-@ 55 north to I @-@ 290 . The new highway helped cut travel times for commuters traveling north and south in the county . According to commercial real estate developers at the time , the new tollway also opened the western suburbs of Chicago to commercial and industrial development . 
 On November 11 , 2007 , the tollway authority opened a southern extension of I @-@ 355 from I @-@ 55 to I @-@ 80 , a distance of 12 @.@ 5 miles ( 20 @.@ 1 km ) ; on its opening , the tollway authority changed the name of the tollway to " Veterans Memorial Tollway " . The tollway authority laid the route of the new extension through Will County and a small portion of Cook County , one of the fastest @-@ growing regions in Illinois . The tollway authority expected the extension to cut travel times in the region by 20 percent . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 From the late 1920s through 1963 , the two @-@ lane @-@ wide <unk> Road ( also known as SBI Route 53 , and later IL 53 ) serviced the north – south transportation corridor that includes eastern portions of DuPage County . From 1963 to 1970 , the Illinois Department of Transportation ( IDOT ) planned and built a new expressway north from Army Trail Road through Schaumburg to the Northwest Tollway ( now the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway ) . After its completion , IDOT rerouted IL 53 onto this new expressway from <unk> Road . 
 The original alignment of I @-@ 355 was defined in the Chicago Area Transportation Study ( abbreviated CATS ) Transportation Plan of April 1962 . The plan called for a supplemental system of limited @-@ access expressways to be built in the Chicago metropolitan area by 1980 , and defined corridors where the expressways were to be located . Most of these corridors , including the Des Plaines River expressway , the Crosstown Expressway running north – south along the west side of Chicago , and most of a proposed northern extension of IL 53 were scrapped because of intense local opposition . 
 Initially , state and county officials anticipated building a freeway for the expressway south of Army Trail Road , similar to the existing freeway north of Army Trail Road . In 1979 , Chicago mayor Jane Byrne canceled plans for the proposed Crosstown Expressway . Following the move , Congress gave the rights to half of the $ 200 million ( equivalent to $ 954 million in 2015 ) that had been earmarked for the Crosstown Expressway to DuPage County . However , county officials found this amount insufficient for construction of the new freeway . The officials then handed authority for the project over to the tollway authority , and spent the money on other projects in the county . 
 In June 1984 , Republican minority leader of the Illinois House of Representatives James " Pate " Philip helped push through legislation authorizing the construction of the tollway , then referred to as simply the DuPage Tollway . Officials at the Morton Arboretum , one of the nation 's premier woodland research centers , promptly filed a federal lawsuit to block construction of the tollway . They also promised to prevent the tollway authority from obtaining environmental approval from federal officials . 
 In April 1985 , the two agencies came to an agreement regarding construction of the new tollway . To protect the arboretum from salt spray and other pollutants caused by cars on the tollway , the tollway authority agreed to build I @-@ 355 below grade around the perimeter of the arboretum . The tollway authority would build a water collection system to divert runoff from the arboretum . In addition , they would build earthen berms along the new road , preventing salt spray from damaging arboretum plants . In exchange , the DuPage County Forest Preserve District agreed to a 99 @-@ year lease providing 189 acres ( 0 @.@ 76 km2 ) of its land to the arboretum for the development of an " urban vegetation laboratory " . Under the agreement , Morton Arboretum agreed to charge DuPage County residents lower admissions one day of the week , build a bicycle path connecting the arboretum to nearby forest preserves , and begin a joint clean @-@ streams program to improve the water quality of DuPage County 's lakes and streams . In January 1986 , the tollway paid out $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 7 @.@ 31 million in 2015 ) to a trust fund as a part of the settlement to help finance the arboretum 's new programs . 
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a preliminary environmental impact statement on March 13 , 1986 . At a public hearing a month later , arboretum executives and Woodridge officials strongly criticized the report as " fatally flawed " and a repeat of tollway @-@ provided research , including typographical errors . The opposition also cited outdated and inaccurate data regarding wetlands replacement , salt dispersion , and the lack of compensation to residents for lowered property values . The tollway authority agreed to run the road below @-@ grade at 75th Street instead of as a 28 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) elevated highway . In addition , they agreed to spend an extra $ 1 million ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 92 million in 2015 ) on the redesigned elevation and interchange . 
 The Corps of Engineers issued a permit for the tollway on October 8 , 1986 , rejecting last @-@ minute concerns from the Sierra Club to reroute the toll road around sections of Churchill Woods Prairie , between Glen Ellyn and Lombard . The permit allowed the first two earth moving contracts issued by the tollway authority to move forward . The tollway authority put the total cost of 17 @.@ 7 miles ( 28 @.@ 5 km ) of new pavement at $ 450 million ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 25 billion in 2015 ) . Of the total cost , $ 325 million ( equivalent to $ 904 million in 2015 ) was allocated for construction , $ 30 million ( equivalent to $ 83 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) to alleviating environmental concerns , including moving and enlarging 117 acres ( 0 @.@ 47 km2 ) of wetlands , and $ 30 million ( equivalent to $ 83 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) for utility relocation . Work in 1987 consisted primarily of excavation , embankment building and land acquisition . 
 Because of problems with pavement on other roads in the system and anticipation of heavy traffic on the new Interstate , the tollway authority decided to pave I @-@ 355 with pavement expected to last 20 years . Construction workers laid concrete on the tollway to a thickness of 12 inches ( 30 cm ) over an 8 @-@ inch ( 20 cm ) sub @-@ base . The new pavement also incorporated fly ash and less cement , allowing the pavement to achieve maximum strength faster than pure concrete . 
 One of the last issues settled prior to the opening of the tollway was the highway 's number . Originally , tollway officials designated the new road I @-@ 355 . Early in 1988 , however , the tollway administration received a letter from the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) indicating that the highway should be named Interstate 455 . FHWA policy at the time dictated that auxiliary Interstate routes that join two other Interstate Highways should start with an even number . IDOT argued the highway more closely resembles a spur from I @-@ 55 . Ultimately , the tollway authority kept the I @-@ 355 designation . 
 Governor James R. Thompson and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner dedicated the North – South Tollway on December 22 , 1989 . When it opened , officials estimated travel times from Schaumburg to Oak Brook would be reduced from 55 minutes to 34 minutes , and from Wheaton to Darien from 60 to 34 minutes . Tollway officials also estimated that 200 @,@ 000 cars per day would use I @-@ 355 . This figure has since been shown to be slightly optimistic , with maximum average daily traffic values approaching 170 @,@ 200 only at the northern end of the Interstate . The initial length of I @-@ 355 was 20 @.@ 01 miles ( 32 @.@ 20 km ) from I @-@ 55 north to I @-@ 290 . 
 = = = Opening = = = 
 I @-@ 355 opened at the stroke of midnight on December 24 , 1989 . As a Christmas gift , the first two days of operation were free . Because of lower traffic counts at the north and south ends of the highway and lack of construction money , tollway officials built the road with four lanes from North Avenue ( IL 64 ) to the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway ( I @-@ 88 ) on the north end , and around I @-@ 55 on the south end . As early as 1991 , tollway officials had drawn up plans to widen the highway to three lanes in each direction . Widening from North Avenue to Butterfield Road ( IL 56 ) took place in 1995 . The old lines marking the former shoulder can still be seen in the right lane as a result of the tollway authority 's attempt to grind them away . 
 After the new road opened , congestion decreased considerably on nearby north – south arteries . The DuPage County Division of Transportation calculated that congestion had decreased on Illinois 53 by 20 % , and the volume of cars on nearby north – south roads Illinois 53 , Illinois 59 and IL 83 had decreased . On IL 53 between Ogden Avenue and Roosevelt Road , traffic counts sank from 21 @,@ 400 to 11 @,@ 800 vehicles per day . In addition , traffic on the exit ramp from the Tri @-@ State Tollway ( I @-@ 294 ) to I @-@ 55 dropped 10 percent in 12 months . Drivers also reported decreases in travel time from one end of the county to the other of up to 40 minutes . However , the opening of the tollway also greatly increased congestion on I @-@ 290 near the northern terminus . A construction project in the summer months of 1990 widened I @-@ 290 just north of the tollway , at a cost of $ 2 – 2 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 46 @.@ 7 million – 58 @.@ 3 million in 2015 ) . 
 In spite of the apparent success of the tollway opening , traffic counts and projected toll revenues were initially lower than projected , with an estimated 65 @,@ 000 motorists per day traveling along the tollway , generating $ 55 @,@ 000 – 65 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 128 @,@ 000 – 152 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) ) in daily toll revenues . In addition , a spate of lawsuits were filed regarding the payment of contractors and subcontractors . Numerous liens filed by subcontractors against the tollway were settled in June at a cost of $ 10 @.@ 1 million ( equivalent to $ 23 @.@ 6 million in 2015 ) . The tollway authority released an additional $ 1 million ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 19 million in 2015 ) in May 1992 to further settle claims made by the general contractor , entering arbitration soon afterwards to settle another $ 1 @.@ 6 – 27 million ( equivalent to $ 3 @.@ 51 million – 59 @.@ 2 million in 2015 ) ) the contractor claimed it was owed . By 2005 , average annual daily traffic values had risen to a range of 77 @,@ 400 to 170 @,@ 200 vehicles per day . 
 As early as 1989 , the tollway authority had discussed implementing automatic toll collection across the entire system to relieve congestion caused by traffic stopping at mainline toll barriers . The tollway authority began testing I @-@ Pass , the tollway system 's electronic payment method , on the entire stretch of I @-@ 355 in 1993 at various tollbooths ; by September 1994 , every plaza on I @-@ 355 accepted I @-@ Pass . By 1998 , the tollway authority had installed dedicated I @-@ Pass lanes ( lanes specifically set aside for electronic toll collections ) at both mainline toll barriers . In 1999 , I @-@ 355 became the first tollway to receive I @-@ Pass Express Lanes ( also known as open road tolling , or ORT ) . With the installation of the express lanes , vehicles with I @-@ Pass could be tolled at highway speeds of 55 miles per hour ( 89 km / h ) . In 2005 , the tollway authority widened the express lanes from two lanes to three lanes in each direction . This allowed the number of express lanes to match the number of travel lanes on the tollway . 
 Unlike the other tollways in the tollway system , there are no oases on the Veterans Memorial Tollway . This is primarily due to the widespread access to food and fuel throughout the western suburbs when construction began in the late 1980s . When the southern extension was opened in Will County in 2007 , that segment of road also did not have any oases . 
 = = = Southern extension = = = 
 In addition to the original alignment of I @-@ 355 , the Transportation Plan of April 1962 included the concept of a route that ran from Bolingbrook south to Joliet . After the northern portion of I @-@ 355 opened in 1989 , the Illinois General Assembly authorized the tollway authority to begin studying the southern extension of I @-@ 355 . 
 The discovery of the Hine 's Emerald Dragonfly , an endangered species , and related concerns for the environmental health of the Des Plaines River wetlands in 1995 , ignited a series of legal challenges that delayed construction of the I @-@ 355 extension for several years . The Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in 1996 to block planning of the southern extension . In January 1997 , a federal judge sided with the Sierra Club , halting construction of the southern extension while the state appealed . In 1999 , the state dropped its appeal and amended the environmental impact study ( EIS ) to meet the Sierra Club 's concerns . The state released the supplemental EIS in 2000 , and in 2002 the FHWA issued a Record of Decision , allowing construction of the tollway to proceed after six years of delays . Land acquisition and utility relocation took place in 2004 . Governor Rod Blagojevich 's $ 5 @.@ 6 billion Congestion @-@ Relief Program for the Illinois Tollway passed the General Assembly in September 2004 , with $ 729 @.@ 3 million being set aside for the extension ( equivalent to $ 7 @.@ 46 billion and $ 972 million in 2015 , respectively ) . Bidding on an excavation contract passed on November 18 , 2004 with construction beginning several days later . 
 To document and reduce the impact of construction on the dragonfly 's habitat , construction crews agreed to keep carcasses of any dragonfly kills . In addition , the tollway authority funded the construction of separate habitats for the dragonfly near the Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in Lemont and in two other preserves in Cook and Will counties . In late 2005 , construction began on the roadway of the 12 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 20 @.@ 1 km ) southern extension of I @-@ 355 from I @-@ 55 in Bolingbrook to I @-@ 80 in New Lenox . 
 Another controversy erupted in February 2006 , when the tollway authority threatened to build the tollway with no interchanges unless the suburbs through which the new extension ran contributed $ 20 million ( equivalent to $ 24 @.@ 1 million in 2015 ) for construction of the interchanges . This marked the first time that the tollway authority had required local municipalities to contribute funds for interchange construction . The towns of Homer Glen , Lemont , New Lenox , Lockport and Will County agreed in a June 2006 intergovernmental agreement to provide $ 20 million in both cash and in @-@ kind contributions for the interchanges . 
 The southern extension is expected to become an economic catalyst for municipalities located along the tollway . The Village of New Lenox estimates that it will receive an additional $ 12 million in sales taxes after its two malls are built out . In Lockport , officials have announced that new Home Depot and <unk> stores are planned for the areas near 159th Street and I @-@ 355 . Commercial developers are also building large warehouse facilities in areas near the Lockport interchanges . 
 One of " the most impressive engineering feats on the state 's 274 miles [ 441 km ] of toll roads " is the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge , a bridge over the Des Plaines River , the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , the Illinois and Michigan Canal , Bluff Road , New Avenue , numerous railroads , and a major Commonwealth Edison utility corridor . The bridge is 1 @.@ 3 miles ( 2 @.@ 1 km ) long , and constituted $ 125 million of the cost of the extension . Work on the bridge included the construction of 34 piers and elevation of existing high @-@ voltage electricity lines to accommodate the highway . To limit the number of piers in the valley , the tollway authority built the bridge with both 170 @-@ foot ( 52 m ) pre @-@ stressed bulb tee girders and 270 @-@ foot ( 82 m ) post @-@ tensioned segmental concrete girders . This was $ 12 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 9 million in 2015 ) cheaper than the concrete box girder design option , and $ 50 million ( equivalent to $ 58 @.@ 1 million in 2015 ) less than the steel plate girder design option . A design @-@ build clause in the original contract for the bridge , in addition to success in the design @-@ build contracts on the 2004 – 07 Tri @-@ State Tollway widening and reconstruction , allowed project managers to redesign and build the new bridge . 
 The tollway authority held a ribbon cutting and dedication ceremony on Veterans Day ( November 11 ) , 2007 , officially renaming the entire length of I @-@ 355 the Veterans Memorial Tollway . Ceremonies were held on the tollway near the 127th Street interchange in Lemont , at 147th Street in Homer Glen , and at US 6 in New Lenox . In addition to the dedication , the tollway authority sponsored a Charity Walk / Run / Roll and " Roll the Tollway " , a charity pre @-@ opening bicycle ride on the highway 's south extension . After noting the success of the festival , a tollway spokesman announced plans to repeat the event annually , including the closure of the entire southern extension . He later clarified the tollway 's position , indicating that while the extension would probably not be closed in its entirety in the future , a possible five @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) ride across the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge may be held . At around 10 : 00 p.m. on November 11 , a group of Illinois State Police vehicles and tollway maintenance vehicles escorted the first motorists southbound along the I @-@ 355 extension , stopping at each interchange to remove barricades . By the time the maintenance crews began to remove barricades along the northbound lanes of the extension , a group of 50 to 60 vehicles had gathered behind the crews . 
 = = = Veterans Memorial Trail = = = 
 As part of constructing the southern extension , the tollway authority donated a 15 @-@ to @-@ 20 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 5 – 6 m ) corridor to local municipalities for the construction of a multi @-@ use trail , named the Veterans Memorial Trail , that will run along most of the length of the tollway from I @-@ 80 to I @-@ 55 . Completion of the trail is expected to cost $ 10 million , with funding to be provided by local communities along the path . A new construction fund for the trail was created from registration fees collected for " Roll the Tollway " . The Active Transportation Alliance announced on January 29 , 2008 that about $ 108 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 125 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) was raised through " Roll the Tollway " . Of this amount , $ 70 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 81 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) was set aside for preliminary engineering studies on the 10 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 16 @.@ 9 km ) bicycle trail . The remaining amount was directed towards advocacy efforts for the Chicago Bicycle Federation and other local bicycle clubs . 
 The initial engineering phase of the bike trail has been completed in the form of the I @-@ 355 Area Trails Master Plan , a framework created by <unk> Lavigne Associates designed to distribute the work of creating and funding the trail among local communities . The Forest Preserve District of Will County has begun work on the Veterans Memorial Trail from International Parkway , Woodridge , to 135th Street , <unk> , and will then extend the trail to US 6 in the Village of New Lenox . This addition will link the trail to a number of businesses in New Lenox , including a shopping mall currently being constructed , Silver Cross Hospital , and medical offices . The Omnibus Appropriations Act included $ 470 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 543 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) in federal funding for construction of the first phase of the trail . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The southern terminus of I @-@ 355 is northeast of New Lenox , where the highway intersects I @-@ 80 . I @-@ 355 is routed north and slightly west through rural , hilly portions of Will County . Just after the US 6 interchange ( mile 1 @.@ 0 ) , tollway drivers pay a toll at Spring Creek Toll Plaza , the only toll plaza on the southern extension of I @-@ 355 . It continues north through the rural sections of Will County , having exits that serve the towns of Homer Glen and Lockport . At 135th Street ( approximately mile 8 @.@ 0 ) in Lemont , I @-@ 355 briefly enters Cook County . After an interchange at 127th Street ( mile 9 @.@ 0 ) , I @-@ 355 crosses over the Des Plaines River on the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge before returning to Will County . Shortly north of the bridge , I @-@ 355 intersects I @-@ 55 at Bolingbrook ( mile 12 @.@ 5 ) . Multiple flyover ramps connect all directions of both highways . 
 North of I @-@ 55 , I @-@ 355 continues to run almost due north through the established western suburbs of Chicago in DuPage County . Travelers pay another toll just north of Boughton Road , at the Boughton Road Toll Plaza ( mile 13 @.@ 5 ) . Continuing north , I @-@ 355 has another multiple flyover interchange with I @-@ 88 ( miles 19 @.@ 5 and 23 @.@ 0 ) , officially designated the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway . On the southern end of the interchange , northbound I @-@ 355 has exits to both directions of I @-@ 88 . I @-@ 355 then swings below I @-@ 88 and runs side @-@ by @-@ side with the other tollway for one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) . Southbound exits to both directions of I @-@ 88 are at the northern end of the interchange . At the Army Trail Road Toll Plaza ( mile 29 @.@ 0 ) , through traffic pays the last toll of the tollway . I @-@ 355 has no tolls north of the Army Trail Road exit ( mile 30 ) in Addison . There is one <unk> exit ( mile 31 @.@ 5 ) at US 20 ( Lake Street ) north of the tollway . I @-@ 355 terminates at the I @-@ 290 interchange near the border of the villages of Itasca and Addison . 
 As a result of a toll rate increase effective January 1 , 2012 , the northernmost two toll plazas ( Boughton Road and Army Trail Road ) charge $ 1 @.@ 90 cash and $ 0 @.@ 95 for cars with I @-@ Pass and E @-@ ZPass . The Spring Creek Toll Plaza charges $ 3 @.@ 80 for travelers paying with cash and $ 1 @.@ 90 for I @-@ Pass and E @-@ ZPass . All three toll plazas force traffic paying with cash to exit right into an area separate from the dedicated I @-@ Pass lanes . Drivers paying with cash then pay their tolls at manned plaza tollbooths . I @-@ Pass and E @-@ ZPass equipped cars and trucks are permitted to stay on the mainline and pay tolls at highway speeds in the tollway 's ORT lanes . 
 On I @-@ 355 , the only control cities that are actual cities are Joliet , St. Louis , Missouri , and from I @-@ 80 , Rockford . Other control cities on I @-@ 355 are limited to general areas of suburban Chicago . For example , control cities for I @-@ 355 while on I @-@ 55 are " West Suburbs " and " Southwest Suburbs " . The control city for areas north of I @-@ 88 are " Northwest Suburbs " . 
 Because of increasing congestion , the Veterans Memorial Tollway has been widened to eight lanes between 75th Street and US 34 .

 = Larry Itliong = 
 Larry <unk> Itliong ( 25 October 1913 – 8 February 1977 ) , also known as " Seven Fingers " , was a Filipino American labor organizer . He organized West Coast agricultural workers starting in the 1930s , and rose to national prominence in 1965 , when he , Philip Vera Cruz , Benjamin <unk> and Pete Velasco , walked off the farms of area table @-@ grape growers , demanding wages equal to the federal minimum wage , that became known as the Delano grape strike . He has been described as " one of the fathers of the West Coast labor movement . " 
 = = Biography = = 
 Itliong was a native of Pangasinan Province in the Philippines . One of six children of Artemio and Francesca Itliong , Itliong only had a sixth grade education . He immigrated to the United States in 1929 and joined his first strike in 1930 ; Itliong was only 14 when he came to the United States . Itliong was an excellent card player , and avid cigar smoker , who spoke multiple Filipino languages , Spanish , Cantonese , Japanese , and taught himself about law . Itliong married six times , had seven children , and raised his family in the Delano area and in the Little Manila community of Stockton , California 
 As a farmworker Itliong worked in Alaska , where he organized cannery and agricultural unions , Washington , and up and down California ; he also worked in Montana and South Dakota . While living in Alaska , he helped found the Alaska Cannery Workers Union ( which later became Local 7 of the United Cannery and Packing and Allied Workers Union , then Local 7 of the International <unk> 's and Warehouse Workers Union ) . He lost three fingers in an accident in an Alaskan cannery , which earned him the nickname , " Seven Fingers . " 
 Some of the labor organizers whom Itliong met in his early days had ties to the Communist Party . Filipinos in California lead the way in unionization efforts among farmworkers in the 1930s and 40s . During World War II , Itliong served on a U.S. Army transport ship as a <unk> . After the war , he settled in the city of Stockton in California 's Central Valley . In 1948 , Itliong ( along with Rudy <unk> , Chris <unk> , Philip Vera Cruz , and Ernesto <unk> ) became involved in the 1948 asparagus strike , which was the first major agriculture strike after World War II . Itliong served as the first shop steward of International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 37 , in Seattle , and was elected its vice @-@ president in 1953 . He served as secretary of the Filipino Community of Stockton from 1954 to 1956 . In 1956 , Itliong founded the Filipino Farm Labor Union in Stockton . In 1957 , he was elected president of the Filipino Voters League in Stockton . By 1965 , Itliong was leading the AFL – CIO union Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ; the majority of members of the committee were Filipinos who had in the 1930s arrived in the United States . 
 A vote was held on 3 May 1965 in which the committee voted to strike against Coachella Valley grape growers . Although the strikers weren 't able to negotiate a contract with the growers , they did succeed in winning higher wages . Following the success in Southern California , on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to strike against grape growers in Delano , California , where the grape season starts in September . This strike became the first time Mexican workers , due to the decision of Cesar Chavez , did not break a strike of Filipinos ; later , on 16 September 1965 , Chavez 's National Farm Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines . These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self @-@ reflection and awakening . 
 The Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee and National Farm Workers Association merged to form the United Farm Workers ; Itliong was skeptical of the merger , as he believed that Mexicans would become dominant over the Filipinos when the organizations merged , and that improving work conditions would come at the expense of Filipino farmworkers , but Itliong kept those feelings to himself at the time . In 1966 , the California Rural Legal Assistance was founded as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson 's War on Poverty , with Cesar Chavez , Dolores Huerta , and Itliong sitting on the founding board . Itliong served as assistant director of the United Farm Workers under Cesar Chavez , and in 1970 he was appointed the United Farm Workers ' national boycott coordinator . In 1971 , Itliong resigned from the United Farm Workers because of disagreements about the governance of the union ; another reason for resigning from the United Farm Workers , was that Itliong felt that the union was not willing to support aging Filipinos . Alex <unk> , a doctoral candidate at University of California , Santa Barbara , called the merger " devastating for the Filipinos who participated in the UFW . " . 
 After leaving the United Farm Workers , Itliong assisted retired Filipino farmworkers in Delano , and was a delegate at the 1972 Democratic National Convention . Together with Vera Cruz , Itliong worked towards building a retirement facility for UFW workers , known as <unk> Village . Although no longer in the United Farm Workers , Itliong continued to support others in the organized labor movement , such as helping others plan a strike against Safeway supermarkets in 1974 . Itliong also served as President of the Filipino American Political Association , a bipartisan lobbying organization . He died in 1977 at the age of 63 in Delano of Lou Gehrig 's disease .

 Most history books mention Chavez and the United Farm Workers , but do not include a mention of Itliong or other Filipinos . Speaking about Chavez and his father , Johnny Itliong said , " Larry was militant . Cesar was non @-@ violent . Cesar had handlers . Cesar had lawyers . Cesar was a dictator . " 
 The first public art memorial honoring Filipino American farmworkers was unveiled on June 24 , 1995 in <unk> Historic <unk> with Larry Itliong and Philip Vera Cruz as its most prominent historical figures . Itliong was posthumously honored in 2010 by inclusion in a mural at California State University , Dominguez Hills . In 2011 , Los Angeles County recognized Itliong with Larry Itliong Day on 25 October ; this follows the City of Carson which became the first city in the United States to recognize Larry Itliong Day in the United States in 2010 . In mid @-@ April 2013 , the New Haven Unified School District renamed Alvarado Middle School Itliong @-@ Vera Cruz Middle School in honor of Vera Cruz and Larry Itliong ; this school is the first school in the United States to be named for Filipino Americans . There was a vocal opposition to the name change , some of whom waved Mexican flags , who said that the name changing disrupts the neighborhood 's tradition . The middle school was originally named for Juan Bautista Alvarado , and the name change will not take effect until 2015 . This occurred after a 13 @-@ year effort to rename a school for the Filipino American leaders , after several other schools had been named to reflect the city 's diverse population , including Cesar Chavez Middle School , where 20 % of the population is Filipino American . In late April 2013 , a Filipino business and a Filipino Community Center were targeted with graffiti vandalism ; the graffiti was investigated as a hate crime . In 2014 , an overpass over the Filipino American Highway was designated as the " Itliong @-@ Vera Cruz Memorial Bridge " . 
 Itliong will be portrayed by <unk> Basco in the 2014 film about Cesar Chavez ; the film will not include other Filipino American farm labor leaders such as Vera Cruz . A documentary titled The Delano <unk> : Forgotten Heroes of the UFW was made to highlight the role of Filipinos in the farm labor movement , including Itliong ; the documentary was released in 2013 . 
 The Filipino Hall in Delano , California houses a collection of memorabilia .

 = Fuck : Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties = 
 Fuck : Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties is a nonfiction book by law professor Christopher M. Fairman about freedom of speech , the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , censorship , and use of the word fuck in society . The book was first published in 2009 by Sphinx as a follow @-@ up on the author 's article " Fuck " , published in 2007 in the Cardozo Law Review . It cites studies from academics in social science , psychoanalysis , and linguistics . Fairman establishes that most current usages of the word have connotations distinct from its meaning of sexual intercourse . The book discusses the efforts of conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance . The author says that legal precedent regarding its use is unclear because of contradictory court decisions . Fairman argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict the use of specific words , this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought . 
 The book received a mostly favorable reception from news sources and library trade publications . Library Journal described the book as a sincere analysis of the word and its history of censorship , Choice : Current Reviews for Academic Libraries called it stimulating , and the San Diego Law Review said it was thought @-@ provoking . One reviewer said that the book , like the article , was a format for the author to repeatedly use " fuck " , rather than actually analyze it from a rigorous perspective . After the book 's release , Fairman was consulted by media sources including CNN and The New York Times , as well as the American Civil Liberties Union , on issues surrounding word taboo in society . 
 = = Background = = 
 Christopher M. Fairman graduated from the University of Texas at Austin . He taught high @-@ school level history for nine years before returning to his alma mater where he ultimately received his Juris Doctor degree . He worked as a clerk on the Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District for Justice J. <unk> Jones . Subsequently , he was a clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for Judge Fortunato P. Benavides , and worked for the law firm Weil <unk> in their office in Dallas . Fairman became a professor at Ohio State University 's Moritz College of Law in 2000 . He specialized in areas of freedom of speech and word taboo , and earned a reputation as an expert on the subject of legal ethics . 
 Fairman was motivated to conduct research on " fuck " after learning of a Columbus , Ohio , man who was arrested for using the word in an email to a judge in 2004 . Fairman delayed writing the article until he received tenure because he was concerned its publication would adversely affect his professional reputation . Nevertheless , his supervisors did not try to convince him to cease research into the topic . Government funding helped finance Fairman 's scholarship . 
 His original 2006 article " Fuck " is an analysis of forbidden speech from linguistic and legal perspectives . It covers use of the word in case studies about sexual harassment and education . The article is 74 pages long , and the word fuck appears over 560 times . According to author Jesse Sheidlower in his book The F @-@ Word , Fairman 's work is the first academic article with the title of simply " Fuck " . 
 Fairman made his article available as a working paper on the Social Science Research Network website on April 17 , 2006 . Initially the author unsuccessfully tried to have the article published by providing copies to multiple U.S. law reviews . The Kansas Law Review rejected his article 25 minutes after receipt . It was published by the Cardozo Law Review in 2007 . The author wrote a follow @-@ up piece in April 2007 titled " Fuck and Law Faculty Rankings " . Fairman died on July 22 , 2015 . At the time of his death , Fairman 's 2007 Cardozo Law Review article , " Fuck " was still classed with the 20 top downloaded works on the Social Science Research Network . 
 = = Content summary = = 
 Fuck cites studies from academics in social science , psychoanalysis , and linguistics . Of the sixteen chapters in the book , eight use the word " fuck " in their titles . He discusses uses of the word from the 15th century onwards . Fairman establishes that most current usages have connotations distinct from its denotation of sexual intercourse , and asserts that rather than having sexual meaning , the word 's use is most commonly associated with power . 
 Fairman discusses the efforts of conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country , and says these acts are opposed to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . Fairman warns against a tendency toward self @-@ censorship . He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process . He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word . 
 Fairman writes that legal precedent regarding use of the word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions . He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law , and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech . He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment , such as speech intended to cause violent acts , and discusses the manner in which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions . Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians ' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely . He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words that can be used in speech , this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Fuck : Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties was first published in 2009 in paperback by Sphinx Publishing , and in an electronic format for the Amazon Kindle the same year . The Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer called Fairman 's paper compelling and amusing . The Horn Book Magazine described the paper as a contemplative scholarly work which was simultaneously an engaging read . Writing in the San Diego Law Review , Orly Lobel called Fairman 's article a thought @-@ provoking analysis into how the law and the First Amendment address issues of sexual language . In a 2011 article for the Federal Communications Law Journal , W. Wat Hopkins was critical of Fairman 's article and subsequent book , writing that both appeared to be formats for the author to repeatedly use the word " fuck " , rather than actually analyze the subject from a rigorous perspective . 
 A review of the book in Publishers Weekly called it a vibrant extension of his article , and described it as educational and assertive in its promotion of freedom of speech , particularly in the face of the controversial language discussed . Choice : Current Reviews for Academic Libraries reviewed Fuck and called it a stimulating book . The review concluded , " [ h ] <unk> recommended . All readership levels . " 
 Library Journal described the book as a sincere analysis of " fuck " and its history of censorship . The review characterized the book as of a higher quality than The Compleat Motherfucker : A History of the Mother of all Dirty Words ( 2009 ) by Jim Dawson . Ian Crouch of The New Yorker praised the cover design for the book . Crouch observed that the word Fuck was shown partially obscured by correction fluid but was still clearly evident in full . He concluded this was an appropriate image for a book on free speech and word taboo . 
 After the book 's publication , Fairman was consulted by media sources , including CNN , on issues involving word taboo . The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio invited Fairman to host its forum " Word <unk> " in 2010 ; his presentation was titled " Putting the ' F ' in Free Speech " . In a 2012 article on the word " fuck " , The New York Times characterized Fairman as the foremost legal scholar in the United States on the word " fuck " .

 = BYU Jerusalem Center = 
 The Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies ( often simply referred to as the BYU Jerusalem Center , BYU – Jerusalem or Mormon University ) , situated on Mount of Olives in Jerusalem , Israel , is a satellite campus of Brigham Young University ( BYU ) , the largest religious university in the United States . Owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints ( LDS Church ) , the center provides a curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament , ancient and modern Near Eastern studies , and language ( Hebrew and Arabic ) . Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the Holy Land , and the program is open to qualifying full @-@ time undergraduate students at either BYU , BYU @-@ Idaho , or BYU @-@ Hawaii . 
 Plans to build a center for students were announced by LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball in 1979 . By 1984 , the church had obtained a 49 @-@ year lease on the land and had begun construction . The center 's prominent position on the Jerusalem skyline quickly brought it notice by the religious conservatives , or Haredim , of Israel . Protests and opposition to the building of the center springing from the Haredim made the issue of building the center a national and even international issue . After several investigative committees of Israel 's Knesset reviewed and debated the issue , Israeli officials decided to allow the center 's construction to continue in 1986 . The center opened to students in May 1988 and was dedicated by Howard W. Hunter on May 16 , 1989 . It did not admit students from 2001 to 2006 due to security issues during the Second Intifada but continued to provide tours for visitors and weekly concerts . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Before the center = = = 
 The first LDS official to enter Jerusalem was LDS Apostle Orson Hyde , who came in 1841 and dedicated the land for the gathering of the people of Israel , the creation of a Jewish state , and the building of an LDS temple at some future time . After his visit , LDS presence in the city was virtually non @-@ existent . By 1971 , the city saw enough LDS visitors for the church to lease a building in East Jerusalem for church services . BYU 's study abroad program to Jerusalem , which began in 1968 , played a key role in the growth of LDS visitors to the area . The LDS presence in the area soon grew too large for the leased space to provide adequate space for worship , so the church began looking into building a center for students . In 1972 , David B. Galbraith became the director of BYU 's program in Jerusalem . He remained in this position until 1987 when the church 's First Presidency asked him to organize the BYU Jerusalem Center . 
 On October 24 , 1979 , church president Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem to dedicate the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens , located on the Mount of Olives . The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area , and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion . It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church 's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city . Negotiations between the church and the Israeli government stretched from 1980 @-@ 1984 . The land the church wanted for the center , located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet , right next to the valley which separates it from Mount Scopus , had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law . The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead . Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land . Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law . By August 1984 , the church had the land on a 49 @-@ year lease , building permits had been obtained , and construction on the building began . 
 = = = Construction and controversy = = = 
 The 1980s saw not only Mormons , but many Christian groups vying for representation and space in the city . These groups constantly faced opposition from a strong political minority of Orthodox Jews living in the city . Neither major political party in Israel ( the Likud and Labor Parties ) could achieve a majority vote in the Knesset without support from the more religious parties . Religious parties used this situation to pass laws in favor of Jewish Orthodoxy in exchange for their support on other issues . At the time , the conservative Jews , who made up the " religious right " in Israel , or the Haredim , constituted 27 % of the population of Jerusalem , and was decidedly against the building of the BYU Jerusalem Center or any other similar Christian structure . Larger parties faced loss of a majority if they stood opposite on this issue . Many Israeli officials , however , such as the Mayor of Jerusalem at the time , Teddy Kollek , along with others in attendance at the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden dedication , supported the center because of what the church had done for the city . Kollek specifically stated that " the Mormon church 's presence in Jerusalem can do a great deal of work in providing the bridge of understanding between the Arab and Jews ... because its members look with sympathy and understanding at both sides . " The land on which the center was built was then still considered Arab land by many , and many officials saw that its lease would add an image of religious tolerance to their government and increase Israeli control of the land . 
 Because of its prominent location in the Jerusalem skyline , construction was quickly noticed , and this sparked a major controversy in Israel and in the Jewish world as a whole beginning in 1985 . The Haredim led the opposition , their main concern being that the building would be used not as a school , but as a center for Mormon <unk> efforts in Jerusalem . The Haredim warned of a " spiritual holocaust " . The LDS Church , they argued , had no local presence in the population of the Jerusalem area and no historical connections to the land . The group spread warnings through letters , newspapers , and television that Mormon missionaries would convert Jews throughout the city , saying that : 
 " The Mormon organization is one of the most dangerous , and in America they have already struck down many Jews . At the present the Mormons are cautious because of the tremendous opposition their missionary activities would engender , but the moment their new Center is completed , we won ’ t be able to stop them . " -- Kol Ha ’ Ir 
 and that : 
 " At the heart of the " emotional " and " bitter " controversy brewing in Jerusalem is whether Christian Zionism , based on Christian eschatological expectations , should function in Israel with the help and active aid of government and municipal authorities , such as the assistance being rendered to the Brigham Young University . " -- Inter Mountain Jewish News 
 Warnings in the media led to street protests and demonstrations . Orthodox Jews marched on City Hall and to the construction site in 1986 . Some even gathered at the Western Wall in a public prayer of mourning because of the center . They also gathered at the hotel at which the BYU President was staying at one point , carrying signs saying : " Conversion is Murder ! " and " Mormons , stop your mission now " . Despite the intensity of the Haredi opposition , at no point did the protests become physically violent . In late 1985 , the Haredim motioned for a no @-@ confidence vote against the leading Labor Party . Prime Minister Shimon Peres organized a committee of eight , four for the center and four against , to debate the issue and come up with a solution either for or against the center 's presence . Another committee was formed to look into the allegation that the money the church had put into Jerusalem was a bribe to gain Mayor <unk> 's support for the center ( the committee found the church " Not Guilty " ) . A subcommittee of the Knesset requested that the LDS Church issue a formal promise not to proselytize Jews . Some Israelis considered this discriminatory , as no other Christian church had been asked to do this in Jerusalem . Church leaders , however , agreed to comply and sent a formally signed statement soon after . Some Jews in the area were still uneasy and doubted the church 's intent , believing that religious belief among Mormons would supersede adherence to the law . One protestor stated that " converting the sons of Judah , us , is a basic article of their faith . . . . They regard themselves as sons of Joseph and believe there will be no Second Coming for as long as we and they do not fuse . " 
 In addition to the promise not to proselyte , BYU began a public relations campaign to inform the public of their intentions for the center as a school and a gathering place for those already of the LDS faith . Ads were purchased in local newspapers , magazines , and on television , and the center had personnel appear on radio talk shows . Government officials in favor of the center also began to speak out , saying that Jerusalem should deny no one a place to worship , Jew , Muslim , or Christian . The Minister for Economic Planning , Gad <unk> said that the debate had " already caused considerable damage to Israel " , and Former Foreign Minister Abba Eban stated that the " free exercise of conscience and dissent in a democratic society " was at stake . The center also received support in the U.S. , as former President Gerald Ford spoke for the center , as well the United Jewish Council of Utah , who wrote a letter stating that " For over one hundred years , the Jewish and LDS communities have coexisted in the Salt Lake Valley in a spirit of true friendship and harmony . It has been our experience that when the leaders of the LDS Church make a commitment of policy , it is a commitment which can be relied upon . The stated commitment of Brigham Young University not to violate the laws of the state of Israel , or its own commitment regarding proselytizing in the state of Israel through the Jerusalem @-@ based Brigham Young facility , is a commitment which we sincerely believe will be honored . " The U.S. government also became an intermediary for BYU as 154 members of Congress issued a letter to the Knesset in support of the BYU Jerusalem Center . In 1986 , the Knesset approved the completion of the center . 
 = = = Opening and dedication = = = 
 Students moved into the center on May 8 , 1987 . The school remained unfinished , but the dormitory levels had been completed . Students had formerly been housed at Kibbutz Ramat Rachel . In 1988 , before the center 's dedication , a few Jerusalem locals complained that the arrangement of the windows at night looked like a Christian cross . The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged them over the windows so that no such sign would be seen . Members of the LDS Church do not use the symbol of the cross as other Christian denominations do , due to their focus on the resurrection , rather than the death , of Christ . 
 The center was dedicated on May 16 , 1989 by Howard W. Hunter , the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles . The dedication ceremony was small , as the church decided not to announce it until a month later . The church did not want a large ceremony to cause concern among those in opposition to the center , who may have seen it as a religious gathering . Thomas S. Monson , then a second counselor in the First Presidency of the LDS Church , and Boyd K. Packer , another member of the church 's Quorum of the Twelve , were among those in attendance , as well as BYU President Jeffrey R. Holland . Robert C. Taylor , director of the BYU Travel Study program was in attendance and stated in an interview with The Daily Universe that the dedication of the building was centered solely on the educational aspect of the school , as well as for " whatever purposes [ the Lord ] has in store " in the future . Taylor stated that the church would respect the laws of the land and their commitment not to proselyte . 
 = = = Center closings = = = 
 After the onset of the Second Intifada , security for BYU students became increasingly difficult to maintain , and the center closed indefinitely to students in 2000 . During the fighting , BYU sources reported that the center 's staff remained on location and managed to maintain good relations on both Israeli and Palestinian sides . As negotiations to stop the fighting continued , one proposed settlement had the center placed within the borders of a proposed Palestinian state ( this , however , was not the proposal ultimately agreed upon by the two sides ) . While closed to students , the center remained open for visitors and concerts . 
 On June 9 , 2006 , officials announced their intention to reopen the Jerusalem Center for the Fall 2006 semester . However , escalating violence in the area from the 2006 Israel @-@ Lebanon Conflict frustrated these plans and raised new concerns about students ' safety in the area . School officials deemed the center would remain closed until the conflict was resolved . During this time , some LDS members in Northern Israel were " voluntarily relocated " into the center , away from border missile strikes . BYU officials announced on October 9 , 2006 that the center would be reopening for student academic programs for Winter Semester 2007 . The initial program was limited to only 44 students . The center remains open into future academic terms .

 The center was designed in partnership with Frank Ferguson of <unk> Architects ( Salt Lake City ) and by Brazilian @-@ Israeli architect David Resnick , who also designed the nearby campus of the Hebrew University . The center is situated on the western slope of the Mount of Olives , right where it connects to Mount Scopus , overlooking the Kidron Valley and the Old City . The 125 @,@ 000 square feet ( 11 @,@ 600 m2 ) , eight @-@ level structure is set amid 5 acres ( 0 @.@ 008 sq mi ; 0 @.@ 020 km2 ) of gardens . The first five levels provide dormitory and apartment space for up to 170 students , each of these apartments having a patio overlooking the Old City . The sixth level houses a cafeteria , classrooms , computer facilities , and a gymnasium , while administrative and faculty offices are located on the seventh level , along with a 250 @-@ seat auditorium . The main entry is on the eighth level , which also contains a recital and special events auditorium with organ , lecture rooms , general and reserve libraries , offices , a domed theater , and a learning resource area . This auditorium is surrounded by glass on three sides , providing views of the city . The organ within it is a Scandinavian @-@ made Marcussen organ . The aforementioned library on the same floor as the auditorium contains 10 @,@ 000 @-@ 15 @,@ 000 volumes focusing largely on the Near East . 
 The center 's design reflects the architecture of the Near East . It is constructed of cast concrete . Hand @-@ carved Jerusalem limestone adorn the building , according to local custom . The use of arches and domes closely models other building of Jerusalem and the gardens throughout the center contain many trees and other plants named in the Bible . The interior contains the arches and cupolas typical of the Near East , and large , windowed pavilions provide wide views of Jerusalem . 
 Over 400 <unk> were drilled into the Mount to secure the foundation in case of an earthquake . The building also contains , in adherence to Israeli law , bomb shelters capable of holding all faculty , staff , and students in case of emergency . 
 = = Research and education = = 
 The Jerusalem Center played a role in the research of the Dead Sea Scrolls in cooperation with the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation of Jerusalem . They developed a comprehensive CD @-@ ROM database of the contents of the Scrolls , enabling researchers worldwide the ability to study them . 
 The center provides a curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament , ancient and modern Near Eastern studies , and language ( Hebrew and Arabic ) . Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the Holy Land , and the program is open only to qualifying full @-@ time undergraduate students at either BYU , BYU @-@ Idaho , or BYU @-@ Hawaii . 
 The center teaches classes in four @-@ month semesters occurring three times per year . Each semester costs $ 10 @,@ 815 . Students are required to take a small orientation course online before entering the center and are interviewed individually . Application requirements state that students must have attended at least two semesters ( including the semester immediately preceding the trip abroad ) at BYU , BYU @-@ Hawaii , or BYU @-@ Idaho , have a GPA of at least 2 @.@ 5 , and sign an agreement not to proselytize . Married students are not allowed to attend . 
 = = Mission = = 
 Members of the LDS Church believe that Jesus Christ will return in glory in his Second Coming . Howard W. Hunter , who was president of the church 's Quorum of the Twelve at the time of the center 's construction , pointed out that although there would be no proselytizing from the center , it still served a valuable purpose . One church member quoted him this way : " Elder Hunter said that our mission was not to harvest , probably not even to plant , but to clear away a few more stones . " Latter @-@ day Saints often see the center as a way for them to show local Jews what the church is about by example , rather than by <unk> . This is done by the way students and faculty at the center live their lives , as well as through the hiring of both Israeli and Palestinian workers , as an example of what can be done through cooperation . During construction of the center , for example , the church hired as many as 300 workers at one time , with about 60 % of them being Arab and the other 40 % being Jewish . Similar cooperation continues today . 
 The center also strives to meet the goals of the BYU Mission statement , " to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life " as well as in their educational endeavors . The center aims to give students not only an educational experience by experiencing cultures and languages firsthand , but a spiritual experience by taking them to the sites of biblical events and encouraging them to live their lives in a Christian way .

 Will ( Eric McCormack ) reveals to Grace ( Debra Messing ) that Karen 's ( Megan Mullally ) husband Stan is still alive . He learned this from his former boss , Malcolm ( Alec Baldwin ) , a secret agent , who told him that Stan is now living under seclusion and faked his death because of troubles with the mob . Will makes Grace promise that she keep this information to herself , but she breaks the promise and tells Jack ( Sean Hayes ) . When Malcolm later visits Will at his apartment and warns him to not to tell people about Stan 's predicament , Karen and Rosario ( Shelley Morrison ) also arrive . At meeting Karen , Malcolm becomes fond of her , as does Karen of him , even asking him out on a date , to which he accepts . Will , however , tells Malcolm that he cannot date Karen because Malcolm is still protecting Stan from the mob . 
 Meanwhile , Grace and Jack are discussing their own problems . Grace uses Jack 's promiscuous history with married men as a legitimate reason to have an affair with a married man , but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends . After being honest with her , Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye , as he told his friends . When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show , Jack Talk , even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire , his eyebrow was burnt off . Later , Will , Grace , and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan . Will breaks the news to her , but Karen believes he is joking . Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead , as she has been giving him reports on Karen . At the admission , Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will 's apartment with Malcolm , explaining that Stan may be alive , but that he is still dead to her .

 " Alive and Schticking " was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by series producer James Burrows . In July 2005 , it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) that Will & Grace 's season premiere for season eight would be performed live . It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode . This was Baldwin 's third appearance , as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven , playing Will 's boss . His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally , who plays Karen ; " I just love Megan . And so I said , ' Well , if you let me do it with Megan . ' And they said ' You got it . ' So I went and did that with them for four [ episodes ] . It was fun . For me now , it 's about who I work with . " 
 Will & Grace creators and executive producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick were in favor of doing a live episode ; " We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we 've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television , " said Mutchnick . He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode . Kevin Reilly , who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President , said the " challenging live platform launch " for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season . In discussion of the episode , Burrows , the director of all Will & Grace episodes , commented : " This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on , where the audience sees everything . Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me , and as long as I have been in the business , there are very few firsts . " 
 Upon learning about the live telecast , the cast had mixed emotions . Sean Hayes , who plays Jack , was nervous about the episode and hoped there would be cue cards . Debra Messing ( Grace ) " gasped loudly " when it was revealed that the technical demands of live television would mean that Burrows would not be directing on the stage floor , but would be up in a booth instead . Messing noted that she had never done live television , but in regards to the live broadcast , said , " It starts out our final season in a real special way . " Eric McCormack ( Will ) was intrigued about the idea and seemed to be ready for whatever happened ; " It keeps it interesting for us . It stirs it up . It gives us a new way to do it . " 
 Mullally revealed that the show 's writing team was " notorious for tinkering with the script 's laugh lines " , even during the actual taping of the episodes . She hoped they would resist that urge for the live episode . Messing , however , was sure that the writers would interfere during the broadcasts ; " I have a gut feeling that , like , 10 minutes before we go they 'll be like , ' Oh , no , no , you know what ? Change this line to this . Now we 're locked – go . ' " Prior to the live episode , the cast had shot the second , third and fourth episodes of the season . Shortly before this episode , Mullally injured her foot and was unable to walk without crutches . The writers therefore had to put Mullally 's character , Karen , in a cast and a motorized scooter , ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe . 
 " Alive and Schticking " was performed live twice for viewers in the East and West coasts , with different jokes for each broadcast . The first show was broadcast at 8 : 30 p.m. ( ET ) for the East ( this feed also aired live at 7 : 30 p.m. in the Central Time Zone ) and the second three hours later at 11 : 30 p.m. ET ( 8 : 30pm PT ) for the West . During the two performances , Messing and Hayes had " attacks of the giggles " . An audience member who was in attendance commented that Messing and Hayes " were so bad at keeping a straight face " during a dress rehearsal that Burrows had to get on the show 's PA system to yell at them . After both telecasts were aired , Burrows revealed that McCormack , Messing , Hayes , Mullally , and Baldwin " had a ball , but they also dreaded it . "

 In its original American broadcast , " Alive and Schticking " was watched by 9 @.@ 81 million households , according to Nielsen ratings .

It also scored the series ' highest 18 – 49 rating since February 17 , 2005 , and biggest overall viewer total since February 24 , 2005 . " Alive and Schticking " finished 21st in the weekly ratings for the week of September 26 – October 2 , 2005 . In 2006 , Baldwin was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the " Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series " category for this episode . 
 " Alive and Schticking " received positive reviews . Fort Worth Star @-@ Telegram contributor Robert Philpot , who gave the episode a B + rating , thought it was a pleasant surprise and an indication that there " might be some life " left in the show . He added that the episode feels fresher because of the " rapid @-@ fire dialogue , farcical situations and ubiquitous double @-@ entendres . And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt , it did prove that real people — and not mere machines — laugh at the characters and the jokes . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted that the episode showed that Will & Grace still had a bit of life left . He added that McCormack seemed to flourish under the pressure , and that Hayes and Mullally " were given free rein to flex their Jack and Karen [ ... ] " . Dana Stevens of Slate magazine reported that " Alive and Schticking " offered a chance to punch up the show with some " unusually broad sight gags . " She wrote that the real reason to watch the episode were the mistakes made by the actors . 
 Philpot continued that moments like Will and his boss making out recalled the show 's " glory days " , and Messing 's trouble keeping a straight face " brought back fond memories of Tim Conway cracking up Harvey Korman on The Carol Burnett Show . " Knoxville News Sentinel 's writer Terry Morrow also commented that the episode reminded him of The Carol Burnett Show because of its " goofiness and by @-@ the @-@ seat @-@ of @-@ its @-@ pants style . " Morrow added that the episode made him laugh more than any other sitcom on network television . Jeffrey Kauffman of DVD Talk praised Baldwin for his performance and commented that " Alive and Schticking " helped " jumpstart the series creatively after a couple of seasons " and " It 's fun [ ... ] to see the actors momentarily break character , a la The Carol Burnett Show , where the absurdity of certain situations ( usually involving Jack and / or Karen ) makes giggling all but impossible . " Entertainment Weekly television critic Gary Susman gave " Alive and Schticking " four stars , while Frazier Moore of the Associated Press lauded it as a " fun , and attention @-@ grabbing , note . " The Hollywood Reporter 's Ray Richmond said " In hindsight , this live thing proved a good idea . " 
 " Alive and Schticking " received less positive reviews as well . Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch wrote that the live episode " proved once and for all that Will & Grace should have been buried before now , " and Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk pointed out that its underlying storyline " is a little too over @-@ the @-@ top . " Jessica Banov of the The Fayetteville Observer wrote , " The first live show ... was so @-@ so . The lighting was weird , and I 'm not sure what was up with Debra Messing 's hair . But it was funny to see Messing and Sean Hayes break from their scripts to giggle . " Cinquemani commented that Baldwin 's " absurd " role as Malcolm " is proving to be one of Will & Grace 's most enduring guest stars . " David Blum of The New York Sun reported that the producers of Will & Grace wasted Baldwin 's " prodigious talents on a supporting role this past season , when it 's clear he could effortlessly carry his own network series . " Kauffman concluded that Grace 's joke about George Bush being brain dead " just falls amazingly flat " . 
 = 1930 Salmas earthquake = 
 The 1930 Salmas earthquake occurred on May 7 at 01 : 34 : 26 IRST in West Azerbaijan Province , Iran . The earthquake , which was among Iran 's largest , measured 7 @.@ 1 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of X ( Extreme ) . A damaging foreshock occurred fifteen hours prior to the main event and served as a warning to the people that felt it strongly . Reports from seismologists and seismological organizations indicate that up to 3 @,@ 000 fatalities may have occurred in western Iran and eastern Turkey . 
 Sixty villages ( including the large settlement of Dilman , which was relocated and rebuilt as Salmas ) were destroyed in the Salmas Plain and in the surrounding mountainous regions . A destructive aftershock sequence affected many villages , and in some cases , damage was inflicted on some that had escaped devastation during the mainshock . An inspection of the region was undertaken , but not until decades later , at which time substantial surface faulting and other ground effects were documented .

 The epicentral area in the Salmas Plain covers 300 square kilometres ( 120 sq mi ) and is positioned northwest of Lake Urmia . This area had been inhabited primarily by Christians for about a thousand years prior to the event ( which was one of the strongest earthquakes to occur in Iran since 1900 ) . The mountainous areas surrounding the plain are extremely isolated with villages ( comprising mainly Kurdish people ) that are spread far apart . Montane villagers sustained themselves primarily on wheat and cattle farming . To the west , near the Turkish border , lies <unk> <unk> , a volcano that is the highest peak in the region . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 A relatively strong foreshock occurred at about 10 : 03 : 26 IRST on May 6 in the same area as the mainshock . This destructive event caused 25 fatalities and was felt as far as northwestern Azerbaijan and southeastern Turkey . Damage to adobe homes was substantial . Roofs and walls collapsed and in some instances whole homes were demolished . Many of the villagers in the valley spent the following night outdoors and were spared during the main event , but in the mountainous villages where the shock was not felt as strongly ( Shekar <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and others ) the population was not as concerned . Many slept indoors and this led to high casualties in those areas during the mainshock a little more than 15 hours later .

 Sixty villages and about 40 churches were destroyed in the southwest Salmas Plain and the surrounding mountainous regions . In the zone of heaviest damage ( bounded by the villages of <unk> Shahr , <unk> and <unk> ) all the homes and all but one of the churches were destroyed . To the east of this area , the large village of Dilman reportedly had 1 @,@ 100 casualties , but seismologists J. S. <unk> and M. Berberian questioned the reliability of this figure . In smaller villages , survivors provided an accurate count of those lost because they remembered the victims by name , but in a village of 18 @,@ 000 , survivors were unable to grasp the extent of the losses . Only two homes remained standing there , and the village was renamed Salmas and moved to a new location to the west . 
 The villages in the mountains to the south , west , and north of the Salmas Plain were generally smaller , and accounted for about half of the total number of villages that were lost . The foreshock was not felt at <unk> ( the westernmost village that was destroyed ) and the losses were high . The foreshock was also not strongly felt to the east of Lake Urmia ( and to the southwest of Tabriz ) where the village of <unk> was completely destroyed and 85 people were killed . Other nearby villages went almost unscathed , with the differing amounts of damage being attributed to soil type .

 A post @-@ earthquake survey of the land was undertaken by seismologists N. N. <unk> and C. P. Melville , but it was not completed until the mid 1970s . At that time , 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) of surface breaks with right @-@ lateral offsets between 1 – 4 metres ( 3 ft 3 in – 13 ft 1 in ) were located between the villages of <unk> and <unk> Shahr . Substantial vertical movement of the west @-@ northwest trending fault was also seen , with even greater maximum displacements of 4 – 6 metres ( 13 – 20 ft ) , but the average vertical slip was about 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 ft 11 in ) throughout the extent of the observed surface faulting . They estimated that about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) of visible fault breaks were present immediately following the shocks , but by the time they had completed their survey 45 years later about half of the surface features had succumbed to erosion . Other effects included disturbed stream and spring flow , water table fluctuations , and landslides .

 = Haddam Island State Park = 
 Haddam Island State Park is an undeveloped 14 @-@ acre ( 5 @.@ 7 ha ) island in the lower Connecticut River in the town of Haddam , Connecticut , in the United States . Originally used by the Wangunk tribe , the island was reserved for their use as part of a 150 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 390 km2 ) land sale to English colonists in May 1662 . In the 19th century , the island was used for fishing and farming . The early 20th century saw it as a place of public recreation , and the State of Connecticut purchased the island and made it a state park in 1944 . The park is only accessible by boat , and recommended activities are boating , fishing , and birdwatching . 
 = = History = = 
 The English settlers in the Connecticut Colony originally named the island Thirty Mile Island because it was erroneously believed to be 30 miles ( 48 km ) north of the Connecticut River 's mouth . The original English settlement in the area was called Thirty Mile Island Plantation . In May 1662 , an area of 150 square miles ( 390 km2 ) of land , including the island , was sold by the Wangunk tribe to the English settlers for 30 coats . However , the natives reserved the right to use the island as part of the sale stipulations . Though little documentation exists today , the Wangunk tribe lived on the island and in the surrounding area before selling it along with the rest of their land . Recorded deeds show that the Wangunk tribe made another land sale in 1672 , and the remaining parcels of Wangunk land were sold between 1765 and 1769 . 
 At the close of the 18th century , the island was one of the most important fishing locations on the Connecticut River . By 1819 , the island was listed as 18 acres ( 7 @.@ 3 ha ) in area and was expected to increase in size following the construction of a pier 90 rods north of the island , which caused the accumulation of sand at the head of the island . The island is currently listed as 14 acres ( 5 @.@ 7 ha ) in size . In the 19th century , two fishing companies operated from the island and constructed piers , and the island was also used for grazing cattle and farming corn . Records in the late 19th century indicate that the Haddam Island area of the Connecticut River was dredged annually . The island became a popular recreational area with picnics and private events in the beginning of the 20th century . The island was purchased by the State of Connecticut in 1944 , and it became a state park . According to legend , Captain Kidd buried some of his treasure on the island , but none has been found . 
 = = Activities = = 
 Haddam Island State Park is home to a large number of bird species , especially during annual migrations , which make it suitable for birdwatching . Bird @-@ banding and other research activities have taken place on the island . Other recommended activities are boating and fishing ; fishing was the historic use of the island from centuries ago . To access to the island , one must cross the Connecticut River , and there is no parking area or fees . The northern side of the island has a beach that is fragile and cannot support heavy visitation , and the island has a significant amount of poison ivy . The nearest access point is the Haddam Meadows State Park boat launch , which features chemical toilets and parking .

 The Badshahi Mosque ( Punjabi , Urdu : <unk> مسجد , Imperial Mosque ) in Lahore was commissioned by the sixth Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb . Constructed between 1671 and 1673 , it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction . It is the second largest mosque in Pakistan and the seventh largest mosque in the world . It is Lahore 's most iconic and famous landmark and a major tourist attraction . Aurangzeb 's mosque 's architectural plan is similar to that of his father , Shah Jehan , the Jama Masjid in Delhi ; though it is much <unk> it also functions as an <unk> . The courtyard which spreads over 276 @,@ 000 square feet , can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers ; ten thousand can be accommodated inside the mosque . The minarets are 196 feet ( 60 m ) tall . The Mosque is one of the most famous Mughal structures , but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh . In 1993 , the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site .

 The mosque was constructed by the sixth Mughal emperor Aurangzeb , who , unlike the previous emperors , was not a patron of art and architecture . He built the mosque between 1671 and 1673 under the guidance of <unk> Khan <unk> , his " master of ordinance " . 
 On 7 July 1799 , the Sikh army of the <unk> chief , Ranjit Singh , took control of Lahore . After the capture of the city , the Badshahi mosque was desecrated by Ranjit Singh , who used its vast courtyard as a stable for his army horses , and its 80 <unk> ( small study rooms surrounding the courtyard ) as quarters for his soldiers and as magazines for military stores . Ranjit Singh used the Hazuri Bagh , the enclosed garden next to it , as his official royal court of audience . In 1818 , he built a marble edifice in the garden facing the mosque . 
 In 1841 , during the First Anglo @-@ Sikh War , Ranjit Singh 's son , Sher Singh , used the mosque 's large minarets for placement of <unk> or light guns . It was used to bombard the supporters of Chand Kaur taking refuge in the besieged Lahore Fort , inflicting great damage to the fort itself . In one of these bombardments , the fort 's Diwan @-@ e @-@ Aam ( Hall of Public Audience ) was destroyed ( it was subsequently rebuilt by the British but it could not be exactly restored in the previous state ) . During this time , Henri De la <unk> , a French cavalry officer employed in the army of Sher Singh , used a tunnel connecting the Badshahi mosque to the Lahore fort to temporarily store gunpowder . 
 In 1849 during the British Raj , the British continued using the mosque and the adjoining fort as a military garrison . The 80 cells ( <unk> ) built into the walls surrounding the its vast courtyard on three sides were originally study rooms , which were used by the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh to house troops and military stores . The British demolished them so as to prevent them from being used for anti @-@ British activities and rebuilt them to form open arcades or <unk> .

 Because of increasing Muslim resentment against the use of the mosque as a military garrison , the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re @-@ establish it as a place of religious worship . From then onwards , piecemeal repairs were carried out under the supervision of the Badshahi Mosque Authority . Extensive repairs commenced from 1939 onwards , when Sikandar Hayat Khan took on the task of raising funds for this purpose . 
 It was not until 1852 that the British established the Badshahi Mosque Authority to oversee the restoration of the mosque as a place of worship . Although repairs were carried out , it was not until 1939 that extensive repairs began , supervised by the architect Nawab Zen Yar Jang Bahadur .

 = Western Chalukya literature in Kannada = 
 A large body of Western Chalukya literature in Kannada language was produced during the reign of the Western Chalukya Empire ( 973 – 1200 CE ) in what is now southern India . This dynasty , which ruled most of the western Deccan in South India is sometimes called the Kalyani Chalukya Dynasty after its royal capital at Kalyani ( now Basavakalyan ) and sometimes called the Later Chalukya Dynasty for its theoretical relationship to the 6th @-@ century Chalukya dynasty of Badami . For a brief period ( 1162 – 1183 ) , the Kalachuris , a dynasty of kings who had earlier migrated to the Karnataka region from central India and served as vassals for several generations , exploited the growing weakness of their overlords and annexed the Kalyani . Around 1183 , the last Chalukya scion , Someshvara IV , overthrew the Kalachuris to regain control of the royal city . But his efforts were in vain , as other prominent Chalukya vassals in the Deccan , the Hoysalas , the Kakatiyas and the Seunas destroyed the remnants of the Chalukya power . 
 Kannada literature from this period is usually categorised into the linguistic phase called Old @-@ Kannada . It constituted the bulk of the Chalukya court 's textual production and pertained mostly to writings relating to the socio @-@ religious development of the Jain faith . The earliest well @-@ known writers belonging to the Shaiva faith are also from this period . Under the patronage of Kalachuri King Bijjala II , whose prime minister was the well @-@ known Kannada poet and social reformer Basavanna , a native form of poetic literature called Vachana literature ( lit " utterance " , " saying " or " sentence " ) proliferated . The beginnings of the Vachana poetic tradition in the Kannada @-@ speaking region trace back to the early 11th century . Kannada literature written in the champu metre , composed of prose and verse , was popularised by the Chalukyan court poets . However , with the advent of the Veerashaiva ( lit , " brave devotees of the god Shiva " ) religious movement in the mid @-@ 12th century , poets favoured the native tripadi ( three @-@ line verse composed of eleven ganas or prosodic units ) , <unk> ( song @-@ poem ) and free verse metres for their poems . 
 Important literary contributions in Kannada were made not only by court poets , noblemen , royalty , ascetics and saints who wrote in the marga ( mainstream ) style , but also by commoners and artisans , including cobblers , weavers , cowherds and shepherds who wrote in the desi ( folk ) style . These Vachana poets ( called Vachanakaras ) revolutionised Kannada literature , rejecting traditional themes that eulogised kings and noblemen , and writing didactic poems that were closer to the spoken and sung form of the language . In addition to hundreds of male poets , over thirty female poets have been recorded , some of whom wrote along with their husbands .

 Towards the end of the 10th century , a new Karnataka dynasty , called the Western Chalukyas , had come to power by overthrowing the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta ( modern Malkhed in the Gulbarga district , Karnataka ) . Their earliest inscription is dated to c . 957 and is ascribed to a subordinate ruler , Tailapa II of Tardavadi , later to become the founding king of the empire , in the Bijapur district , Karnataka . An inscription from c . 967 suggests that an unsuccessful rebellion was staged by <unk> , a local king belonging to the Chalukya family , with the help of the Kadamba chief from the temple town Banavasi . These events , however , paved the way for Tailapa II to launch a successful rebellion against the Rashtrakuta King Karka II with the help of the Kadamba chief of Hangal . 
 A century before these political developments , the age of great Sanskrit and Prakrit epics and classics had come to an end . This productive period had made available a vast corpus of literature that could be expressed in the local language of Kannada . Kannada , which had flourished both as a language of political discourse and literature in the Rashtrakuta court , found enthusiastic support from the Chalukya kings . The influential Jains , who according to historian A.S. <unk> may have comprised 30 percent of the population , not only dominated the cultural landscape of 9th and 10th century Karnataka , but were also eager to encourage literature in the local language . According to Professor S.N. Sen , a research fellow at the Indian council of historical research , Kannada literature under the Chalukyas reached a " perfection of form " . Scholars Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben have claimed that 90 percent of the Chalukyan royal inscriptions are in Kannada , a virtual displacement of Sanskrit as the language of courtly discourse . 
 = = = Mainstream literature = = = 
 For a few centuries after Kavirajamarga ( " Royal path for poets " , c . 850 ) , the earliest available Kannada literary work , Jain writings had adhered to Sanskritic models that had been recognised by the state as the path for future Kannada writers , while relegating native poetic forms ( compositions such as <unk> and <unk> ) to subordinate status . The stranglehold that the Sanskritic models had over Kannada literature is best exemplified by Ranna 's lexicon Rannakanda ( 990 ) , where native day @-@ to @-@ day Kannada words had been translated into Sanskrit . This implied that the pure form of the local language was not viewed as equal to Sanskrit , from the cosmopolitan viewpoint . Kannada writings by Jain authors thus used impressive Sanskrit @-@ derived verses interspersed with prose to extol the virtues of their patron kings , who were often compared to heroes from the Hindu epics . While Adikavi Pampa ( Pampa Bharata , 941 ) compared his patron , the feudatory Chalukya King Arikesari , to Pandava prince Arjuna , in Vikramarjuna Vijaya , his version of the Hindu epic Mahabharata , Ranna ( 983 ) found it suitable to compare his patron , King Satyashraya , to Pandava prince Bhima . 
 = = = Folk literature = = = 
 The mainstream literary style was to lose popularity during the mid @-@ 12th century Kalachuri rule , due to the rise of revolutionary notions about the social and cultural order . The Veerashaivas , acting in protest , used the pure form of Kannada language in their poems ; moreover , they encouraged writers from lower castes to participate and completely eliminated themes that had been considered formal by the king and the monastery . Thus , written in native metres , in a language close to the spoken form of Kannada , the Vachana poems gained mass appeal . A new religious faith was thereby propagated by the Veerashaivas whose ascendancy is called the " Veerashaiva movement " and their communicative genre , the Vachana . While the Vachana poetry is generally categorised as a part of the pan @-@ Indian Bhakti ( devotional ) literature , such generalisations tend to disguise the very esoteric and anti @-@ bhakti positions taken by many Vachanakaras . The origin of the Veerashaiva ideology and the beginnings of their poetry is unclear . According to D.R. Nagaraj , a scholar on literary cultures in history , modern scholars tend to favour two broad views : integrationist and <unk> . The <unk> , such as L. <unk> , trace the source of Vachana poetic tradition to the Sanskrit Upanishad scriptures and the Agama doctrine , though this does not explain why the movement did not blossom earlier or in the neighbouring Telugu @-@ speaking region where radical Shaiva sects were known to be active . The <unk> , such as Chidananda Murthy , M.M. <unk> and G.S. <unk> , propose a native Karnataka origin of the poetry , though they are yet to fully explain its unique nature . 
 = = = Other developments = = = 
 At about this time , adding to pressure from the popularity of the Vachana canon in the northern Kannada @-@ speaking region , the noted Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana ( 1108 – 1152 ) of the southern Kannada @-@ speaking region converted from Jainism to the Hindu sect of Vaishnavism . The popularity of Ramanujacharya 's philosophy had spread in the Hoysala lands and <unk> , a sub @-@ sect of Vaishnavism , was in the ascendant . By the late 13th century , the Veerashaiva writers , who were by now writing allegorical inscriptions and biographies of famous Vachanakaras of the 12th century , were in stiff competition with the Jains . The earliest attempts by the Jains to veer away from traditional puranic ( philosophical ) themes of renunciation are seen in the writings of Hoysala writers Nemichandra and Andayya . Lilavati <unk> , a novel written by Nemichandra ( 1170 ) on the topic of love , erotica , and of the victory of Kamadeva ( god of love ) over his arch @-@ rival Shiva , is the first among such writings . It was followed by Kabbigara Kava ( " Poets defender " , 1215 – 1237 ) by Andayya , also a work depicting a war between Kamadeva and the god Shiva . Despite these efforts , the Jain literary influence was to recede in the coming decades and centuries , being relegated mostly to the coastal Kannada @-@ speaking region . Works of enduring quality were still produced by maverick authors such as Ratnakaravarni ( 1557 ) , though their numbers were fewer . 
 Contemporaneous to these developments , Nagavarma II wrote his Kannada grammar Karnataka <unk> ( " Ornament of Karnataka language " , 1042 or 1145 ) . A milestone in the history of Kannada literature , it helped consolidate the language as competitor to established languages such as Sanskrit and Prakrit , bringing the local language within the realm of literary cosmopolitanism . Writing a Kannada grammar in Sanskrit language was essential to Nagavarma II , a subtle rebuttal to Sanskritic scholars of the day who may have considered Kannada a language of the common man and its grammar as underdeveloped . In addition to the Chalukya patronage , Kannada poets and writers of this period were popular in the courts of neighbouring kingdoms of the western Deccan . The Hoysalas , the southern Kalachuris , the Seunas , the Gangas and the Silharas are some of the ruling families who enthusiastically used Kannada in inscriptions and promoted its literature .

 The late 10th century was a period of consolidation for the fledgling empire . Founding King Tailapa II and his successor , King Satyashraya , warred against their neighbours : the <unk> of south Konkan , the <unk> of Gujarat , the Paramara of central India and the Chola Dynasty of Tanjore . Unaffected by these political developments , Kannada literature continued to flourish in the royal court . The foremost writer of this period was Ranna , who was born to a family of bangle sellers in the town of <unk> . Ranna is considered by historians K.A. Nilakanta Sastri and Sailendra Nath Sen as one of the " three gems of Kannada literature " along with his seniors , Adikavi Pampa and Sri Ponna . Ranna became the court poet of King Tailapa II and King Satyashraya . In his early days , he was also patronised by the well @-@ known Ganga minister Chavundaraya . Ranna is famous for writing <unk> purana ( 993 ) , which recounts the life of the second Jain tirthankar <unk> . However , it is in his magnum opus , the work <unk> Bhima Vijaya ( " Victory of bold Bhima " , also called Gada <unk> or " Conflict of Clubs ' " , 982 ) that he reaches his zenith of poetic grace while describing the conflict between Pandava Bhima and Kaurava prince Duryodhana in his Jain version of the Hindu epic Mahabharata . 
 Unlike Pampa who glorifies Arjuna and Karna in his writing , Ranna eulogises his patron King Satyashraya and favourably compares him to Bhima , whom he crowns at the end of the Mahabharata war . He calls Bhima 's adversary Duryodhana <unk> ( " a great person " ) . The work contains some of the earliest examples of elegiac verses ( called <unk> gita or <unk> gita ) in the Kannada language , noted among which is one piece that describes the heart @-@ rending lamentation ( called <unk> rasa or " sentiment of pathos " ) of Duryodhana on seeing the slain bodies of his brother <unk> , his inseparable friend in joy and sorrow , Karna , and Arjuna 's valorous son Abhimanyu . The effect given to the writing , the language , the diction and the style maintained throughout the narration has earned Ranna a place among the most notable authors of Kannada literature . Ascribed also to Ranna is the earliest available dictionary in Kannada language called the Rannakanda ( 990 ) , of which only eleven verses still exist . His other notable writings were the <unk> and the <unk> . According to historian Suryanath Kamath , the latter work , which is now lost , may have been an eulogy of Chavundaraya , whom the poet admired . For his literary contributions , the title Kavi <unk> ( " Emperor among poets " ) was bestowed upon Ranna by his patron king . 
 Another notable writer from the close of the 10th century , Nemichandra , wrote the <unk> <unk> and Lilavati ( c . 990 ) with Prince <unk> Deva of <unk> ( modern Banavasi , Karnataka ) and Princess Lilavati as the protagonists of the latter poem . Other writers from the close of the 10th century whose works are now lost but have been praised by the Chalukya minister Durgasimha ( 1031 ) are <unk> ( patronised by King Jayasimha II ) , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Inscriptions such as the <unk> and Haveri records eulogize popular writers such as Harivarma ( 1070 ) and Narayana Deva respectively . 
 = = = = Early secular writings = = = = 
 According to Kannada scholar R. Narasimhacharya , despite the production of some important secular writings , repeated Chola invasions into Kannada lands in the 11th century may have adversely affected literary production . This situation was brought about by intense competition between the Western Chalukyas and their arch @-@ rivals , the Cholas of Tanjore . Among notable writings , <unk> 's <unk> ( " <unk> ornament of passion " , 1025 ) , written in the champu metre , is the earliest available work on erotica in the Kannada language and an adaptation of the Sanskrit <unk> by <unk> . The narration is a dialogue between the patron and his wife in <unk> , the most modern Kannada in usage at the time . He was under the patronage of <unk> , feudatory of King Jayasimha II ( also called Jagadekamalla I ) . <unk> , a Jain Brahmin patronised by King Someshvara I ( also called <unk> or <unk> ) showed his ability to write on scientific subjects in Jatakatilaka ( 1049 ) , the earliest available writing on astrology in Kannada , citing the Sanskrit astronomer Aryabhata . His other work is the lost Chandraprabha Charite , on belles @-@ lettres . 
 Chavundaraya II , a Shaiva Brahmin ( Brahmin devotee of the god Shiva ) by faith and a protege of King Jayasimha II , wrote <unk> ( c . 1025 ) in the champu metre . It is the earliest available encyclopaedia in the Kannada language , written at times with a poetic touch . It comprises twelve chapters and has found popularity in later references as well . The work is on various topics such as daily life , astronomy , astrology and forecasting of events based on the Indian calendar ( <unk> <unk> ) , sculpture , construction of buildings ( <unk> <unk> ) and reservoirs ( <unk> ) , omens , divination of water , preparation of medicine from herbs and plants ( <unk> ) , general medicine ( <unk> ) , perfumery , cookery and toxicology ( <unk> ) . Mentioned in this book is the popular South Indian dish <unk> and its preparation by soaking <unk> dal ( black gram ) in butter milk , grinding it to a fine paste , and mixing with spices and the clear water of curd . 
 Durgasimha , the <unk> <unk> ( minister of war and peace ) of King Jayasimha II wrote the well @-@ known Panchatantra ( " The five stratagems " , 1031 ) in champu style , basing it on <unk> 's <unk> language original <unk> . This fable is the first adaptation of the original into a vernacular language of India . Containing sixty fables in all , thirteen of which are original , each is summarised by an ethical moral based on a Jain tenet . Durgasimha also authored the Karnataka <unk> , the earliest available commentary in the Kannada language , giving a brief commentary on all the Sanskrit verses he quoted in the Panchatantra . Around this time , <unk> ( c . 1000 – 1050 ) , a Kannada language theorist , who considered the rules of prosody to be the same for Sanskrit and Kannada , wrote the <unk> 
 There were other notable writers from the latter part of 11th century . <unk> , patronised by King Someshvara II , wrote the poem <unk> in c . 1068 . <unk> , a Brahmin Advaita saint of Balligavi , who was patronised by King <unk> , a vassal of Chalukya King Someshvara II , wrote <unk> sataka ( c . 1070 ) in the sataka ( hundred @-@ line verse ) metre . In this <unk> of verses , where each ends with the term " <unk> " as another name of the god Shiva , the author treats on <unk> ( ethics of renunciation ) . Other writers whose works are considered lost but have been referenced in contemporary writings are <unk> and Gunavarma . <unk> , who was admired by King Someshvara II ( also called Bhuvanaika Malla ) , wrote <unk> and <unk> . Gunavarma , who earned the honorific Bhuvanaika Vira , a title befitting a warrior rather than a poet , is mentioned by grammarian Keshiraja ( c . 1260 ) as the author of Harivamsa . His title identifies him with a Ganga prince called <unk> who was a minister and general under Chalukya King Someshvara II . Other writings ascribed to the author are Pushpadanta Purana and <unk> Prabha Stotra .

 The 12th century heralded an age of peace and prosperity . Cultural and literary developments received impetus during the rule of King Vikramaditya VI , a patron of the fine arts . The king , who ascended the throne in 1076 and ruled for fifty years occupies a pride of place in the history of Karnataka . His reign marks the end of the use of Saka Varsha ( Indian calendar , the " Saka era " ) in Chalukya inscriptions and the start of Vikrama Varsha ( " Vikrama era " ) . His court was adorned with some of the most well @-@ known writers of Kannada and Sanskrit literature . <unk> , whose writings are dated by the scholars D.R. Nagaraj and Sheldon Pollock to the 10th century , and by E.P. Rice and R. Narasimhacharya to c . 1112 , wrote the <unk> , a book containing fifteen stories that belong to the genre of fable and parable . Well known among these stories teaching about Jain tenets are " <unk> and the mongoose " , " Kapalika and the young elephant " and " Serpent , tiger , monkey and the goldsmith who had fallen in the old well " . The writing is one of intense self @-@ interrogation where the author criticises the beliefs of all contemporaneous religions while decrying the contamination in the original Jain beliefs due to external cultural influences , such as the practice of violent and bloody rituals and the caste system . 
 Brahmashiva , the court poet of King Vikramaditya VI , earned the title <unk> ( " Emperor among poets " ) from his patron for his writing <unk> ( " Analysis of the doctrine " , c . 1125 ) . In this philosophical writing , containing touches of propagandist satire and humor , the author seeks to prove the virtues of Jainism superior to all other contemporary religions . Brahmashiva portrays contemporary life and beliefs of the people of the Kannada @-@ speaking region . He criticises Hinduism and the conversion of a Jain temple originally dedicated to the Tirthankar <unk> in <unk> into a Hindu temple <unk> the goddess Mahalakshmi . He expresses reservation regarding the existence of religious cosmopolitanism within a household where family members followed multiple faiths . The author is concerned about the eroding popularity of Jainism in southern India due to the rising popularity of the Veerashaiva movement . Prince <unk> , a younger brother of King Vikramaditya VI , wrote <unk> ( " Cattle Medicine " ) , the earliest available writing in Kannada on veterinary science , which mixes medicine and magic . 
 After the death of Vikramaditya VI , his successors , Someshvara III and Jagadhekamalla II continued to support poets and writers . <unk> 's account of the life of the 22nd tirthankar Neminatha , the Neminathapurana ( c . 1145 ) in champu metre , includes details of the Hindu epic Mahabharata and of the god Krishna from a Jain outlook . Jagaddala Somanatha 's Karnataka Kalyanakaraka ( 1150 ) , a translation of the Sanskrit writing Kalyanakaraka by <unk> , is the earliest writing on medicine in Kannada . It prescribes an entirely vegetarian and non @-@ alcoholic diet . 
 = = = = Consolidation of grammar = = = = 
 Among available works on Kannada grammar , a part of Kavirajamarga ( 850 ) forms the earliest framework . The occurrence of the term <unk> in some contexts of the writing may be a reference to previous grammarians or <unk> . Though Nagavarma @-@ II is credited to be the author of the earliest exhaustive Kannada grammar , the author mentions his predecessors , <unk> and Nagavarma @-@ I ( the extant <unk> , " Ocean of Prosody " , c . 984 ) as path @-@ makers of Kannada grammar . The exact time when grammarian Nagavarma @-@ II lived is debated by historians . Until the discovery of <unk> Puranam ( " Life of <unk> " , c . 1042 ) written in Kannada by an author who goes by the same name , it was broadly accepted by scholars including E.P. Rice , R. Narasimhacharya and K.A. Nilakanta Sastri that Nagavarma II lived in the mid @-@ 12th century ( 1145 ) and was also the Katakacharya ( " poet laureate " ) of Chalukya King Jagadhekamalla II . However , of late , the Encyclopaedia of Indian literature , published by the Sahitya Akademi ( 1988 ) , and scholars D.R. Nagaraj and Sheldon Pollock concur that Nagavarma II lived in the mid @-@ 11th century and was the poet laureate of Chalukya King Jayasimha II , who had the epithet Jagadekamalla ( " Lord of the world " ) . 
 Irrespective of when Nagavarma II lived , it is accepted that few scholars in the history of Kannada literature made important contributions in as many subjects as he did . His writings on grammar , poetry , prosody , and vocabulary are standard authorities and their importance to the study of the Kannada language is well @-@ acknowledged . Among his available writings , the historically important Kavyavalokana ( " Treatise on the art of poetry " ) on grammar , poetics and rhetoric is considered path @-@ breaking and contains all the essentials of Kannada grammar . The first section of the book is called <unk> and contains five chapters dealing with <unk> combinations , nouns , compounds , nominal derivatives and verbs respectively . It is based on earlier works by the Sanskrit grammarians <unk> and <unk> . The Karnataka Bhashabhushana , a consolidated and exhaustive Kannada grammar written by Nagavarma II in the Sanskrit language , follows the fundamental framework of the Katantra school of Sanskrit grammar . For his contribution to Kannada grammar , Nagavarma II earned the honorific <unk> – the name of the noted Sanskrit grammarian of the Satavahana era . His <unk> <unk> ( " Treasury of significations " ) , a lexicon , gives Kannada equivalents of nearly eight thousand Sanskrit words and is considered an achievement which gave Kannada language considerable footing in the world of Sanskrit literary dominance . Modern Kannada poet Govinda Pai proposed that the author of Karnataka Bhashabhushana was a different Nagavarma who belonged to the mid @-@ 12th century .

 The meteoric rise of Veerashaivism ( a religious sect which preaches devotion to the god Shiva , also called " Lingayatism " ) in caste @-@ ridden 12th @-@ century Karnataka has historic significance because it involved commoners from the lower strata of society , people who had hitherto been denied access to even basic education . The essence of the movement , also seen in the resulting Vachana poems , was the rejection of temple @-@ based ritual worship and the hegemony of mainstream Sanskritic texts and scriptures . The movement encouraged a monotheistic belief in the god Shiva which , according to Kannada scholar H.S. Shiva Prakash , is a possible influence of the 63 Nayanmars ( poets devoted to the god Shiva , 5th – 10th century ) of the Tamil @-@ speaking region . The followers of the faith prayed not to a conventional image of a God but rather wore a linga ( symbol of the god Shiva ) on their body . The beginnings of the Vachana poetry ( called Vachana Sahitya – " Vachana literature " , or Anubhava Sahitya – " mystic literature " and sometimes Sharana Sahitya – " literature of the devotees " ) , a unique form of expression in the Kannada language , can however be traced back to the 11th century . 
 Names of three poets from the 11th century and some of their poems are available . Madara <unk> , a cobbler turned saint , is considered by H.S. Shiva Prakash as the first Vachana poet , and was held in high esteem by latter day poets of the 12th century , including Basavanna . Only ten of <unk> 's poems , expressing his resentment of the caste system in metaphors taken from the cobblers ' trade , are extant today . <unk> <unk> is the second poet . A dalit by birth , his six available poems are confessional in nature , a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna . <unk> Dasimaiah ( or <unk> Dasimaiah , 1040 ) is better known because a hundred and fifty of his poems are available . Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors , his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva . Dasimaiah 's wife <unk> qualifies as Kannada 's first women poet , though only a few of her poems are available .

 In mid @-@ 12th century , the Kalachuris successfully warred against their overlords , the Western Chalukyas , and annexed their capital Kalyani . During this turbulent period lasting three decades ( 1153 – 1183 ) , Veerashaivism gained popularity . According to H.S. Shiva Prakash , the Kalachuri period is one of the high points of medieval Kannada literature . Basavanna ( or Basava ) , a social reformer and the prime minister of Kalachuri King Bijjala II , is generally regarded as the inspiration behind this movement . Allama Prabhu , Chennabasava , Siddharama , Akka Mahadevi , and <unk> Keshiraja are other well @-@ known poets among several hundred in this cadre . 
 A centre of religious discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ( " Hall of experience " ) in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered to discuss their mystic experiences . Here , they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas . These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic , <unk> and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches , rituals and book learning . Many of these poems are anonymous , but the authors are identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked in the poem . 
 Basavanna 
 Born to Brahmin parents in the town of Basavana <unk> , Basavanna ( 1106 – 1167 ) rejected the <unk> ( " ritual thread ceremony " ) and left home for Kudalasangama , a holy place at the confluence of the Krishna and <unk> rivers in Bagalkot district , Karnataka . According to historian P.B. Desai , it was here , during his tutelage under the saint <unk> , that Basavanna had visions of his life 's purpose . The life of Basavanna marks a milestone in the history of Karnataka state , India . A towering personality , his zeal and socio @-@ cultural achievements in the realm of peace and equality of mankind have brought about enduring changes in society . 
 Information about his life and achievements come from the many Kannada writings , the earliest of which were written just after his death . Hoysala poet Harihara 's <unk> ragale is the first known biography on Basavanna . Vijayanagara poet @-@ writer Bhima Kavi 's Basavapurana ( 1369 ) , Singiraja 's Amala <unk> ( 1500 ) , Vijayanagara minister Lakkanna Dandesa 's Shiva <unk> ( 1425 – 1450 ) are some of the important sources . The cornerstone of Basavanna 's philosophy was " work @-@ worship is heaven " , the rejection of mere worship of God and the acceptance of one 's own body as a temple of God . Basavanna strongly advocated a life of complete commitment to work . As a poet , he finds a pride of place in Kannada literature . His deftly written poems end with the word " Kudalasangama " which literally means " God of the confluence of two rivers " , the poet 's version of the god Shiva . About 1 @,@ 300 such poems have survived , and have been described by H.S. Shiva Prakash as lyrical , satirical , deeply contemplative and self @-@ critical . 
 In one satirical poem , Basavanna decries the hypocrisy of a snake charmer and his wife , who on their way to find a bride for their son cancel the journey when they come across a bad omen – another snake charmer and his wife . Though Basavanna himself was a minister under the patronage of the king , some of his poems betray his contempt towards kingship and deep devotion to the god Shiva . A poem by Basavanna : 
 Allama Prabhu 
 Allama , also known as Allama Prabhu ( lit , " Allama the master " ) was a mendicant saint @-@ poet who took to the path of asceticism after the untimely death of his wife <unk> . He was born into a family of hereditary temple performers and was himself an expert on the drum ( called <unk> ) in Balligavi , a town of great antiquity in the Shivamogga district , Karnataka . Wandering around grief @-@ stricken by his wife 's death , he came across a saint called <unk> who initiated him into asceticism . 
 Ascribed to Allama are 1 @,@ 321 extant poems , each of which end with the word " <unk> " ( lit , " Lord of the Cave " , a form of the god Shiva ) , for it is said Allama found enlightenment in a cave . Allama 's cryptic poems , though full of kindness , are known for their satire , mockery , invective and rejection of siddhis ( occult powers ) . H.S. Shiva Prakash compares Allama 's poems to the <unk> in Japanese Zen poetry . According to D.R. Nagaraj , Allama 's mystic poems are in a category all of their own and do not qualify as bhakti poems , which are typically characterised by transparent devotion . 
 While Basavanna 's zeal and influence led to the formation and popularity of the Veerashaiva movement in Kalyani , it was Allama who was the undisputed spiritual authority presiding over the gatherings of the devotees . Chamarasa , a well @-@ known 15th @-@ century Kannada writer in the court of Vijayanagara King Deva Raya II wrote Prabhulinga Lile ( 1430 ) , an account of the preachings and achievements of Allama ; it was translated into the Telugu and Tamil languages at the behest of his patron king , and later into the Sanskrit and Marathi languages . In the story , Allama is considered an incarnation of the Hindu god Ganapathi while Ganapathi 's mother , Parvati ( Shiva 's consort ) , takes the form of a princess of Banavasi . A notable anthology called the <unk> ( " The achievement of nothingness " , 1400 ) was compiled on the life of Allama and gives details about his interaction with contemporary saints . A poem by Allama Prabhu : 
 Akka Mahadevi 
 Prominent among the more than thirty women poets was Akka Mahadevi . Born to a merchant family in the town <unk> ( or <unk> ) in the Shivamogga district , and possibly married against her wishes to a feudal chief called <unk> , she renounced worldly pleasures , opting for a life of devotion and asceticism . She is often compared to other such notable female saint @-@ poets of Hinduism as Andal , <unk> and Meera Bai , and is considered one of the prominent female poets of the Kannada language . 
 The 430 short poems written by her , in a language that depicts her love for her divine lover " Channa Mallikarjuna " ( lit , " Beautiful Mallikarjuna " , a name for the god Shiva ) , and the 15th @-@ century anthology , the <unk> , are the main sources of information about her life . Her poetry is characterised by scorn for physical possessions and detachment from worldly affairs . A popular poem written by her describes the life of a silk worm which spins a cocoon , becomes entangled in the threads , and eventually dies because it cannot extricate itself – the silk worm is compared to a person and the silk threads , to worldly desires . In a poem of puns , the poet prays that her god , whom she describes as the " Lord of fragrant <unk> " , may cut through the cocoon of desires so she may become free like a butterfly . 
 In addition to poetry , she is credited with two short writings , <unk> and <unk> , the latter written in the native tripadi metre , describing the various stages of spiritual enlightenment . Tradition has it that Akka Mahadevi preferred to wear no clothes , a form of renunciation which in her own words was the " most exalted spiritual state " . She died while still in her twenties in a plantain grove in the holy city of Srisailam . A poem by Akka Mahadevi : 
 Other poets 
 Basavanna 's nephew , Chennabasava , is more popular as a strategist and a theologian . Apart from authoring some notable and lengthy Vachana poems , he wrote on yogic experiences in a book called <unk> . He is known to have been the manager of the gatherings and the <unk> ( " great house " ) of Basavanna . Credited to Siddharama , another influential devotee and a native of <unk> ( modern <unk> , Maharashtra ) , are writings in tripadi metre and 1 @,@ 379 extant poems ( though he has claimed authorship of 68 @,@ 000 poems ) . His poems were influenced by Basavanna 's ideology and convey rejection of blind beliefs , the caste system , and sexual discrimination . 
 Artisan poets included <unk> <unk> , a wood cutter ; <unk> <unk> , a washerman ; <unk> Chowdiah , a ferryman ; Madara <unk> , a cobbler ; <unk> Mariah , a toddy tapper ; <unk> Ramanna , a cowherd ; <unk> <unk> , a mirror maker ; and <unk> Siddha , a shepherd , as but a few in a long list of poets . Poets <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> were ritual street performers and their poems reflect images from their trade . 
 Several women poets made important contributions including : Basavanna 's sister <unk> and his two wives , <unk> and <unk> , though <unk> seems to have been the more prolific . Some female poets were wives of male poets in the Veerashaiva congregation . Notable among them are <unk> , whose poems compare in quality to those of Akka Mahadevi , <unk> ( a dalit poet ) , whose poems scorn at the upper caste people , Mahadevi and <unk> , who wrote poems in a mystic language , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , who penned poems on the hypocrisy of religious pretences , <unk> <unk> ( a spinner ) , who employed a cryptic language called <unk> in her poems , and <unk> , who is known for her debates with the patron saint Allama himself . Other names worthy of mention are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and a princess called <unk> .

 Challenging the very core of the caste @-@ based society , the Veerashaivas conducted a marriage between an upper caste Brahmin bride and a lower caste Shudra groom . The resulting confrontation between rebellious Veerashaivas and the conservative upper classes lead to the assassination of King Bijjala II and the eviction of most devotees , including Basavanna , from Kalyani . The successors of King Bijjala II were weak , prompting Chalukya Someshvara IV , ruling from Annigeri , to attempt rebuilding his empire by invading Kalyani in 1183 . Though his invasion was successful , his overall efforts failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in Banavasi in 1189 . Though these turbulent events caused a setback to the Veerashaiva gatherings and creation of poems , the movement had set roots in the Kannada soil and regained popularity in the 15th century under the patronage of the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire . 
 = = Literature after the Chalukyas = = 
 The post @-@ Chalukya period is characterised by the popularity of Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional writings , though secular and courtly topics written in native metres continued to flourish . Native metres in vogue were the shatpadi ( six @-@ line verse ) , the tripadi , the <unk> ( rhymed couplets ) and the sangatya ( compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment a musical instrument ) . Overall , Kannada writings began to change from marga ( " formal " , due to Sanskritic influence ) to desi ( " vernacular " ) and become more accessible to the common man . 
 This change is apparent in the writings of the Hoysala court poets , some of who are noted for pioneering works in native metres . The <unk> poet Harihara , one of the most prominent poets of the medieval era , established the ragale tradition with his biography of Basavanna ( Basavaraja <unk> ragale , 1160 ) , the earliest available biography of the social reformer and of the Kannada language as well . His nephew Raghavanka established the shatpadi metre in his unique and original narration of the story of King Harishchandra called Harishchandra Kavya ( 1200 ) . Sisumayana is credited with introducing a new composition called sangatya ( 1232 ) in his allegorical poems Tripuradahana ( " Burning of the triple fortress " ) and Anjanacharita . Some Jain authors continued the champu tradition , such as Janna , immortalised by his writing Yashodhara Charite ( 1207 ) , a unique set of stories in 310 verses dealing with sadomasochism and transmigration of the soul . The earliest well @-@ known Brahmin writers also emerged during the late 12th century and wrote on themes ranging from Vaishnava faith ( Rudrabhatta 's Jagannatha Vijaya , 1185 ) to secular treatises on poetics ( Kavi Kama 's <unk> Ratnakara , on poetic sentiment and flavor ) . 
 After the fall of the Kalachuri empire , the Vachana poetic tradition halted temporarily . However , by the 14th century , the Veerashaivas who held influential positions in the Vijayanagara Empire were exerting their influence , especially during the reign of King Deva Raya II ( or <unk> Deva Raya ) . Although this period is not as famous for the proliferation of the Vachana poems as the 12th century was , contemporary writers adopted the preachings of the saints and devotees of the bygone era and made them the protagonists of their writings . Having found a rallying point to spread their faith , they began an era of commentaries , anthologies and biographies . Famous among biographies were <unk> 's Basavapurana ( 1369 ) , Singiraja 's Mala @-@ Basavapurana ( or <unk> , 1500 ) on the life of Basavanna , Chamarasa 's Prabhulingalile ( 1425 ) on the life of Allama Prabhu and Virupaksha Pandita 's Chenna Basavapurana ( 1584 ) , an account of Chennabasava . Among a long list of anthologies , four versions of the <unk> are the most well @-@ known . The first version , completed in 1400 by <unk> <unk> , was written in the form of a dialogue between the protagonist , saint Allama Prabhu , and other well @-@ known Veerashaiva devotees . Later versions were compiled by <unk> Arya ( 1500 ) , Gummalapura <unk> ( 1560 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 1570 ) . Writing Vachana poems was popularised again from the mid @-@ 16th century , though Kannada language had to wait till the 17th century to discover its greatest modern poet in this genre . Sarvajna ( lit . " The all knowing " , 16th or 17th century ) , a mendicant poet @-@ moralist and social reformer , left an indelible imprint on Kannada literature with his didactic poems , numbering about 2 @,@ 100 in all . Written using the simple native tripadi metre to instruct the country folk , these poems cover a vast range of topics , from caste and religion to economics and administration , from arts and crafts to family life and health . Sarvajna 's poems constitute some of Kannada 's most popular works . 
 Four noted Brahmin writers of the Vijayanagara empire , Kumara Vyasa , Timmanna Kavi , Kumara Valmiki and Chatu <unk> proliferated the shatpadi metre in their versions of the Hindu epics . Inspired by the Vachana writers who used the song @-@ prose medium to write their poems , the Haridasa poets used genres such as the kirthane ( musical compositions with two refrains – composition based on raga , or tune and tala , or rhythm ) , the <unk> ( rhythm @-@ based ) and the <unk> ( melody @-@ based ) to convey their devotion to God . Their contributions to the south Indian classical music ( Carnatic music ) is well acclaimed , Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa being the most popular poets of this cadre . Purandaradasa was the most prolific Haridasa poet who wrote in the ragale metre and also earned the honorific Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha ( " Father of Carnatic music " ) . Kanakadasa was versatile in many native metres . His Mohana <unk> is in the sangatya metre , <unk> and a book of morals for children called <unk> @-@ sara are in the shatpadi metre .

 " Devil in a New Dress " is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West from his fifth studio album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ( 2010 ) . Originally released through West 's GOOD Friday initiative , a weekly free music giveaway started by the rapper to promote My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . It later appeared on the album with an added guitar solo by producer Mike Dean and an additional guest verse featuring rapper Rick Ross . " Devil in a New Dress " was produced by Bink ! . It was the only song in the album not to be produced by West , who wrote it alongside Bink ! , Ross and Malik Jones . The song samples Smokey Robinson 's quiet storm recording " Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow " , and is themed lyrically to lust and heartache . Both the topics of love and religion serve as the main inspiration to the song . 
 The song received acclaim from music critics , who praised the delivery of West 's verse , the lush production and the guest appearance by Ross . It has been remixed by several musicians , such as J. Cole , Jay Electronica and Young Chris . Ross promoted the song releasing a music video in which he showcased his verse . The song was prominently featured in West 's short film Runaway during a dinner room sequence . It charted on the South Korean Gaon Chart at position 99 .

 " Devil in a New Dress " was first released on September 3 , 2010 , and was the fourth song to be featured apart of Kanye West 's GOOD Fridays , a music giveaway that provided free MP3 downloads every week . The intention was to release a free new song every Friday for a few months , and the weekly tracks generally featured various rappers from his label , GOOD Music , and other artists he usually collaborated with . Though it was the fourth GOOD Fridays song released , it was the second completely original track premiered . During its initial release , Consequence of Sound reported , " the Chicago based rapper has shared Devil in a New Dress ' , a song which is rumored to be included on West ’ s still untitled fifth studio album . Compared to his other recent joints , the track is rather minimal in nature . It clocks in at less than three minutes and features no guest contributors . In fact , it ’ s the accompanying beat which actually makes the post @-@ midnight release worth our time . " The song was often rumored to be featured on West 's new album , appearing on a leaked tracklist . It was later confirmed to appear on the album , albeit as a vastly different version . It was released digitally following the release of the album .

 Following some media controversies , West chose to record the majority of his fifth studio My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in a reclusive manner in Oahu , Hawaii . Like the majority of the album , " Devil in a New Dress " was composed there . Rapper Rick Ross was invited to Hawaii to work with West , because West was set to produce the song " Live Fast , Die Young " , which appeared on Teflon Don , an album by Ross . Ross was not initially intended to be featured on West 's album , however he walked in while West was recording another track , " Monster " . Ross was so impressed with what he heard and asked if he could deliver an intro to the song . West enjoyed what Ross brought to the song and invited him back to his studio during the final stages of the album , to record a guest verse on an extended " Devil in a New Dress " . According to Ross , the verse was added the day before the album had to be turned into the record label . In an interview with MTV discussing the composition of the song , Ross commented : 
 I got a call , they wanted me to be a part of that record . [ ... ] It was actually the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in , and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me . So I just sat there , approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could . When I laid the verse , 30 minutes later , I was extremely happy . I sent it to him , and he was too . I think it was one of the <unk> verses I did this year . " 
 Ross favorably compared the recording sessions to his past in school . He mused , " it 's like everybody is a student : You walk into a session , and it 's all about the subject at hand . " The remastered album version featured a new guitar solo , composed by producer Bink ! . Bink ! is most famous for his contributions to Jay @-@ Z 's album , The Blueprint , which has been described a " pioneering album " by Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Dombal and was West 's big break as a producer . West and Bink ! originally became friends while producing another Jay @-@ Z album , The Dynasty : Roc La Familia in the late 1990s . Bink ! described that the two producers quickly developed a mutual respect for each other . Bink ! commented on the first time he showed the composition to West , saying " the reaction I got from him after I played the beat for the first time was real intense . " Immediately Bink ! knew that West was going to use the production . Initially , he wasn 't sure whether or how West was going to use the song for his album , and expressed surprise that West dropped the song as a free track prior to the album 's release .

 The song is 5 minutes , 52 seconds long , though the originally released version was less than 3 minutes . The song is built on a soulful sample of Smokey Robinson 's quiet storm recording " Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow " , with an extended guitar solo . The song features a synth @-@ heavy breakdown , complete with guitar riffs , before Ross arrives , spitting : " I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders / Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired / Before his jaw shattered , climbing up the lord 's ladder / We still speeding , running signs like they don 't matter . " It is the only album track without production by West , but features his characteristic style of manipulating the pitch and tempo of classic soul samples . West raps in a flow similar to that of rapper Nas , commenting about the women who have wronged him in the past and his struggles with religion . Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times commented that the track reveals West 's true feelings on women ; 
 " His <unk> are usually untrustworthy temptresses , though occasionally they 're authority figures who judge him as a criminal trespasser or a cultural arriviste . And songs such as the porno fantasy ' Hell of a Life ' and the siren @-@ slaying ' Devil in a New Dress ' ( featuring the <unk> macho Ross ) revive familiar mythologies about women — that they 're monsters , killers , fallen angels — in language vibrant enough to fully revive these old stereotypes . " 
 MTV stated that " ' Dress ' continues [ Kanye 's ] return to the soulful old @-@ school sounds he championed in his early work " and that " West works an easy flow over the midtempo joint replete with feathery falsetto backing vocals an overall buttery ' 70s feel . Despite the laidback groove , West shows his vulnerable side , as he laments being loved and left . " " Devil in a New Dress " contains lyrics about lust and heartache , with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as " part bedroom allure , part angelic prayer " . Rap @-@ Up called it a " female @-@ focused song " and a " soulful track , boasting a slow @-@ rolling beat with a haunting vocal sample . ” Alex <unk> of <unk> wrote " over piano flourishes and a scintillating string section contain some of the funniest tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek lyrics about women Kanye ever managed : ' I hit the Jamaican spot , at the bar , take a seat / I ordered the jerk , she said you are what you eat . ' Kanye might be on his quest for love , but he still isn ’ t able to tolerate gold @-@ digging girls who are only after his cash : ' And outta all the colors that are still up the skies / You got green on your mind , I can see it in your eyes .

 " Devil in a New Dress " has received general acclaim from music critics , and was noted for its soulful production , as well as the verse provided by Ross . It was considered a highlight of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , and has been described as " perhaps the easiest song to like on first listen . " It was compared favorably to songs from West 's debut studio album The College Dropout by Jon Caramanica of The New York Times . Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic felt that the track brought out the best in Ross . Slant Magazine viewed that on " Devil in a New Dress " , West perfected the sampling style he helped make popular , and commented that West " manipulates the pitch and tempo of Smokey Robinson 's ' Will You Love Me Tomorrow ? ' until it crawls luxuriantly out of the speakers like wine poured in slow motion . It 's a gorgeous slow burner that turns tragic in its third act , as Kanye 's rhymes swap lust for heartache before distorted guitar lines and a muscular verse from Rick Ross close it out " . 
 Chicago Sun @-@ Times praised West 's vocal delivery , saying " he rips more hard raps on ' Devil in a New Dress ' -- chuckling through lines like , ' We love Jesus / but you done learned a lot from Satan / We ain 't married / but tonight I need some consummation , ' and later chewing through an impersonation of a preacher , ' Say @-@ tan ! Say @-@ tan ! Say @-@ tan ! ' — all over a fluttery , high , quiet @-@ storm soul vocal that 's part bedroom allure , part angelic prayer . " MTV stated " West 's breezy GOOD Fridays release gets a wintertime tune @-@ up with Ross riding shotgun . The Miami Don 's majestic contribution comes with a revamped breakdown setting up his slick boats . Still , Yeezy 's verse holds up over the Boss 's even with the refinement . " Dan Vidal of URB stated Ross brought his best to the track , writing that he " steps his tired old coke @-@ rhymes up to intense lyrical portraits on the final version of ' Devil In A New Dress ' . " Stereogum 's Amrit Singh described the production style as a throwback to vintage hip @-@ hop beats , and praised West 's extended use of metaphors on the track . AbsolutePunk 's Drew Beringer cited the track as an example of West 's " penchant for soul " , calling the track excellent . AllMusic 's Andy Kellman also described the beat as a " throwback soul production " , writing that it was " provided by the Smokey Robinson @-@ sampling Bink , it ’ s as gorgeous as any of West ’ s own early work , yet it ’ s marred by an aimless instrumental stretch , roughly 90 seconds in length , that involves some incongruent electric guitar flame @-@ out . " 
 The Village Voice 's Sean Fennessey commented that the production by Bink ! was gorgeous in nature . He compared the original three @-@ minute long version of the song to the one on the album , writing that the original " was affecting , funny ( “ I ordered the jerk , she said ' You are what you eat . ' ” ) and soulful — a touch of the old Ye . And just three minutes long . But the album version is something bigger , with a magisterial guest verse from Rick Ross ( appearing twice here ) that comes after an odd but sumptuous acid @-@ jazz breakdown . " Craig Jenkins of Prefix Music opined that " Bink ’ s beat for ' Devil in a New Dress ' peters out midway through , and a live band plays a sultry , emotive take on that beat . " Andrew Barber of Complex stated that for the people disappointed in the briefness of the verses provided by Ross on " Monster " , this track more than makes up for it . Barber favorably compared the track to the style of West 's older songs , and commented that it showcased West 's " softer , more vulnerable side , opening up about a woman . "

 The song appears in West 's short film Runaway , an extended 35 minute long music video which features a majority of the tracks featured on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . The song is played halfway through the short during the introduction to the dinner party sequence .

According to Rap Radar , " Kanye couldn ’ t make it , so Ross took matters into his own hands and shot a video for his portion of ' Devil In A New Dress ' from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . 
 Anthony <unk> of Complex wrote that " Rick Ross gives us visuals for just about every freestyle , verse and song he 's ever recorded . <unk> dropped off a Spiff TV @-@ directed video for " Devil In A New Dress " from Kanye 's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy .

 TGS head writer Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) is assigned to solve a public relations problem caused by the show 's stars , Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) and Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) , during their hosting duties of the St. Patrick 's Day parade , in which Jenna passed out and Tracy cursed during the live television broadcast . To make things worse , Liz is summoned to jury duty and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia . When she leaves for jury duty , she does not leave anyone in charge and allows the staff to go without direction — until later when she puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) in charge after learning that the staff have gotten out of hand . Liz is on a court case about a woman , named Rochelle <unk> ( Jackie Hoffman ) , whose work life and frustrations parallel her own ; the two both have employees named Tracy and Jenna , both believe their employees waste their time , and make their lives difficult . 
 Meanwhile , Jenna , worn out from working on TGS during the day and on her unlicensed Janis Joplin biopic at night , visits Dr. Leo Spaceman ( Chris Parnell ) for help so she can work on both . He gives Jenna a military @-@ grade experimental drug currently being tested on rats to stay awake . At the same time , Tracy believes that having enough money to pay FCC fines means that he can say anything on television , and he says to Liz , " I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me . " As a result , Tracy curses on The Martha Stewart Show , and after learning that the show 's advertisers are pulling out , due to his actions , decides to sponsor the show . Meanwhile , Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric , Jack Donaghy , desperately tries to find a name for a pocket microwave oven that is not offensive in any language . With Liz gone , Jack assigns the TGS writing staff , Frank Rossitano ( Judah Friedlander ) , James " Toofer " Spurlock ( Keith Powell ) , J. D. Lutz ( John Lutz ) , Josh Girard ( Lonny Ross ) , and Sue LaRoche @-@ Van der Hout ( Sue Galloway ) , to this task . After their unsuccessful attempts , Kenneth suggests " The Funcooker " which Jack decides is the perfect name . 
 Back at the studios , the taping of TGS is interrupted by Dr. Spaceman who desperately forces Jenna to sleep because she might die like one of his test rats . Tracy creates a diversion by dropping his trousers and exposing his buttocks , which he refers to as the " Funcooker " . Everyone realizes that this is where Kenneth heard the name . Fed up with the chaos , Liz sends the entire show 's staff — including Kenneth and Dr. Spaceman — to her office . Liz ponders over a box of matches and thinks of the woman in court , in which she admitted to committing arson as a way of getting back at her out @-@ of @-@ control employees .

 " Pilot " is the first episode of the American television show Numb3rs . Based on a real @-@ life serial rape case , " Pilot " features two brothers , an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and a mathematics professor at a Southern California university , using their individual skills to capture a serial rapist who has begun to kill his victims . " Pilot " also introduces the theme of mathematics being used to solve crimes . 
 Written by series creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci , the episode was filmed twice , once in Boston , Massachusetts and once in Los Angeles , California , with two different casts using two somewhat different scripts . The test audience could not believe that the three men who portrayed the family could be related to each other , so the producers made cast changes to the family . They also made several changes to the rest of the cast to accommodate the changes in the script . Heuton and Falacci changed the script to focus on the brothers ' relationship with each other . When filming finished , CBS picked up the episode and the series three weeks later . 
 " Pilot " first aired in the United States on January 23 , 2005 . The episode received mixed reviews . Mathematicians and students at California Institute of Technology enjoyed the episode and were impressed with the mathematics in it . In contrast , television critics felt as though the episode 's plot about a serial rapist was unoriginal , although one critic called the math boring . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 FBI Special Agents Don Eppes ( Rob Morrow ) , Terry Lake ( Sabrina Lloyd ) and David Sinclair ( Alimi Ballard ) investigate a serial rapist who has begun killing his victims . With the twelfth victim , Karen Silber ( Kate Norby ) , changing her story again and the thirteenth victim 's car missing , Don runs out of viable leads . Taking a map and a case file with him , Don goes to his childhood home , owned by his father Alan Eppes ( Judd Hirsch ) , to take a shower . Don 's younger brother , Dr. Charlie Eppes ( David Krumholtz ) of <unk> 's mathematics department , finds and studies the map which Don lays on the dining room table . As Don prepares to return to the office , Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family 's sprinkler . He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find the neighborhood where the rapist resides . Skeptical , Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation . 
 Charlie develops the model needed to find the rapist and refines it with graduate student Amita Ramanujan 's ( Navi Rawat ) assistance . Charlie 's model yields what he calls a " hot zone " , an area in which the suspect probably lives . As the case progresses , Silber is found dead in her house . Don and his team resort to comparing DNA samples of men who live in the hot zone to samples of the rapist / killer . Using statistical analysis , Charlie deduces that Silber lied about where her rape took place . After Don learns from Silber 's colleagues where Silber was raped , Charlie refines his equation , which yields a smaller area within the original hot zone . DNA , however , clears everyone in the original hot zone . As a result , Assistant Director in Charge ( <unk> ) Walter Merrick ( Anthony Heald ) pulls Don and his team from the investigation . At the same time , Dr. Larry <unk> ( Peter MacNicol ) , Charlie 's colleague and friend , encourages Charlie to make his equation " less elegant " and to evaluate the worth of his consultation work . 
 Back at the Eppes house , Charlie and Don discuss what went wrong . Alan is confident that the math is correct . Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don , the model will not show Don at his apartment . Instead , it would zone in on his office , where he spends most of his time . Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones , one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works . Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone , Don , Terry , and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim . After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation , he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier . This revelation proves that Charlie 's models are correct .

 Two pilots were filmed . Fascinated by mathematicians , creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci decided to create a show about one . With the encouragement of CBS development executives , they wrote several pilots revolving around mathematicians and scientists , including the pilot for Numb3rs , over the course of 14 years . Knowing that mathematics would not be readily accepted by the general public on its own , Heuton and Falacci in 2003 decided to use the police procedural format to facilitate the acceptance . When Falacci and Heuton pitched the pilot , CBS agreed to produce it about halfway through their presentation . 
 Although they had considered several story ideas , Heuton and Falacci wanted to feature a case in which math was used to solve a traditional type of crime . They decided to base the episode on a real @-@ life serial rapist case in which police asked Dr. Kim Rossmo to assist them in the investigation . In 1998 , Rossmo , then with the Vancouver Police Department , was called in to help Lafayette , Louisiana , police investigator <unk> Gallien find the South Side Rapist . Rossmo and Gallien visited the crime scenes , and Rossmo used criminal geographic targeting , a mathematical model used to find the area in which the suspect would most likely reside . Together , Rossmo and Gallien developed a map indicating the most likely location of the rapist 's residence . After DNA cleared everyone living in the area , Gallien learned that a sheriff 's deputy in a neighboring department , Randy Comeaux , was a potential suspect . He had lived in the area during the time frame of the rapes but moved to a residence in the neighboring jurisdiction some time later . DNA on a cigarette butt left by Comeaux confirmed that he was the rapist , and Comeaux was arrested . 
 The pilot was originally filmed in Boston , which was selected because of Falacci 's familiarity with the area and because of the contrast between academia and the working class . Filming began in the spring of 2004 . Although the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) refused to allow filming on campus , the cast and crew spent two days filming in the city . Dr. Tony Chan of UCLA 's physical science department consulted on the original pilot episode . Although initially hesitant about auditioning , David Krumholtz was the first person cast and won the role of Charlie Eppes . Other original cast members were Len Cariou as Alan ; Gabriel Macht as Don ; Peter MacNicol as Charlie 's mentor ; Anna <unk> Smith as Don 's boss ; Jennifer Bransford , Michael Rooker , and Alimi Ballard as FBI agents ; and Navi Rawat as a MIT graduate student . When filming was completed , executive producers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott and producer Skip <unk> added graphics and music to the footage . They also added transitions to assist the storytelling . To accommodate these changes , CBS allowed the producers to delay the delivery of the pilot to the studio by two weeks .

 When previewed , the focus group liked the concept but hated the way the pilot was produced . Among the problems with the original pilot was the believability of the Eppes family in terms of both physical appearance and chemistry , with the chemistry of the actors being the larger issue . Although Heuton and Falacci liked Cariou , Macht , and Krumholtz , Heuton and Falacci did not know how the three actors playing the Eppes family would interact with each other until filming began . 
 Since both the focus group and network executives liked the concept of the pilot , CBS decided to recast and reshoot it . Filming began again in September 2004 . To accommodate the budget for the new pilot , the second pilot was set and filmed in Los Angeles . Administrators at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) agreed to allow producers to film the academic scenes at Caltech . Dr. Gary <unk> , one of Caltech 's math professors , served as math consultant of the second pilot . The producers kept Krumholtz , MacNicol , Rawat , and Ballard . Rooker and Macht left the cast , and Rob Morrow replaced Macht as Don . Other casting changes included the addition of Sabrina Lloyd as a FBI agent , Judd Hirsch as Alan , and Anthony Heald as Don 's boss . 
 The producers rewrote the script to accommodate changes in story , characters , and basic idea of the series . They decreased the role of Don 's boss to focus the main conflict on the brothers ' worldviews . They rewrote the structure and composition of Don 's team . They also revised the start of Charlie 's involvement with the investigation to incorporate Heuton and Falacci 's original idea of Don taking the work home with him . When the second pilot was presented to the focus group , the group liked it . CBS picked up the pilot three weeks after filming ended . 
 = = Previews = = 
 The second pilot was screened at Caltech on January 10 , 2005 , and Heuton , Falacci , Hirsch , Morrow , Krumholtz , and <unk> participated in a panel discussion after the preview . The students who saw the screening at Caltech enjoyed the episode . The pilot was then previewed during the Joint Mathematics Meeting in Atlanta , Georgia from January 12 through January 14 , 2005 . Ed Pegg , Jr . , a member of the Mathematical Association of America ( MAA ) who watched the episode at the conference , stated that he liked it and that he was impressed with the decision to depict the mathematics accurately . As for premiering on network television , the pilot initially was to air on January 21 , 2005 , but it was moved to January 23 , 2005 , after the AFC Championship game in order to be seen by a larger audience . When it premiered on TV on January 23 , 2005 , 25 million people watched the pilot episode of Numb3rs , beating the audience for the pilot episode of Desperate Housewives by about 4 million viewers .

 Reception of the pilot varied according to the audience in question . The pilot was very well received by the mathematics community . Within a couple of weeks of Pegg 's article for the MAA , Keith Devlin , another member of the association , gave the pilot a very favorable review . 
 As for the mainstream media , the reviews for the pilot were mixed . Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly commented that , given that the case was about a serial killer , the pilot did not show the math in an original way . John Leonard of the New York Magazine called the cast " superb " but criticized the pilot for being too busy . Melanie McFarland , the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer 's TV critic , asserts that the pilot 's storyline was an " unfortunate choice " for the pilot episode . Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that the pilot 's storyline was unoriginal . Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle , however , stated that the pilot and the cast were excellent but that the math was uninteresting .

 On the Numb3rs season one DVDs , three features address both pilots . The bonus feature " Point of Origin : Inside the Unaired Pilot " on the Numb3rs : The Complete First Season DVDs highlights the differences between both pilots and features clips from the original pilot .

Although the bonus feature " <unk> Numb3rs : Season One " features clips and discussions for other episodes throughout the season , it also addresses the production of the second pilot . 
 = Rutherfordium = 
 Rutherfordium is a chemical element with symbol Rf and atomic number 104 , named in honor of physicist Ernest Rutherford . It is a synthetic element ( an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature ) and radioactive ; the most stable known isotope , 267Rf , has a half @-@ life of approximately 1 @.@ 3 hours . 
 In the periodic table of the elements , it is a d @-@ block element and the second of the fourth @-@ row transition elements . It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 4 elements . Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium in group 4 . The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly . They compare well with the chemistry of the other group 4 elements , even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects . 
 In the 1960s , small amounts of rutherfordium were produced in laboratories in the former Soviet Union and in California . The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists , and it was not until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) established rutherfordium as the official name for the element . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Rutherfordium was reportedly first detected in 1964 at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna ( then in the Soviet Union ) . Researchers there bombarded a plutonium @-@ 242 target with neon @-@ 22 ions and separated the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with ZrCl4 . The team identified spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka @-@ hafnium properties . Although a half @-@ life was not accurately determined , later calculations indicated that the product was most likely rutherfordium @-@ 259 ( abbreviated as <unk> in standard notation ) : 
 242 
 94Pu + 22 
 10Ne → 264 − x 
 104Rf → 264 − x 
 <unk> 
 In 1969 , researchers at the University of California , Berkeley conclusively synthesized the element by bombarding a californium @-@ 249 target with carbon @-@ 12 ions and measured the alpha decay of 257Rf , correlated with the daughter decay of nobelium @-@ 253 : 
 249 
 98Cf + 12 
 6C → 257 
 104Rf + 4 n 
 The American synthesis was independently confirmed in 1973 and secured the identification of rutherfordium as the parent by the observation of K @-@ alpha X @-@ rays in the elemental signature of the 257Rf decay product , nobelium @-@ 253 . 
 = = = Naming controversy = = = 
 The Russian scientists proposed the name <unk> and the American scientists suggested the name rutherfordium for the new element . In 1992 , the IUPAC / IUPAP Transfermium Working Group ( TWG ) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element 104 and that credit should be shared between the two groups . 
 The American group wrote a scathing response to the findings of the TWG , stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group . In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years , a fact that the Russian team does not deny . They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee . The TWG responded by saying that this was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery . The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team ( rutherfordium ) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion . 
 As a consequence of the initial competing claims of discovery , an element naming controversy arose . Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name <unk> ( Ku ) in honor of Igor Kurchatov ( 1903 – 1960 ) , former head of Soviet nuclear research . This name had been used in books of the Soviet Bloc as the official name of the element . The Americans , however , proposed rutherfordium ( Rf ) for the new element to honor Ernest Rutherford , who is known as the " father " of nuclear physics . The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) adopted <unk> ( <unk> ) as a temporary , systematic element name , derived from the Latin names for digits 1 , 0 , and 4 . In 1994 , IUPAC suggested the name dubnium ( <unk> ) to be used since rutherfordium was suggested for element 106 and IUPAC felt that the Dubna team should be rightly recognized for their contributions . However , there was still a dispute over the names of elements 104 – 107 . In 1997 the teams involved resolved the dispute and adopted the current name rutherfordium . The name dubnium was given to element 105 at the same time . 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 Rutherfordium has no stable or naturally @-@ occurring isotopes . Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory , either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements . Sixteen different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 253 to 270 ( with the exceptions of 264 and 269 ) . Most of these decay predominantly through spontaneous fission pathways . 
 = = = Life @-@ times = = = 
 Out of isotopes whose half @-@ lives are known , the lighter isotopes usually have shorter half @-@ lives ; half @-@ lives of under 50 <unk> for <unk> and <unk> were observed . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are more stable at around 10 ms , <unk> , 257Rf , <unk> , and <unk> live between 1 and 5 seconds , and <unk> , 265Rf , and <unk> are more stable , at around 1 , 1 @.@ 5 , and 10 min respectively . The heaviest isotopes are the most stable , with 267Rf having a measured half @-@ life of about 1 @.@ 3 h . Half @-@ lives for <unk> and higher are not known . 
 The lightest isotopes were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products . The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is <unk> ; heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers , of which only 267Rf has been confirmed . The heavy isotopes <unk> and <unk> have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes <unk> and 268Db , but have short half @-@ lives to spontaneous fission : it seems likely that the same is true of <unk> , a likely daughter of <unk> . While the isotope <unk> has yet to be observed , it is predicted to have a long half @-@ life of 1 h . Before its discovery , 265Rf was predicted to have an even longer half @-@ life of 13 h , but it has a half @-@ life of only 2 @.@ 5 min . 
 In 1999 , American scientists at the University of California , Berkeley , announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Uuo . These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted seven alpha particles to form 265Rf nuclei , but their claim was retracted in 2001 .

 Rutherfordium is the first transactinide element and the first member of the 6d series of transition metals . Calculations on its ionization potentials , atomic radius , as well as radii , orbital energies , and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of hafnium and very different from that of lead . Therefore , it was concluded that rutherfordium 's basic properties will resemble those of other group 4 elements , below titanium , zirconium , and hafnium . Some of its properties were determined by gas @-@ phase experiments and aqueous chemistry . The oxidation state + 4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable + 4 state . In addition , rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable + 3 state . 
 The chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculation which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the p orbitals have a lower energy level than the d orbitals , giving it a valence electron configuration of <unk> 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 <unk> , therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium . With better calculation methods and studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that rutherfordium behaves according to the rest of the group 4 elements . 
 In an analogous manner to zirconium and hafnium , rutherfordium is projected to form a very stable , high melting point oxide , <unk> . It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides , <unk> , which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides <unk> . The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase . 
 In the aqueous phase , the Rf4 + ion hydrolyzes less than titanium ( IV ) and to a similar extent as zirconium and hafnium , thus resulting in the <unk> + ion . Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions . The use of chloride and bromide ions produces the <unk> complexes <unk> − 
 6 and <unk> − 
 6 . For the fluoride complexes , zirconium and hafnium tend to form <unk> and <unk> complexes . Thus , for the larger rutherfordium ion , the complexes <unk> − 
 6 , <unk> − 
 7 and <unk> − 
 8 are possible .

 Rutherfordium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close @-@ packed crystal structure ( c / a = 1 @.@ 61 ) , similar to its lighter congener hafnium . It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23 @.@ 2 g / cm3 ; in comparison , the densest known element that has had its density measured , osmium , has a density of 22 @.@ 61 g / cm3 . This results from rutherfordium 's high atomic weight , the lanthanide and actinide contractions , and relativistic effects , although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical , and the sample would quickly decay . The atomic radius for rutherfordium is expected to be around 150 pm . Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital , the Rf + and Rf2 + ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons , which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues .

 Early work on the study of the chemistry of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves . The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element . Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes . The isotope <unk> has been used for these studies . The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule . Rutherfordium ( IV ) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium ( IV ) chloride ( <unk> ) because its bonds are more covalent . 
 A series of experiments confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as a typical member of group 4 , forming a tetravalent chloride ( <unk> ) and bromide ( <unk> ) as well as an oxychloride ( <unk> ) . A decreased volatility was observed for <unk> 
 4 when potassium chloride is provided as the solid phase instead of gas , highly indicative of the formation of nonvolatile K
