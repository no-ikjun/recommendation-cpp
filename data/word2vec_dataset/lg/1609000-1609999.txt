 In wine making , the delicate nature of the Riesling grape requires special handling during harvesting to avoid crushing or bruising the skin . Without this care , the broken skins could leak tannin into the juice , giving a markedly coarse taste and throwing off balance the Riesling 's range of flavors and aromas . 
 A wine that is best at its " freshest " states , the grapes and juice may be chilled often throughout the <unk> process . Once , right after picking to preserve the grapes ' more delicate flavours . Second , after it has been processed through a bladder press and right before fermentation . During fermentation , the wine is cooled in temperature controlled stainless steel fermentation tanks kept between 10 and 18 ° C ( 50 and 64 ° F ) . This differs from red wines that normally ferment at 24 to 29 ° C ( 75 to 84 ° F ) 
 Unlike Chardonnay , most Riesling do not undergo malolactic fermentation . This helps preserve the tart , acidic characteristic of the wine that gives Riesling its " thirst @-@ quenching " quality . ( Producers of Sauvignon blanc and Pinot <unk> often avoid malolactic fermentation for the same reason . ) Riesling is often put through a process of cold stabilization , where the wine is stored just above its freezing point . The wine is kept at this temperature until much of the tartaric acid has crystallized and precipitated out of the wine . This helps prevent crystallization of the acid ( often called " wine diamonds " ) in the bottle . After this , the wine is normally filtered again to remove any remaining yeast or impurities . 
 In viticulture , the two main components in growing Riesling grapes are to keep it " Long & Low " meaning that the ideal situation for Riesling is a climate that allows for a long , slow ripening and proper pruning to keep the yield low and the flavor concentrated . 
 = = With food = = 
 Riesling is a versatile wine for pairing with food , because of its balance of sugar and acidity . It can be paired with white fish or pork , and is one of the few wines that can stand up to the stronger flavours and spices of Thai and Chinese cuisine . A Riesling 's typical aromas are of flowers , tropical fruits , and mineral stone ( such as slate or quartz ) , although , with time , the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above . 
 Riesling is almost never fermented or aged in new oak ( although large old oak barrels are often used to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace ) . This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to a wider range of foods . The sharp acidity / sweetness in Rieslings can serve as a good balance to foods that have a high salt content . In Germany , cabbage is sometimes cooked with <unk> to reduce the vegetable 's smell . 
 As with other white wines , dry Riesling is generally served at a cool 11 ° C ( 52 ° F ) . Sweeter Rieslings are often served warmer . 
 = = Clones = = 
 There exists a large number of commercial clones of Riesling , with slightly different properties . In Germany , approximately 60 clones are allowed , and the most famous of these have been propagated from vines in the vineyards of Schloss Johannisberg . Most other countries have sourced their Riesling clones directly from Germany , but they are sometimes propagated under different designations . 
 = = Red Riesling = = 
 A very rare version of Riesling which has recently received more attention is Red Riesling ( Roter Riesling ) . As the name suggests , this is a red @-@ skinned clone of Riesling ( a skin color commonly found for e.g. Gewürztraminer ) , but not a dark @-@ skinned clone , i.e. , it is still a white wine grape . It is considered a mutation of White Riesling , but some experts have suggested the opposite relationship , i.e. , that Red Riesling could be the forerunner of White Riesling . Small amounts of Red Riesling are grown in Germany and Austria . In 2006 , the Rheingau winery Fritz <unk> planted what has been claimed to be the first commercial amounts of Red Riesling . To confuse matters , " Red Riesling " has also been used as a synonym for red @-@ skinned Traminer grapes ( such as the Savagnin rose of <unk> de <unk> ) and the obscure variety Hanns , which is a seed plant of Roter Veltliner . Roter Riesling has nothing to do with <unk> . 
 = = Crosses = = 
 In the late 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many efforts to develop new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible , less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant characteristics of Riesling . The most notable is the Müller @-@ Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882 , which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale ( although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner ) . Other Riesling / Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite <unk> and <unk> . Kerner , a cross between Riesling and the red wine grape <unk> is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings .

 = No Angel ( Beyoncé song ) = 
 " No Angel " ( stylized as " Angel " ) is a song by American singer Beyoncé from her self @-@ titled fifth studio album ( 2013 ) . It was written by James Fauntleroy , Caroline Polachek , and Beyoncé while the latter two and Boots also served as its producers . Polachek worked on several songs for the singer 's album with her bandmate from Chairlift , Patrick Wimberly , before " No Angel " was included on the record . 
 A chillwave midtempo song with elements of R & B , hip hop and trap music , " No Angel " features a minimalistic production and instrumentation consisting mostly of bass . Beyoncé uses a high vocal register , singing in falsetto with breathy vocals . Lyrically , the song features the protagonist declaring that neither she nor her love interest are perfect . " No Angel " received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics who praised its composition and the singer 's vocal performance ; however some of them criticized its placement on the album . 
 A music video for the song was directed by @ lilinternet and filmed in Houston , Texas as a tribute to the singer 's hometown . It features various landscape shots of the city as well as close @-@ ups of numerous people , including ten Houston @-@ based rappers ; Beyoncé also appears , dressed in white . The clip received positive reviews from critics who praised the fact that it accurately captured Houston . At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards , Beyoncé performed " No Angel " live during a medley of songs from her fifth studio album . 
 = = Background = = 
 Beyoncé met with Polachek 's bandmate of Chairlift , Patrick Wimberly , who collaborated with her sister Solange Knowles at that time and went with her on tour . During the tour , Beyoncé expressed her admiration of Wimberly , adding that she would " love to get in the studio some time " . Wimberly later contacted Beyoncé 's management , and Polachek and himself were later invited to a studio in Manhattan to work on Beyoncé self @-@ titled fifth studio album . They stayed in the studio for a week and when the duo was asked to submit the tracks to Beyoncé 's team , Polachek added one song with complete production and a missing verse she had written while being on tour in the United Kingdom . At that time , she felt that the song " could be a good album track for Chairlift , but it would be incredibly sexy if Beyoncé did it " . Polachek further elaborated about the differences between her version of " No Angel " and Beyoncé 's rendition , saying , " Her groove was different — my vocals were <unk> , and hers were more like panting . And in my version the synths detuned really quickly for a second ; she did the same thing but with her voice . It sounds like the whole song melts . " 
 " No Angel " was written by James Fauntleroy , Caroline Polachek and Beyoncé and produced by the latter two . Beyoncé handled the track 's vocal production , while American musician Boots provided additional production . The song was recorded with guidance from Polachek and Stuart White at Russel 's of Clapton in London , <unk> Studio , Jungle City Studios and Oven Studios , all in New York City . Polachek also handled the synths and drum programming and Andrew Scheps finished the track 's audio mixing . " No Angel " was mastered by Tom Coyne and Aya Merrill at Sterling Sound , New York City . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " No Angel " is a <unk> chillwave song . Influences of stripped down hip hop music were noted in its beat , with critics also noting elements of midtempo trap and " languid " R & B. The groove was noted to be minimalistic and progressive . Its instrumentation consists of mostly heavy bass , a counterpoint bassline and multiple finger snaps , in addition to chiming and refracted 1920s soft rock synths and percussive thump . Boogie , a distortion musical effect was also implemented in the song . Idolator 's Mike Wass found a minimal R & B grind in " No Angel " and felt that its multi @-@ layered sound provided a rich electronic background . Throughout the song , Beyoncé adopts breathy and emotional vocals . She sings with a falsetto vocal register , with Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez of Billboard calling it a return of the falsetto from the singer 's own song , " Halo " ( 2008 ) . Writing for The New York Times , Jody Rosen stated that the singer 's vocal performance was an " imitation " of the falsetto by musician Prince . Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune opined that Beyoncé employed her highest possible range , with her voice " threatening to fray " . Complex writer Tim Finney described the singer 's vocal performance as an " intoxicating @-@ asthmatic rasp " . 
 Admitting she is not perfect , Beyoncé sings the lines " Would you rather I be a machine who doesn 't notice when you late or when you lyin ' ? " and " No I 'm not an angel , but at least I 'm trying " . In " No Angel " , Beyoncé declares that her partner is " no angel either " , remarking that he is not perfect . However , despite his imperfections , the protagonist admits she still loves him . Beyoncé sings the lines " [ u ] <unk> the pretty face is something complicated / I come with a side of trouble / But I know that 's why you 're staying " in the song aimed to inform her " roguish " male lover . The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word at a time in longer intervals . A short interlude about " mov [ ing ] things to the bedroom " is interpolated in the song . Beyoncé forgoes lyrical subtlety during that part , singing explicit lines such as " Tell me do you wanna ride ? " and " First both of my legs go back on your head , and whatever you want , yeah baby , I 'm bad " . Fuse 's Mark Sundstrom interpreted the song 's message as talking about the singer 's husband Jay @-@ Z and added " She loves him more because she knows him entirely , accepting he 's not perfect or without a past " . Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld considered its lyrical content to be about how a " couple 's respective internal messiness can bring them closer together " . 
 Describing the song as " gorgeous " , Anupa Mistry of Spin magazine noted influences by Solange Knowles and added that " she 's cool with being pitchy and imperfect " . Ludovic Hunter @-@ Tilney from the Financial Times called its sound " indie @-@ R & B of a downtown variety " that Solange Knowles would record . The Verge 's Trent Wolbe concluded that " No Angel " was reminiscent of Solange Knowles ' work on the extended play True ( 2012 ) . Bradley Stern from the website MuuMuse called the song one of the album 's more " left @-@ leaning productions " saying that it would sound suitable for Solange Knowles ' work with Dev Hynes . Philip Shelburne of Spin magazine found a " distinctly Burial @-@ like quality " in the song . Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune noted it was " [ a ] s discursive as ' Blow ' is insistent " . Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press wrote that the singer " declares she 's a freak " in the falsetto @-@ heavy song .

 " No Angel " has received generally favorable reviews from most music critics . Writing for BET , Latifah Muhammad deemed " No Angel " " unapologetic and overflowing with the kind of candor that makes it a standout " . She further added , " Since love isn 't always black and white , this song deals with the gray area " . Entertainment Weekly 's Nick Catucci felt that the song " treat [ s ] relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs " on the album . Caitlin White from the website The 405 felt that , " In ' No Angel ' her partner is ' no angel either , ' the second thought in a comparison that begins with her own ability to transgress standards of purity or celestial perfection " . Chris Kelly of Fact noted that the singer managed to put theory to practice with the track , with an " imperfect but touching performance " . In a review for The Quietus , Mof Gimmers described " No Angel " as a " pure foreplay " . 
 Writers of Billboard deemed the song a throwback track and praised the singer 's falsetto . Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim ! noted that songs on the album , such as " No Angel " , effectively display genre diversity , Beyoncé 's vocal range and " a penchant of musical experimentation " . Tris McCall of The Star @-@ Ledger dubbed the song as one of the " experiments in mood " . Michael Cragg of The Guardian opined that the song 's " icy mechanics ... recasts the slow jam as something otherworldly " and called it a " Pitchfork @-@ friendly " collaboration . Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph called the slow track " more groove than an actual song " and praised Beyoncé 's vocals " flipping sensuously between breathy falsetto and deep come @-@ on " . Jody Rosen from Vulture considered the song a " very pretty showcase " of the singer 's falsetto and wrote that its production was " admirably barely there " . Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld called " No Angel " part of the darker material on the record and described the singer 's vocal performance as " an apparition singing over a lost Bowie @-@ Prince collaboration " . Kitty Empire of The Observer noted in her review how " No Angel " was " pretty much as described : a winningly stark baroque 'n'B track " . Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone described the song as the " [ p ] <unk> slinky Eighties electro @-@ soul jammy " . Idolator 's Mike Wass described " No Angel " as a " sonic adventure " which " experiments wildly " with synths and beats . He noted , " This pretty gem needs a few listens to be properly consumed but its ultimately one of the album 's most fulfilling moments . " 
 Cosmopolitan journalist Alex Rees noted how it was normal for the singer to sound " breathy " and " breathless " following four songs in a row on the album discussing sex . Nicole James of Fuse called the song a " sexed @-@ up midtempo banger " . Jem Aswad of the same publication noted the presence of a " wild , jazzy , Joni @-@ ish melody that flies all over the scale " . Jordan Runtagh from the website VH1 called " No Angel " a " classic fake @-@ out love song " and connected to the singer 's real @-@ life relationship with husband Jay @-@ Z. A more mixed review came from Ryan E.C. Hamm from Under the Radar who noted that the <unk> songs on Beyoncé which do not work well , managed to look better only because of the record itself ; he <unk> this with " No Angel " , criticizing it as " a little boring " . Both Christopher R. Weingarten of Spin and Tom Breihan of Stereogum called the song " boring " ; the latter added it would be that way for listeners " until that subtle digital bassline finds its way into your head " . Breihan , however , praised the singer 's falsetto vocals as " a thing to behold " . Melissa Locker of Time magazine stated that the singer sang " slightly obnoxiously " in " No Angel " . Una Mullally from The Irish Times questioned how " No Angel " was included in the track listing of Beyoncé , before adding " but it did and we 're just going to have to deal with it " . However , she concluded that the song should be listened several more times to be understood .

 A music video for " No Angel " was released on December 13 , 2013 through the iTunes Store in addition to a clip for every other track on the parent album . On November 24 , 2014 it was also uploaded to the singer 's Vevo account . @ lilinternet served as the director and Ed Burke was the creative director for the visual filmed in Houston , Texas . After seeing the music video for " Express Yourself " by Diplo which was directed by @ lilinternet and featured various shots of New Orleans , Beyoncé expressed her wish to collaborate with him on the visual for " No Angel " . Diplo contacted the director , telling him that the singer is interested in a collaboration . Following discussions with Beyoncé 's team , he went to Houston with Ben Solomon and visited her team from Parkwood Entertainment to discuss about his work . In an interview with Vice magazine , @ lilinternet recalled that the whole project occurred " very rapidly " . Beyoncé told the director she wanted to create a tribute to Houston , as he specialized in working on filming various locations and " environmental beauty " . Initially , the video was planned to be shot in a span of eight days . Only little narratives were planned ; however @ lilinternet revealed that the team opted for driving around Houston and filming various locations and people . He stated , " We had so many Houston legends all together in that video , and they all really worked hard to let us capture Houston properly . Beyonce 's team hooked us up with the legends . It 's her hometown and she wanted its heroes represented . And I think they really respected the fact we weren 't in and out . " He added that the video was completed without any " exaggeration " and felt that there was " so much beauty that kind of just innately was in the people and in the city " . The director revealed that he had a lot of freedom while working on the video and added , 
 We really wanted to spend time , immerse ourselves , drive for hours and hours aimlessly with a camera , jumping out and shooting things that caught my eye . We didn 't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy 's Chicken and call it an " authentic video . " There was tons of hanging out , getting the feel , all with cameras ready . We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help , plus Bun B 's brother Truck , and Paul Wall . The city was so receptive , so willing to help , so open , and that leant a lot to the fact that we really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston .

Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone described the clip as a " revealingly down @-@ to @-@ earth tour " of the singer 's hometown . Similar sentiments were offered by <unk> Harry from the website Salon who referred to the video as a " love letter " to Houston . Rob Markman writing for MTV News wrote in his review that the video gave viewers a glimpse of Houston local culture .

 Sharing what he perceived to be " key " moments in each of the seventeen music videos , Walker of MTV identified one for " No Angel " where Beyoncé " proves she comes ' with a side of trouble ' " . Bradley Stern from MuuMuse remarked how the video looked like the video game Grand Theft Auto and showed things that did not look " angelic " : " Between the tough @-@ looking <unk> , fancy cars and flashy jewelry , strippers and dozens of ' In Loving Memory ' tees and tributes , it seems like Bey 's trying to say these aren 't exactly the easiest streets to live ... But like the song suggests , just because things might get rough sometimes doesn 't mean it 's not still home . " A mixed review came from an editor of Houston Chronicle who described the clip as " somber , shocking " and noted the omissions of many landmarks characteristic for the city such as <unk> , the Houston Astrodome and The Galleria . The editor also noted that the video offered a glimpse in the town 's sex industry and elaborated , 
 Many Houstonians probably don 't know that side of the city . They almost certainly don 't see it as beautiful . ' Thug culture ' is what some pundits call it . But underneath is something complicated , and it has a way of influencing society unlike anything else Houston produces . Because of Beyoncé , that is the Houston that the world sees .

 = Safety ( gridiron football score ) = 
 In gridiron football , the safety ( American football ) or safety touch ( Canadian football ) is a scoring play that results in two points being awarded to the scoring team . Safeties can be scored in a number of ways , such as when a ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone . After a safety is scored in American football , the ball is kicked off to the team that scored the safety from the 20 @-@ yard line ; in Canadian football , the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35 @-@ yard line or kicking the ball off themselves . The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal , which require the scoring team to kick the ball off to the scored upon team . Despite being of relatively low point value , safeties can have a significant impact on the result of games , and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals , despite being worth a point less , due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick . 
 Safeties are the least common method of scoring in American football but are not rare occurrences – since 1932 , a safety has occurred once every 14 @.@ 31 games in the National Football League ( NFL ) , or about once a week under current scheduling rules . On October 21 , 1973 , Fred Dryer , playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers , became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game . A much rarer occurrence is the one @-@ point safety , which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two @-@ point conversion attempt ; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996 , most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl . No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL . A conversion safety by the defense is also possible , though highly unlikely ; although this has never occurred , it is the only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game . 
 = = Scoring a safety = = 
 = = = American football = = = 
 In American football , a safety is scored when any of the following conditions occur : 
 The ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone . 
 The ball becomes dead in the end zone , with the exception of an incomplete forward pass , and the defending team is responsible for it being there . 
 The offense commits a foul in its own end zone . 
 = = = Canadian football = = = 
 In Canadian football , a safety touch is scored when any of the following conditions occur : 
 The ball becomes dead in the goal area of the team in possession of the ball 
 The ball touches or crosses the dead line or a sideline in goal after having been directed from the field of play into the Goal Area by the team scored against or as the direct result of a blocked scrimmage kick . 
 = = Resuming play after a safety = = 
 = = = American football = = = 
 After a safety is scored , the ball is put into play by a free kick . The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20 @-@ yard line and can punt , drop kick , or place kick the ball . In professional play , a kicking tee cannot be used – however , a tee can be used in high school or college football . Once the ball has been kicked , it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team , and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball . 
 = = = Canadian football = = = 
 After scoring a safety touch , the scoring team has the option of taking control of the ball and beginning play from their own 35 @-@ yard line , kicking the ball off from their 35 @-@ yard line , or accepting a kickoff from the 25 @-@ yard line of the team that conceded the score . If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick , and the ball can be held , placed on the ground , or placed on a tee prior to the kick . As in American football , the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team . 
 = = Elective safeties = = 
 In American football , intentionally conceded safeties are an uncommon strategy . Teams have utilized elective safeties to gain field position for a punt when pinned deep in their own territory and , when ahead near the end of a game , to run down the clock so as to deny the other team a chance to force a turnover or return a punt . Teams have also taken intentional safeties by kicking a loose ball out the back of their end zone , with the intent of preventing the defense from scoring a touchdown . 
 Elective safeties are more common in Canadian football , where they can result in better field position than a punt . The 2010 Edmonton Eskimos surrendered a Canadian Football League ( CFL ) <unk> 14 safeties , a factor that led CFL reporter Jim Mullin to suggest increasing the value of the safety touch from two to three points as a deterrent . 
 = = Conversion safety = = 
 In American football , if what would normally be a safety is scored on an extra point or two @-@ point conversion attempt ( officially known in the rulebooks as a try ) , one point is awarded to the scoring team . This is commonly known as a conversion safety or one @-@ point safety and it can be scored by the offense . There are at least two known occurrences of the conversion safety in Division I college football – a November 26 , 2004 game in which Texas scored against Texas A & M , and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl in which Oregon scored against Kansas State . In both games the PAT kick was blocked , recovered by the defense , and then fumbled or thrown back into the end zone . Coincidentally , play @-@ by @-@ play commentator Brad Nessler called both of these games . No conversion safeties have been scored in the NFL since 1940 , although it is now slightly more likely after the rule change in 2015 which allowed the defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt . Before 2015 , the only scenario in which a one @-@ point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball out the back of the end zone without taking possession of it . After the 2015 rule change , a one @-@ point safety can also be scored after the defense takes possession and fumbles out of their own end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it , as in the NCAA . 
 In college football and the NFL , a conversion safety could also be scored by the defense . To accomplish this , the kicking team would have to retreat all the way back to their own end zone and then fumble the ball out of it or be tackled in it . A more plausible scenario would involve a turnover on the extra point attempt followed by a lost fumble before the defensive player reaches the end zone , with the ball finally being downed by the offense in its own end zone . While such a conversion safety has never been scored by the defense , it is the only possible way in which a team could finish with a single point in an American football game .

 The 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final was played on September 6 , 2014 , at PPL Park in Chester , Pennsylvania . The match determined the winner of the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup , a tournament open to amateur and professional soccer teams affiliated with the United States Soccer Federation . This was the 101st edition of the oldest competition in United States soccer . Seattle Sounders FC won the match , defeating the Philadelphia Union in Pennsylvania . The crowd of 15 @,@ 256 saw the teams go into extra time level at 1 – 1 before the Sounders scored twice more to end the match 3 – 1 . 
 Philadelphia and Seattle both play in the top tier of American soccer , Major League Soccer ( MLS ) , and bypassed the initial stages of the tournament with entries into the third round of play . The Sounders were in the midst of a Supporters ' Shield @-@ winning regular season , while the Union 's start was so poor that their coach was replaced a week prior to their first game in the competition . Philadelphia secured its berth in the final by defeating the Harrisburg City Islanders , the New York Cosmos , the New England Revolution , and FC Dallas . Seattle 's road to the final included victories over PSA Elite , the San Jose Earthquakes , the Portland Timbers , and the Chicago Fire . 
 The coaches both chose strong squads in their attempts to win the trophy , though Sounders forward Kenny Cooper , later selected as Player of the Tournament , did not appear in the final . The Union 's Maurice Edu gave his team the lead with a goal in the first half , but the Sounders equalized with a second half strike by Chad Barrett , and the match went into extra time . Although Philadelphia controlled periods of the match with chances throughout , Clint Dempsey took the lead for Seattle in the first extra time period , and Obafemi Martins sealed a Seattle victory with a late goal . Seattle earned a $ 250 @,@ 000 cash prize , as well as a berth into the 2015 – 16 CONCACAF Champions League . Philadelphia received a $ 60 @,@ 000 cash prize as the competition 's runner @-@ up .

 The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all United States Soccer Federation affiliated teams , from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) . The 2014 competition was the 101st edition of the oldest soccer tournament in the United States . For the third consecutive season , all American @-@ based MLS teams earned automatic qualification into the third round proper . Previously , only eight teams from MLS could qualify for the tournament : six automatically based on the previous year 's league results , and two more via a play @-@ in tournament .

 Teams from Philadelphia and the surrounding region have had a successful history in the Open Cup : Bethlehem Steel F.C. won five trophies between 1915 and 1926 , the <unk> Truckers won in 1936 , and the Philadelphia Ukrainians won four times during the 1960s . The Union 's alternative jersey , worn throughout the competition , featured a large letter " B " in the lower left corner to honor Bethlehem . 
 The Union began the MLS regular season with only 3 wins in 16 games . Their head coach , John Hackworth , was fired and Jim Curtin was named as his interim replacement a week before the first Open Cup match against their lower @-@ league affiliate Harrisburg City Islanders on June 17 . A successful run in the Open Cup had the potential to salvage the season and Curtin said that the team was taking the home game " very seriously " . Harrisburg plays in the USL Professional Division — the third division of American soccer — but Philadelphia still played several of its regular starters , and did not permit Harrisburg to use two previously loaned Union players . Philadelphia was almost eliminated , but Maurice Edu scored an equalizing goal in the 89th minute , and Andrew Wenger scored two more goals in extra time to advance the Union with a score of 3 – 1 . 
 On June 24 , Philadelphia played at home versus the New York Cosmos of the second @-@ tier North American Soccer League in what was only Curtin 's second game as head coach . Overtime was again needed as the teams ended regulation tied at one apiece before Sébastien Le Toux scored the game @-@ winner in the 115th minute . Shortly after the goal , a melee erupted between the teams that resulted in two Cosmos players and one Union player being sent off for pushing and shoving . Two of New York 's assistant coaches were also ejected for their parts in the disorder . 
 The team were at home against the New England Revolution of MLS for the fifth round , on July 8 . They easily won with goals from Conor Casey and Le Toux . The latter 's strike made him the modern @-@ era Open Cup goals leader with a total of 14 scored in his career . Le Toux had a strong history with Seattle and the tournament before moving to the Union in 2009 ; he previously played for the second @-@ division incarnation of the Sounders and won the 2009 Open Cup with the MLS side . He would later be named the runner @-@ up to the year 's Most Valuable Player of the Tournament . A dust storm accompanied by thunder and lightning halted the game for an hour after the 61st minute , but the Revolution could not recover from the two goal deficit . 
 On August 12 , Philadelphia traveled to MLS side FC Dallas for the semifinal . Amobi <unk> scored a goal in the first half before Dallas equalized . The match went to kicks as regulation and extra time resulted in a stalemate . Goalkeeper Zac MacMath made diving saves of two Dallas attempts in the shoot @-@ out to clinch the Union 's place in the final — the closest the team had been to winning a trophy in its five @-@ year history .

 The Seattle Sounders won the Open Cup in 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 . They also reached the final in 2012 but were eliminated by a lower @-@ level side early in 2013 . In 2014 , they drew amateur club PSA Elite , a developmental lower @-@ division team that had already been victorious in its first three rounds of the tournament . Seattle hosts most Open Cup home games at Tukwila 's Starfire Sports stadium . The ground holds about 4 @,@ 000 which is much smaller than their normal home stadium , CenturyLink Field . Coach Sigi Schmid was quoted as saying " I think our guys thrive on the closeness of the crowd . It helps spur them on to good performances . " Seattle was leading MLS entering the round on June 18 , and easily won 5 – 0 . Kenny Cooper scored twice in the victory . 
 The Sounders hosted the San Jose Earthquakes at Starfire on June 24 and both teams scored in the first half . The Earthquakes second @-@ string goalie , David Bingham , kept his team in the match by stopping three shots from Chad Barrett late in the second half . Neither team scored in extra time and the game went to a shoot @-@ out . After the shoot @-@ out ended 4 – 1 , goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann celebrated by drinking a beer in front of the beer garden and the home fans . 
 On July 9 , Seattle went against its rival , the Portland Timbers , at Starfire for the quarterfinal . The Sounders went on top with an Osvaldo Alonso goal , but former Sounder Steve Zakuani assisted Darlington <unk> to score a last @-@ second equalizer for the Timbers in the 93rd minute . Extra time saw the ejection of Portland 's Diego Chara while Cooper and Marco Pappa both found the back of the net to give the home team a 3 – 1 victory . 
 The team 's semifinal match was at home against Chicago Fire on August 13 . The Fire were without 2013 's MLS Most Valuable Player , Mike Magee , due to suspension . Cooper and Andy Rose each scored twice while Obafemi Martins and Pappa both had a goal apiece . Seattle finished the game with three goals in the final four and a half minutes in the convincing 6 – 0 victory . The first goal of the match was Cooper 's last of the competition as he did not play in the subsequent final . He ended the tournament with a total of 13 career Open Cup goals , one shy of Le Toux 's modern @-@ era total of 14 . Cooper netted six in 2014 alone , and he would go on to be named 2014 's Player of the Tournament .

The Union marketed the game by publicly displaying the trophy at local restaurants , landmarks , and events . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 The Open Cup is not held in as high regard as the MLS Cup but it is still an important achievement . For Philadelphia , it represented their first @-@ ever chance at a trophy , whereas Seattle had been to the finals five times in the club 's six @-@ year history . With a victory , the Sounders would tie the Fire with four overall wins by an MLS team . 
 The all @-@ time record between the clubs stood at 3 – 2 in favor of Seattle . The Sounders had beaten the Union earlier in the year during league play but Philadelphia had improved since then . By the time of the final , the Union had a 10 @-@ game unbeaten streak at home . Seattle had recently lost three of five MLS matches but was still one of the best teams in the league . Seattle was the favorite with one pundit comparing Philadelphia to perennial underdog Rocky Balboa of the film series Rocky . 
 Player selection during the previous stages of the Open Cup was a challenge due to key personnel receiving call @-@ ups for the World Cup . The Sounders had depth that could withstand losing players and did not rest starters in the lead @-@ up to the final game . The Union rested several starters during the previous weekend 's league match . Philadelphia 's Casey , Le Toux , and Cristian Maidana were significant attacking threats , while Seattle had the striking pair of Martins and Clint Dempsey . Defensively , Edu was Philadelphia 's strongest player . Seattle also had a strong defense with young national team prospect DeAndre Yedlin , and eventual MLS Defender of the Year Chad Marshall .

 Kickoff was scheduled for 7 : 30 pm local time . Armando Villareal was the referee and his assistants were Peter <unk> and Corey Parker . The fourth official was Jose Carlos Rivero . There were no suspensions or injuries of note . The weather was cloudy with a temperature of 73 ° F ( 23 ° C ) .

 Sounders coach Schmid made adjustments to his usual starting lineup . Pappa did not start due to a recent return from international duty with Guatemala , while star striker Martins was on the bench as well . Although he won the Golden Boot for most goals scored , Cooper was primarily a bench player throughout the year and did not start the match . Although lacking those playmakers , the Sounders came out attacking and their first big chance came in the 10th minute when Rose slung a low cross near the face of the goal to Dempsey , whose resulting shot was off @-@ frame . 
 The Union increased its pace with Andrew Wenger playing wide on the left where he repeatedly got past Yedlin to get to the byline or cut back to shoot . Maidana and Le Toux strengthened Philadelphia 's position by combining on the other side of the field to penetrate Seattle 's defense . Wenger connected with Le Toux who took a shot , but Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei was quick enough to make the stop . In the 38th minute , Maidana was fouled by Leonardo González wide right of the penalty area . Maidana 's resulting free kick curled towards the back post where Brad Evans lost his footing and Edu glanced the ball with his forehead to put it in the back of the net . The home team kept control of the first half and continued creating scoring opportunities .

 Neither team made substitutions at halftime . The Sounders came out on the attack and were awarded a corner kick just three minutes into the period . Carlos Valdes attempted to clear the ball but Marshall headed it towards goal for MacMath to clear . Barrett scored from close range and the match was level at 1 – 1 . 
 Seattle maintained momentum with Yedlin beginning to overcome Wenger while Martins replaced Barrett in the 60th minute . Philadelphia 's midfield then again began to assert dominance and Maidana had a breakaway in the 72nd minute . Yedlin sprinted to make up ground to stop the attack in what MLS would call the " defensive play of the game " . Dempsey had a chance to score off a cross from Pappa in the 76th minute but could not get a foot on the ball . Martins then had another chance that went wide before control shifted yet again to Philadelphia . 
 Seattle replaced Lamar Neagle with Pappa in the 74th minute in an attempt to create an advantage . Philadelphia answered with two more chances that almost won the match . Casey received a yellow card at the 57th minute and was later replaced by Pedro Ribeiro . In the 88th minute , Raymon Gaddis won the ball and took a shot that was deflected . Ribeiro took a shot but it lacked power . In stoppage time , Vincent Nogueira had another close shot that struck the post and ricocheted dangerously close to the goal before being cleared .

Valdes had an excellent opportunity to tie the match in the 111th minute when he made a header towards the Sounders goal , but the shot was weak and easily saved .

 Both teams had chances during the match with Philadelphia making an especially intense push in the final 15 minutes . While both defenses struggled throughout , Frei and MacMath combined for a total of seven saves ( four and three , respectively ) . Schmid told the press after the final : " From a fans ' standpoint , it was probably a very , very entertaining game . " A writer for Sports Illustrated quipped that " Schmid 's decision not to start Obafemi Martins and Pappa was confusing — and then looked like a stroke of genius " , as both were integral to the Sounders offense in the later stages of the game . Schmid told reporters during a post @-@ match interview that Martins did not start due to a muscle strain . The coach also praised the ability of Martins and Dempsey to complete key passes with each other . The Sounders received a $ 250 @,@ 000 cash prize for winning the tournament . It was Dempsey 's first club trophy of his long career , and he beat Martins in voting to be named the Player of the Round . Yedlin and Frei also received votes . Seattle went on to win the MLS Supporters ' Shield for having the best record in the league before being eliminated from the playoffs . The Open Cup win granted the team a spot in the 2015 – 16 CONCACAF Champions League . 
 As runner @-@ up , Philadelphia was awarded $ 60 @,@ 000 . Curtin told the media after the game : " I 've never been proud of anything in my life that ended in a loss before ... This is the first time . " Curtin 's leadership on the road to the final helped convince the players , fans , media , and front office of his ability to manage the club . Although the team missed the league playoffs , his performance was enough for the team to remove the " interim " tag from his title as head coach . 
 GolTV had broadcasting rights for the tournament between 2012 and 2014 . The channel is not shown on many television packages but Comcast picked up the feed in the Philadelphia area . Attendance at PPL Park was 15 @,@ 256 , the lowest for an Open Cup final in six years . A live stream was made available over the Internet for a fee , but the quality was so poor that refunds were promised after only 20 minutes . After the game , a writer for The Seattle Times panned the broadcast arrangements and low attendance at PPL Park , saying , " It 's a shame so few were able to see it . "

 The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion is an action role @-@ playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks and the Take @-@ Two Interactive division 2K Games . It is the fourth installment in The Elder Scrolls action fantasy video game series , following The Elder Scrolls III : Morrowind and preceding The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim . Oblivion was first released in March 2006 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 . A mobile phone version of the game was released in May 2006 , and a PlayStation 3 version was shipped in March 2007 . After a number of smaller content releases , the major expansion pack Shivering Isles was distributed . The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion Game of the Year Edition was released in 2007 ( a package including both Shivering Isles and the official expansion pack Knights of the Nine ) for Microsoft Windows , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 . A fifth @-@ anniversary edition was shipped in 2011 . 
 Oblivion 's main story revolves around the player character 's efforts to thwart a fanatical cult known as the " Mythic Dawn " that plans to open the gates to a realm called " Oblivion " . The game continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely . A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character 's skills , which are numerical representations of certain abilities . Seven skills are selected early in the game as major skills , with the remainder termed minor . Developers opted for tighter pacing in gameplay and greater plot focus than in past titles . 
 Development for Oblivion began in 2002 , directly after the release of Morrowind . To design the graphics , Bethesda used an improved Havok physics engine , high dynamic range lighting , procedural content generation tools that allowed developers to quickly create detailed terrains , and the Radiant A.I. system , which enabled non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles . The game features fully voiced NPCs — a first for the series — and the music of award @-@ winning composer Jeremy Soule . Overall , Oblivion was well received by critics , and has won a number of industry and publication awards . It was praised for its impressive graphics , expansive game world , and schedule @-@ driven NPCs . It was successful both commercially and critically . A PlayStation Portable version of the game was also in development before being cancelled . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Oblivion is a role @-@ playing game ( RPG ) that incorporates open @-@ ended gameplay . The player can follow side @-@ quests , interact with NPCs , dispatch monsters , develop their character , and travel anywhere in the province of Cyrodiil at any time while playing the game ( provided that the areas are not quest @-@ specific and otherwise inaccessible when not questing ) . The game never ends , and the player can continue playing after completing the main quest . The gameplay includes a " fast travel " system , in which an icon appears on the game world map every time the player visits a new location . This excludes the game world 's main cities which are already unlocked for fast travel from the start of the game . The player can arrive at a desired location instantaneously by selecting the icon on the map . 
 Character development is a primary element of Oblivion . At the beginning of the game , players select one of many human or anthropomorphic races , each of which has different natural abilities , and customize their character 's appearance . A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character 's skills , which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas . 
 Seven skills are selected early in the game as major skills , with the remainder termed minor . The players level up each time they improve their major skills by a total of ten points ; this provides the opportunity to improve their attributes . Attributes are more broad character qualities , such as " speed " and " endurance " , while skills are more specific , such as " armorer " or " athletics " . Afflictions such as disease and poison can reduce the player 's attributes . When players reach 25 , 50 , 75 , or 100 points in a single skill , they unlock new abilities related to the skill . 
 The game 's 21 skills fall evenly under the categories of combat , magic , and stealth , and many skills complement more than one area . Combat skills are used primarily for battle and incorporate armor and heavy weapons like blades , axes , maces , and hammers . Magic skills rely on the use of spells to alter the physical world , to affect the minds of others , to injure and debilitate enemies , to summon monsters to help fight , and to heal wounds . Stealth skills allow the player to crack locks , <unk> for goods , use speech to manipulate people , and apply cunning in combat ( through the use of a bow or with a sneak attack ) . The spells , weapons , and other tools such that a player needs to employ and enhance these skills , such as <unk> , can be purchased in shops , stolen from NPCs , or found as loot on the bodies of foes or in dungeons . 
 Oblivion can be played in either a first- or third @-@ person view , except in the mobile phone version , in which the game can only be played in isometric projection . The player may change the level of difficulty at any time , thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions . The screen constantly presents a heads @-@ up display , which provides information about the character 's health , <unk> , and fatigue , all of which can be increased by leveling up . 
 Health can be restored by spells , potions , or resting ; the loss of all health results in death . <unk> enables and is depleted by the use of spells ; it is rejuvenated naturally over time , but it can be restored similarly to health . Fatigue affects the character 's effectiveness in combat and general efficiency , and can be alleviated by resting , potions , and spells . 
 Throughout the world are a variety of enemies , including standard fantasy monsters such as imps and goblins , and animals such as bears and wolves . Enemies become stronger and weapons and armor more effective as the player levels up . This game mechanic of level @-@ scaling was incorporated to maintain a constant and moderate aspect of difficulty . However , level @-@ scaling combined with the leveling system has received criticism , as it has the potential to unbalance the game ; characters with major skills that increase on an involuntary basis , such as athletics or armor , can find that they level too quickly , making the enemies proportionately harder than intended . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Oblivion is set after the events of The Elder Scrolls III : Morrowind , though it is not a direct sequel to it or any other game . The game is set in Cyrodiil — a province of Tamriel , the continent on which all the games in the series have so far taken place . 
 The story begins with the player imprisoned in a cell for an unknown crime . Emperor Uriel Septim VII , accompanied by Imperial bodyguards known as " the Blades " , arrive in the prison , fleeing from assassins who have murdered the emperor 's three sons and are now targeting him . The emperor and the Blades reveal that the player 's jail cell contains a secret entrance to a part of the city 's sewer that functions as an escape route . Pardoned by the emperor , the player follows the group into the sewer , where they come under attack by assassins . All but one of the Blades are cut down in the fighting that ensues . Knowing he is destined to die by the hands of the assassins , Uriel Septim entrusts the player with the Amulet of Kings , worn by the Septim emperors of Tamriel , and orders the player to take it to a man named Jauffre , the grand master of the Blades , at Weynon Priory . Immediately afterward , one of the assassins kills the emperor . The player escapes the sewer and heads out into the open world of Cyrodiil . 
 The lack of an heir for Uriel Septim has broken an old covenant — the barrier to Oblivion : a dangerous realm that is in another dimension . Multiple gates to Oblivion open , and an invasion of Tamriel begins by magical creatures known as Daedra , killing and destroying anything in their path . Jauffre tells the player that the only way to close the gates permanently is to find someone of the royal bloodline to retake the throne and relight the <unk> — with the Amulet of Kings — in the Imperial City . Fortunately , there is an illegitimate son named Martin , who is a priest in the city of Kvatch . Upon arriving at Kvatch , the player finds that the Daedra have destroyed the city and very few survivors remain . A massive Oblivion Gate is obstructing the main city entrance , and the player must venture through the gate into the <unk> — one of the planes of Oblivion — in order to close it from the inside and allow access to the city . After closing the gate , the player enters Kvatch and takes it back from the Daedra with the assistance of surviving guardsmen . Fortunately , Martin has survived and the player persuades him to come to Weynon Priory . 
 The player , now recognized as the Hero of Kvatch , returns to Weynon Priory with Martin , finding that it has come under attack by assassins and that the Amulet of Kings has been stolen . The player escorts Jauffre and Martin to Cloud Ruler Temple , the stronghold of the Blades . There , Martin is recognized as the emperor and is given command of the Blades . The player is optionally entered into their ranks and sets off in search of the amulet . After gathering information , the player learns that the group responsible for Uriel Septim 's assassination and the theft of the amulet are the Mythic Dawn , a cult dedicated to the worshiping of Mehrunes Dagon , the Daedric Prince of Destruction . The cult believes Dagon is the true creator of the world and wish for him to " cleanse " it of all impurities . Killing the emperor and thus removing the barriers to Oblivion was the first step in realizing this idea . The player attempts to infiltrate the secret meeting place of the cult in the hopes of retrieving the amulet . When the player does so , the cult 's leader , Mankar Camoran , escapes through a portal , taking the amulet with him . The player takes the book that had opened the portal to Martin , who deduces a way to reopen the portal . The player seeks out three key artifacts necessary to recreate the portal : a Daedric artifact , the armor of the first Septim emperor , and a Great <unk> Stone . With all three retrieved , Martin reveals that a final ingredient is needed : a Great Sigil Stone from inside a Great Gate similar to the one that devastated Kvatch . Martin and Jauffre decide to allow the city of <unk> to be attacked by Daedra so that a Great Gate will be opened . Once it is , the player obtains the Stone and closes the Gate , also saving <unk> . 
 A portal is created at Cloud Ruler Temple and the player is sent through to Mankar Camoran 's created realm of Paradise . After bypassing Daedra , Mythic Dawn members and obstacles , the player confronts Camoran and kills him . The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin , and they subsequently travel to the Imperial City with the Blades to relight the <unk> and end the Daedric invasion . They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself . The player and Martin fight their way to the Temple of the One . There , Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon 's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way . He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings , merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh , the Dragon @-@ God of Time , thus becoming Akatosh 's avatar . After a battle , Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone . Martin , whose soul was consumed by the amulet , enters the afterlife to join his forbears . In a telepathic monologue to the player , he sheds an optimistic light , explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty , the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the players hands . The Empire 's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and elects them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil . 
 = = Development = = 
 The game was developed by the United States software company Bethesda Softworks . Ken Rolston , who was Morrowind 's lead designer , oversaw the development team . The PC and Xbox 360 versions of the game were co @-@ published by 2K Games and Bethesda . Work on Oblivion began shortly after the release of Morrowind in 2002 . By mid @-@ September 2004 , Oblivion had been officially announced , and its title revealed . 
 During Oblivion 's development , Bethesda concentrated on creating a system with more realistic storyline , believable characters , and meaningful quests than had been done in the past . In comparison with previous titles in the series , the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software , and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine . The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering ( HDR ) and specular mapping . Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivion 's terrain , leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles . 
 While designing Oblivion 's landscape and architecture , developers worked from personal travel photographs , nature books , texture images , and reference photographs . Procedural content generation tools used in production allowed for the creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with Morrowind . Erosion algorithms incorporated in the landscape generation tools allowed for the creation of craggy terrain quickly and easily , replacing Morrowind 's artificially smoothed @-@ over terrain . 
 Oblivion 's view distance is far greater than its predecessor 's , extending player sightlines to the horizon and giving views of distant towns and mountain ranges . According to a Microsoft press release , Oblivion 's game world is approximately 16 square miles ( 41 square kilometers ) in size . Wilderness quests , ruins , and dungeons were added to fill surplus space . Content in the dungeons is more densely packed than in dungeons in Morrowind , with an increase in the frequency of creature encounters , quest @-@ related NPCs , and puzzles . The populations represented in Oblivion , however , do not match the " thousands upon thousands " described in previous in @-@ game literature . The development team decided to set the NPC populations at a level that would play well , rather than one that would match game lore , since the presence of a large number of NPCs on screen would have caused the game to slow down . 
 In response to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind , Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion . NPCs were designed to make choices , rather than complete scripted routines , to achieve predetermined goals . The manner in which goals such as eating , sleeping , reading , and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment , the choices of other NPCs , and programmed personality values . For example , an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others , if they are given the opportunity and if it is in their character . These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 Oblivion features the voices of Patrick Stewart , Lynda Carter , Sean Bean , Terence Stamp , Ralph <unk> , and Wes Johnson , with celebrity acquisition and voice production being handled by <unk> . The voice acting received mixed reviews in the gaming press . While many publications praised it as excellent , others found fault with its repetitiveness . The issue has been blamed on the small number of voice actors and the blandness of the dialogue itself . Lead designer Ken Rolston found the plan to fully voice the game " less flexible , less apt for user projection of his own tone , more constrained for branching , and more trouble for production and disk real estate " than Morrowind 's partially recorded dialogue . Rolston tempered his criticism with the suggestion that voice acting " can be a powerful expressive tool " and can contribute significantly to the charm and ambience of the game . He stated " I prefer Morrowind 's partially recorded dialogue , for many reasons . But I 'm told that fully @-@ voiced dialogue is what the kids want " . 
 Oblivion 's score was composed by series mainstay Jeremy Soule , a video game composer whose past scores had earned him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts ( BAFTA ) award in the " Game Music Category " and two nominations for an Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences ( AIAS ) award for " Original Music Composition " . The official soundtrack to Oblivion , featuring 26 tracks spanning 58 minutes ; it was released in March 2006 , via Soule 's digital distributor DirectSong . Soule had worked with Bethesda and Todd Howard during the creation of Morrowind , and , in a press release announcing his return for Oblivion , Soule repeated the words he had said during Morrowind 's press release : " The stunning , epic quality of The Elder Scrolls series is particularly compatible with the grand , orchestral style of music I enjoy composing the most " . As in his compositions for Morrowind , Soule chose to create a soft and minimalist score so as not to wear out users ' ears . Soule stated that while composing the music he did not imagine any specific characters or events ; rather , he wanted it " to comment on the human condition and the beauty of life " . In a 2006 interview , he related that this desire came as a result of a car accident that occurred during his composition of the score . He said , " I ended up rolling in my car several times on an interstate while flying headlong into oncoming traffic ... I felt no fear ... I simply just acknowledged to myself that I 've had a good life and I would soon have to say goodbye to all of it in a matter of seconds " . Soule sustained only minor injuries , but commented that his feeling during the crash — " that life is indeed precious " — remained with him throughout the rest of the composition .

 Oblivion 's public debut occurred on May 18 , 2005 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) in Los Angeles . The version shown at E3 was substantially finished ; most content was already in the game , lacking only the polish that the final months of development would bring . Most viewers were impressed by Oblivion 's showing , and the game won a number of " best of " awards from a variety of game journalists : GameSpy 's " RPG Game of Show " , GameSpot 's " Best Role @-@ Playing Game " , IGN 's " Best PC RPG " , RPGFan 's " Overall Game of E3 2005 " , and , most <unk> , the " Best Role Playing Game " in the 2005 E3 Game Critics Awards . A near @-@ final build of Oblivion was shown at Microsoft 's Consumer Electronics Show press tent in January 2006 , showcasing the game 's exteriors . In the months prior to release , anticipation for the game ran high , with critics describing Oblivion as " the first next @-@ gen game " only heightening attention . " People were expecting the game to cure blindness and heal the sick , " said Pete Hines , Vice President of Public Relations and Marketing for Bethesda . 
 2K Games had aimed for a late 2005 publication so that the game could be an Xbox 360 launch title . The official release date for the PC and Xbox 360 versions was originally November 22 , 2005 , but developmental delays pushed it back to March 20 , 2006 . A mobile phone version of the game , developed by <unk> and published by <unk> Studios , was released on May 2 , 2006 . The PlayStation 3 version of the game ( ported by 4J Studios ) was released on March 20 , 2007 , in North America and on April 27 , 2007 , in Europe . This version includes graphical improvements that had been made since the PC and Xbox 360 release , and was subsequently praised for its enhanced visual appeal . 
 At the 2007 E3 , the Game of the Year edition for Oblivion was announced . In North America and Europe , the game was released in September 2007 , for the Xbox 360 and PC , and in October 2007 , for the PS3 ; in Australia , it was released on September 2007 , for the Xbox 360 and PC , and in December 2007 , for the PS3 .

 Starting in April 2006 , Bethesda released small packages of additional downloadable content ( DLC ) for the game from their website and over the Xbox Live Marketplace . The first update came as a set of specialized armor for Oblivion 's <unk> horses ; released on April 3 , 2006 . Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of micropayments for downloadable in @-@ game content , many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they had to pay for the relatively minor horse @-@ armor package on the Internet and elsewhere . Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not going to respond rashly to customer criticism . New releases continued into late 2006 , at lower prices with more substantial content , leading to a better reception in the gaming press . Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game 's factions , a new dungeon , and new spells that were absent in the initial release . Oblivion 's final content pack was released October 15 , 2007 . 
 The Elder Scrolls IV : Knights of the Nine is an official expansion for Oblivion released on November 21 , 2006 . Downloadable on the Xbox Live marketplace for the Xbox 360 and available for retail purchase for PC users , the expansion content was included in the original version of the PlayStation 3 release . The expansion was developed , published , and released by Bethesda Softworks . The plot of Knights of the Nine centers on the rise of the sorcerer @-@ king Umaril and the player 's quest to defeat him with the aid of the lost crusader 's relics . Although it made little change to the basic mechanics of Oblivion , it was judged by reviewers to be a brief but polished addition to the game 's main plot . 
 The Elder Scrolls IV : Shivering Isles , was released on March 27 , 2007 , for Windows and Xbox 360 . The expansion offers more than 30 hours of new adventuring , and features new quests , voice acting , monsters , spells , armor , and expanded freeform gameplay .

Shivering Isles takes place in the realm of madness ruled over by the Daedric prince Sheogorath . The player is tasked by Sheogorath with saving the realm from an approaching cataclysm known as the Greymarch .

 Oblivion received universal acclaim from critics , and became a commercial success . The game had shipped 1 @.@ 7 million copies by April 10 , 2006 , sold over 3 million copies by January 2007 , and over 3 @.@ 5 million by November 2011 . Electronic Entertainment Design and Research , a market research firm , estimates that the game has sold 9 @.@ 5 million copies worldwide . Reviewers praised the game for its impressive graphics , expansive game world and schedule @-@ driven NPCs . Eurogamer editor Kristan Reed stated that the game " successfully unites some of the best elements of RPG , adventure and action games and fuses them into a relentlessly immersive and intoxicating whole " . GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin wrote that compared to Morrowind , which was one of the best role @-@ playing games he has seen in years , " Oblivion is hands @-@ down better , so much so that even those who 'd normally have no interest in a role @-@ playing game should find it hard to resist getting swept up in this big , beautiful , meticulously crafted world " . X @-@ Play 's Jason D 'Aprile stated , " All the games in this series have been known for their sheer vastness and freedom of choice , but the Elder Scrolls IV takes that concept and runs with it " . 
 GamesTM editors noted that the game is " heavily steeped in RPG tradition , however , its appeal stretches far beyond the hardcore RPG demographic thanks to its ease of play , boundless ambition and focused attention to detail " . Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote that the game is " worth playing for the sense of discovery — each environment looks different from the last and requires a nuanced reaction — makes the action addictive . " GameZone staff commented on how one can spend a lot of the gameplay time by leveling up his or her character , doing various quests , and customizing the character before even starting the main quest . 
 Game Revolution 's Duke Ferris noted that " the voices occasionally repeat " but was impressed that the developers managed to fit a lot of voiced dialog into the game , where most is " high @-@ quality work " . IGN editor Charles Onyett praised the game 's storytelling and " easy to navigate menus " . 
 Despite the praise , Patrick Joynt of 1UP.com criticized the conversations between in @-@ game NPCs and the player : " When an NPC greets you with a custom piece of dialogue ( such as a guard 's warning ) and then reverts to the standard options ( like a guard 's cheerful directions just after that warning ) it 's more jarring than the canned dialogue by itself " . GameSpy 's Justin Speer criticized the " disruptive loading stutters while moving across the game world " and long loading times . Speer noted several miscellaneous bugs , such as unintended floating objects and unsynchronized lip @-@ synching and speech . Onyett of IGN criticized the disjunction between enemies that scaled up according to the player 's level and not their combat abilities or NPC allies , the loading times and the imprecision in the combat system , but stated that " none of those minor criticisms hold back Oblivion from being a thoroughly enjoyable , user @-@ friendly , gorgeous experience with enough content to keep you returning time and time again " . 
 Oblivion won a number of industry and publication awards . In 2006 , the game was awarded the title " Game of the Year " at the G @-@ Phoria Video Game Awards and at the Spike TV Video Game Awards . At the 24th annual Golden Joystick Awards , Oblivion was awarded " <unk> Ultimate Game of the Year " , " Xbox Game of the Year " , and " <unk> PC Game of the Year " . The game was titled the best role @-@ playing game of 2006 by 1UP.com , G4 , IGN , GameSpy , GameSpot , Game Revolution , and the Interactive Achievement Awards . In 2007 , PC Gamer magazine rated Oblivion number one on their list of the top 100 games of all time . In addition to the awards won by the game itself , Patrick Stewart 's voice work as Uriel Septim won a Spike TV award , and the musical score by composer Jeremy Soule won the inaugural MTV Video Music Award for " Best Original Score " through an international popular vote . 
 = = Rating change = = 
 On May 3 , 2006 , the Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) in North America changed Oblivion 's rating from T ( Teen 13 + ) to M ( Mature 17 + ) , citing game content not considered in the ESRB review , i.e. , " the presence in the PC version of the game of a locked @-@ out art file that , if accessed by using an apparently unauthorized third party tool , allows the user to play the game with topless versions of female characters " . In response to the new content , the ESRB conducted a review of Oblivion , showing to its reviewers the content originally submitted by Bethesda along with the newly disclosed content . 
 The ESRB reported that Bethesda Softworks would promptly notify all retailers of the change , issue stickers for retailers and distributors to affix on the product , display the new rating in all following product shipments and marketing , and create a downloadable patch rendering the topless skin inaccessible . Bethesda complied with the request but disagreed with the ESRB 's rationale . Some retailers began to check for ID before selling Oblivion as a result , and one California Assemblyman used the event to criticize the ESRB 's inefficiency .

 = = History = = 
 Though it is Sweden 's third most populous city , Malmö often missed the possibility to host larger concert and music events because it lacked a suitable indoor arena . When the City Tunnel project was initiated by Malmö Stad in the late 1990s , the city began to plan a new district in <unk> . This led to the decision to build Hyllie station in 2001 , as a part of the tunnel project , to boost the development of the new district . The ice hockey club Malmö Redhawks , which was the proposed main tenant of the new arena , was initially uncertain of the new project and wanted to renovate its present home , the Malmö Isstadion , instead of moving to an entirely new arena . However , the Redhawks were convinced when Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB contributed seven million kronor to help the club 's financial situation . 
 The decision to build an arena in the area was first presented by Nilsson in May 1997 , and developed further over the following decade . The permit to start building Malmö Arena was granted in September 2006 , and the first sod was turned on 10 January 2007 by Nilsson , hockey players Pekka <unk> , Juha <unk> , and Carl Söderberg , and two politicians from Malmö Stad . The main contractors for the building of the arena were Parkfast AB , with the collaboration of the structural engineer <unk> i Skåne . The arena was designed by Mats Matson of MM <unk> <unk> AB , Hannu <unk> of <unk> Architects , and Gert Wingårdh of Wingårdh arkitektkontor . The final construction cost for the arena was 750 million kronor – 100 million kronor over budget because of additions to the initial plan . The arena was entirely financed by Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB . Malmö Arena was inaugurated on 6 November 2008 with a large concert featuring a variety of artists , among them Robyn , Helen Sjöholm , Sanne Salomonsen , and Jill Johnson . 
 The name of the arena was discussed during 2007 , with Malmö Arena or Hyllie Arena discussed as potential options . The naming rights were eventually sold to Malmö Stad for 10 years in a deal worth 50 million kronor . Nilsson wished for the arena to have " Malmö " in its name because the city 's new association football stadium , Swedbank Stadion , did not .

 Malmö Arena was used for athletics in February 2009 , when the arena hosted " Malmö Indoor Gala " , a newly founded indoor athletics competition , organised by Malmö Allmänna <unk> ( MAI ) . Several international athletes were invited to compete , including pole vault Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva , but she turned down the invitation due to illness . Many other major athletes refused their invitations for a variety of reasons , causing the competition to attract only meagre interest from the public . No more than 7 @,@ 000 spectators attended , making the competition a financial failure . The competition was therefore not held again .

 = Alexis Bachelot = 
 Alexis Bachelot , <unk> , ( born Jean @-@ Augustin Bachelot ; February 22 , 1796 – December 5 , 1837 ) was a Roman Catholic priest best known for his tenure as the first Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands . In that role , he led the first permanent Catholic mission to the Kingdom of Hawaii . Bachelot was raised in France , where he attended the Irish College in Paris , and was ordained a priest in 1820 . He led the first Catholic mission to Hawaii , arriving in 1827 . Although he had expected the approval of then Hawaiian King Kamehameha II , he learned upon arrival that Kamehameha II had died and a new government that was hostile towards Catholic missionaries had been installed . Bachelot , however , was able to convert a small group of Hawaiians and quietly minister to them for four years before being deported in 1831 on the orders of Kaʻahumanu , the Kuhina Nui ( a position similar to queen regent ) of Hawaii . 
 Bachelot then traveled to California , where he served as an assistant minister while <unk> and teaching . In 1837 , having learned of Queen Kaʻahumanu 's death and King Kamehameha III 's willingness to allow Catholic priests on the island , Bachelot returned to Hawaii , intending to continue his missionary work . However , by Bachelot 's arrival , Kamehameha III had again changed his mind and Bachelot was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months . He was freed only after the French and British navies imposed a naval blockade on the Honolulu harbor . Although he was later able to secure passage on a ship to Micronesia , he died en route and was buried on an islet near Pohnpei . His treatment in Hawaii prompted the government of France to dispatch a frigate to the island ; the resulting intervention is known as the French Incident and led to the emancipation of Catholics in Hawaii . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bachelot was born in Saint @-@ Cyr @-@ la @-@ Rosière , Orne , France on February 22 , 1796 . In 1806 , he left home for Paris , where he enrolled in the Preparatory Seminary of Picpus to pursue priesthood . In 1813 , he professed at the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary , taking the name Alexis . He studied at the Irish College in Paris before being ordained as a priest in 1820 . As a priest , he initially served as the College 's rector and later led the preparatory seminary at Tours . 
 = = Hawaiian mission = = 
 In the early 1820s , Jean Baptiste Rives , a French adviser to the Hawaiian king Kamehameha II , traveled to Europe to attempt to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii . Members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary were receptive to his idea , and in 1825 , Pope Leo XII assigned them the task of evangelizing Hawaii . Bachelot was appointed the Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands , and in this role led the first permanent mission to Hawaii . 
 The expedition was organized by the influential <unk> family and funded by the government of France . Bachelot was assisted in his new position by fellow priests Patrick Short and Abraham Armand , as well as several lay brothers . The mission sailed from Bordeaux on La Comète in November 1826 . The missionaries were initially accompanied by a group that planned to explore commercial trading opportunities but returned to France after reaching Mexico . 
 Unbeknownst to Bachelot , political changes occurred in Hawaii prior to the mission 's arrival . King Kamehameha II died in 1824 and his younger brother Kamehameha III became king . Because Kamehameha III was young at the time of his ascension , Queen Kaʻahumanu ( their stepmother ) ruled as Kuhina Nui . On the advice of Hiram Bingham I — a Protestant missionary who had converted the Hawaiian royalty four years previously — Queen Kaʻahumanu took a hard stance against Catholicism . Rives ' influence on the Hawaiian government had faded , and he never returned to Hawaii . 
 La Comète arrived in Honolulu on July 7 , 1827 . The priests were faced with a situation of dire poverty owing to the absence of Rives ' patronage . Furthermore , they had promised La Comète 's captain that Rives would pay for their passage after they arrived in Hawaii , but by the time of their arrival , Rives had already left . Queen Kaʻahumanu refused to allow the missionaries to stay , suspecting them to be covert agents of the government of France . She instructed La Comète 's captain to take the mission with him when he departed . The captain , however , refused to do so because he did not receive payment for their passage , so the party was able to remain . 
 The priests began their missionary work , but encountered suspicion from most chiefs . The members of the party had great difficulty defending themselves , as none of them was fluent in English or Hawaiian . But , the group were favorably received by the high chief <unk> , the royal governor of Oahu , and his wife <unk> Liliha . ( The couple were Catholic converts and rivals of Queen Kaʻahumanu . ) <unk> welcomed the party and gave its members permission to stay . 
 For several months , Bachelot and his fellow missionaries lived in three small rented structures , saying their first mass on the island in a grass hut . They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased , where the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace was dedicated in 1843 . After settling on the island , the group avoided drawing attention to themselves and studied the Hawaiian language . During their mission 's first two years , the group converted 65 Hawaiians and ministered to Hawaiians who had already been converted . They often held surreptitious night @-@ time meetings with converts who feared persecution . The priests ' vestments and rituals made their evangelism efforts more effective because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs . 
 Bachelot introduced two plant species to Hawaii : Prosopis humilis and <unk> . Prosopis humilis trees later covered thousands of acres there . He had obtained the seeds , which were originally gathered by Catholic missionaries in California , from the Royal Conservatory in Paris . Bachelot translated a prayer book into Hawaiian ( O Ke A 'o Ana <unk> , " Christian Doctrine " , c . 1831 ) , authored a catechism in Hawaiian ( He <unk> Ho <unk> <unk> , " A Word of Instruction " , 1831 ) , and wrote an introduction to Hawaiian grammar in French ( Notes <unk> , " Grammatical Notes " , 1834 ) . 
 = = Persecution = = 
 By 1827 , Protestant Christianity , and in particular Bingham 's teachings , had become the de facto state religion of the Kingdom of Hawaii . Queen Kaʻahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832 , by , for example , forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize . In December 1831 , Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to leave on a ship , the Waverly , bound for North America . Though Queen Kaʻahumanu steadfastly opposed his work , Bachelot viewed her as a good person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries . 
 The news of Bachelot and Short 's expulsion caused controversy in the United States , where it was viewed as a violation of the rights appertaining to foreigners in the 1826 treaty signed by Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones of the United States Navy and King Kamehameha III . U.S. Navy Commodore John Downes protested the expulsions while in discussion with chiefs during his 1832 visit to the kingdom . 
 = = California = = 
 The Waverly landed at a vacant area near San Pedro , Los Angeles , in January 1832 . Bachelot and Short traveled to the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel , where they were welcomed by the Franciscans who staffed the mission . Bachelot later became the pastor of a church in Los Angeles , served as an assistant minister for the mission , and led the mission on an interim basis after its priest was reassigned in 1834 . He also taught in Los Angeles schools during a teacher shortage . He ministered in California until 1837 and became popular with <unk> . 
 In 1833 , the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith reorganized the jurisdiction of Oceania . Hawaii became part of the newly created Apostolic Vicariate of Eastern Oceania , which was split into northern and southern divisions . Bachelot remained as the Prefect Apostolic for the northern division . Etienne Jerome <unk> served as the Vicar Apostolic of Eastern Oceania and oversaw Bachelot 's assignment in Hawaii . 
 In 1835 and 1836 , two representatives of the Catholic Church traveled to Hawaii in an attempt to ascertain whether Bachelot could return . Queen Kaʻahumanu had died in 1832 , and the following year King Kamehameha III began making radical changes to Hawaiian law . Columban Murphy , a Catholic lay brother from the United Kingdom , visited King Kamehameha III in 1835 and discussed the possibility of Bachelot 's return . Finding King Kamehameha III amenable to the idea , Murphy traveled to California to relay the news . He was unable , however , to locate Bachelot , who was absent from the area at the time . After Bachelot received Murphy 's message , Bachelot and Short decided to return to Hawaii . The <unk> in Los Angeles , a municipal council , attempted to dissuade Bachelot and asked the Catholic leadership in Santa Barbara to prevent him from leaving , but he insisted on departing and the Catholic leadership did not prevent him . 
 = = Final years = = 
 When Bachelot and Short arrived in Honolulu in May 1837 , they spent only 13 days on the island . Notwithstanding the agreement he had signed with French Naval Captain Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars that allowed French citizens to live on the island , King Kamehameha III sought to deport the priests . Bachelot and Short were confined to the ship on which they had arrived , the Clémentine , on May 22 . However , the Clémentine 's captain , Jules Dudoit , refused to transport them from Hawaii . Dudoit , a British citizen of French descent , met with Charlton , the British consul , and they publicly protested the priests ' confinement . Their efforts to secure freedom for the priests to live on the island were unsuccessful until the British naval vessel HMS Sulphur and the French frigate the La Vénus arrived in Honolulu on July 8 . The ships were commanded respectively by Edward Belcher and Dupetit Thouars , who each tried to convince the authorities to allow the priests to return to the island . After negotiations proved futile , they blockaded the harbor , boarded the Clémentine , and brought Bachelot and Short ashore . The La Vénus sent 300 sailors to escort them from the harbor to the French mission . King Kamehameha III agreed to allow the priests to stay in Honolulu until they could find a ship to transport them elsewhere , under the condition that they refrain from proselytizing . 
 That year , Bachelot , who suffered from a form of rheumatism , became very sick . By November 1837 , he had recovered sufficiently to leave Hawaii . He purchased a ship and sailed toward Micronesia , intending to work on a mission . Bachelot 's health significantly worsened after leaving Hawaii and he died at sea on December 5 , 1837 . He was buried on an islet off the coast of Pohnpei . In 1838 , a small chapel was built near his grave . 
 Owing to the persecution of Bachelot and his fellow priests , the government of France sent the frigate L <unk> to Hawaii in 1839 . Its captain , Cyrille Pierre Théodore Laplace , had been instructed to force the government to stop persecuting Catholics . In response to this show of force , King Kamehameha III granted Catholics freedom of religion . 
 = English Benedictine Reform = 
 The English Benedictine Reform or Monastic Reform of the English church in the late tenth century was the most important religious and intellectual movement in the later Anglo @-@ Saxon period . In the mid @-@ tenth century almost all monasteries were staffed by secular clergy , who were often married . The reformers sought to replace them with celibate contemplative monks following the Rule of Saint Benedict . The movement was inspired by European monastic reforms , and the leading figures were Dunstan , Archbishop of Canterbury , Æthelwold , Bishop of Winchester , and Oswald , Archbishop of York . 
 In seventh and eighth century England , most monasteries were Benedictine , but in the ninth century learning and monasticism declined severely . Alfred the Great ( 871 – 99 ) deplored the decline and started to reverse it . The court of Æthelstan ( 924 – 39 ) , the first king of the whole of England , was cosmopolitan , and future reformers such as Dunstan and Æthelwold learned from Continental exponents of Benedictine monasticism . The English movement became dominant under King Edgar ( 959 – 75 ) , who supported the expulsion of secular clergy from monasteries and cathedral chapters , and their replacement by monks . The reformers had close relations with the crown , furthering its interests and depending on its support . The movement was confined to the south and midlands , as the crown was not strong enough in the north to confiscate property from local elites to establish Benedictine foundations in the area . The movement declined after the deaths of its leading exponents at the end of the tenth century . 
 The artistic workshops established by Æthelwold reached a high standard of craftsmanship in manuscript illustration , sculpture and gold and silver , and were influential both in England and on the Continent . In his monasteries , learning reached a high standard , producing competent prose and poetry in the elaborate hermeneutic style of Latin favoured in tenth @-@ century England . His Winchester school played an important role in creating the standard vernacular West Saxon literary language , and his pupil Ælfric was its most eminent writer . 
 All surviving medieval accounts of the movement are by supporters of reform , who strongly condemned what they saw as the corruption and religious inadequacy of the secular clergy , but historians in the late twentieth and early twenty @-@ first centuries have increasingly seen these accounts as unfairly biased against the secular clergy . 
 = = Background = = 
 The author of the Rule of Saint Benedict , which was the principal monastic code in Europe in the early Middle Ages , was Saint Benedict of Nursia ( c . 480 – 550 ) . Under this rule , the lives of the monks were mainly devoted to prayer , together with reading sacred texts and manual work . They lived a communal life and were required to give complete obedience to their abbot . Benedict 's achievement was to produce a stable system characterised by moderation and prudence . 
 The seventh century saw the development of a powerful monastic movement in England , which was strongly influenced by the ideas of St Benedict , and the late seventh @-@ century scholar English Aldhelm assumed that monasteries would normally follow the Benedictine rule . However , by 800 , few foundations could claim high spiritual and intellectual standards , and the ninth century saw a sharp decline in learning and monasticism . Political and financial pressures , partly due to disruption caused by Viking attacks , led to an increasing preference for pastoral clergy over contemplative monks . There was a progressive transfer of property from the minsters to the crown , which accelerated after 850 . According to John Blair : 
 To a significant extent , the royal administration had achieved territorial stability by <unk> onto minsters . Well might late tenth @-@ century polemicists blame kings of Wessex and their magnates , even more than the Vikings , for despoiling the Church 's resources . The scars of the Viking raids had healed , but the secularization of minsters continued on its slow , consistent course . 
 At the end of the ninth century , Alfred the Great started to revive learning and monasticism , and this work was carried on by his grandson , King Æthelstan ( 924 – 39 ) . Kings before Edgar ( 959 – 975 ) did not take the view , which was adopted by Æthelwold and his circle , that the only worthwhile religious life was Benedictine monasticism . When Gérard of <unk> reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin in Saint @-@ Omer in 944 , dissident monks found a refuge in England under King Edmund ( 939 – 46 ) . Before the tenth @-@ century reform , the lines between secular clergy and monastics were sometimes blurred . There are cases of communities of monks established to provide pastoral care , and clergy in some secular establishments lived according to monastic rules . 
 = = Early development = = 
 The Benedictine reform movement on the continent started with the foundation of Cluny Abbey in Burgundy in 909 @-@ 10 , but the influence of Cluny , which was innovative in its customs , was largely confined to Burgundy . England 's closest links were with the more conservative Fleury Abbey on the Loire , which had great prestige because it held Saint Benedict 's body . The leaders of the English movement were also influenced by the reforms which had been promulgated by the Carolingian Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious at the <unk> of Aachen in the 810s , and particularly their promulgation of uniform monastic rules under the authority of the crown . Modest religious and diplomatic contacts between England and the Continent under Alfred and his son Edward the Elder ( 899 – 924 ) intensified during the reign of Æthelstan , which saw the start of the monastic revival . Four of Æthelstan 's half @-@ sisters married European rulers , resulting in closer contacts between the English and Continental courts than ever before . Many manuscripts were imported , influencing English art and scholarship and art , and English churchmen learnt about the Continental Benedictine reform movement . 
 The leaders of the English Benedictine reform were Dunstan , Archbishop of Canterbury ( 959 – 88 ) , Æthelwold , Bishop of Winchester ( 963 – 84 ) , and Oswald , Archbishop of York ( 971 – 92 ) . Dunstan and Æthelwold reached maturity in Æthelstan 's cosmopolitan , intellectual court in the 930s , where they met monks from the European reformed houses which provided the inspiration for the English movement . In the early 940s Dunstan was appointed Abbot of Glastonbury , where he was joined by Æthelwold , and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury , which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform . The Rule of Saint Benedict was translated into Old English at this time , probably by Æthelwold , and it is the only surviving prose translation of the Rule into a European vernacular in the early Middle Ages . In about 954 Æthelwold wished to go to the Continent to study reforms there at first hand , but King Eadred ( 946 – 55 ) refused him permission and appointed him Abbot of Abingdon , which became the second centre . Dunstan was exiled by King Eadwig ( 955 – 59 ) between 956 and 958 , and he spent this time observing Benedictine practices at St Peter 's Abbey in Ghent . Æthelwold on the other hand appears to have been on good terms with Eadwig , an early indication that the reformers were not united politically . Oswald was a nephew of Oda , Archbishop of Canterbury from 941 to 958 . Oda , a supporter of reform , introduced Oswald to Fleury , where he was ordained and spent a large part of the 950s . 
 = = The reform and the crown = = 
 Rosamond <unk> observes that " the zeal for monastic reform undoubtedly was a common bond right across Europe " . On the other hand , relations between monasteries and their patrons varied . Where rulers were weak , as in Burgundy , Cluny looked to the papacy for protection , whereas in other areas such as Flanders , monasteries had close links with local rulers . In England there was a close dependence on the royal family and very little papal influence . The accession of Edgar , the first king to strongly support reform , in 959 , led to court support for the imposition of Benedictine rules on a number of old minsters with monks imported from houses such as Oswald 's Westbury on Trym , Dunstan 's Glastonbury and Æthelwold 's Abingdon . Hardly any of the reformed houses were new foundations , but a few nunneries , which had royal connections , were established in Wiltshire and Hampshire . 
 In 963 Edgar appointed Æthelwold as Bishop of Winchester , and with the support of the king and the pope the new bishop promptly expelled the secular clergy from the city 's Old and New <unk> , and replaced them with monks . The secular clerks and their supporters were local people of consequence , and the king had to resort to force to confiscate their wealthy benefices . By 975 around 30 male houses and 7 or 8 nunneries had been reformed , all in Wessex or places in the Midlands where Æthelwold and Oswald held property . But the reformed houses were then probably only around 10 per cent of the religious establishments . The wealthiest reformed monasteries were far richer than ordinary secular minsters , and the late @-@ eleventh century Domesday Book shows that some possessed almost as much land as the greatest lay magnates , but rich and important unreformed houses such as Chester @-@ le @-@ Street and Bury St Edmunds flourished into the eleventh century . The reformers ' propaganda , mainly from Æthelwold 's circle , claimed that the church was transformed in Edgar 's reign , but in Blair 's view the religious culture " when we probe beneath the surface , starts to look less exclusive and more like that of Æthelstan 's and Edmund 's " . 
 Edgar was concerned about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom , and wanted to impose uniform rules to be followed by all . The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform , the Regularis Concordia , which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970 . The Concordia was written by Æthelwold , who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys . A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services , and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice . 
 On the Continent there were different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule , but in England uniform practice was a matter of political principle . The Concordia said that King Edgar " urged all to be of one mind as regards monastic usage ... and so , with their minds anchored firmly on the ordinances of the Rule , to avoid all dissension , lest differing ways of observing the customs of one Rule and one country should bring their holy conversation into disrepute . " Fleury 's customs were the most important influence on the Regularis Concordia , and Fleury itself appears to have been influenced by English liturgical practices . 
 The conquest of the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time , enabling kings from Æthelstan onwards to see themselves as heirs of the Carolingian emperors ; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige . The monks depended on the king in a way that the local ealdormen did not , so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families . The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day , and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots . The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship , and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen ; Edgar 's last wife , Ælfthryth , was the first king 's consort to regularly witness charters as regina . 
 The reformers ' propaganda claimed that England had been unified as a result of the wide acceptance of <unk> , and that the movement 's greatest benefactor , King Edgar , had played a major role in the unification by his demands for adherence to the Benedictine Rule . Æthelwold probably tutored Edgar as a boy , and was very close to him ; it is likely that Æthelwold was influential in persuading the king to carry through his reforms and support Benedictine monasticism . Monks became dominant on the bishops ' bench during his reign . 
 Æthelwold was close to Queen Ælfthryth , and supported the claim of her son Æthelred ( 978 – 1016 ) to be king against his elder half @-@ brother , Edward ( 975 – 78 ) . Dunstan supported Edward , who succeeded on Edgar 's death in 975 . Æthelred became king on his half @-@ brother 's murder in 978 , and Æthelwold was then a powerful figure at court until his death in 984 . 
 = = The nobility and the reform = = 
 Nobles made donations to reformed foundations for religious reasons , and many believed that they could save their souls by patronising holy men who would pray for them , and thus help to expiate their sins . In some cases gifts were a payment for the right to be buried at a monastery . Some aristocrats founded new monasteries ; for example , Æthelwine , Ealdorman of East Anglia , founded Ramsey Abbey in 969 , gave it many gifts , and translated the relics of two martyred princes to it . Gifts were designed to increase the prestige of both the donor and recipient , as when Ealdorman Byrhtnoth of Essex , later to be the hero of the Battle of Maldon , gave Ely Abbey " thirty mancuses of gold , twenty pounds of silver , two gold crosses , two lace <unk> containing precious works of gold and gems , and two finely made gloves " . Upon his death his widow added a large hanging worked with images of his victories , apparently previously hanging at their house , and a gold torc . The 12th @-@ century local chronicle , the Liber Eliensis , records 14 churches which also received gifts from him . 
 Nobles ' choice of recipient was determined by their relationship with individual monks and other aristocrats . An individual would patronise the same foundations that other family members and allies supported , but despoil the property of houses associated with his political adversaries . Æthelwine of East Anglia and Ælfhere , Ealdorman of Mercia were the leaders of the two rival factions . Ælfhere seized land of Æthelwine 's Ramsey and was an enemy of Archbishop Oswald and an ally of Bishop Æthelwold . Æthelwine , a friend of Oswald , sometimes seized land belonging to Æthelwold 's Ely . Oswald himself used his position to assist his relatives , leasing Worcester lands to them in ways which had been forbidden by ninth @-@ century synods . The historian Janet Pope comments : " It appears that religion , even monasticism , could not break the tight kin group as the basic social structure in tenth @-@ century England . " 
 The three leaders of the movement were all aristocrats , and they were able to get the support of their family and friends as well as the King . In Pope 's view , " this close link between the monks and the nobles is ultimately the most important factor in the success of the reform " . Wormald agrees , stating that aristocratic support for monastic reform was more important for its success than royal or papal sponsorship . The aristocracy did not confine their support to reformed foundations , but continued to donate to unreformed ones . 
 = = Monks and clerics = = 
 Nicholas Brooks describes Dunstan as " the ablest and best loved figure that tenth @-@ century England produced " , and observes that his " example helped to inspire a massive transfer of landed resources from the secular aristocracy to the religious aristocracy ; it made possible a revival of scholarly , religious , pastoral and cultural standards in late tenth @-@ century England that gave a distinctively monastic character to the English church and hierarchy " . But Brooks admits that it is very difficult to point to any specific contribution that he made to the reform , and Robertson questions Dunstan 's importance : " At the present time it would be unwise to give a definitive answer to the question whether Dunstan 's role as the instigator of a monastic reform movement was a tenth @-@ century fact or a twelfth @-@ century fiction . " 
 Æthelwold reformed monasteries in his own diocese of Winchester , and he also helped to restore houses in eastern England , such as Peterborough , Ely , Thorney and St Neots . Almost all had been monasteries in the seventh century , and had later become communities of secular clerks or transferred to secular ownership , so he could argue that he was just restoring their original status . He also restored nunneries , working with his ally , Queen Ælfthryth . He did not merely attempt to revive the historical church , but also to improve it by inventing dubious pedigrees for his houses . He was the main propagandist for the movement , and wrote all the major works supporting it in England during Edgar 's reign . 
 Blair describes the basic aim of the movement , both in England and on the Continent , as being " to establish and disseminate high liturgical , spiritual and pastoral standards " . On the Continent , cathedral chapters were staffed by secular canons , and only monasteries had monks . Æthelwold rejected this distinction ; his expulsion of clerics in favour of monks from Winchester Cathedral ( the Old Minster ) as well as the New Minster introduced a unique feature to the English reform . Dunstan and Oswald hesitated to follow his example , probably because unlike Æthelwold they had lived abroad and understood continental practice , and also because they preferred a gradualist approach to Æthelwold 's confrontational strategy . Oswald installed monks at Worcester Cathedral , but he built a new church for them and retained the clerics , who were educated with the monks in the same classroom . Canterbury did not become fully monastic until after Dunstan 's death . Æthelwold was a historian who was reviving what he believed to be the practice of the past , particularly Pope Gregory the Great 's injunction to Augustine in the Libellus <unk> , as reported by Bede , that Augustine should continue as a bishop to live the life of a monk . Blair argues that large religious institutions could not function without priests carrying out parochial duties , and he comments that " Æthelwold 's rejection of all forms of religious life but the monastic was decidedly odd . The lurid <unk> of clerics as foul , lazy , and lascivious come mainly from his circle . " Although the Rule of Saint Benedict barred monks from engaging in external ministry , English Benedictines were actively engaged in pastoral work and teaching the secular clergy . 
 Dunstan 's first biographer , called " B " , was a secular cleric who left Glastonbury for Liège in around 960 . After 980 he made several attempts to gain the patronage of leading English churchmen , but they were unsuccessful because monastic reformers were unwilling to assist a secular canon living abroad . The secular priests lacked able scholars to defend themselves , and no defence against Æthelwold 's charges has survived . The leading twelfth @-@ century historians , John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury , were Benedictines who reinforced the seculars ' negative image . The diverse minsters and religious practices of Anglo @-@ Saxon England were disguised by a small group which obtained a near monopoly of the religious record and presented an unreal picture of religious uniformity . 
 = = Saints and relics = = 
 Reformers attached great importance to the elevation and translation of saints , moving their bodies from their initial resting place to a higher and more prominent location to make them more accessible for veneration . An important precursor was the seventh @-@ century translation of the remains of St Benedict himself from Monte Cassino to Fleury Abbey . By the tenth century , translation usually involved a grand procession , an elaborate new shrine and often reconstruction of the church . Almost nothing is known of the life of Swithun , who was an obscure ninth @-@ century Bishop of Winchester until Æthelwold launched a major cult of him as a saint , and translated his grave from outside the Old Minster to a new shrine inside . After Æthelwold 's own death in 984 his progress to becoming the subject of a cult followed the conventional path : his grave is said to have been neglected until he appeared in a vision to say that his body should be moved , and his successor Ælfheah then built a new choir to hold his body , where it became the focus of miracles . 
 Saints were believed to have an active power after death , and the reformers made great efforts to transfer saints ' remains and relics from obscure minsters to their own new establishments . Characteristically , Æthelwold showed great energy in this . Gifts of land and other possessions to a church were often expressed as donations to its principal saint , so the seizure of such a saint 's remains from an unreformed community could then justify the transfer of its wealth to a Benedictine monastery , on the ground that as property had been donated to the saint , it should follow his or her body to its new home . The reformers had what Alan Thacker calls a " mania for saint @-@ making and relic collecting " . Theft of relics from unreformed communities to increase a church 's collection was common , such as Ely Abbey 's " relic raid " on Dereham in 974 to obtain the remains of Saint <unk> . This was probably associated with the acquisition by Ely of Dereham church , and may have been a means of ensuring that the abbey kept possession of the church 's estates . According to Thacker , Æthelwold 's activities were " on an unrivalled scale " : 
 Not all , one suspects , were yielded willingly to Æthelwold 's grasping representatives ... Æthelwold obviously wanted his monasteries to be centres of spiritual power , an aim he sought to fulfil by making them the home of as many saints as possible . Undoubtedly too he was anxious to remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment . But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession , focused on the saint 's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community . 
 On the other hand , although Oswald was active in promoting cults , he does not generally seem to have used relic collecting as a means of gaining control of the assets of secular communities , and Dunstan displayed no interest in relics . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the death of King Edgar in 975 , aristocrats who had lost land and family religious houses to the reformed monasteries took advantage of the disputed succession between Edgar 's sons to seize back their property . Ælfhere of Mercia took the lead in the " anti @-@ monastic reaction " , against defenders of the reformed houses such as Æthelwine of East Anglia , and Byrhtnoth , later to be the hero of The Battle of Maldon . According to Byrhtferth of Ramsey Abbey , " monks were smitten with fear , the people trembled ; and clerics were filled with joy , for their time had come . Abbots were expelled with their monks , clerics were installed with their wives , and the error was worse than before . " 
 Ann Williams argues that a long @-@ standing rivalry between Ælfhere and Æthelwine was an important factor in the disturbances which followed Edgar 's death . She comments : 
 There is no reason to regard [ Ælfhere ] as particularly ' anti @-@ monastic ' . The attitudes of all parties towards the reform movement were as much political as religious . Æthelwine was no ' friend of God ' so far as Ely was concerned , and it has been suggested that only his friendship with Oswald prevented him from being accused of ' anti @-@ monastic ' activities himself . All the lay noblemen of the time had cause for alarm at the great increase in wealth and power enjoyed by the reformed monasteries in the 960s and 970s and the sometimes dubious means they employed to acquire land . 
 The " anti @-@ monastic reaction " was short @-@ lived , but the reformed monasteries went into a long term decline , and they were hard hit by the renewal of Viking attacks and high taxation from the 980s . Blair comments : " For all their great and continuing achievements , the reformed houses after the 970s lived more on inherited capital than on dynamic growth . " No spiritual leaders of the church emerged in the eleventh century comparable with the three main figures of the monastic reform , and the position of monks in English religious and political life declined . There were very few important new foundations , the main exception being Bury St Edmunds , where a Benedictine community replaced a clerical one early in the century . There were also a few more monasteries founded by lay nobility , the last being Coventry Abbey in 1045 , founded by Leofric , Earl of Mercia and his wife <unk> . Monks lost their near monopoly on bishoprics , partly because Edward the Confessor , who spent his early life abroad , preferred foreign clerics in his episcopal appointments , but mainly because the development of royal government required a permanent staff , and this was supplied by secular royal priests , who would be rewarded by nomination to bishoprics . The influence of the centralising Regularis Concordia declined following the deaths of the founders of the movement , and there was increasing localism in the eleventh century , with few links between monasteries . 
 The enthusiasm for relics continued , and foundations ' prestige was greatly increased by success in obtaining the remains of important saints . The period between the Benedictine Reform and the Norman Conquest saw the most lavish donations of land to monasteries of any period in medieval England , and the leading reformed foundations became immensely wealthy , retaining their status after the Conquest . Monasteries founded in the Anglo @-@ Saxon period enjoyed greater prosperity and prestige than post @-@ Conquest establishments . 
 = = Importance of the reform movement = = 
 Simon Keynes describes the Benedictine reform as " the particular aspect of [ Edgar 's ] reign which has come to dominate all others " . Keynes says : 
 The principal motivation or driving force behind the re @-@ establishment of religious houses in the kingdom of the English , living in strict accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict , was a desire to restore to their former glory some of the ancient houses known from the pages of Bede 's Ecclesiastical History of the English People , from other literary works , from historical traditions of the later eighth and ninth centuries , or indeed from the physical remains of buildings ... Modern historians will recognise how much was owed to the monastic reform movements on the continent , and will find extra dimensions , such as a wish to extend royal influence into areas where a king of the West Saxons might not expect his writ to run , or a more general wish to revive a sense of ' Englishness ' , through raising awareness of the tradition of the past . 
 Antonia Gransden sees some continuity of the Anglo @-@ Saxon monastic tradition from its origin in seventh @-@ century Northumbria , and argues that historians have exaggerated both the importance of the tenth @-@ century reform and its debt to continental models . The Anglo @-@ Saxons shared the general medieval tendency to revere the past , and monks in the later Anglo @-@ Saxon period saw the age of Bede as laying the foundations of their own observance and organisation . Nicola Robertson says that : " the evidence for the existence of a unified reform movement is , in my opinion , very fragile " . 
 Martin Ryan is also sceptical , pointing out that there is very little evidence of reforming activity in northern England , even though Oswald was Archbishop of York . This may reflect the reformers ' dependence on royal support ; they needed Edgar 's backing to expel secular clergy , and his power was too tenuous in the north to allow this . The most northerly Benedictine abbey was Burton upon Trent . Ryan comments : 
 Yet if the Benedictine reforms dominate the sources from this period , their wider impact should not be overstressed : large areas of England were affected only minimally , if at all . It was the emergence of small local churches and the development of new systems of pastoral care – processes only imperfectly documented – that would have the more enduring impact and more thoroughgoing effect on religious life in England . 
 Julia Barrow agrees , arguing that the establishment of the Benedictine monasteries was " not necessarily the most important development within the English church of the time " ; far more significant numerically was the growth in parish churches . 
 In the view of Catherine Cubitt , the reform " has rightly been regarded as one of the most significant episodes in Anglo @-@ Saxon history " , which " transformed English religious life , regenerated artistic and intellectual activities and forged a new relationship between church and king " . The prosperity of later Anglo @-@ Saxon England was important to its success , and it was underpinned by trade and diplomacy with continental Europe as well as by religious needs . She acknowledges the reform 's limited geographical impact : 
 But reform brought with it new ways of thinking about the church and its personnel , derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance . This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres , the distinction between monks and clergy , and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders . Ultimately , these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church , such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Helmut <unk> observes that although the reformed monasteries were confined to the south and midlands , " here a new golden age of monastic life in England dawned and brought in its train a renaissance of culture , literature and art " . In the view of Mechthild Gretsch : " No school in Anglo @-@ Saxon England has been praised more warmly by its pupils than the school established by Æthelwold at the Old Minster " . He established high standards of learning , with skilled exponents of the elaborate and obscure hermeneutic style of Latin which was the house style of the Benedictine Reform . He sent monks to Fleury and Corbie Abbeys to learn about liturgical chant , and surviving Winchester <unk> ( books of liturgical music ) include music by Continental and English composers , many written in hermeneutic Latin . 
 Visual art combined new influences from continental monastic styles with development of earlier English features , and is often described as the " Winchester style " or " school " although this was only one of the centres involved . Although the foundation of new communities reduced in the early 11th century , art continued to flourish as the existing monasteries grew richer . The Benedictional of St. Æthelwold ( Winchester , probably 970s , now British Library ) is recognised as the most important of a group of surviving illuminated manuscripts , lavishly illustrated with extravagant acanthus leaf borders . According to the dedicatory poem , Æthelwold " commanded ... many frames well adorned and filled with various figures decorated with numerous beautiful colours and with gold " , and he got what he asked for . It is described by Andrew Prescott as the " outstanding work of art to have survived from this period " . According to Barbara Yorke , " The artistic workshops established at Æthelwold 's foundations during his lifetime were to continue as influential schools of craftsmen after his death , and had a widespread influence both in England and on the Continent . " 
 As well as lavish illumination , the period saw the development of a distinct English tradition of line drawing in manuscripts , sometimes with the addition of light colour in ink or wash ( watercolour ) , often to reinforce ink in highlighting outlines . This is often divided into two rather different sub @-@ styles . These also developed from continental styles , and one , sometimes called the " Utrecht style " was influenced strongly by the presence in Canterbury from around 1000 of the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter , where each psalm is illustrated with a panoramic ink drawing full of tiny figures . The Harley Psalter from Canterbury ( probably 1020s ) is a copy , with differences in style such as the addition of coloured washes . Dunstan was himself an artist , as were many monks who rose to senior positions , and the earliest datable outline drawing is probably by him , and includes a portrait of him prostrating himself before Christ . This was added to a blank page in an older book , probably before his exile in 956 . The other " Winchester " style of drawing can be characterised by detailed and agitated drapery , an effect sometimes taken to excess , but giving animation to figures . The skilled use of line drawing continued to be a feature of English art for centuries , for example in the Eadwine Psalter ( Canterbury , probably 1150s ) and the work of Matthew Paris , monk of St Albans ( c . 1200 – 1259 ) and his followers . 
 The very few remains of monastic architecture in the period are supplemented by brief documentary mentions . St Laurence 's Church , Bradford @-@ on @-@ Avon appears to represent a unique near @-@ complete monastic church of the period , and the angels in relief were probably part of a large rood cross group . Generally the contemporary sources give much more detail on the valuable treasures in precious metal , rich embroidered cloth , and other materials , which the monasteries were able to accumulate , largely from gifts by the elite . The few pieces to survive mostly did so outside England , and include the silver Brussels Cross and a walrus ivory figure from a Crucifixion . 
 Susan Irvine describes five historical watersheds in the development of the Old English language , the fourth of which is the Benedictine Reform , which " led indirectly to the establishment of an Old English ' literary language ' " . In the late ninth century King Alfred had carried through a programme of translating Latin texts into the vernacular , and almost a century later the monastic reformers revived the project of producing texts in English for teaching . Æthelwold 's school at Winchester aimed to establish a standard West Saxon literary language , a programme probably initiated by Æthelwold himself . His most illustrious pupil , Ælfric ( <unk> – <unk> ) , who became abbot of Eynsham , aimed to write in accordance with a consistent grammatical system and vocabulary . 
 Ælfric , who was described by Claudio Leonardi as " the highest pinnacle of Benedictine reform and Anglo @-@ Saxon literature " , shared in the movement 's monastic ideals and devotion to learning , as well as its close relations with leading lay people . His works included two series of forty homilies , lives of saints , a Latin grammar in English , and a discussion of trades and occupations . He was an adviser of the king , and an authority on church practice and canon law . Matthew Parker , Queen Elizabeth I 's first Archbishop of Canterbury , cited him in support of Protestant doctrines , and his discussion of Eucharistic theory was cited in theological controversies until the nineteenth century . 
 The reformers were mainly interested in prose rather than poetry , but the bulk of Old English poetry survives in manuscripts of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries , of which the most important are the Beowulf manuscript , Exeter Book , Vercelli Book , and the Junius or Cædmon manuscript . Although the dates of composition of most of this poetry remain uncertain , much of it is probably considerably older than the manuscripts . This is probably because of the interest in vernacular works fostered by the Benedictines . Most surviving vernacular literature was produced by followers of the Benedictine reformers , and written in the standard Old English they championed . Walter <unk> observes : 
 Being a political , religious and cultural centre of unique prestige and influence , Winchester , through the conscious efforts of its monastic school to standardize language , must also have become a factor of prime importance in the evolution of the literary standard in use throughout England in the late Old English period . 
 The Continental leaders of the church immediately after 1066 justified the Conquest by denigrating the pre @-@ Conquest state of the Anglo @-@ Saxon church . Newcomers such as Lanfranc , who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070 , had no interest in saints venerated by the Anglo @-@ Saxons , and his <unk> for Christ Church , Canterbury , show no debt to the Regularis Concordia . However , Anglo @-@ Norman monks soon turned the Anglo @-@ Saxon hagiographical tradition to their own uses , and saints venerated by the Anglo @-@ Saxons regained respect . Monasteries ' land and privileges were defended by appealing to pre @-@ Conquest charters , and fabricating fraudulent ones if necessary . In the next generation two historians of mixed parentage , Eadmer and William of Malmesbury , saw a pattern of an early Northumbrian peak followed by decline until a revival in the tenth century , and a further decline which reached its nadir on the eve of the Conquest . This scheme , which saw both the tenth century and the post @-@ Conquest as peaks of monastic excellence preceded by periods of decline , satisfied both Norman propaganda and Anglo @-@ Saxon pride , but in Gransden 's view it unfairly denigrates the achievements of the periods of so @-@ called decline . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 Before the twenty @-@ first century , the Benedictine reform dominated history textbooks of the period , and the earlier tenth century and later eleventh received far less attention . According to Wormald : " For English historians , the tenth century is above all one of " Reformation " , the enforcement of Benedictine observance upon the religious life " . The main sources for the reform are the lives of Dunstan , Oswald and Æthelwold , and this creates the risk of exaggerating the role of these three men at the expense of the many lesser @-@ known men who contributed to the process , and on concentrating on reformed communities at the expense of less rigorous and secular ones . The picture drawn of the reform by Æthelwold and his circle has been dominant , and historians have generally portrayed it favourably . In 2005 John Blair commented : " Ecclesiastical historians ' distaste for the lifestyle of secular ministers , which has become less explicit but can even now seem virtually instinctive , reflects contemporary partisanship absorbed into a historiographical tradition which has privileged the centre over the localities , and the ideals of the reformers over the realities and needs of grass @-@ roots religious life . " In the twenty @-@ first century , historians have been far more sceptical of the reformers ' claims , and defended the contribution of the clerics and local churches . 
 Modern historians see clerical institutions in the mid @-@ tenth century such as Winchester and Canterbury as flourishing centres of activity in religion , literature and the arts . In Keynes 's view : " there had been a steady development throughout the first half of the tenth century , so that when the reform movement gathered momentum , from about 960 onwards , the reformers were able to draw on the traditions and resources of an already flourishing church . " The historian Marco Mostert comments : " one has the impression that the life of letters flourished in the unreformed monasteries in ways not dissimilar to that in the Benedictines ' monasteries . The monastic reform movement took pride in much that was already in existence . " 
 = Goldfinger ( novel ) = 
 Goldfinger is the seventh novel in Ian Fleming 's James Bond series , first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 23 March 1959 . Goldfinger originally bore the title The Richest Man in the World and was written in January and February 1958 . The story centres on the investigation by MI6 operative James Bond into the gold smuggling activities of Auric Goldfinger , who is also suspected by MI6 of being connected to SMERSH , the Soviet counter @-@ intelligence organisation . As well as establishing the background to the smuggling operation , Bond uncovers a much larger plot , with Goldfinger planning to steal the gold reserves of the United States from Fort Knox . 
 Fleming developed the James Bond character more in Goldfinger than in the previous six novels , presenting him as a more complex individual , whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George . The Saint George theme is echoed by the fact that it is a British agent sorting out an American problem . 
 In common with Fleming 's other Bond stories , he used the names of people he knew , or knew of , throughout his story , including the book 's eponymous villain , who was named after British architect Ernő Goldfinger . Upon learning of the use of his name , Goldfinger threatened to sue over the use of the name , before the matter was settled out of court . Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard , Jr . Fleming also used a number of his own experiences within the book , and the round of golf played with Goldfinger was based upon a tournament in 1957 at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson . 
 Upon its release , Goldfinger went to the top of the best @-@ seller lists ; the novel was broadly well received by the critics , being favourably compared to contemporary version of both Sapper and John Buchan . Goldfinger was serialised as a daily story and as a comic strip in the Daily Express newspaper , before being the third James Bond feature film of the Eon Productions series , released in 1964 and starring Sean Connery as Bond . Most recently , Goldfinger was adapted for BBC Radio with Toby Stephens as Bond and Sir Ian McKellen as Goldfinger . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Fleming structured the novel in three sections — " <unk> " , " Coincidence " and " Enemy action " — which was how Goldfinger described Bond 's three seemingly coincidental meetings with him . 
 <unk> 
 Whilst changing planes in Miami after closing down a Mexican heroin smuggling operation , British Secret Service operative James Bond is asked by Junius Du Pont , a rich American businessman ( whom he briefly met and gambled with in Casino Royale ) , to watch Auric Goldfinger , with whom Du Pont is playing <unk> in order to discover if he is cheating . Bond quickly realises that Goldfinger is indeed cheating with the aid of his female assistant , Jill Masterton , who is spying on DuPont 's cards . Bond blackmails Goldfinger into admitting it and paying back DuPont 's lost money ; he also has a brief affair with Masterton . Back in London , Bond 's superior , M , tasks him with determining how Goldfinger is smuggling gold out of the country : M also suspects Goldfinger of being connected to SMERSH and financing their western networks with his gold . Bond visits the Bank of England for a briefing with Colonel Smithers on the methods of gold smuggling . 
 Coincidence 
 Bond contrives to meet and have a round of golf with Goldfinger ; Goldfinger attempts to win the golf match by cheating , but Bond turns the tables on him , beating him in the process . He is subsequently invited back to Goldfinger 's mansion near Reculver where he narrowly escapes being caught on camera looking over the house . Goldfinger introduces Bond to his factotum , a Korean named Oddjob . 
 Issued by MI6 with an Aston Martin DB Mark III , Bond trails Goldfinger as he takes his vintage Rolls @-@ Royce Silver Ghost ( adapted with armour plating and armour @-@ plated glass ) via air ferry to Switzerland , driven by Oddjob . Bond manages to trace Goldfinger to a warehouse in Geneva where he finds that the armour of Goldfinger 's car is actually white @-@ gold , cast into panels at his Kent refinery . When the car reaches Goldfinger 's factory in Switzerland ( Enterprises Auric AG ) , he recasts the gold from the armour panels into aircraft seats and fits them to the Mecca Charter Airline , in which he holds a large stake . The gold is finally sold in India at a vast profit . Bond foils an assassination attempt on Goldfinger by Jill Masterton 's sister , Tilly , to avenge Jill 's death at Goldfinger 's hands : he had painted her body with gold paint , which killed her . Bond and Tilly attempt to escape when the alarm is raised , but are captured . 
 Enemy action 
 Bond is tortured by Oddjob when he refuses to confess his role in trailing Goldfinger . In a desperate attempt to survive being cut in two by a circular saw , Bond offers to work for Goldfinger , a ruse that Goldfinger initially refuses , but then accepts . Bond and Tilly are subsequently taken to Goldfinger 's operational headquarters in a warehouse in New York City . They are put to work as secretaries for a meeting between Goldfinger and several gangsters ( including the Spangled Mob and the Mafia ) , who have been recruited to assist in " Operation Grand Slam " – the stealing of the United States gold reserves from Fort Knox . One of the gang leaders , Helmut Springer , refuses to join the operation and is killed by Oddjob . Learning that the operation includes the killing of the inhabitants of Fort Knox by introducing poison into the water supply , Bond manages to conceal a capsule containing a message into the toilet of Goldfinger 's private plane , where he hopes it will be found and sent to Pinkertons , where his friend and ex @-@ counterpart Felix Leiter now works . 
 Operation Grand Slam commences , and it turns out that Leiter has indeed found and acted on Bond 's message . A battle commences , but Goldfinger escapes . Tilly , a lesbian , hopes that one of the gang leaders , Pussy Galore ( leader of a gang of lesbian burglars ) , will protect her , but she is killed by Oddjob . Goldfinger , Oddjob and the mafia bosses all escape in the melee . Bond is drugged before his flight back to England and wakes to find he has been captured by Goldfinger , who has managed to hijack a BOAC jetliner . Bond manages to break a window , causing a depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane ; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger . At gunpoint , he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast , where they are rescued by a nearby <unk> . 
 = = Characters and themes = = 
 The character of Bond was developed more than in the previous novels ; academic Jeremy Black considers that , in Goldfinger , Bond " was presented as a complex character " . Continuation author Raymond Benson agrees , and sees Goldfinger as a transitional novel , with Bond becoming more human than in previous books and more concerned with what Benson calls " the mortal trappings of life " , which manifest itself with the opening chapter of the book as Bond sits in Miami airport and thinks through his fight with and killing of a Mexican thug . Benson also sees that Bond has developed something of a sense of humour in Goldfinger , verbally abusing Oddjob , to Bond 's own amusement . 
 Auric Goldfinger was described by Raymond Benson as " Fleming 's most successful villain to date " and Fleming gives him a number of character flaws that are brought out across the novel . Psychologically Goldfinger is warped , possibly because of an inferiority complex brought on by his shortness , in contrast to a number of Fleming 's other oversized villains and physically he is odd , with a lack of proportion to his body . As with a number of other villains in the Bond novels , there is an echo of World War II , with Goldfinger employing members of the German Luftwaffe , some Japanese and Koreans . For Operation Grand Slam , Goldfinger used the poison GB , now known as Sarin , which had been discovered by the Nazis . Goldfinger has an obsession with gold to the extent that academic Elizabeth Ladenson says that he is " a walking tautology " . Ladenson lists both his family name and his first name as being related to gold ( " Auric " is an adjective pertaining to gold ) ; his clothes , hair , car and cat are all gold coloured , or a variant thereof ; his Korean servants are referred to by Bond as being " yellow " , or yellow @-@ faced " ; and he paints his women ( normally prostitutes ) gold before sex . 
 Elizabeth Ladenson thought the character of Pussy Galore to be " perhaps the most memorable figure in the Bond periphery . " Galore was introduced by Fleming in order for Bond to seduce her , thereby proving Bond 's masculinity of being able to seduce a lesbian . To some extent the situation also reflected Fleming 's own opinions , expressed in the novel as part of Bond 's thoughts , where " her sexual confusion is attributable to women 's suffrage " ; in addition , as Fleming himself put it in the book : " Bond felt the sexual challenge all beautiful Lesbians have for men . " Ladenson points out that , unlike some Bond girls , Galore 's role in the plot is crucial and she is not just there as an accessory : it is her change of heart that allows good to triumph over evil . In doing so , " Goldfinger himself ... is a mere obstacle , the dragon to be got rid of before the worthy knight can make off with the duly conquered lady . " 
 As with Ladenson 's observation that Bond was being depicted as " the worthy knight " , Raymond Benson also identifies the Saint George theme in Goldfinger , which he says has run in all the novels , but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond 's thoughts after Goldfinger reveals he will use an atomic device to open the vault : " Bond sighed wearily . Once more into the breach , dear friend ! This time it really was St George and the dragon . And St. George had better get a move on and do something " . Jeremy Black notes that the image of the " latter @-@ day St. George [ is ] again an English , rather than British image . " 
 As with other Bond novels , such as Casino Royale , gambling is a theme , with not only golf as part of the novel , but opening with the <unk> game as well . Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond 's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry . Once more ( as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No ) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming 's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond 's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English . 
 = = Background = = 
 Goldfinger was written in Jamaica at Fleming 's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had produced to that time . He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World . Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger 's first encounter . Similarly , the depressurisation of Goldfinger 's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere , but which found its way into Goldfinger . Some years previously a plane had <unk> over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window and Fleming , who was not a comfortable airline passenger , had made note of the incident to use it . 
 As usual in the Bond novels , a number of Fleming 's friends or associates had their names used in the novel ; the Masterton sisters having their names taken from Sir John Masterman , an MI5 agent and Oxford academic who ran the double cross system during World War II ; Alfred Whiting , the golf professional at Royal St George 's Golf Club , Sandwich , becoming Alfred <unk> ; whilst the Royal St George 's Golf Club itself became the Royal St Mark 's , for the game between Bond and Goldfinger . In the summer of 1957 Fleming had played in the <unk> Pro @-@ Am golf tournament at the Berkshire Golf Club , where he partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson : much of the background went into the match between Bond and Goldfinger . One of Fleming 's neighbours in Jamaica , and later his lover , was Blanche Blackwell , mother of Chris Blackwell of Island Records ; Fleming used Blanche as the model for Pussy Galore , although the name " Pussy " came from Mrs " Pussy " Deakin , formerly Livia Stela , an SOE agent and friend of his wife 's . 
 Fleming 's golf partner , John Blackwell , ( a cousin to Blanche Blackwell ) was also a cousin by marriage to Ernő Goldfinger and disliked him : it was Blackwell who reminded Fleming of the name . Fleming also disliked what Goldfinger was doing destroying Victorian buildings , replacing them with the architect 's modernist designs , particularly a terrace at Goldfinger 's own residence at 2 Willow Road . Goldfinger threatened to sue Fleming over the use of the name and , in retaliation , Fleming threatened to add an erratum slip to the book changing the name from Goldfinger to <unk> and explaining why ; the matter was settled out of court after the publishers , Jonathan Cape , agreed to ensure the name Auric was always used in conjunction with Goldfinger . Fleming 's golfing friend John Blackwell then became the heroin smuggler at the beginning of the book , with a sister who was a heroin addict . 
 There were some similarities between Ernő and Auric : both were Jewish immigrants who came to Britain from Eastern Europe in the 1930s and both were Marxists , although they were physically very different . The likely model for Goldfinger was American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard , Jr . , who Fleming had met in 1949 . <unk> had established a company , the Precious Metals Development Company , which circumvented numerous export restrictions , selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong . Fleming had reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths , one of the Livery Companies of the City of London with a list of queries about gold , its properties and the background of the industry , including smuggling . Fleming himself liked gold enough to commission a gold @-@ plated typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company , although he never actually used it . In 1995 , this machine was purchased by the Bond actor , Pierce Brosnan .

 Goldfinger was published on 23 March 1959 in the UK as a hardcover edition by publishers Jonathan Cape ; it was 318 pages long and cost fifteen shillings . Richard Chopping again provided the cover art for the first edition : a skull with gold coins for the eyes and a rose in its mouth . The book was dedicated to " gentle reader , William Plomer " , the editor of a number of the Fleming novels . Fleming took part in a select number of promotional activities , including appearing on the television programme The Bookman and attending a book signing at Harrods . The novel went straight to the top of the best @-@ seller lists . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Goldfinger received more positive reviews than Fleming 's previous novel , Dr. No , which had faced widespread criticism in the British media . Writing in The Observer , Maurice Richardson thought that " Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only in the direction of an atomic , sophisticated Sapper . " Even when leaving reality behind , however , Richardson considers that Fleming , " even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek , ... remains maniacally readable " . Richardson picked up on two areas relating to the characters of the book , saying that Goldfinger " is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming 's museum of super fiends " , whilst , referring to the novel 's central character , observed that " the real trouble with Bond , from a literary point of view , is that he is becoming more and more synthetic and zombie @-@ ish . Perhaps it is just as well . " Writing in The Manchester Guardian , Roy Perrott observed that " Goldfinger ... will not let [ Bond 's ] close admirers down " . Perrott thought that overall " Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan @-@ ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe " ; he summarised the book by saying that it was " hard to put down ; but some of us wish we had the good taste just to try . " 
 The critic writing for The Times thought that Bond was " backed up by sound writing " by Fleming . Although the plot was grandiose , the critic noted that : " it sounds – and is – fantastic ; the skill of Mr. Fleming is to be measured by the fact that it is made not to seem so . " For The Times Literary Supplement , Michael Robson considered that " a new Bond has emerged from these pages : an agent more relaxed , less promiscuous , less <unk> muscular than of yore . " Bond was not the only thing that was more relaxed , according to Robson , as " the story , too , is more relaxed . " Robson saw this as a positive development , but it did mean that although " there are incidental displays of the virtuosity to which Mr. Fleming has accustomed us , ... the narrative does not slip into top gear until Goldfinger unfolds his plan " . The Evening Standard looked at why Bond was a success and listed " the things that make Bond attractive : the sex , the sadism , the vulgarity of money for its own sake , the cult of power , the lack of standards " . The Sunday Times called Goldfinger " Guilt @-@ edged Bond " , whilst the Manchester Evening News thought that " Only Fleming could have got away with it ... outrageously improbable , wickedly funny , wildly exciting " . 
 Even the " avid anti @-@ Bond and an anti @-@ Fleming man " , Anthony Boucher , writing for The New York Times appeared to enjoy Goldfinger , saying " the whole preposterous fantasy strikes me as highly entertaining . " Meanwhile , the critic for the New York Herald Tribune , James Sandoe considered the book to be " a superlative thriller from our foremost literary magician . " 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Anthony Burgess , in Ninety @-@ nine Novels , cited it as one of the 99 best novels in English since 1939 . " Fleming raised the standard of the popular story of espionage through good writing — a heightened journalistic style — and the creation of a government agent — James Bond , 007 — who is sufficiently complicated to compel our interest over a whole series of adventures . A patriotic <unk> with a tinge of Scottish puritanism in him , a <unk> and amateur of vodka martinis , a smoker of strong tobacco who does not lose his wind , he is pitted against impossible villains , enemies of democracy , megalomaniacs . Auric Goldfinger is the most extravagant of these . All this is , in some measure , a great joke , but Fleming 's passion for plausibility , his own naval intelligence background , and a kind of sincere <unk> , allied to journalistic efficiency in the management of his <unk> , make his work rather impressive . The James Bond films , after From Russia With Love , stress the fantastic and are inferior entertainment to the books . It is unwise to disparage the well @-@ made popular . There was a time when Conan Doyle was ignored by the literary annalists even though Sherlock Holmes was evidently one of the great characters of fiction . We must beware of snobbishness . " 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 Daily Express serialisation ( 1959 ) Goldfinger was serialised on a daily basis in the Daily Express newspaper from 18 March 1959 onwards . 
 Comic strip ( 1960 – 1961 ) 
 Fleming 's original novel was adapted as a daily comic strip which was published in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated around the world . The adaptation ran from 3 October 1960 to 1 April 1961 . The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky . Goldfinger was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books as part of the Dr. No anthology , which in addition to Dr. No , also included Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia , with Love . 
 Goldfinger ( 1964 ) 
 In 1964 , Goldfinger became the third entry in the James Bond film series . Sean Connery returned as Bond , while German actor Gert Fröbe played Auric Goldfinger . The film was mostly similar to the novel , but Jill and Tilly Masterton ( renamed Masterson for the film ) have shortened roles and earlier deaths in the story . The plot of the film was also changed from stealing the gold at Fort Knox to irradiating the gold vault with a dirty bomb . 
 BBC documentary ( 1973 ) 
 The 1973 BBC documentary Omnibus : The British Hero featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters ( e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond ) , including James Bond in dramatised scenes from Goldfinger – notably featuring the hero being threatened with the novel 's circular saw , rather than the film 's laser beam – and Diamonds Are Forever . 
 Radio adaptation ( 2010 ) 
 Following its successful version of Dr. No , produced in 2008 as a special one @-@ off to mark the centenary of Ian Fleming 's birth , Eon Productions allowed a second Bond story to be adapted . On 3 April 2010 , BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of Goldfinger with Toby Stephens ( who played villain Gustav Graves in Die Another Day ) as Bond , Ian McKellen as Goldfinger and Stephens ' Die Another Day co @-@ star Rosamund Pike as Pussy Galore . The play was adapted from Fleming 's novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis . 
 = The Adventures of Tintin = 
 The Adventures of Tintin ( French : Les Aventures de Tintin ) is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi , who wrote under the pen name Hergé . The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century . By 2007 , a century after Hergé 's birth in 1907 , Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies . 
 The series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 in Le Petit Vingtième ( The Little Twentieth ) , a youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle ( The Twentieth Century ) . The success of the series saw the serialised strips published in Belgium 's leading newspaper Le Soir ( The Evening ) and spun into a successful Tintin magazine . In 1950 , Hergé created Studios Hergé , which produced the canonical versions of ten Tintin albums . The Adventures of Tintin have been adapted for radio , television , theatre , and film . 
 The series is set during a largely realistic 20th century . Its hero is Tintin , a young Belgian reporter and adventurer . He is aided by his faithful Wire Fox Terrier dog Snowy ( Milou in the original French edition ) . Other protagonists include the brash and cynical Captain Haddock and the intelligent but hearing @-@ impaired Professor Calculus ( French : Professeur Tournesol ; <unk> being the French word for sunflower ) , as well as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson ( French : Dupont et Dupond ) and the opera diva Bianca Castafiore . 
 The series has been admired for its clean , expressive drawings in Hergé 's signature ligne claire ( " clear line " ) style . Its well @-@ researched plots straddle a variety of genres : swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy , mysteries , political thrillers , and science fiction . The stories feature slapstick humour , offset by dashes of sophisticated satire and political or cultural commentary .

 = = = Le Vingtième Siècle : 1929 – 1939 = = = 
 Georges Remi , best known under the pen name Hergé , was employed as an illustrator at Le Vingtième Siècle ( " The Twentieth Century " ) , a staunchly Roman Catholic , conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé 's native Brussels . Run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez , the paper described itself as a " Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information " and disseminated a far @-@ right , fascist viewpoint . Wallez appointed Hergé editor of a new Thursday youth supplement , titled Le Petit Vingtième ( " The Little Twentieth " ) . Propagating Wallez 's socio @-@ political views to its young readership , it contained explicitly pro @-@ fascist and anti @-@ Semitic sentiment . In addition to editing the supplement , Hergé illustrated L 'extraordinaire aventure de Flup , Nénesse , Poussette et Cochonnet ( " The Extraordinary Adventures of Flup , Nénesse , Poussette and Cochonnet " ) , a comic strip authored by a member of the newspaper 's sport staff . Dissatisfied with this , Hergé wanted to write and draw his own cartoon strip . 
 He already had experience creating comic strips . From July 1926 he had written a strip about a boy scout patrol leader titled Les Aventures de Totor C.P. des <unk> ( " The Adventures of Totor , Scout Leader of the Cockchafers " ) for the Scouting newspaper Le Boy Scout Belge ( " The Belgian Boy Scout " ) . Totor was a strong influence on Tintin , with Hergé describing the latter as being like Totor 's younger brother . Jean @-@ Marc and Randy Lofficier stated that graphically , Totor and Tintin were " virtually identical " except for the scout uniform , also noting many similarities between their respective adventures , particularly in the illustration style , the fast pace of the story , and the use of humour . He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium such as the systematic use of speech bubbles — found in such American comics as George McManus ' Bringing up Father , George Herriman 's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks 's Katzenjammer Kids , copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper 's reporter Léon Degrelle . 
 Although Hergé wanted to send Tintin to the United States , Wallez ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union , acting as anti @-@ socialist propaganda for children . The result , Tintin in the Land of the Soviets , was serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from January 1929 to May 1930 . Popular in Francophone Belgium , Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station , following which he organised the publication of the story in book form . The story 's popularity led to an increase in sales , so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants . At Wallez 's direction , in June he began serialisation of the second story , Tintin in the Congo , designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo . Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots , in later decades it was accused of racism , however at the time was un @-@ controversial and popular , and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales . 
 For the third adventure , Tintin in America , serialised from September 1931 to October 1932 , Hergé finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice , and used the work to push an anti @-@ capitalist , anti @-@ consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper 's ultra @-@ conservative ideology . The Adventures of Tintin had been syndicated to French Catholic magazine Cœurs Vaillants ( " Brave Hearts " ) since 1930 , and Hergé was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too . 
 Hergé went on to pen a string of Adventures of Tintin , sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo , the United States , Egypt , India , China , and the United Kingdom . He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising , such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros , the East European kingdom of Syldavia , or the fascist state Borduria — whose leader , Müsstler , was a combination of Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler and Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini . 
 = = = Le Soir : 1940 – 1945 = = = 
 In May 1940 , Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II broke out across Europe . Although Hergé briefly fled to France and considered a self @-@ imposed exile , he ultimately decided to return to his occupied homeland . For political reasons , the Nazi authorities closed down Le Vingtième Siècle , leaving Hergé unemployed . In search of employment , he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium 's leading newspaper , Le Soir ( The Evening ) , which was allowed to continue publication under German management . On 17 October 1940 , he was made editor of the children 's supplement , Le Soir Jeunesse , in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures . In this new , more repressive political climate of German @-@ occupied Belgium , Hergé could no longer explore political themes in his Adventures of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo . As Harry Thompson noted , Tintin 's role as a reporter came to an end , to be replaced by his new role as an explorer . 
 From 1943 on , Hergé with the help of Edgar P. Jacobs started redrawing and colouring the early Tintin adventures , while also collaborating in the production of new stories . The old stories , usually a bit over 100 pages long , were restructured to fit into 62 pages . Jacobs eventually ended the collaboration in 1947 when Hergé refused to share the credit with him . They remained friends though . 
 = = = Le Journal de Tintin : 1946 – 1983 = = = 
 At the end of the war , in September 1944 , the Allies entered Brussels and Hergé 's German employers fled . Le Soir was shut down and The Adventures of Tintin was put on hold . Then in 1946 , Hergé accepted an invitation from Belgian comic publisher Raymond Leblanc and his new publishing company Le Lombard to continue The Adventures of Tintin in the new Le journal de Tintin ( Tintin magazine ) . While elated to have his work published again , Hergé quickly learned that if Tintin magazine was his deliverer , it was also his demanding employer . He no longer had the independence he preferred ; he was required to produce two coloured pages a week for Leblanc 's magazine — a tall order . Despite this , Hergé 's dedication to detail continued , his artistic standards escalated , even as his pressures mounted . 
 Finally , in 1950 , Hergé began to poach the better members of the Tintin magazine staff to work in the large house on Avenue Louise that contained the fledgling Studios Hergé . Bob De Moor ( who imitated Hergé 's style and did half the work ) , Guy <unk> ( colourist ) , and Marcel <unk> ( secretary ) were the nucleus . To this , Hergé added Jacques Martin ( imitated Hergé 's style ) , Roger Leloup ( detailed , realistic drawings ) , Eugène <unk> ( later chief of the Studios ) , Michel Demaret ( letterer ) , and Baudouin Van Den Branden ( secretary ) . As Harry Thompson observed , the idea was to turn the process of creating The Adventures of Tintin into a " veritable production line , the artwork passing from person to person , everyone knowing their part , like an artistic orchestra with Hergé conducting . " The Studios produced eight new Tintin albums for Tintin magazine , and coloured and reformatted two old Tintin albums . Studios Hergé continued to release additional publications until Hergé 's death in 1983 . In 1986 , a twenty @-@ fourth unfinished album was released , the Studios were disbanded , and its assets were transferred to the Hergé Foundation . Bolstered by recent adaptations , The Adventures of Tintin continue to entertain new generations of Tintin fans today .

 Tintin is a young Belgian reporter who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day . The Adventures may feature Tintin hard at work in his investigative journalism , but seldom is he seen actually turning in a story . He is a boy of neutral attitudes with whom the audience can identify ; in this respect , he represents the everyman . 
 Readers and critics have described Tintin as a well @-@ rounded yet open @-@ ended , intelligent and creative character , noting that his rather neutral personality — sometimes labelled as bland — permits a balanced reflection of the evil , folly , and <unk> , which surrounds him . The character never compromises his Boy Scout ideals , which represent Hergé 's own , and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story , rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist . Tintin 's iconic representation enhances this aspect , with Scott McCloud noting that it " allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world . " 
 Snowy ( Milou in Hergé 's original version ) , a white Wire Fox Terrier dog , is Tintin 's loyal , four @-@ legged companion . The bond between Snowy and Tintin is very deep , as they have saved each other from perilous situations many times . Snowy frequently " speaks " to the reader through his thoughts ( often displaying a dry sense of humour ) , which are not heard by the human characters in the story . Snowy has nearly let Tintin down on occasion , particularly when distracted by a bone . Like Captain Haddock , he is fond of Loch Lomond brand Scotch whisky , and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into trouble . When not distracted , Snowy is generally fearless , his only fear being arachnophobia . When Tintin gets tied up by villains ( which often happens ) , Snowy is usually able to free him by biting through the rope . 
 = = = = Captain Haddock = = = = 
 Captain Archibald Haddock ( Capitaine Haddock in Hergé 's original version ) , a Merchant Marine sea captain ( he may be of English , or Scottish origin ) , is Tintin 's best friend . Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws , Haddock is initially depicted as a weak and alcoholic character , but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor , Sir Francis Haddock . The Captain 's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin 's often @-@ implausible heroism ; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic . After he and Tintin find Red Rackham 's treasure , Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall ( Le château de Moulinsart in the original French ) . 
 The hot @-@ tempered Haddock uses a range of colourful insults and curses to express his feelings , such as " billions of blue blistering barnacles " or " ten thousand thundering typhoons " , " bashi @-@ bazouk " , " <unk> " , " kleptomaniac " , or " sea <unk> " , but nothing actually considered a swear word . He is a hard drinker , particularly fond of rum and of Scotch whisky , especially Loch Lomond ; his bouts of drunkenness are often used for comic effect , but sometimes get him into serious trouble . 
 = = = = Professor Calculus = = = = 
 Professor Cuthbert Calculus ( Professeur Tryphon Tournesol in Hergé 's original version ) , an absent @-@ minded and half @-@ deaf physicist , is a regular character alongside Tintin , Snowy , and Captain Haddock . He was introduced in Red Rackham 's Treasure , and based partially on Auguste Piccard , a Swiss physicist . The leading characters do not initially welcome his presence , but through his generous nature and his scientific ability , he develops a lasting bond with them . Eventually , by the end of Land of Black Gold , he becomes a resident of Marlinspike Hall . Normally mild @-@ mannered and dignified , Calculus occasionally loses his temper and acts in a spectacularly aggressive manner in response to actual or perceived insults , such as when Captain Haddock belittles his work or accuses him of " acting the goat " . He is a fervent believer in dowsing , and carries a pendulum for that purpose . Calculus 's deafness is a frequent source of humour , as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard , usually in the most unlikely words possible . He does not admit to being near @-@ deaf and insists he is only " a little hard of hearing in one ear . " 
 = = = = Supporting characters = = = = 
 Hergé 's supporting characters have been cited as far more developed than the central character , each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality , which has been compared with that of the characters of Charles Dickens . Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists ' adventures . To further the realism and continuity , characters would recur throughout the series . The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations . As a result , the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period . 
 Thomson and Thompson ( Dupont et Dupond in Hergé 's original version ) are two incompetent detectives who look like identical twins , their only discernible difference being the shape of their moustaches . First introduced in Cigars of the Pharaoh , they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series , being afflicted with chronic <unk> . They are extremely clumsy , thoroughly incompetent , and usually bent on arresting the wrong character . The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks except when sent abroad ; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting , but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire . The detectives were in part based on Hergé 's father Alexis and uncle Léon , identical twins who often took walks together , wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks . 
 Bianca Castafiore is an opera singer of whom Haddock is terrified . She was first introduced in King Ottokar 's Sceptre and seems to appear wherever the protagonists travel , along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner . She is comically foolish , whimsical , absent @-@ minded , and talkative , and seems unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud . Her speciality is the Jewel Song ( Ah ! Je ris de me voir si belle en ce <unk> ) from Gounod 's opera , Faust , which she sings at the least provocation , much to Haddock 's dismay . She is often maternal toward Haddock , of whose dislike she remains ignorant . She often confuses words , especially names , with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her ; " Haddock " is frequently replaced by malapropisms such as " Paddock " , " <unk> " , or " Hopscotch " , while Nestor , Haddock 's butler , is confused with " <unk> " and " Hector " . Her own name means " white and chaste flower " : a meaning to which Professor Calculus once refers when he breeds a white rose and names it for the singer . She was based upon opera divas in general ( according to Hergé 's perception ) , Hergé 's Aunt <unk> ( who was known for her " shrill " singing of opera ) , and , in the post @-@ war comics , on Maria Callas . 
 Other recurring characters include Nestor the butler , Chang the loyal Chinese boy , Rastapopoulos the criminal mastermind , Jolyon Wagg the infuriating ( to Haddock ) insurance salesman , General Alcazar the South American dictator , Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab the Arab emir , Abdullah his mischievous son , Dr. Müller the evil German psychiatrist , Oliveira da Figueira the friendly salesman , Cutts the butcher whose phone number is repeatedly confused with Haddock 's , and Allan the henchman of Rastapopoulos and formerly Haddock 's first mate . 
 = = = Settings = = = 
 The settings within Tintin have also added depth to the strips . Hergé mingles real and fictional lands into his stories , along with a base in Belgium from where Tintin sets off — originally 26 Labrador Road , but later Marlinspike Hall . The role of setting is aptly demonstrated in King Ottokar 's Sceptre , in which Hergé creates two fictional countries , Syldavia and Borduria , and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline . Other fictional lands include Khemed on the Arabian Peninsula and San Theodoros , São Rico , and Nuevo Rico in South America , as well as the kingdom of Gaipajama in India . Along with these fictitious locations , actual nations were employed such as Belgium , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , the United States , the Soviet Union , Congo , Peru , India , Egypt , Indonesia , Nepal , Tibet , and China . Other actual locales used were the Sahara , the Atlantic Ocean , and the Moon . 
 = = Research = = 
 Hergé 's extensive research began with The Blue Lotus ; Hergé stated , " It was from that time that I undertook research and really interested myself in the people and countries to which I sent Tintin , out of a sense of responsibility to my readers " . 
 Hergé 's use of research and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin , going so far as to create fictionalised countries , dressing them with specific political cultures . These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Hergé 's lifetime . Pierre Skilling has asserted that Hergé saw monarchy as " the legitimate form of government " , noting that democratic " values seem underrepresented in [ such ] a classic Franco @-@ Belgian strip " . Syldavia in particular is described in considerable detail , Hergé creating a history , customs , and a language , which is actually a Slavic @-@ looking transcript of <unk> , a working @-@ class Brussels dialect . He set the country in the Balkans , and it is , by his own admission , modelled after Albania . The country finds itself threatened by neighbouring Borduria , with an attempted annexation appearing in King Ottokar 's Sceptre . This situation parallels the Italian conquest of Albania , and that of Czechoslovakia and Austria by expansionist Nazi Germany prior to World War II . 
 Hergé 's use of research would include months of preparation for Tintin 's voyage to the moon in the two @-@ part storyline spread across Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon . His research for the storyline was noted in New Scientist : " The considerable research undertaken by Hergé enabled him to come very close to the type of space suit that would be used in future Moon exploration , although his portrayal of the type of rocket that was actually used was a long way off the mark " . The moon rocket is based on the German V @-@ 2 rockets . 
 = = Influences = = 
 In his youth , Hergé admired Benjamin <unk> and suggested that a number of images within Tintin in the Land of the Soviets reflected this influence , particularly the pictures of animals . René Vincent , the Art Deco designer , also had an impact on early Tintin adventures : " His influence can be detected at the beginning of the Soviets , where my drawings are designed along a decorative line , like an ' S ' . " Hergé also felt no compunction in admitting that he had stolen the image of round noses from George McManus , feeling they were " so much fun that I used them , without scruples ! " 
 During the extensive research Hergé carried out for The Blue Lotus , he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts . This is especially noticeable in the seascapes , which are reminiscent of works by Hokusai and Hiroshige . 
 Hergé also declared Mark Twain an influence , although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting Incas as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in Prisoners of the Sun , an error T. F. Mills attributed to an attempt to portray " Incas in awe of a latter @-@ day ' Connecticut Yankee ' " . 
 = = Translation into English = = 
 = = = British = = = 
 Tintin first appeared in English in the weekly British children 's comic Eagle in 1951 with the story King Ottokar 's Sceptre . It was translated in conjunction with Casterman , Tintin 's publishers , and starts by describing Tintin as " a French boy " . Snowy was called by his French name " Milou " . 
 The process of translating Tintin into British English was then commissioned in 1958 by Methuen , Hergé 's British publishers . It was a joint operation , headed by Leslie Lonsdale @-@ Cooper and Michael Turner , working closely with Hergé to attain an accurate translation as true as possible to the original work . Due in part to the large amount of language @-@ specific word play ( such as punning ) in the series , especially the jokes which played on Professor Calculus ' partial deafness , it was always the intention not to translate literally , instead striving to sculpt a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right . Despite the free hand Hergé afforded the two , they worked closely with the original text , asking for regular assistance to understand Hergé 's intentions . 
 The British translations were also Anglicised to appeal to British customs and values . Milou , for example , was renamed Snowy at the translators ' discretion . Captain Haddock 's Le château de Moulinsart was renamed Marlinspike Hall . 
 When it came time to translate The Black Island , which is set in Great Britain , the opportunity was taken to make the scenes more true @-@ to @-@ life ; such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring scenes of the British countryside were more accurate for discerning British readers . Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough , and had compiled a list of 131 errors of detail , which should be put right , asking Studios Hergé to rework it completely . The resulting album is the dramatically updated and redrawn 1966 version that is the most commonly available today . As of the early 21st century , Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere . 
 = = = American = = = 
 Unlike in most of Western Europe , the Tintin books have had limited popularity in the United States . 
 The works were first adapted for the American English market by Golden Books , a branch of the Western Publishing Company in the 1950s . The albums were translated from French into American English with some artwork panels blanked except for the speech balloons . This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children , such as drunkenness and free mixing of races . The albums were not popular and only six were published in mixed order . The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable , and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world . 
 From 1966 to 1979 , Children 's Digest included monthly instalments of The Adventures of Tintin . These serialisations served to increase Tintin 's popularity , introducing him to many thousands of new readers in the United States . 
 Atlantic Monthly Press , in cooperation with Little , Brown and Company beginning in the 1970s , republished the albums based on the British translations . Alterations were made to vocabulary not well known to an American audience ( such as gaol , tyre , saloon , and spanner ) . As of the early 21st century , Little , Brown and Company ( owned by the Hachette Book Group USA ) continues to publish Tintin books in the United States . 
 = = = Lettering and typography = = = 
 The English @-@ language Adventures of Tintin books were originally published with handwritten lettering created by cartographer Neil Hyslop . 1958 's The Crab With the Golden Claw was the first to be published with Hyslop 's lettering . Hyslop was given versions of Hergé 's artwork with blank panels . Hyslop would write his English script on a clear cellophane @-@ like material , aiming to fit within the original speech bubble . Occasionally the size of the bubbles would need to be adjusted if the translated text would not fit . In the early 2000s , Tintin 's English publishers Egmont discontinued publishing books featuring Hyslop 's handwritten lettering , instead publishing books with text created with digital fonts . This change was instigated by publisher Casterman and Hergé 's estate managers Moulinsart , who decided to replace localised hand @-@ lettering with a single computerised font for all Tintin titles worldwide .

 On 1 June 2006 , the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet 's Light of Truth Award upon the Hergé Foundation , along with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu . The award was in recognition of Hergé 's book Tintin in Tibet , Hergé 's most personal adventure , which the Executive Director of ICT Europe Tsering Jampa noted was " for many ... their introduction to the awe @-@ inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet " . In 2001 , the Hergé Foundation demanded the recall of the Chinese translation of the work , which had been released with the title Tintin in Chinese Tibet . The work was subsequently published with the correct translation of the title . Accepting on behalf of the Hergé Foundation , Hergé 's widow Fanny Rodwell stated , " We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later " . 
 = = = Literary criticism = = = 
 The study of Tintin has become the life work of many literary critics , observers sometimes referring to this study as " <unk> " . A prominent literary critic of Tintin is Philippe Goddin , who published Hergé et Tintin reporters : Du Petit Vingtième au Journal Tintin ( 1986 , later republished in English as Hergé and Tintin Reporters : From " Le Petit Vingtième " to " Tintin " Magazine in 1987 ) and Hergé et les Bigotudos ( 1993 ) amongst other books on the series . In 1983 , Benoît Peeters published Le Monde d <unk> , subsequently published in English as Tintin and the World of Hergé in 1988 . Although Goddin and Peeters were native French @-@ speakers , the English reporter Michael Farr also published works on such as Tintin , 60 Years of Adventure ( 1989 ) , Tintin : The Complete Companion ( 2001 ) , Tintin & Co . ( 2007 ) and The Adventures of Hergé ( 2007 ) , as had English screenwriter Harry Thompson , the author of Tintin : Hergé and his Creation ( 1991 ) . 
 Literary critics , primarily in French @-@ speaking Europe , have also examined The Adventures of Tintin . In 1984 , Jean @-@ Marie Apostolidès published his study of the Adventures of Tintin from a more " adult " perspective as Les Métamorphoses de Tintin , published in English as The Metamorphoses of Tintin , or Tintin for Adults in 2010 . In reviewing Apostolidès ' book , Nathan Perl @-@ Rosenthal of The New Republic thought that it was " not for the faint of heart : it is densely @-@ packed with close textual analysis and laden with psychological jargon . " Following Apostolidès 's work , French psychoanalyst Serge <unk> examined the series in his books Tintin et les Secrets de Famille ( " Tintin and the Family Secrets " ) , which was published in 1990 , and Tintin et le Secret d <unk> ( " Tintin and Hergé 's Secret " ) , published in 1993 . 
 The first English @-@ language work of literary criticism devoted to the series was Tintin and the Secret of Literature , written by the novelist Tom McCarthy and published in 2006 . McCarthy compares Hergé 's work with that of Aeschylus , Honoré de Balzac , Joseph Conrad , and Henry James and argues that the series contains the key to understanding literature itself . McCarthy considered the Adventures of Tintin to be " stupendously rich " , containing " a mastery of plot and symbol , theme and sub @-@ text " which , influenced by <unk> 's psychoanalytical readings of the work , he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes , ranging from bartering to implicit sexual intercourse that Hergé had featured throughout the series . Reviewing the book in The Telegraph , Toby Clements argued however that McCarthy 's work , and literary criticism of Hergé 's comic strips in general , cut " perilously close " to simply feeding " the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive " in the <unk> community . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 The earliest stories in The Adventures of Tintin have been criticised for displaying racial stereotypes , animal cruelty , colonialist , violent , and even fascist leanings , including ethnocentric caricatured portrayals of non @-@ Europeans . While the Hergé Foundation has presented such criticism as naïveté and scholars of Hergé such as Harry Thompson have said that " Hergé did what he was told by the Abbé Wallez " , Hergé himself felt that his background made it impossible to avoid prejudice , stating , " I was fed the prejudices of the bourgeois society that surrounded me . " 
 Tintin in the Congo has been criticised as presenting the Africans as naïve and primitive . In the original work , Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing a class of African children . " My dear friends , " he says , " I am going to talk to you today about your fatherland : Belgium . " Hergé redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics . Hergé later admitted the flaws in the original story , excusing it saying , " I portrayed these Africans according to ... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time . " Sue Buswell summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as " all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals " , although Thompson noted this quote may have been " taken out of context " . 
 Drawing on André Maurois ' Les <unk> du colonel Bramble , Hergé presents Tintin as a big @-@ game hunter , accidentally killing fifteen antelope as opposed to the one needed for the evening meal . However , concerns over the number of dead animals led Tintin 's Scandinavian publishers to request changes . A page of Tintin killing a rhinoceros by drilling a hole in its back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive ; Hergé replaced the page with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin 's rifle while he sleeps under a tree . In 2007 , the UK 's Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be pulled from shelves after a complaint , stating , " It beggars belief that in this day and age that any shop would think it acceptable to sell and display Tintin in the Congo . " In August 2007 , a Congolese student filed a complaint in Brussels that the book was an insult to the Congolese people . Public prosecutors investigated , and a criminal case was initiated , although the matter was transferred to a civil court . Belgium 's Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against " over @-@ reaction and hyper political correctness " . 
 Hergé altered some of the early albums in subsequent editions , usually at the demand of publishers . For example , at the instigation of his American publishers , many of the African characters in Tintin in America were re @-@ coloured to make their race Caucasian or ambiguous . The Shooting Star originally had an American villain with the Jewish surname of " Blumenstein " . This proved controversial , as the character exhibited exaggerated , stereotypically Jewish characteristics . " Blumenstein " was changed to an American with a less ethnically specific name , Mr. Bohlwinkel , in later editions and subsequently to a South American of a fictional country — São Rico . Hergé later discovered that ' Bohlwinkel ' was also a Jewish name . 
 = = Adaptations and memorabilia = = 
 The Adventures of Tintin has been adapted in a variety of media besides the original comic strip and its collections . Hergé encouraged adaptations and members of his studio working on the animated films . After Hergé 's death in 1983 , the Hergé Foundation and Moulinsart , the foundation 's commercial and copyright wing , became responsible for authorising adaptations and exhibitions . 
 = = = Television and radio = = = 
 Two animated television adaptations and one radio adaptation have been made . 
 Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin ( Les aventures de Tintin d 'après Hergé ) ( 1957 ) was the first production of Belvision Studios . Ten of Hergé 's books were adapted , each serialised into a set of five @-@ minute episodes , with 103 episodes produced . The series was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Belgian comic artist Greg , later editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tintin magazine , and produced by Raymond Leblanc . Most stories in the series varied widely from the original books , often changing whole plots . 
 The Adventures of Tintin ( Les aventures de Tintin ) ( 1991 – 92 ) was the more successful Tintin television series . An adaptation of twenty @-@ one Tintin books , it was directed by Stéphane Bernasconi and was produced by Ellipse ( France ) and Nelvana ( Canada ) on behalf of the Hergé Foundation . The series adhered closely to the albums to such an extent that panels from the original were often transposed directly to the screen . The series aired in over fifty countries and was released on DVD . It aired in the US on HBO . 
 The Adventures of Tintin ( 1992 – 93 ) radio series was produced by BBC Radio 4 . The dramas starred Richard Pearce as Tintin and Andrew Sachs as Snowy . Captain Haddock was played by Leo McKern in Series One and Lionel Jeffries in Series Two , Professor Calculus was played by Stephen Moore and Thomson and Thompson were played by Charles Kay . 
 = = = Cinema = = = 
 Five feature @-@ length Tintin films were made before Hergé 's death in 1983 . Nearly four decades later , a planned trilogy of Hollywood Tintin movies is being released . 
 The Crab with the Golden Claws ( Le <unk> aux pinces d 'or ) ( 1947 ) was the first successful attempt to adapt one of the comics into a feature film . Written and directed by Claude <unk> and João B Michiels , the film was a stop @-@ motion puppet production created by a small Belgian studio . 
 Tintin and the Golden Fleece ( Tintin et le mystère de la <unk> d 'Or ) ( 1961 ) , the first live action Tintin film , was adapted not from one of Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin but instead from an original script written by André Barret and <unk> Forlani . Directed by Jean @-@ Jacques Vierne and starring Jean @-@ Pierre Talbot as Tintin and Georges Wilson as Haddock , the plot involves Tintin travelling to Istanbul to collect the Golden Fleece , a ship left to Haddock in the will of his friend , <unk> <unk> . Whilst in the city however , Tintin and Haddock discover that a group of villains also want possession of the ship , believing that it would lead them to a hidden treasure . 
 Tintin and the Blue Oranges ( Tintin et les oranges <unk> ) ( 1964 ) , the second live action Tintin film , was released due to the success of the first . Again based upon an original script , once more by André Barret , it was directed by Philippe <unk> and starred Talbot as Tintin and Jean <unk> as Haddock . The plot reveals a new invention , the blue orange , that can grow in the desert and solve world famines , devised by Calculus ' friend , the Spanish Professor Zalamea . An emir whose interests are threatened by the invention of the blue orange proceeds to kidnap both Zalamea and Calculus , and Tintin and Haddock travel to Spain in order to rescue them . 
 Tintin and the Temple of the Sun ( Tintin et le temple du soleil ) ( 1969 ) , the first traditional animation Tintin film , was adapted from two of Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin : The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun . The first full @-@ length , animated film from Raymond Leblanc 's Belvision , which had recently completed its television series based upon the Tintin stories ; it was directed by Eddie Lateste and featured a musical score by the critically acclaimed composer François Rauber . The adaptation is mostly faithful , although the Seven Crystal Balls portion of the story was heavily condensed . 
 Tintin and the Lake of Sharks ( Tintin et le lac aux <unk> ) ( 1972 ) , the second traditional animation Tintin film and the last Tintin release for nearly 40 years , it was based on an original script by Greg and directed by Raymond Leblanc . Belvision 's second feature takes Tintin to Syldavia to outwit his old foe Rastapopoulos . While the look of the film is richer , the story is less convincing . The movie was subsequently adapted into a comic album made up of stills from the film .

 Tintin and I ( Tintin et moi ) ( 2003 ) , a documentary film directed by Anders <unk> Østergaard and co @-@ produced by companies from Denmark , Belgium , France , and Switzerland , was based on the taped interview with Hergé by Numa Sadoul from 1971 . Although the interview was published as a book , Hergé was allowed to edit the work prior to publishing and much of the interview was excised . Years after Hergé 's death , the filmmaker returns to the original tapes and restores Hergé 's often personal , insightful thoughts — and in the process brings viewers closer to the world of Tintin and Hergé . It was broadcast in the United States on the PBS network , 11 July 2006 . 
 Sur les traces de Tintin ( On the trail of Tintin ) ( 2010 ) was a five @-@ part documentary television series which recaps several albums of the book series by combining comic panels ( motionless or otherwise ) with live @-@ action imagery , with commentary provided . 
 = = = Theatre = = = 
 Hergé himself helped to create two stage plays , collaborating with humourist Jacques Van Melkebeke . Tintin in the Indies : The Mystery of the Blue Diamond ( 1941 ) covers much of the second half of Cigars of the Pharaoh as Tintin attempts to rescue a stolen blue diamond . The Disappearance of Mr. Boullock ( 1941 – 1942 ) has Tintin , Snowy , and Thomson and Thompson track the mysterious Mr. Boullock around the world and back to Brussels again . The plays were performed at the Théâtre Royal des Galeries in Brussels . The scripts of the plays are unfortunately lost . 
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s , two Tintin plays appeared at the Arts Theatre in the West End of London , adapted by Geoffrey Case for the Unicorn Theatre Company . These were Tintin 's Great American Adventure , based on the comic Tintin in America ( 1976 – 1977 ) and Tintin and the Black Island , based on The Black Island ( 1980 – 81 ) ; this second play later toured . 
 A musical based on The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun premièred on 15 September 2001 at the Stadsschouwburg ( City Theatre ) in Antwerp , Belgium . It was entitled Kuifje – De Zonnetempel ( De Musical ) ( " Tintin – Temple of the Sun ( The Musical ) " ) and was broadcast on Canal Plus , before moving on to Charleroi in 2002 as Tintin – Le Temple du Soleil – Le Spectacle Musical . 
 The Young Vic theatre company in London ran Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin , a musical version of Tintin in Tibet , at the Barbican Arts Centre ( 2005 – 2006 ) ; the production was directed by Rufus Norris and was adapted by Norris and David Greig . The show was successfully revived at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End of London before touring ( 2006 – 2007 ) to celebrate the centenary of Hergé 's birth in 2007 .

 Tintin began appearing in video games when Infogrames Entertainment , SA , a French game company , released the side scroller Tintin on the Moon in 1989 . The same company released a platformer video game titled Tintin in Tibet in 1995 for the Super NES and Mega Drive / Genesis . Another platformer from Infogrames titled Prisoners of the Sun was released the following year for the Super NES , PC , and Game Boy Color . As computer graphics technology improved , video game experiences improved . In 2001 , Tintin became 3D in a game called Tintin : Destination Adventure , released by Infogrames for the PC and PlayStation . Then in 2011 , an action @-@ adventure video game called The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn , a tie @-@ in to the 2011 movie , was released by Ubisoft in October 2011 . 
 = = = Memorabilia and merchandise = = = 
 Images from the series have long been licensed for use on merchandise , the success of Tintin magazine helping to create a market for such items . Tintin 's image has been used to sell a wide variety of products , from alarm clocks to underpants . Countless separate items related to the character have been available , with some becoming collectors ' items in their own right . 
 The Hergé Foundation has maintained control of the licenses , through Moulinsart , the commercial wing of the foundation . Speaking in 2002 , Peter <unk> , the then director general at Moulinsart , noted this control : " We have to be very protective of the property . We don 't take lightly any potential partners and we have to be very selective ... for him to continue to be as popular as he is , great care needs to be taken of his use . " However , the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as " trivialising the work of Hergé by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising " in the wake of a move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series . 
 Tintin memorabilia and merchandise has allowed a chain of stores based solely on the character to become viable . The first shop was launched in 1984 in Covent Garden , London . Tintin shops have also opened in both Bruges and Brussels in Belgium , and in Montpellier , France . In 2014 , a Tintin shop opened in Taguig , Philippines , only the second of its kind in Southeast Asia . The British bookstore chain , Ottakar 's , founded in 1987 , was named after the character of King Ottokar from the Tintin book King Ottokar 's Sceptre , and their shops stocked a large amount of Tintin merchandise until their takeover by Waterstone 's in 2006 . 
 = = = Stamps and coins = = = 
 Tintin 's image has been used on postage stamps on numerous occasions . The first Tintin postage stamp was an eight @-@ franc stamp issued by Belgian Post for the 50th anniversary of the publication of Tintin 's first adventure on 29 September 1979 , featuring Tintin and Snowy looking through a magnifying glass at several stamps . In 1999 , a nine @-@ stamp block celebrating ten years of the Belgian Comic Strip Center was issued , with the center stamp a photo of Tintin 's famous moon rocket that dominates the Comic Strip Center 's entry hall . To mark the end of the Belgian Franc and to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of Tintin in the Congo , two more stamps were issued by Belgian Post on 31 December 2001 : Tintin in a pith helmet and a souvenir sheet with a single stamp in the center . The stamps were jointly issued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . In 2004 , Belgian Post celebrated its own seventy @-@ fifth anniversary , as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Explorers on the Moon , and the thirty @-@ fifth anniversary of the moon landings with a souvenir sheet of five stamps based upon the Explorers on the Moon adventure . To celebrate the centenary of Hergé 's birth in 2007 , Belgian Post issued a sheet of 25 stamps depicting the album covers of all 24 Adventures of Tintin ( in 24 languages ) plus Hergé 's portrait in the center . A souvenir sheet of ten stamps called " Tintin on screen " , issued 30 August 2011 , depicts the Tintin film and television adaptations . 
 Besides stamps , Tintin has also been commemorated by coin several times . In 1995 , the Monnaie de Paris ( Paris Mint ) issued a set of twelve gold medallions , available in a limited edition of 5000 . A silver medallion was minted in 2004 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Tintin book Explorers on the Moon , again in a limited run , this time of 10 @,@ 000 . It quickly sold out . In 2004 , Belgium minted a limited edition commemorative euro coin featuring Tintin and Snowy celebrating the 75th anniversary of Tintin 's first adventure in January 2004 . Although it has a face value of € 10 , it is , as with other commemorative euro coins , legal tender only in the country in which it was issued — in this case , Belgium . In 2006 – 2012 France issued the Comic Strip Heroes commemorative coin series featuring famous Franco @-@ Belgian comics , beginning in 2006 with Tintin . It was a set of six different euro coins honouring Hergé : three 1 ½ <unk> silver coins featuring Tintin and the Professor , Tintin and Captain Haddock , and Tintin and Chang ; a € 10 ( gold ) featuring Tintin ; and a € 20 ( silver ) and a € 50 ( gold ) featuring Tintin and Snowy . In 2007 , on Hergé 's centenary , Belgium issued its € 20 ( silver ) Hergé / Tintin coin . 
 = = = Parody and pastiche = = = 
 During Hergé 's lifetime , parodies were produced of the Adventures of Tintin , with one of the earliest appearing in Belgian newspaper La Patrie after the liberation of the country from Nazi German occupation in September 1944 . Entitled Tintin au pays de nazis ( " Tintin in the Land of the Nazis " ) , the short and crudely drawn strip lampoons Hergé for working for a Nazi @-@ run newspaper during the occupation . 
 Following Hergé 's death , hundreds more unofficial parodies and pastiches of the Adventures of Tintin were produced , covering a wide variety of different genres . Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings : pornographic , political , and artistic . In a number of cases , the actual name " Tintin " is replaced by something similar , like <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , within these books . 
 McCarthy 's first group , pornographic parodies , includes 1976 's Tintin en Suisse ( " Tintin in Switzerland " ) and Jan <unk> 's 1992 work La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin ( " Tintin 's Sex Life " ) , featuring Tintin and the other characters engaged in sexual acts . Another such example was Tintin in Thailand , in which Tintin , Haddock , and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday . The book began circulating in December 1999 , but in 2001 , Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation . 
 Other parodies have been produced for political reasons : for instance , Tintin in Iraq lampoons the world politics of the early 21st century , with Hergé 's character General Alcazar representing President of the United States George W. Bush . Written by the pseudonymous Jack Daniels , Breaking Free ( 1989 ) is a revolutionary socialist comic set in Britain during the 1980s , with Tintin and his uncle ( modelled after Captain Haddock ) being working class Englishmen who turn to socialism in order to oppose the capitalist policies of the Conservative Party government of Margaret Thatcher . When first published in Britain , it caused an outrage in the mainstream press , with one paper issuing the headline that " Commie <unk> turn Tintin into picket <unk> ! " 
 Other comic creators have chosen to create artistic stories that are more like fan fiction than parody . The Swiss artist <unk> created the irreverent comic adventures of <unk> , what The Guardian calls " the most beautifully produced of the pastiches . " Similarly , Canadian cartoonist Yves Rodier has produced a number of Tintin works , none of which have been authorised by the Hergé Foundation , including a 1986 " completion " of the unfinished Tintin and Alph @-@ art , which he drew in Hergé 's ligne claire style . 
 The response to these parodies has been mixed in the <unk> community . Many despise them , seeing them as an affront to Hergé 's work . Nick Rodwell of the Hergé Foundation took this view , declaring that " None of these copyists count as true fans of Hergé . If they were , they would respect his wishes that no one but him draw Tintin 's adventures . " Where possible , the foundation has taken legal action against those known to be producing such items . Others have taken a different attitude , considering such parodies and pastiches to be tributes to Hergé , and collecting them has become a " niche specialty " . 
 = = = Exhibitions = = = 
 After Hergé 's death in 1983 , his art began to be honoured at exhibitions around the world , keeping Tintin awareness at a high level . The first major Tintin exhibition in London was Tintin : 60 years of Adventure , held in 1989 at the Town Hall in Chelsea . This early exhibition displayed many of Hergé 's original sketches and inks , as well as some original gouaches . In 2001 , an exhibition entitled Mille <unk> ! ( " Billions of Blistering Barnacles ! " ) was shown at the National Navy Museum ( Musée national de la Marine ) in Paris . In 2002 , the Bunkamura Museum of Art in Tokyo staged an exhibition of original Hergé drawings as well as of the submarine and rocket ship invented in the strips by Professor Calculus . The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich , London , hosted the exhibition The Adventures of Tintin at Sea in 2004 , focusing on Tintin 's sea exploits , and in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the publication of Tintin 's first adventure . 2004 also saw an exhibition in Halles Saint <unk> in Brussels titled Tintin et la ville ( " Tintin and the City " ) showcasing all cities in the world Tintin had travelled . 
 The Belgian Comic Strip Center in the Brussels business district added exhibits dedicated to Hergé in 2004 . The Brussels ' Comic Book Route in the center of Brussels added its first Tintin mural in July 2005 . 
 The centenary of Hergé 's birth in 2007 was commemorated at the largest museum for modern art in Europe , the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris , with Hergé , an art exhibition honouring his work . The exhibition , which ran from 20 December 2006 until 19 February 2007 , featured some 300 of Hergé 's boards and original drawings , including all 124 original plates of The Blue Lotus . Laurent le Bon , organizer of the exhibit said , " It was important for the Centre to show the work of Hergé next to that of Matisse or Picasso . " Michael Farr said , " Hergé has long been seen as a father figure in the comics world . If he 's now recognized as a modern artist , that 's very important . " 
 2009 saw the opening of the Hergé Museum ( Musée Hergé ) , designed in contemporary style , in the town of Louvain @-@ la @-@ Neuve , south of Brussels . Visitors follow a sequence of eight permanent exhibit rooms covering the entire range of Hergé 's work , showcasing the world of Tintin and his other creations . In addition , the new museum has already seen many temporary exhibits , including Into Tibet With Tintin .

 Hergé is recognised as one of the leading cartoonists of the twentieth century . Most notably , Hergé 's ligne claire style has been influential to creators of other Franco @-@ Belgian comics . Contributors to Tintin magazine have employed ligne claire , and later artists Jacques <unk> , Yves <unk> , Jason Little , Phil Elliott , Martin Handford , Geof Darrow , Eric Heuvel , Garen Ewing , Joost Swarte , and others have produced works using it . 
 In the wider art world , both Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein have claimed Hergé as one of their most important influences . Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from Tintin comics , whilst Warhol used ligne claire and even made a series of paintings with Hergé as the subject . Warhol , who admired Tintin 's " great political and satirical dimensions " , said , " Hergé has influenced my work in the same way as Walt Disney . For me , Hergé was more than a comic strip artist " . 
 Hergé has been lauded as " creating in art a powerful graphic record of the 20th century 's tortured history " through his work on Tintin , whilst Maurice Horn 's World Encyclopedia of Comics declares him to have " spear @-@ headed the post @-@ World War II renaissance of European comic art " . French philosopher Michel Serres noted that the twenty @-@ three completed Tintin albums constituted a " chef @-@ d 'oeuvre " ( " masterpiece " ) to which " the work of no French novelist is comparable in importance or greatness " . 
 In 1966 , Charles de Gaulle said , " In the end , you know , my only international rival is Tintin ! We are the small ones , who do not let themselves be had by the great ones . " 
 In March 2015 , Brussels Airlines painted an Airbus A320 @-@ 200 with registration OO @-@ SNB in a special Tintin livery . 
 Tintin has become a symbol of Belgium and so was used in a variety of visual responses to the 2016 Brussels bombings .

 = 1973 Buffalo Bills season = 
 The 1973 Buffalo Bills season was the 14th season for the team and their fourth season in the National Football League ( NFL ) . The Bills finished in second place in the AFC East division and finished the 1973 NFL season with a record of 9 wins and 5 losses , the team 's first winning record since 1966 . 
 Head coach Lou Saban began the second season of his second tenure with the Bills . Saban had previously led the team to the 1964 and 1965 AFL championships . It was the first season that the team played in Rich Stadium ( now " Ralph Wilson Stadium " ) after thirteen years playing at War Memorial Stadium . 
 The Bills ' were coming off of 1 – 13 and 4 – 9 – 1 records in 1971 and 1972 , respectively . Incumbent starting quarterback Dennis Shaw found himself in a battle with rookie Joe Ferguson for the starting job . 
 The season was defined by O.J. Simpson becoming the first player in NFL history to rush for 2 @,@ 000 yards in a season . Behind Simpson 's record @-@ setting season , the Bills set an NFL record for most team rushing yards in a 14 @-@ game season , with 3 @,@ 088 . Simpson was coming off of his best professional season , in which he earned his first All @-@ Pro recognition and first rushing title . In addition to establishing a then @-@ record for single @-@ season rushing yardage , with 2 @,@ 003 , Simpson established the single @-@ season record for rushing yards gained per game , which still stands .

The team ushered in a new stadium , new uniforms and a transformed team built through the draft and a few key trades . With all the emphasis on rushing the team would only post two 100 @-@ yard receiving efforts . 
 The Bills started the season 4 – 1 and then lost four of their next five before winning their final 4 games . Rookie quarterback Joe Ferguson , who eventually would be the Bills starting quarterback for 12 seasons , started all 14 games at quarterback . Dennis Shaw who had been the starter the previous three season , saw action in four games .

Simpson ) . The offensive guards were a pair of young future All @-@ Pro performers : Pro Football Hall of Famer DeLamielleure ( drafted 26th overall in 1973 ) and College Football Hall of Famer McKenzie ( drafted 27th overall in 1972 ) . 
 Paul Seymour , who would play his entire career with the Bills , became the team 's starting tight end .

US 730 travels east along the Columbia River as a continuation of Columbia River Highway No. 2 into Umatilla County , intersecting I @-@ 82 and US 395 in the city of Umatilla . US 730 and US 395 form a short concurrency within the city before the highways part , with US 730 continuing northeast into Washington . The highway travels through rural Walla Walla County and ends at an intersection with US 12 south of Wallula . 
 US 730 was created with the original United States Highways on November 11 , 1926 , traveling on the existing Columbia River Highway , established in 1917 , from US 30 in Umatilla to US 410 south of Wallula . The Washington section of US 730 was added to the state highway system in 1923 as a branch of State Road 3 , later becoming a branch of Primary State Highway 3 ( PSH 3 ) in 1937 . The highway was concurrent with US 395 from 1937 until 1985 , traveling from Cold Springs Junction to US 410 . US 30 was moved to a new route bypassing Umatilla and Irrigon in 1946 , allowing for US 730 to be extended southwest to Boardman , later to an interchange with I @-@ 84 .

From Irrigon , US 730 continues northeast along the Columbia River into Umatilla County and becomes 6th Street in the city of Umatilla . The highway intersects I @-@ 82 and US 395 in a diamond interchange and forms a short concurrency with US 395 . US 730 continues east through the unincorporated community of McNary and the northern terminus of Oregon Route 207 ( OR 207 ) in rural Umatilla County . The highway turns northeastward along Lake Wallula and intersects OR 37 at Cold Springs Junction , providing connections north to the Warehouse Beach Recreation Area and Hat Rock State Park on the Columbia River and south to the city of Pendleton . US 730 heads into Washington , traveling between a Union Pacific rail line and the canyon walls of the Columbia River Gorge . An ODOT survey measuring traffic volume for any average day of the year , expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) , was conducted in 2011 on US 730 and calculated that the busiest section of the highway in Oregon was at its interchange with I @-@ 82 , serving 11 @,@ 800 vehicles , while the least busy section of the highway was at the Washington state line , serving 2 @,@ 500 vehicles .

 The highway that became US 730 within Oregon has been designated by the Oregon State Highway Commission as the easternmost segment of Columbia River Highway No. 2 since November 27 , 1917 , created as part of the initial named state highway system . The segment of US 730 within Washington was added to the state highway system in 1923 as a branch of State Road 3 and kept its designation as a branch of PSH 3 during the creation of the primary and secondary highway system in 1937 . The United States Highway System was adopted on November 11 , 1926 , by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) and included US 730 , traveling northeast along the Columbia River from US 30 in Umatilla to US 410 south of Wallula . US 395 was extended south from Spokane , Washington , to San Diego , California , in 1937 , becoming concurrent with US 730 between Cold Springs Junction and its eastern terminus at US 410 south of Wallula . US 30 was moved to a new section of the Old Oregon Trail Highway No. 6 , bypassing the cities of Irrigon and Umatilla , on November 25 , 1946 . 
 US 730 was subsequently extended west in 1962 to an intersection with US 30 at Boardman Junction , and was moved further south to an interchange with I @-@ 80N in 1967 . During the westward extension of US 12 from Idaho into Washington , ODOT suggested to the AASHO a route that included the entirety of US 730 in 1962 , while WSDOT suggested routing US 12 over US 410 and Washington State Route 12 ( SR 12 ) to Vancouver , Washington . The AASHO approved the extension of US 12 into Washington on June 20 , 1967 , routing it along US 410 and SR 14 to its present terminus in Aberdeen . US 395 was re @-@ aligned to a concurrency with I @-@ 82 in 1985 , crossing the Columbia River on the Umatilla Bridge and having a shorter concurrency with US 730 . The old route of US 395 from Cold Springs Junction to Pendleton , part of Pendleton @-@ Cold Springs Highway No. 36 , became Oregon Route 37 .

 = 2009 Women 's Cricket World Cup Final = 
 The 2009 Women 's Cricket World Cup Final was a cricket match between New Zealand and England played on 22 March 2009 at the North Sydney Oval in Australia . It was the culmination of the 2009 Women 's Cricket World Cup , the ninth Women 's Cricket World Cup . England won the final by four wickets , clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England . It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup – England won their previous final contest in 1993 . 
 After winning the toss , New Zealand captain <unk> Tiffen opted to bat first . Her side were bowled out in 47 @.@ 2 overs for a total of 166 runs . All @-@ rounder Lucy Doolan , batting at number nine , was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48 . England bowler Nicky Shaw took a career @-@ best four wickets for 34 runs . In their response , England built an opening partnership of 74 runs and continued to score steadily . Despite regularly losing wickets , they reached the winning total with 23 balls to spare , earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years . Shaw , who had initially not been included in the England team , was named player of the match after replacing the injured Jenny Gunn just minutes before the start of the match .

 New Zealand were drawn in Group A of the competition , along with the West Indies , South Africa and their " traditional rivals " Australia . They started their campaign against Australia . <unk> Tiffen scored a cautious half @-@ century for New Zealand , but her dismissal triggered a collapse in which the team lost seven wickets for the addition of 34 runs . In their reply , Australia regularly lost wickets , and a six over bowling spell by Kate Pulford , in which she took three wickets for 30 runs , slowed the run chase . After an initial rain delay held up the game , a second downpour finished the match , with Australia 13 runs short by the Duckworth – Lewis method . Tiffen missed New Zealand 's second match , against the West Indies , with an injury , and Aimee Mason deputised as captain . For the second time in as many matches , New Zealand suffered a collapse , losing their first six wickets for 104 runs . A seventh @-@ wicket partnership of 57 between Mason and Sarah <unk> helped New Zealand to remain competitive in the match , and they completed their 50 overs with 192 runs . According to Cricinfo , the West Indian reply " was devoid of momentum " . Spin bowlers Mason and Lucy Doolan took three wickets apiece to limit the West Indies to 136 runs for the loss of eight wickets from their overs . In their final group stage match , New Zealand ensured that they won the group with a big win over South Africa . Amy Satterthwaite , Sara McGlashan and Nicola Browne all scored half @-@ centuries as their team reached a total of 250 for five . South Africa struggled in their chase : only Cri @-@ Zelda Brits reached double figures in an innings dominated by the bowling of Mason and Suzie Bates , who collected four wickets each . 
 England were placed in Group B , alongside India , Pakistan and Sri Lanka . In their first contest , against Sri Lanka , they scored 277 runs , aided by a 95 @-@ ball century from Claire Taylor , and a half @-@ century by Caroline Atkins . Sri Lanka batted their full allocation of overs , but lost by 100 runs . Laura Marsh took three wickets , and three of the Sri Lankan batsmen were run out in their chase . Following the match , Jenny Gunn 's bowling action was reported to the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) as being potentially illegal , but she was cleared a few days later . England faced India in their second match , in a contest billed as the battle for top spot in the group . England won the match easily , bowling India out for 169 ; with Gunn and Holly Colvin each taking three wickets , and unbeaten half @-@ centuries from both Atkins and Claire Taylor . Another large win , over Pakistan , guaranteed England finished as group winners . Marsh took a career @-@ best five wickets to help bowl Pakistan out for just 78 runs , a total which her side reached in less than half of their allowed overs . 
 = = = Super Sixes = = = 
 England and New Zealand met each other in the first match of the Super Sixes . England batted first , and despite being 96 for four at one stage , 57 runs from captain Charlotte Edwards , and a rapid 22 runs from Gunn , helped their side recover to post a total of 201 for five . In response , New Zealand began positively , and were boosted by a half @-@ century from their captain , Tiffen , but the spin bowling of Edwards , Marsh and Colvin controlled the run rate , and New Zealand were eventually bowled out for 170 , Edwards taking four wickets . England 's following match was against the West Indies , and they once again surpassed 200 runs after batting first . Sarah Taylor , Claire Taylor and Atkins all scored half @-@ centuries to propel England to their total of 236 for eight . The English bowlers then dismissed the West Indies for 90 runs , with Marsh collecting three wickets . The win secured England a place in the final , irrespective of the result in their final match against Australia . 
 In their second match , New Zealand faced an Indian side which had beaten Australia in their first Super Six contest . India batted first and scored 207 , during an innings in which they lost four batsmen to run outs . New Zealand began their response well , putting on a partnership of 78 runs for the first wicket between Pulford and Tiffen . After Tiffen 's dismissal , Bates supported Pulford , who eventually fell for 71 runs , and New Zealand reached their target with 14 balls to spare . New Zealand set a record partnership for the second wicket in women 's ODIs in their final match : Bates scored 168 and Tiffen 100 as the pair put on 262 runs together . Bates played an aggressive innings , scoring her runs from 105 balls , including 6 sixes and 19 fours . New Zealand reached 373 from their overs , and bowled Pakistan out for 150 , granting themselves a 223 run victory , and qualifying for the final . England were outplayed by Australia in their final Super Six match : Shelley Nitschke slowed the run rate during her bowling , taking two wickets and restricting England to just fourteen runs from her ten overs . England were bowled out for 161 , a total Australia chased down within 34 overs .

 Prior to the start of the competition , Jenny Roesler of Cricinfo suggested England and New Zealand , along with Australia , as the favourites to win the competition . The final was a repeat of the 1993 final , when England won at Lord 's . Both sides had won the World Cup previously , but only when hosting the tournament . New Zealand achieved the feat in 2000 , while England were winners in both 1973 and 1993 . In addition to losing the 1993 final to England , New Zealand were also finalists in 1997 , losing to Australia in India . England had contested five previous finals ; losing to Australia in subsequent tournaments in 1978 , 1982 and 1988 . England all @-@ rounder Gunn aggravated a calf @-@ strain during the warm @-@ up , and was replaced by the team 's vice @-@ captain Nicky Shaw , who had previously been omitted from the side . Huw Richards , writing for the International Herald Tribune , described both England and New Zealand as worthy finalists , and noted that he was disappointed with the performance of Australia , who finished fourth .

 The final was played on " a gloriously sunny day " at the North Sydney Oval , a multi @-@ purpose stadium in North Sydney , New South Wales . The ground had hosted a number of matches earlier in the tournament , and during the 1988 Women 's Cricket World Cup , but has never hosted men 's international cricket . The match , played in front of 2 @,@ 300 people , began at 10 : 00 <unk> , with a scheduled lunch interval from 13 @.@ 10 to 13 @.@ 55 . Steve Davis , of Australia , and the South African Brian Jerling were appointed as the on @-@ field umpires for the match . Davis was a member of the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires , the highest designation for an umpire , while Jerling was on the International Panel of Umpires and Referees , the next most senior designation . Tyron <unk> and Jeff Brookes fulfilled the off @-@ field roles of third and fourth umpires respectively , and Brian Aldridge served as match referee . Aldridge had previously umpired the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final . 
 Despite conditions conducive to swing bowling , New Zealand 's captain , Tiffen , chose to bat first after winning the toss . England opened the bowling with seam from one end , provided by Katherine Brunt , and spin at the other , from Isa Guha . Brunt 's bowling spell was described by the BBC 's Aimee Lewis as " superb " , and team @-@ mate Shaw credited her with putting the New Zealand batsmen under pressure . New Zealand progressed to 46 for the loss of just the opener Pulford , before England made their first bowling change . The England vice @-@ captain , Shaw , was brought on , and made an immediate impact . From her third ball , Bates mistimed an attempted loft over mid @-@ on , and was caught by Atkins . The following ball , Satterthwaite fell for a duck , edging an <unk> delivery to the wicket @-@ keeper , Sarah Taylor . Four overs later , Tiffen was also dismissed by Shaw , providing a thick edge to Sarah Taylor . Although middle @-@ order batsmen McGlashan and Mason both got starts , New Zealand collapsed to 101 for seven . Doolan joined Browne at the crease , and the pair provided their side with some degree of a recovery : Doolan scored 48 runs in a partnership of 63 to help New Zealand to their total of 166 . After the dismissal of Doolan , who was stumped off a wide delivery , New Zealand subsided rapidly , losing their final two wickets for just two more runs . The New Zealand Herald criticised the batting as being " indifferent " , but Richards credited England for their " tight bowling and fielding " to restrict New Zealand . 
 In their response , England began confidently : opening batsmen Atkins and Sarah Taylor built a partnership larger than any managed by New Zealand , scoring 74 runs before the dismissal of Taylor for 39 . Atkins played a more patient innings than Taylor , and scored the most runs for her side , accruing 40 from 85 balls . Claire Taylor came to the crease upon Sarah Taylor 's dismissal and played with a similar attacking intent , striking four boundaries during her 21 runs before she was bowled by Mason . England 's middle order suffered their own collapse against the opposition spin bowlers Doolan and Mason , their scoring rate slowing significantly from 4 @.@ 78 runs per over at the end of the fourteenth over to 3 @.@ 58 twenty overs later . Edwards was given out after being caught by wicket @-@ keeper Rachel Priest for 10 runs , though she did not actually hit the ball . Despite their struggles through the middle overs , Richards opined that " England never looked like losing . " It was Shaw who once again galvanised England , batting with a more attacking style than those that had struggled before her . Her score of 17 not out pushed England towards the winning target , and a single from Colvin secured victory for England with 23 balls remaining in the innings . Shaw 's contribution earnt her the player of the match accolade .

 Interstate 359 ( I @-@ 359 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System in the US state of Alabama . It is a spur route that runs for 2 @.@ 76 miles ( 4 @.@ 44 km ) entirely within the city limits of Tuscaloosa . Its termini are just south of I @-@ 20 / I @-@ 59 interchange on the south side of town and U.S. Highway 43 ( US 43 ) in downtown Tuscaloosa . The entire length is concurrent with U.S. Highway 11 ( US 11 ) and Alabama State Route 69 ( SR 69 ) , with both continuing as at grade thoroughfares north and south of the shorter Interstate . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 359 begins just south of the I @-@ 20 / 59 interchange at the western terminus of Skyland Boulevard ( US 11 , SR 7 ) and SR 69 . From this point the route travels in a northerly direction where it meets Interstate 20 / 59 at a partial cloverleaf interchange . The route reaches its first exit at 35th Street in a half cloverleaf configuration , which provides access to the University of Alabama . I @-@ 359 then continues in a northerly direction paralleling Greensboro Avenue to its northern terminus just north of 15th Street where the limited access freeway transitions into an at grade thoroughfare as it enters downtown Tuscaloosa . 
 From its crossing of the Alabama Great Southern Railroad ( AGS ) through the northern terminus , the highway in its entirety is elevated along a continuous bridge span . I @-@ 359 also features a wrong @-@ way concurrency for its entire duration with travel from downtown Tuscaloosa being signed as both I @-@ 359 and SR 69 south and US 11 north , and with travel from the south being signed both I @-@ 359 and SR 69 north and US 11 south .

 In the early 1960s , local planners and elected officials stated the need for direct access to Interstate 59 from the city of Tuscaloosa . As annexation had not yet brought the city limits to the I @-@ 59 corridor , Interstate 359 was originally to be the only access provided to I @-@ 59 directly from Tuscaloosa . The route , as originally envisioned , was to have no exits for the duration of its route between its southern terminus at I @-@ 59 and its northern terminus at 15th Street in downtown Tuscaloosa . 
 Actual planning for I @-@ 359 commenced in 1961 , and by 1971 , the Alabama Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) announced that federal funding would be sought for its construction . Planning for the corridor continued throughout the 1970s , only to stall briefly due to complications with the required environmental impact assessment associated with the project . By 1976 , it was announced I @-@ 359 would have an exit both at 35th Street and 15th Street to improve access to both the University of Alabama and Stillman College . 
 In 1977 , <unk> publicly unveiled the final routing of the route and presented it at a series of public meetings in August 1977 . The selected route resulted in the slight relocation of 35th Street , the construction of a bridge along 31st Street over the freeway and the construction of a continuous viaduct along the final leg of the freeway through its 15th Street junction . Plans were also unveiled to add an additional travel lane in each direction along I @-@ 20 / 59 between its junction with I @-@ 359 and McFarland Boulevard . 
 Following the acquisition of the necessary right @-@ of @-@ way , phasing of the project was released in June 1979 . The first phase included the completion of the interchange at I @-@ 20 / 59 and lane expansion ; the second phase included the segment between I @-@ 20 / 59 and the AGS railroad crossing ; and the third phase included the elevated segment through the northern terminus in downtown Tuscaloosa . Construction would commence in 1980 on the first phase , with the bid for the second phase setting a then @-@ record for cost for a Tuscaloosa road project at $ 11 @,@ 884 @,@ 450 . As construction was wrapping up on phase two , phase three of the project again set a record cost at $ 17 @.@ 4 million in January 1982 . The phase included the completion of the viaduct section of the freeway , constructed at an average elevation of 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) above grade . The first segment of I @-@ 359 opened to traffic in October 1982 between I @-@ 20 / 59 and Exit 1 . Costing $ 41 million at completion , I @-@ 359 was officially dedicated and opened for traffic on September 13 , 1983 .

 = Zuihō @-@ class aircraft carrier = 
 The Zuihō class ( <unk> ) was a group of two aircraft carriers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy before World War II . Both ships were originally built as submarine tenders , but were subsequently converted into carriers . Completed in early 1942 , Shōhō supported the invasion forces in Operation MO , the invasion of Port Moresby , New Guinea , and was sunk by American carrier aircraft on her first combat operation during the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 May . Shōhō was the first Japanese aircraft carrier to be sunk during World War II . Zuihō played a secondary role in the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 and did not engage any American aircraft or ships during the battle . The ship participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign during the rest of 1942 . She was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands during this campaign and covered the evacuation of Japanese forces from the island in early 1943 after repairs . 
 Afterwards , her aircraft were disembarked several times in mid to late 1943 and used from land bases in a number of battles in the South West Pacific . Zuihō participated in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in mid @-@ 1944 . In this last battle , Zuihō mainly served as a decoy for the main striking forces and she was finally sunk by American aircraft fulfilling her task . In between engagements , the ship served as a ferry carrier and a training ship . 
 = = Design , construction and conversion = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1930s , the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to build a class of two submarine tenders which could be converted into light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers . The first ship , Tsurugizaki , was commissioned into service in 1939 . Construction of the second , Takasaki , was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as an aircraft carrier . The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940 . In early 1941 , Tsurugizaki was taken out of service , converted to an aircraft carrier , and recommissioned as Shōhō in early 1942 . 
 After their conversion , the ships had a length of 205 @.@ 5 meters ( 674 ft 2 in ) overall . They had a beam of 18 @.@ 2 m ( 59 ft 8 in ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 58 m ( 21 ft 7 in ) . They displaced 11 @,@ 443 tonnes ( 11 @,@ 262 long tons ) at standard load . As part of their conversion , their original diesel engines , which had given them a top speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) , were replaced by a pair of destroyer @-@ type geared steam turbine sets with a total of 52 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 39 @,@ 000 kW ) , each driving one propeller . Steam was provided by four Kampon water @-@ tube boilers and they now had a maximum speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . The boilers exhausted through a single downturned starboard funnel and the ships carried 2 @,@ 642 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 600 long tons ) of fuel oil , giving them a range of 7 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 400 km ; 9 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Their crew numbered 785 officers and men . 
 Their flight deck was 180 m ( 590 ft 6 in ) long and had a maximum width of 23 m ( 75 ft 6 in ) . The ships were designed with a single hangar 124 m ( 406 ft 10 in ) long and 18 m ( 59 ft ) wide . The hangar was served by two octagonal centerline aircraft elevators . The forward elevator was 13 by 12 meters ( 42 ft 8 in × 39 ft 4 in ) in size and the smaller rear elevator measured 12 by 10 @.@ 8 meters ( 39 ft 4 in × 35 ft 5 in ) . The ships had arresting gear with six cables , but they were not fitted with an aircraft catapult . The Zuihō @-@ class carriers were a flush @-@ deck design and lacked an island superstructure . They were designed to operate 30 aircraft . 
 The primary armament consisted of eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm Type 89 anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull . They fired 23 @.@ 45 @-@ kilogram ( 51 @.@ 7 lb ) projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of 700 – 725 m / s ( 2 @,@ 300 – 2 @,@ 380 ft / s ) ; at 45 ° , this provided a maximum range of 14 @,@ 800 meters ( 16 @,@ 200 yd ) , and a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 400 meters ( 30 @,@ 800 ft ) . The ships were also initially equipped with four twin 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns , also in sponsons along the sides of the hull . They fired .25 @-@ kilogram ( 0 @.@ 55 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 900 m / s ( 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ) ; at 50 ° , this provided a maximum range of 7 @,@ 500 meters ( 8 @,@ 202 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 meters ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . In 1943 , Zuihō 's light AA armament was increased to 48 twenty @-@ five mm guns . The following year , an additional twenty 25 mm guns were added in addition to six 28 @-@ round AA rocket launchers . Each 12 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) rocket weighed 22 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 50 lb ) and had a maximum velocity of 200 m / s ( 660 ft / s ) . Their maximum range was 4 @,@ 800 meters ( 5 @,@ 200 yd ) .

 After commissioning , Zuihō remained in Japanese waters until late 1941 , becoming the flagship of the Third Carrier Division on 30 September . Together with the carrier Hōshō and eight battleships , Zuihō covered the return of the ships of the 1st Air Fleet as they returned from the Attack on Pearl Harbor in mid @-@ December . Aside from one trip to transport aircraft to the Philippines , she remained in Japanese waters until June 1942 . 
 While still fitting @-@ out , Shōhō was assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet on 22 December 1941 . On 4 February 1942 , she ferried aircraft to Truk , where she remained until 11 April before returning to Yokosuka . In late April 1942 , Shōhō was assigned to Operation MO and arrived in Truk on 29 April . The following day , she departed Truk in company with four heavy cruisers and they formed the Main Force of the operation . Due to aircraft shortages , her aircraft complement consisted of only four obsolete Mitsubishi A5M " Claude " and eight modern Mitsubishi A6M2 " Zero " fighters plus six Nakajima B5N2 " Kate " torpedo bombers . Covering the other elements of Operation MO was the Striking Force that consisted of the fleet carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku . 
 = = = Battle of the Coral Sea = = = 
 After covering the landings on Tulagi on 3 May , Shōhō headed north to cover the invasion convoy the next day and was not present when aircraft from the American carrier Yorktown attacked Japanese shipping at Tulagi . This air strike confirmed that at least one American carrier was in the vicinity , but the Japanese had no idea of its location . They launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans , but without result . US Army Air Force ( USAAF ) aircraft spotted Shōhō southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May , but she was too far north to be attacked by the American carriers , which were refueling . That day , Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher received Ultra intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation MO near Bougainville , and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion . It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May . Based on this information , Fletcher planned to complete refueling his ships on 6 May and move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea to be in a position to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May . 
 American reconnaissance aircraft reported two Japanese heavy cruisers northeast of Misima Island in the Louisiade Archipelago off the eastern tip of New Guinea at <unk> and two carriers at 0815 on 7 May . An hour later Fletcher ordered an airstrike launched , believing that the two carriers reported were Shōkaku and Zuikaku . Lexington and Yorktown launched a total of 53 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and 22 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers escorted by 18 F4F Wildcats . The 0815 report turned out to be miscoded , as the pilot had intended to report two heavy cruisers , but USAAF aircraft had spotted Shōhō , her escorts and the invasion convoy in the meantime . As the latest spot report plotted only 30 nautical miles ( 56 km ; 35 mi ) away from the 0815 report , the aircraft en route were diverted to this new target . 
 Shōhō and the rest of the Main Force were spotted by aircraft from Lexington at 1040 . At this time , Shōhō 's combat air patrol ( CAP ) consisted of two A5Ms and one A6M Zero . The first dive bomber attacks all missed and the CAP shot down one Dauntless after it had dropped its bomb . The second squadron of Dauntlesses followed shortly afterwards and they hit Shōhō twice with 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 450 kg ) bombs . These penetrated the ship 's flight deck and burst inside her hangars , setting the fueled and armed aircraft there on fire . A minute later the Devastators of VT @-@ 2 began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of the ship . They hit Shōhō five times and the damage from the hits knocked out her steering and power . In addition , the hits flooded both engine and boiler rooms . Yorktown 's aircraft delivered the coup de grace with another eleven hits from 1000 @-@ pound bombs in addition to two more torpedo hits . After his attack , Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Dixon , commander of VS @-@ 2 , radioed his famous message to the American carriers : " Scratch one flat top ! " 
 Shōhō was ordered abandoned at 1131 and sank four minutes later . Some 300 men successfully abandoned the ship , but they had to await rescue as the remaining ships of the Main Force headed north at high speed to avoid any further airstrikes . Around 1400 , the destroyer Sazanami returned to the scene and rescued only 203 survivors , the rest of her crew of 834 died during the attack or in the water awaiting rescue . Shōhō was the first Japanese aircraft carrier lost during the war . 
 Zuihō led the Support Fleet during the Battle of Midway and did not engage American carriers directly . Her aircraft complement consisted of six Mitsubishi A5M " Claude " and six Mitsubishi A6M2 " Zero " fighters , and twelve Nakajima B5N2 " Kate " torpedo bombers . After a brief refit in July – August , the ship was assigned to First Carrier Division with Shōkaku and Zuikaku on 12 August . 
 The division sailed to Truk on 1 October to support Japanese forces in the Guadalcanal Campaign and left Truk on 11 October based on the promise of the Japanese Army to capture Henderson Field on Guadalcanal . At this time , Zuihō carried 18 A6Ms and 6 B5Ns . The Japanese and American carrier forces discovered each other in the early morning of 26 October during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and each side launched air strikes . The aircraft passed each other en route and nine of Zuihō 's Zeros attacked the aircraft launched by the USS Enterprise . They shot down three each Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters and Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and damaged one more of each type while losing four of their own . Two of Enterprise 's Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers hit Zuihō with 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bombs and damaged her flight deck enough that she could not conduct flight operations although she was not seriously damaged otherwise . Together with the damaged Shōkaku , the ship withdrew from the battle and reached Truk two days later . After temporary repairs , the two carriers returned to Japan in early November and Zuihō 's repairs were completed on 16 December . 
 The ship left Kure on 17 January 1943 and sailed for Truk with a load of aircraft . Upon arrival she was assigned to the Second Carrier Division to provide cover for the evacuation of Guadalcanal , along with Jun 'yō and Zuikaku , later in the month and in early February . Zuihō arrived at Sasebo on 9 May and received a brief refit in mid @-@ June . She returned to Truk on 15 July and remained in the area until 5 November when she returned to Yokosuka . By this time , Zuihō was assigned to the First Carrier Division with Shōkaku and Zuikaku and they sailed for Eniwetok Atoll on 18 September for training and to be in position to intercept any attacks by American carriers in the vicinity of Wake Island and the Marshall Islands area . That day the American carriers raided the Gilbert Islands and were gone by the time the Japanese reached Eniwetok on 20 September . 
 On 30 November , Zuihō , together with the escort carriers Chūyō and Unyō , departed Truk for Japan , escorted by four destroyers . The Americans had cracked the Japanese naval codes and positioned several submarines along their route to Yokosuka . Skate unsuccessfully attacked Zuihō on 30 November , while Sailfish torpedoed and sank Chūyō five days later with heavy loss of life . From December to May 1944 , Zuihō ferried aircraft and supplies to Truk and Guam although she was reassigned to the Third Carrier Division on 29 January , together with the converted carriers Chitose and Chiyoda . Each of the three carriers was intended to be equipped with 21 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers , but this plan was changed on 15 February to a consolidated air group , the 653rd , that controlled the aircraft of all three carriers . While fully equipped by May with 18 Zero fighters , 45 Zero fighter @-@ bombers , 18 B5Ns , and 9 Nakajima B6N " Jill " torpedo bombers , the air group 's pilots were largely drawn from the two most recent classes and lacked experience . The ship sailed for Tawi @-@ Tawi on 11 May in the Philippines . The new base was closer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands where the Japanese expected the next American attack . However , the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots and American submarines were very active in the vicinity which restricted the ships to the anchorage .

 The 1st Mobile Fleet was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June , where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines , when Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa learned of the American attack on the Mariana Islands the previous day . Upon reaching Guimares , the fleet refueled and sortied into the Philippine Sea where they spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June . The Americans failed to locate Ozawa 's ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided on launching his air strikes early the following morning . He had deployed his forces in a " T " - shaped formation with the 3rd Carrier Division at the end of the stem , 115 nautical miles ( 213 km ; 132 mi ) ahead of the 1st and 2nd Carrier Divisions that formed the crossbar of the " T " . Zuihō and her consorts were intended to draw the attentions of the Americans while the other carriers conducted their air strikes without disruption . The first wave of search aircraft spotted one group of four carriers from Task Force 58 at <unk> and the Japanese carriers launched their aircraft an hour later . This consisted of 43 Zero fighter @-@ bombers and 7 B6Ns , escorted by 14 A6M5 fighters ; the carriers retained only three fighters , two fighter @-@ bombers , two B6Ns and two B5Ns for self @-@ defense and later searches . While the air strike was still forming up , the second wave of searchers located Task Force 58 's battleships and the air strike was diverted to attack them . The Americans detected the incoming Japanese aircraft and had a total of 199 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters in the air by the time the Japanese aircraft were in range of the American ships . The defending fighters decimated the Japanese aircraft and only 21 survived , doing little damage to the American ships . Some of the surviving Japanese aircraft landed at Guam while others , including the five surviving B6Ns , returned to their carriers where they claimed one carrier definitely damaged and another probably hit . 
 At dusk , the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance . Both sides launched aircraft the next day to locate each other ; Zuihō launched three aircraft at 1200 to search east of the fleet , but they did not discover the Americans . The Americans discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched . While they sank one Japanese carrier and damaged two others , Zuihō was not attacked and successfully disengaged that evening . By the end of the battle , Air Group 653 was reduced to two Zero fighters , three Zero fighter @-@ bombers and six torpedo bombers . After reaching Japan on 1 July , the ship remained in Japanese waters until October , training replacements for her air group . 
 = = = Battle of Leyte Gulf = = = 
 After the Americans attacked the Philippines , Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October , the Japanese implemented their plan for the defense of these areas that required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces , with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations . Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines , preparatory to the actual invasion . 
 On 18 October , Admiral Soemu Toyoda activated the naval portion of the defense plan after receiving reports of the landings on Leyte . Zuihō 's role , together with Chiyoda , Chitose , Zuikaku and the rest of the Main Body of the 1st Mobile Fleet , approaching Leyte Gulf from the north , was to serve as decoys to attraction away from the two other forces approaching from the south and west . All forces were to converge on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October . As decoys , the carriers were only provided with a total of 116 aircraft : 52 Zero fighters , 28 Zero fighter @-@ bombers , 7 Yokosuka D4Y " Judy " dive bombers , 26 B6N and 4 B5N torpedo bombers . By the morning of 24 October , the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of Task Force 38 and Admiral Ozawa ordered an air strike launched to attract the attention of the Americans . This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters ; the survivors landed at airfields on Luzon . The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from Luzon and Leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon . They finally found them at 1605 , but Admiral William Halsey , Jr . , commander of Task Force 38 , decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike . He did , however , turn all of his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day in what came to be called the Battle of Cape Engaño . 
 American aircraft were able to track the Japanese ships for most of the night and Halsey ordered an air strike of 60 Hellcat fighters , 65 Helldiver dive bombers and 55 Avenger torpedo bombers launched shortly after dawn in anticipation of locating the Japanese fleet . They spotted it at <unk> and brushed aside the 13 Zeros that the Japanese had retained for self @-@ defense . Zuihō attempted to launch her few remaining aircraft , but was hit by a single bomb on her aft flight deck after a number of torpedo @-@ carrying Avengers missed . The 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb started several small fires , lifted the rear elevator , bulged the flight deck , knocked out steering and gave the ship a small list to port . Twenty minutes later , the fires were put out , steering repaired and the list corrected . A second attack an hour later focused on Chiyoda and ignored Zuihō . The third wave arrived around 1300 and badly damaged the ship . She was hit once by a torpedo and twice by small bombs , although fragments from as many as 67 near misses cut steam pipes and caused flooding of both engine rooms and one boiler room . Zuihō was forced to reduce speed to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) and flooding increased so that all available hands were ordered to man the pumps at 1410 . The ship took on a 13 ° list to starboard and went dead in the water at 1445 when the port engine room fully flooded . A fourth wave of American aircraft attacked ten minutes later , but only damaged her with splinters from another ten near misses . This was enough to increase her list to 23 ° and she was ordered abandoned at 1510 . Zuihō sank at 1526 at position 19 ° 20 ′ N 125 ° 15 ′ W with the loss of 7 officers and 208 men . The destroyer Kuwa and the battleship Ise rescued 58 officers and 701 men between them . 
 = Typhoon Xangsane = 
 Typhoon Xangsane , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Milenyo , was a deadly typhoon that affected the Philippines , Vietnam , and Thailand during the 2006 Pacific typhoon season . The name Xangsane was submitted by Laos and means elephant . 
 Xangsane made landfall in the Philippines , battering the northern islands with torrential rains and strong winds , and causing widespread flooding and landslides . After passing over Manila and emerging over the South China Sea , the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam , also causing flooding and landslides there and in Thailand . The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths , mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam , and at least $ 747 million ( 2006 USD ) in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Typhoon Xangsane originated in a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines . On September 23 , a persistent area of convective thunderstorms was observed about 100 mi ( 160 km ) northwest of Palau , in an environment favorable to tropical cyclogenesis . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) declared the formation of a tropical depression at 00 : 00 UTC on September 25 . Simultaneously , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) began warning on the tropical depression with the local name Milenyo . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ; a joint United States Navy – Air Force agency that monitors tropical cyclones globally ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert around the same time , designating the disturbance Tropical Depression 18W at 12 : 00 UTC . The system quickly organized as it drifted westward , and according to both the JMA and the JTWC , it attained tropical storm intensity near 00 : 00 UTC on September 26 . Consequently , it received the international name Xangsane . The name was submitted by Laos and means " elephant " . 
 The storm began to increase in forward speed and shift its direction toward the west @-@ northwest , attaining typhoon intensity at 18 : 00 UTC on September 26 . At the time , it was centered about 390 mi ( 630 km ) east @-@ southeast of Manila , the capital city of the Philippines . Over the next several hours , Xangsane rapidly intensified as it approached the archipelago ; the JMA estimates that the typhoon achieved its maximum 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) early on September 27 , with a corresponding central pressure of 940 millibars ( 28 inHg ) . According to the JTWC , the typhoon peaked with 1 @-@ minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) , corresponding to Category 4 strength on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . The center of the powerful storm skirted the northern coast of Samar and continued west @-@ northwestward . With a well @-@ defined eye evident on visible satellite imagery , Xangsane struck southern Luzon around 12 : 00 UTC , and remained over the Philippines for the next day or so . Due to extensive interaction with land , the typhoon 's structure deteriorated , and the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm early on September 28 . Xangsane traveled over the Manila area before entering the South China Sea and turning due west , steered by the subtropical ridge to its north over mainland China . 
 Over open waters , the system encountered conditions favorable to renewed intensification , including warm sea surface temperatures , light vertical wind shear , and strong upper @-@ level divergence . As a result , it reattained typhoon status by 18 : 00 UTC on September 28 . Continued strengthening yielded a secondary peak on September 29 , marked by 10 @-@ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , according to the JMA , and 1 @-@ minute winds of 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) as ascertained by the JTWC . Tracking westward at around 17 km / h ( 11 mph ) , Xangsane maintained its intensity until it neared Vietnam , when dry air and land interaction began to slowly diminish the typhoon on September 30 . Just after 00 : 00 UTC on October 1 , the system made landfall along the central coast of Vietnam , near Da Nang . At the time , Xangsane was a low @-@ end typhoon , with 10 @-@ minute winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . The storm quickly declined in force as it progressed inland through Indochina : it weakened to a severe tropical storm around 12 : 00 UTC , and to a tropical storm six hours later . Although the JTWC issued its final warning on Xangsane just after landfall , the agency continued to track the storm until 00 : 00 on October 2 . At the same time , the JMA downgraded Xangsane to a tropical depression ; it dissipated later that day , over Thailand .
