 = Alvin C. Graves = 
 Alvin Cushman Graves ( November 4 , 1909 – July 19 , 1965 ) was an American nuclear physicist who served at the Manhattan Project 's Metallurgical Laboratory and the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II . After the war , he became the head of J ( Test ) Division at Los Alamos , and was director or assistant director of numerous nuclear weapons tests during the 1940s and 1950s . Graves was badly injured in the 1946 laboratory criticality accident in Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin , but recovered . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Alvin Cushman Graves was born on November 4 , 1909 in Washington , DC , the youngest of six children . He was the son of Herbert C. Graves , an engineer with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and member of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace after World War I. Graves attended Eastern High School , and graduated at the top of his class from the University of Virginia in 1931 with a bachelor 's degree in electrical engineering . He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a year , but found that jobs were hard to come by during the Great Depression . He received a graduate fellowship to the University of Chicago , where he earned his Ph.D. , writing his thesis on " Packing Fraction Differences Among Heavy Elements " . 
 At Chicago , Graves met and married Elizabeth Riddle , a physics major there , who was known as " Diz " . Elizabeth Riddle Graves earned her Ph.D. , writing her thesis on " Energy Release from Beryllium @-@ 9 ( Alpha , Alpha ) Lithium @-@ 7 and the Production of Lithium @-@ 7 " . Graves remained at the University of Chicago as a research fellow and an assistant professor until 1939 , when he moved to the University of Texas . Unfortunately , Elizabeth was unable to secure a job there as well due to its anti @-@ nepotism rules . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 In 1942 Graves was invited back to the University of Chicago by Arthur H. Compton . Graves had already received a request from the MIT Radiation Laboratory to work on radar , and he asked if he could contribute more to Compton 's project . Compton replied that he could . He joined the Manhattan Project 's Metallurgical Laboratory , and helped build the first nuclear reactor , the Chicago Pile @-@ 1 . Graves , Harold V. <unk> and Warren <unk> formed Enrico Fermi 's " suicide squad " or " liquid @-@ control squad " , assigned to smash 5 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 19 l ; 4 @.@ 2 imp gal ) glass bottles containing a solution of cadmium sulfate over the reactor with hammers if something went wrong . Cadmium is a strong neutron absorber and Fermi hoped that this would halt a runaway nuclear chain reaction , if the reactor control rods proved to be incapable of halting it in the first place . 
 Graves and Elizabeth moved to work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico when it opened in 1943 . He made it a condition of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for her . This was probably unnecessary , as someone with her skills — she was one of the few physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft @-@ Walton accelerator — would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos . At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945 , Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child . Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast . They listened to Samuel K. Allison 's countdown to the explosion on the radio , and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test , which took until the afternoon to reach them , with Geiger counters . The child was a healthy daughter , Marilyn Edith . 
 Graves was badly injured in the 1946 laboratory criticality accident at Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin . Slotin , who was training Graves to replace him in his position as chief bomb assembler for Los Alamos , was demonstrating the dangerous " tickling the dragon 's tail " test to Graves and several other scientists when the accident occurred . Graves , who was nearest to Slotin , suffered an estimated dose of 390 roentgens , and was given a 50 percent chance of survival . This caused severe radiation poisoning , loss of hair and a zero semen count . After two weeks of hospitalization and a several weeks of convalescence , he seemed to have recovered fully , and in a few months was back at work and skiing vigorously , with only a bald spot on the head to show for the experience . Two years later he fathered a healthy child , their second , a son they named Alvin Palmer . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Graves became dismissive of the radiation risks from nuclear testing while serving as test director for the Nevada Test Site shots during the 1950s . He announced that the risks from fallout were " concocted in the minds of weak malingerers . " As a spokesman for the Nevada Test Site , he spoke in local areas around Nevada assuring the population of no danger from the activities there . As the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory 's J ( Test ) Division , he was the scientific director or deputy director of most of the nuclear tests from 1948 through the 1950s , including the Desert Rock exercises which exposed military personnel to radiation , and the Castle Bravo test that irradiated many native islanders and test personnel . Asked to testify before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on the danger of radiation causing cancer , Graves replied : 
 The danger is not that this will happen to you . The danger is that it is more likely to happen to you . Maybe the more likely is not very much more likely , but it is still more likely . 
 Graves was a pillar of the Los Alamos community . He was an active member of the non @-@ denominational Protestant Community Church . With the encouragement of Elizabeth , who played the violin , he learned to play the cello , hoarding his petrol ration stamps so that he could travel to Santa Fe , New Mexico , for lessons . He played in the Los Alamos Symphony , accompanying local performances of Gilbert and Sullivan and Handel 's Messiah . He was chairman of the board of the local bank , and a member of the local school board . 
 Graves died of a heart attack on July 19 , 1965 while skiing in Del Norte , Colorado , twenty years after the Slotin accident , at the age of 55 . He had suffered from hypertension even before the 1946 accident , and had a minor heart attack in December 1955 . His father had also died of a heart attack . A 1978 follow @-@ up study of the Slotin accident victims suggested that latent systemic damage from the accident contributed to heart failure . He was interred in the Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos , New Mexico . 
 = 1984 European Super Cup = 
 The 1984 European Super Cup was an association football match between Italian team Juventus and English team Liverpool , which took place on 16 January 1985 at the Stadio Comunale . The match was the annual European Super Cup contested between the winners of the European Cup and European Cup Winners ' Cup . At the time , the European Super Cup was generally a two @-@ legged fixture , but only the first leg ( in Turin ) was played , due to fixture congestion . 
 Juventus were appearing in the Super Cup for the first time . Liverpool were appearing in the competition for the third time , they had won the competition in 1977 , and lost in 1978 to Belgian team Anderlecht . Juventus won the 1983 – 84 European Cup Winners ' Cup , beating Portuguese team Porto 2 – 1 in the final . Liverpool qualified by winning the 1983 – 84 European Cup . They beat Italian team Roma 4 – 2 in a penalty shootout after the final had finished 1 – 1 . 
 Watched by a crowd of 55 @,@ 384 , Juventus took the lead in the first half when Zbigniew Boniek scored in the 39th minute . Boniek scored again in the second half to give Juventus a 2 – 0 lead which they held on to until the end of the match to win their first Super Cup . The two clubs met later in the season in the 1985 European Cup Final , which resulted in the death of 39 spectators due to a disaster that occurred prior to kick @-@ off . Juventus won the match 1 – 0 .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The European Super Cup was founded in the early 1970s , as a means to determine the best team in Europe and serve as a challenge to Ajax , the strongest club side of its day . The proposal by Dutch journalist Anton Witkamp , a football match between the holders of the European Cup and Cup Winners ' Cup , failed to receive UEFA 's backing , given the recent Cup Winners ' Cup winners Rangers had been banned from European competition . Witkamp nonetheless proceeded with his vision , a two @-@ legged match played between Ajax and Rangers in January 1973 . The competition was endorsed and recognised by UEFA a year later . 
 Juventus qualified for the Super Cup as the reigning European Cup Winners ' Cup winners . They had remained unbeaten throughout the 1983 – 84 European Cup Winners ' Cup , and beat Porto 2 – 1 in the final . It was Juventus ' first appearance in the competition . 
 Liverpool had qualified for the competition as a result of winning the 1983 – 84 European Cup . They had beaten Roma 4 – 2 in a penalty shootout , after the match had finished 1 – 1 . Liverpool were appearing in their third Super Cup . They won the competition on their first appearance in 1977 , beating German team Hamburg 7 – 1 on aggregate . Their other appearance in 1978 resulted in a defeat to Belgian team Anderlecht . 
 Traditionally , the Super Cup had been played over two legs , but due to both clubs experiencing fixture congestion , was played as a one @-@ off match in Turin in January 1985 . 
 = = = Summary = = = 
 Bad weather in Turin created doubt about whether the match could be completed . However , the referee decided to go ahead with the match . Liverpool were without striker Kenny Dalglish who was suspended . Liverpool struggled to gain a foothold in the match in the first half and were behind when Juventus scored in the 40th minute . A mishit pass by Massimo Briaschi found Zbigniew Boniek whose subsequent shot from the edge of the Liverpool penalty area beat goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar to give Juventus a 1 – 0 lead . Liverpool had a chance to equalise before the end of the first half , but midfielder John Wark put his shot wide of the Juventus goal . Liverpool started the second half without defender Mark Lawrenson who had injured himself during the first half , he was replaced by Gary Gillespie . Liverpool tried to level the match in the second half , but their best chances came from midfielder Ronnie Whelan whose shots from distance did not result in any goals . Juventus extended their lead late in the second half when Boniek scored again . A cross from Briaschi found Boniek , whose shot beat Grobbelaar to extend Juventus ' lead to 2 – 0 . Five minutes later , Juventus nearly extended their lead again . However , striker Paolo Rossi 's shot was saved by Grobbelaar . Juventus held onto their lead to win the match 2 – 0 and win the Super Cup .

 The two sides met again at the end of the season in the 1985 European Cup Final . However , the events of the match were overshadowed by the disaster that occurred before kick @-@ off . Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans . The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse , killing 39 people and injuring hundreds . English clubs were banned indefinitely from European competition , with a condition that when the ban was lifted , Liverpool would serve an extra three @-@ year ban . The ban eventually lasted for five years , clubs returning to European competition in the 1990 – 91 season . Juventus won the match 1 – 0 to win the European Cup for the first time . 
 Liverpool finished second in the First Division during the 1984 – 85 Football League . They were thirteen points behind champions Everton . Juventus finished the 1984 – 85 Serie A in sixth place , seven points behind champions Hellas Verona . 
 = Same @-@ sex marriage in Spain = 
 Same @-@ sex marriage has been legally recognized in Spain since 3 July 2005 . In 2004 , the nation 's newly elected Socialist Party ( PSOE ) government , led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , began a campaign for its legalization , including the right of adoption by same @-@ sex couples . After much debate , a law permitting same @-@ sex marriage was passed by the Cortes Generales ( Spain 's bicameral parliament , composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies ) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005 . The law took effect the next day , making Spain the third country in the world to allow same @-@ sex couples to marry across the entire country , after the Netherlands and Belgium , and 17 days ahead of the right being extended across all of Canada . 
 The ratification of this law was not devoid of conflict , despite support from 66 % of the population . Roman Catholic authorities in particular were adamantly opposed , criticising what they regarded as the weakening of the meaning of marriage . Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children . Demonstrations for and against the law drew thousands of people from all parts of Spain . After its approval , the conservative People 's Party challenged the law in the Constitutional Court . 
 Approximately 4 @,@ 500 same @-@ sex couples married in Spain during the first year of the law . Shortly after the law was passed , questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non @-@ Spaniards whose country did not permit same @-@ sex marriage . A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country 's same @-@ sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non @-@ Spaniard regardless of whether that person 's homeland recognizes the partnership . At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry , although two non @-@ Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain . 
 The November 2011 general election delivered a landslide victory to the People 's Party , whose leader Mariano Rajoy said that he opposed same @-@ sex marriage , but any decision about repealing the law could be made only after the ruling of the Constitutional Court . On 6 November 2012 , the law was upheld by the Court with 8 support votes and 3 against . Minister of Justice Alberto Ruiz @-@ <unk> announced that the government will abide the ruling and the law will not be repealed . 
 = = History = = 
 During the 1990s and early 2000s , several city councils and autonomous communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex , although the effect was mainly symbolic . Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain 's autonomous communities ; Catalonia ( 1998 ) , Aragon ( 1999 ) , Navarre ( 2000 ) , Castile @-@ La Mancha ( 2000 ) , Valencia ( 2001 ) , Balearic Islands ( 2001 ) , Madrid ( 2001 ) , Asturias ( 2002 ) , Andalusia ( 2002 ) , Castile and León ( 2002 ) , Extremadura ( 2003 ) , Basque Country ( 2003 ) , Canary Islands ( 2003 ) , Cantabria ( 2005 ) , Galicia ( 2008 ) and La Rioja ( 2010 ) , and in both autonomous cities ; Ceuta ( 1998 ) and Melilla ( 2008 ) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children ; thus , a same @-@ sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption , but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died . Same @-@ sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities , because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage . 
 The Socialist Party ( PSOE ) manifesto for the 2004 general election included the pledge of amending the Civil Code to legalize same @-@ sex marriage , granting it the same status as heterosexual marriage in order to " ensure full social and legal equality for lesbians and gays " . After the socialists ' victory in the election , the new Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero promised at his inauguration address to bring this change forward : " The moment has finally arrived to end once and for all the intolerable discrimination which many Spaniards suffer because of their sexual preferences . ( ... ) As a result , we will modify the Civil Code to recognize their equal right to marriage with the resulting effects over inheritance , labor rights and social security protection " . On 30 June 2004 , the then Minister of Justice Juan Fernando López Aguilar announced that the Congress of Deputies had provisionally approved a government plan for legislation to extend the right of marriage to same @-@ sex couples . López Aguilar also announced two propositions , introduced by the regional Convergence and Union party of Catalonia : one introduced legal status for both <unk> and same @-@ sex common @-@ law unions ( <unk> de hecho , " de facto unions " ) , while the other permitted transgender people to legally change their name and sex designation without the requirement of surgery . The bill regarding same @-@ sex marriage was approved by the Cabinet on 1 October 2004 , submitted to Parliament on 31 December , and passed by the Congress of Deputies on 21 April 2005 . However , it was rejected on 22 June 2005 by the Senate , where the opposition People 's Party held a plurality of the seats . The bill was returned to the lower house , which holds the power to override the Senate , and final approval was given to the bill on 30 June 2005 with 187 " yes " votes , 147 " no " votes , and 4 abstentions . 
 With the final approval , and enactment of the bill on 2 July 2005 , Spain became the third country in the world to formally legalize same @-@ sex marriages nationwide , after the Netherlands and Belgium . 
 The first same @-@ sex wedding took place eight days after the bill became law , and was celebrated in the council chamber in the Madrid suburb of Tres Cantos by Carlos <unk> and Emilio Menéndez . The first same @-@ sex marriage between women took place in Barcelona eleven days later . 
 In spite of these steps toward equal treatment , a legal flaw remained : if children were born within a lesbian marriage , the non @-@ biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent ; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption . This right was granted to heterosexual couples ( married or not ) , where a stepfather could declare his wife 's children to be his without further process . On 7 November 2006 , the government amended the law on assisted reproduction , allowing the non @-@ biological mother to be regarded as a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth @-@ mother . 
 = = = Ratification of Law 13 / 2005 = = = 
 The projected bill announced on 30 June 2004 by the Minister of Justice was studied by the General Council of the Judiciary . Although the General Council admitted that the existing discrimination against homosexuals could not be condoned , it was quite critical about extending marriage toward same @-@ sex couples ( including collateral adoption ) . It argued that the extension was not demanded by the Constitution , and that ending discrimination could be achieved through other legal means , such as the extension of civil unions . 
 Despite this negative report , the government presented the bill to Congress on 1 October 2004 . With the exception of the People 's Party and members of the Democratic Union of Catalonia , the different parliamentary parties favoured the reform . On 21 April 2005 , Congress approved the bill , with 183 " yes " and 136 " no " votes and 6 abstentions ( including a member of the People 's Party ) . The bill to allow same @-@ sex marriage in Spain was short : it added a new paragraph to article 44 of the civil code , saying that Matrimony shall have the same requisites and effects regardless of whether the persons involved are of the same or different sex . 
 In accordance with constitutional provisions , the text approved by the Congress was then submitted to the Senate for final approval , change or veto . On 21 June 2005 experts were called to the Senate to debate the issue . The expert 's opinions were diverse ; some stated that gay adoption had no effect on a child 's development , except for perhaps a higher tolerance towards homosexuality . However , psychiatrist Aquilino <unk> , called by the People 's Party as an expert , called homosexuality a pathology and emotive disorder . Among other assertions that generated debate , he claimed that " many homosexuals have rape abuse antecedents since childhood " and that homosexuals generally come from families with " hostile , alcoholic and distant " fathers , and mothers who were " over protective " toward boys and " cold " toward girls . Prominent People 's Party members later rejected <unk> 's assertions . 
 The Senate vetoed the text submitted by the Congress . The veto was proposed by the People 's Party , which held the majority of the seats , and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia , and was approved by 131 " yes " and 119 " no " votes and 2 abstentions . As a result , the text was sent back to the Congress . On 30 June 2005 it was approved by Congress , which , in accordance with the constitutional provisions , overrode the Senate veto . This was achieved with 187 " yes " votes ( including a member of the People 's Party , Celia Villalobos ) , 147 " no " votes , and four abstentions . The veto override implied its approval as law . The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of parliament to speak in its support , saying We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of our neighbors , our colleagues , our friends and our relatives . At the same time , we are building a more decent society . Mariano Rajoy , the leader of the opposition People 's Party , was denied the opportunity to address parliament after Zapatero 's appearance , and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society . 
 When the media asked King Juan Carlos if he would sign the bill that was being debated in the Cortes Generales , he answered that he was the King of Spain , not of Belgium – a reference to King Baudouin of Belgium , who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion . For the king to withhold his royal assent would effect a veto of the legislation . However , the king gave his royal assent to Law 13 / 2005 on 1 July 2005 , and the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July , and came into effect on 3 July . The king received criticism by Carlist and other far right conservatives for signing the legislation . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 The bill 's passage was met with concern by Catholic authorities , including Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI . Cardinal López Trujillo , president of the Pontifical Council for the Family , said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law . He said every profession linked with implementing same @-@ sex marriages should oppose it , even if it meant losing their jobs . Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite @-@ sex , non @-@ religious marriage , its opposition was not as vocal ; for example , the Church did not object to the marriage of Crown Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz , who had divorced from a previous civil marriage . The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill , even though 80 % of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith . Sociologists believe this may be due to the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years , where the Church traditionally had most influence , especially on family issues . A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality . A complementary explanation might be that the Church 's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco , whose regime was closely linked to the Church . 
 Prime Minister Zapatero responded to Church criticism by saying : 
 There is no damage to marriage or to the family in allowing two people of the same sex to get married . Rather , these citizens now have the ability to organize their lives according to marital and familial norms and demands . There is no threat to the institution of marriage , but precisely the opposite : this law recognizes and values marriage . 
 Aware that some people and institutions profoundly disagree with this legal change , I wish to say that like other reforms to the marriage code that preceded this one , this law will not generate bad results , that its only consequence will be to avoid senseless suffering of human beings . A society that avoids senseless suffering of its citizens is a better society . 
 In any case , I wish to express my deep respect to those people and institutions , and I also want to ask for the same respect for all of those who approve of this law . To the homosexuals that have personally tolerated the abuse and insults for many years , I ask that you add to the courage you have demonstrated in your struggle for civil rights , an example of generosity and joy with respect to all the beliefs . 
 On 19 June 2005 there was a public protest against the law . Protesters — led by People 's Party members , Spanish bishops and the Spanish Family Forum ( Foro Español de la Familia ) — said they had rallied 1 @.@ 5 million people against what they considered an attack on the traditional family and Spanish values ; the Government 's Delegation in Madrid counted 166 @,@ 000 at the same event . Two weeks after this protest , coinciding with Gay Pride Day , <unk> ( Federación <unk> de <unk> , Gays , <unk> y <unk> — the Spanish Lesbian , Gay , and Transgender Organization ) estimated two million people marched in favour of the new law ; police sources counted 97 @,@ 000 . Both marches took place in Madrid , at the time governed by the conservative People 's Party . 
 Spanish bishops also claimed that the government , by extending the right of marriage to same @-@ sex couples , weakened the meaning of marriage , which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple . The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of gay couples adopting and raising children , and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents , but for the adopted . Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same @-@ sex couples had existed for a long time in Spain , since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners . Adoption by same @-@ sex couples was already legal in Navarre ( 2000 ) , the Basque Country ( 2003 ) , Aragon ( 2004 ) , Catalonia ( 2005 ) and Cantabria ( 2005 ) before the same @-@ sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide . Furthermore , in Asturias ( 2002 ) , Andalusia ( 2002 ) and Extremadura ( 2003 ) , same @-@ sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care . These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents ' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children . This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology , which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology . 
 In a 2008 biography , Queen Sofia of Spain revealed that she preferred the term " civil union " to " marriage " for committed same @-@ gender relationships . This and other alleged comments by the queen opened the Spanish monarchy to rare criticism in 2008 , with the <unk> palace issuing an apology on behalf of the queen for the " inexact " quotes attributed to her . Antonio <unk> , president of <unk> , said his organization accepted the queen 's apology , but added that there remains ill feelings by the gay community towards the queen over the comments . King Juan Carlos , known to be far more liberal than his wife , was reportedly incensed by the biography , with reporters stating the king will fire palace officials who allegedly approved official royal endorsement of the book . 
 During the 2011 General Election , People 's Party leader and Prime Minister of Spain Mariano Rajoy stated he also prefers the term " civil union " to marriage for same @-@ sex couples .

 On 21 July 2005 , a judge from the city of <unk> refused to issue a marriage license to a lesbian couple .

" In August 2005 , a judge from Gran Canaria refused licenses to three same @-@ sex couples and mounted another constitutional challenge . In December 2005 , the Constitutional Court rejected both challenges owing to both judges ' lack of standing to file them . On 30 September 2005 , the opposition People 's Party decided to initiate a separate constitutional challenge , causing division within the party . The outcome was published on November 6 , 2012 , seven years after the challenge was presented . The Court decided to uphold the same @-@ sex marriage law with 8 support votes and 3 against . 
 On 27 February 2007 the Spanish Family Forum presented an initiative signed by 1 @.@ 5 million people to legislate marriage as the union of a man and a woman only ( thus effectively prohibiting same @-@ sex marriage ) .

On 30 May 2007 , the aforementioned judge of <unk> was condemned by the Disciplinary Committee of the General Council of Judiciary Power ( Comisión <unk> del Consejo General del Poder Judicial <unk> ) to pay 305 euros for refusing to marry a gay couple and was also strictly warned against doing it again .

 Shortly after the law was passed , questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non @-@ Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a marriage license on the grounds that India did not permit same @-@ sex marriage . However , on 22 July another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner ( the first same @-@ sex marriage between women in Spain ) . This judge disagreed with his colleague 's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same @-@ sex marriage . 
 On 27 July , the Junta de <unk> de Sala – a body within the Public Prosecutor 's Corp that advises the Minister of Justice 's office – issued an opinion that LGBT Spaniards can marry foreigners from countries that do not permit same @-@ sex marriage . This marriage would be valid according to Spanish law , but did not imply automatic validity according to the foreigner 's national law . A ruling published in the Official State Bulletin stated : 
 According to the instructions from the Ministry of Justice ( Dirección General de <unk> y <unk> ) , Spanish Consulates abroad may carry out the preliminary paperwork for a same @-@ sex marriage . At least one of the marrying partners must be a Spanish citizen , residing in the Consular demarcation . However , the marriage itself can only take place at the Consulate if local laws recognize same @-@ sex marriages ( Spanish consulates in Boston , Brussels , The Hague , Amsterdam , Oslo , Toronto , Montreal , Ottawa , Cape Town , Pretoria , Stockholm , Washington , D.C. , Mexico City , Lisbon , Porto , Reykjavík , Buenos Aires , Rosario , Córdoba and Mendoza , as of August 2010 ) . In all other cases , the partners must marry in Spanish territory . Two non @-@ resident foreigners cannot marry in Spain , as at least one of the partners must be a Spanish resident , although they both may be non @-@ Spanish citizens .

In June 2015 the then mayor of the Basque capital Vitoria , Javier Maroto , announced his engagement to longtime partner <unk> Rodríguez . The wedding was held on 18 September 2015 at Vitoria 's city hall . Maroto , a member of the conservative People 's Party 's national board , is known for his views contrary to the stance of his own party pertaining the gay marriage in Spain . Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy , who had challenged the law approving same sex marriage when he was Opposition Leader , attended the wedding celebrations as a guest .

 = Roger Norreis = 
 Roger Norreis ( sometimes Roger Norreys or Roger Norris ; died between 1223 and 1225 ) was a medieval Abbot of Evesham in England . He was a controversial figure installed in several offices against opposition . In his appointment to Evesham he was accused of immoral behaviour and failing to follow monastic rules . In 1202 Norreis became embroiled in a dispute with his monks and his episcopal superior the Bishop of Worcester ; litigation and argumentation lasted until his deposition in 1213 . He then was appointed prior of a subsidiary monastic house of Evesham but was deposed within months then re @-@ appointed to the office five years later . 
 Norreis has been described by modern historians as being unsuited for the religious positions to which he was appointed and by one of being completely unsuitable to hold any kind of spiritual role . Nevertheless , even his most severe contemporary critic , Thomas of Marlborough , one of his own monks at Evesham , conceded that Norreis was energetic , entertaining , and enterprising ; during his time as abbot of Evesham Abbey he managed to complete the crossing tower of the monastic church . Roger Norreis died between 1223 and 1225 . 
 = = Background and early career = = 
 Norreis was a native of northern England and his family was probably of Norse origin . He was a monk at Christ Church Priory , the cathedral chapter of Canterbury Cathedral ; when he became a monk is unknown . In 1187 he was appointed treasurer of the priory , and in that role was sent by the cathedral chapter to King Henry II of England to plead their case against Baldwin of Forde , the Archbishop of Canterbury . The archbishop and his monks were in dispute over Baldwin 's plan to found a collegiate church at Hackington in honour of Thomas Becket which most of the monks opposed because they feared it would diminish the prestige of their priory . 
 Once Norreis reached the king he was converted to Baldwin 's side , perhaps because of the latter 's appointment of Norreis as the cellarer of Christ Church while the pair were at the king 's court . The monks resisted this appointment , and in September they appealed to the papacy , arguing that the appointment was against the Benedictine Rule . They also captured and held Norreis in custody , telling anyone who enquired after him that he was sick . Norreis escaped in early 1188 by travelling through the sewer and fled to the safety of the archbishop , who was then at Otford . In a mocking reference to his escape route , Norreis was occasionally known as Roger <unk> or " Roger the Drain @-@ Cleaner " . Baldwin then tried to have Norreis installed as prior at Christ Church 's dependent priory of St Martin 's , Dover , but the appointment was never confirmed . 
 = = Prior and abbot = = 
 King Henry died on 6 July 1189 and his son Richard I was crowned on 3 September . The succession of a new monarch eventually allowed a truce in the dispute between the Canterbury monks and their archbishop , as Henry had been a supporter of the archbishop 's scheme . Before the truce could be hammered out , Baldwin appointed Norreis as prior of Christ Church in October 1189 as another move in the quarrel over the Hackington project . In November the cathedral chapter secured a compromise that included the abandonment of the scheme and Norreis 's dismissal from office . The agreement came at a council held by Richard in late November 1189 at which the monks agreed to let the king settle the dispute over the Hackington project if the archbishop would withdraw Norreis ' appointment . Norreis 's fellow monks considered him a traitor to their cause , and his reputation was that of someone with few morals . He was also known for ingratiating himself with those in power , including the justiciar Geoffrey fitzPeter . Many of the details concerning Norreis ' career at Christ Church come from the works of Gervase of Canterbury , as well as the collection of letters known as the <unk> <unk> . 
 Norreis was appointed to the abbacy of Evesham Abbey in 1190 and was blessed as abbot on 13 January 1190 . He owed his appointment to King Richard and to Baldwin 's attempts to make the dismissal from Christ Church look less like a defeat for the archbishop . Norreis also claimed that he received the office in return for unspecified services he rendered to Richard . There was no attempt at an election by the monks , a lack which went against canon law . During his tenure of office , his monks accused him of adultery , excessive drinking , gluttony , setting up favourites , starving the monks , and appropriating monastic property for his own use . A further offence was his habit of wearing secular clothing rather than the monastic robes prescribed by the Benedictine Rule . All these charges come from one of his monks , the historian Thomas of Marlborough , who wrote much of the history of Evesham known as the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham . Thomas 's account of Norreis 's rule is biased against the abbot and is a self @-@ aggrandising account of how Thomas single @-@ handedly triumphed over both his and his abbey 's foes . Norreis did manage some good for the abbey , as it was while he was abbot that the crossing tower of the monastic church was completed . 
 Early in his tenure Norreis appears to have been somewhat circumspect and did not greatly annoy his monks . The change appears to have happened around 1195 , when the monks are first recorded as appealing to higher authority . Because Evesham had traditionally claimed to be exempt from episcopal oversight by the see of Worcester , in which it was located , the monks could only appeal to the papacy or to a papal legate . Hubert Walter , the Archbishop of Canterbury after Baldwin , held a legateship for England until July 1195 and so the monks appealed to him . Walter forced Norreis to make some compromises with his subordinates , but the truce did not last long , and the monks once again complained of their treatment . They were visited by the new Bishop of Worcester John of Coutances some time between 1196 and 1198 , but Norreis succeeded in avoiding any severe sanctions by offering gifts to the bishop . The monks again appealed to Walter in about 1200 , but between the archbishop 's preoccupation with political affairs and Norreis 's promises to reform , no solid changes occurred . 
 = = Dispute with Mauger and his monks = = 
 In 1202 the new Bishop of Worcester Mauger attempted to investigate Norreis 's conduct , but under the leadership of Thomas of Marlborough the monastic community refused to allow the bishop to visit , claiming that Evesham was exempt from episcopal visitation and oversight . According to Thomas , Norreis offered to renounce the abbey 's claim to exemption in return for money , but the bishop refused . <unk> then fled the monastery , while the monks continued to refuse the bishop and were excommunicated , a sentence that Norreis was spared . Between early September and mid @-@ October the dispute was heard by three ecclesiastical tribunals , Mauger was supported by Eustace , Bishop of Ely , and Giles de Braose , Bishop of Hereford . The monks and Norreis then made common cause , each vowing to stand by the other in resisting Mauger . As well as these two cases , there was a dispute between the monks and the bishop over the ownership of some properties . The monks and Norreis then obtained the right for their case to be heard by papal judge @-@ delegates , but Mauger objected to the fact that the appointed judges were all Benedictine monks , and travelled to Rome to appeal . 
 In 1203 Norreis , secure in his alliance with his own monks , once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit and that of his family and friends . His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas , along with other monks , to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non @-@ member of the community . Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter . Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks . Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis 's exactions and abuse of his monks . 
 Norreis went to Rome in the company of Thomas of Marlborough shortly before 1205 to lay the abbey 's case before the papacy . Thomas remained in Italy , but Norreis returned to England in the middle of 1205 . While in Rome , Norreis and Thomas borrowed 400 marks to finance the litigation at the papal curia . Norreis could not repay this sum and for a while was in danger of being imprisoned , but he managed to leave Rome without suffering the fate of one of his companions who was detained for the debt and died while imprisoned . When Norreis made it back to England , Mauger excommunicated the abbot in April 1205 . The monks won a victory on the question of the abbey 's exemption from episcopal visitation in 1206 , but other elements of the quarrel remained unresolved , including that of the disputed churches . Later that year the monks became so annoyed by Norreis 's abuse that they abandoned the abbey and did not return until they secured the abbot 's confirmation of their rights . 
 With the question of the episcopal exemption decided in Evesham 's favour , the alliance between Norreis and his monks dissolved . The monks again complained of their abbot 's behaviour to the new papal legate , John of Sancta Maria . The legate ordered an investigation , the result being a written agreement between the two parties . Norreis gave gifts to the legate 's nephew , refused to sign the agreement , and took revenge on his opponents by expelling Thomas of Marlborough and his allies from the monastery . Thirty monks followed Thomas into exile , and Norreis pursued them with soldiers who were defeated by the monks . A compromise was eventually reached , Norreis agreeing that the revenues of the abbey would be split with the monks , that officials of the abbey would be appointed by the abbot but with the advice and consent of the monks , and that the abbot would not admit or expel monks without taking the counsel of his monks nor dispose of the monastic property without the consent of his subordinates . Although the issue of the monks ' support was temporarily solved , the issue of the disputed properties between Mauger and the monastery continued . Norreis appears to have been willing to compromise with the bishop , but the monks refused . 
 The dispute between Norreis and his monks dragged on for years . The interdict of 1207 – 1213 caused further delays , but when it was lifted in 1213 the case against Norreis was finally heard . A papal legate visited the abbey and found that the monks were lacking in food , clothes , and other necessities . The liturgy was not being performed according to the monastic rule because the monks lacked the proper clothing . Charity to the poor had ceased , the monastic buildings were dilapidated , and the monks were forced to beg for their needs . The legate found that the abbot was living well , wearing non @-@ monastic clothes , and enjoying the company of young women in his dwelling , while his monks suffered . Norreis was deposed from the abbacy by the papal legate in 1213 . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 On 27 November 1213 Norreis was appointed the prior of Penwortham Priory , a dependent priory of Evesham , partly to compensate him for the loss of the abbacy and partly to keep him from abandoning monastic life entirely . Norreis was deposed five months later owing to his continued bad morals and behaviour and again went to Rome in a bid to be restored to office . On this occasion he was unable to secure his reinstatement , but in 1218 or 1219 he was restored to Penwortham through the influence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio . <unk> died on 16 July or 19 July , but there is disagreement over the year of his death . The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that he died in 1223 , but the editors of Heads of Religious Houses : England and Wales , 940 – 1216 state he died in either 1224 or 1225 . He was buried at Penwortham . 
 Thomas of Marlborough , who knew Norreis , wrote that he was " everywhere condemned as the manifest enemy of God " . More modern writers echo the sentiment . John Moorman described Norreis as a man " totally unsuited to the delicate and responsible task of ruling over a company of men and directing the affairs of a wealthy corporation " . David Knowles , a historian of English monasticism , wrote that Norreis was " utterly unworthy to hold spiritual office of any kind " , and that Baldwin 's appointment of him as prior at Christ Church " must always remain a dark stain on the archbishop 's reputation " . Knowles also noted that he was " a man of great practical ability " . Even Thomas of Marlborough noted that Norreis was energetic , entertaining , and full of enterprise . 
 = Kill ' Em All = 
 Kill ' Em All is the debut studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica , released on July 25 , 1983 , by the independent label Megaforce Records . Kill ' Em All is regarded as a groundbreaking album for thrash metal because of its precise musicianship , which fuses new wave of British heavy metal riffs with hardcore punk tempos . Its musical approach and lyrics were markedly different from rock 's mainstream of the early Eighties and inspired a number of bands who followed in similar manner . The album did not enter the Billboard 200 until 1986 , when it peaked at number 155 , following Metallica 's commercial success with its third studio album Master of Puppets ; the 1988 Elektra reissue peaked at number 120 . Kill ' Em All was critically praised at the time of its release and in retrospect , and was placed on a few publications ' best album lists . It was certified 3 × platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States . The album generated two singles : " Whiplash " and " Jump in the Fire " . 
 Metallica began by playing shows in local clubs in Los Angeles . They recorded several demos to gain attention from club owners , and eventually relocated to San Francisco to secure the services of bassist Cliff Burton . The group 's No Life ' til Leather demo ( 1982 ) was noticed by Megaforce label head Jon Zazula , who signed them and provided a small budget of $ 15 @,@ 000 for recording . The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in Rochester , New York . It was originally intended to be titled Metal Up Your Ass , with cover art featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl . The band was asked to change the name because distributors feared releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success . Metallica promoted the album on the two @-@ month co @-@ headlining Kill ' Em All for One tour with Raven in the United States . Although the initial shipment was 15 @,@ 000 copies in the US , the album sold 60 @,@ 000 copies worldwide by the end of Metallica 's Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984 . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 Metallica was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by drummer Lars Ulrich and vocalist James Hetfield . Before settling on a definitive lineup , Metal Blade Records owner Brian Slagel asked Metallica to record a song for the first edition of his Metal Massacre compilation . Hetfield and Ulrich chose " Hit the Lights " from Hetfield 's previous band Leather Charm , and recorded it with Hetfield 's childhood friend Ron McGovney on bass , and temporary guitarist Lloyd Grant . The band 's first lineup featured Hetfield , Ulrich , McGovney , and guitarist Dave Mustaine , who was acquired through a newspaper advertisement . The band practiced in McGovney 's garage and inquired to play gigs at local clubs . Metallica 's first show was on March 14 , 1982 , at the Radio City in Anaheim . The nine @-@ song setlist consisted of two originals ( " Hit the Lights " and an unfinished version of " Jump in the Fire " from Mustaine 's earlier band Panic ) and covers of new wave of British heavy metal ( NWOBHM ) bands such as Diamond Head , Blitzkrieg , Savage , and Sweet Savage . The gig was notorious because Mustaine had problems with the guitar distortion pedal and broke a string during a song . Metallica 's second gig was March 27 at Hollywood 's Whisky a Go Go , opening for Saxon . Although Mötley Crüe was originally scheduled to open the show , the group canceled because of its growing popularity . Metallica recorded a three @-@ song demo to persuade the venue 's management to allow the band to open for Saxon . Metallica 's third concert was in April , at which was premiered " The Mechanix " , written by Mustaine during his tenure with Panic . Mustaine interacted with the fans at Metallica 's earliest shows because Hetfield was shy . 
 To get attention from club owners , Metallica recorded the Power Metal demo which featured " Motorbreath " in addition to the already @-@ performed originals . The logo , displaying the band 's name with the first and last letter drawn larger with sharp serifs and italicized , was designed by Hetfield . The No Life ' til Leather demo was recorded in July 1982 , and it created a buzz in the underground tape trading circles . No Life ' til Leather featured a re @-@ recorded version of " Hit the Lights " , which appeared on the second pressing of Metal Massacre , in addition to new songs such as " Phantom Lord " , " Seek & Destroy " , and " Metal Militia " . The recording and mastering was financed by Kenny Kane , owner of the punk label High Velocity , and distributed by Ulrich and his friend Pat Scott . Because of tensions with Mustaine , McGovney left the band in December . Ulrich was impressed by Cliff Burton 's performance with Trauma at The Troubadour and offered to let him join the group . Burton joined on the condition that Metallica would relocate to the San Francisco area . Moving to El Cerrito in February 1983 , the band stayed and rehearsed at Exodus manager Mark Whitaker 's house , which they called the " Metallica Mansion " . Metallica intended to record its debut in Los Angeles on Slagel 's independent label on an $ 8 @,@ 000 budget . Slagel could not afford the record , and Ulrich contacted Jon Zazula , a New Jersey record store owner and promoter of heavy metal bands on the East Coast who had already heard No Life ' til Leather . Metallica took a bus to New Jersey in late March , and upon arrival , allowed Zazula to sell copies of No Life ' til Leather to help him found Megaforce Records , because no label wanted to finance the album 's recording . 
 Hetfield and Ulrich fired Mustaine on the morning of April 11 , after a gig in New York , because of his drug and alcohol problems , overly aggressive behavior , and clashes with bandmates . On Whitaker 's recommendation , Metallica recruited Kirk Hammett , who played in Exodus and was a one @-@ time student of Joe Satriani . Hammett learned the songs on his flight to New York , and started recording the album with Metallica barely a month later . Metallica met producer Paul Curcio at Music America studios in Rochester , New York , and recorded the album in two weeks . Unable to afford a hotel during the recording sessions , the band members lived in people 's houses in Rochester and at the Music Factory in Jamaica , Queens , where Anthrax held rehearsals . Curcio had set the studio equipment as if he were recording an ordinary rock band . He thought the initial tapes sounded very distorted and tried to compensate by turning down the knobs . Metallica resented Curcio 's involvement because he seemed uninterested and had little impact on the sound . Although Zazula wanted Hammett to replicate Mustaine 's solos , Hammett 's guitar solos on the album were partially based on Mustaine 's original solos , with the first four bars of most solos written by Mustaine before his departure . Despite their differences , Mustaine 's contributions to the early years of Metallica were still acknowledged and he received four co @-@ writing credits on Kill ' Em All . Zazula was not satisfied with the initial mix because he thought the drums were too loud and the guitars were too low in the mix . The remix was done by sound engineer Chris Bubacz , according to Zazula 's instructions . 
 The final cost for the record was $ 15 @,@ 000 , which nearly bankrupted Zazula . " This was mortgage money I 'm spending , not something I 've got put by I 'm going to invest , " he said later . Zazula had a hard time finding a distributor for the record , but he eventually convinced Relativity Records to distribute the album in the US and Canada , and Music for Nations in Europe . The band initially intended to title the album Metal Up Your Ass with the cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from a toilet bowl . However , Zazula convinced them to change this as he thought distributors would not stock it . The final cover featured the shadow of a hand letting go of a bloodied hammer . Burton was credited with coming up with the name Kill ' Em All — referring to timid record distributors , saying , " Those record company fuckers ... kill ' em all ! " — as a response to the situation . Ulrich thought Kill ' Em All was a good name , and Zazula agreed . Even though the original title was unused , the band did later release a " Metal Up Your Ass " T @-@ shirt with the proposed artwork . A live bootleg recording of a 1982 performance at the Old Waldorf , titled Metal Up Your Ass ( Live ) , featured the original cover artwork . Original pressings of the album came with an inner sleeve that included pictures and lyrics as well as a silver label on the vinyl . Subsequent pressings had a blank white sleeve and standard album label . The 1988 reissue re @-@ introduced the lyrics and photos . The original release can be distinguished by the words " Bang That Head That Doesn 't Bang " at the top of the back cover . This was dropped from the reissue . The phrase " Bang That Head That Doesn 't Bang " was dedicated to San Francisco fan Ray Burch , known for his headbanging at the band 's early shows . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Kill ' Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity . The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion , low @-@ register chords , and shredding leads to the genre . Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos . Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica 's subsequent albums . Hetfield 's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life ' til Leather to a rough @-@ edged bark and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill ' Em All . Music writer Joel McIver said Burton 's and Hetfield 's performances were nearly virtuosic , because of the smooth @-@ sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter . According to journalist Chuck Eddy , the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare , violence and life on the road gives the album a " naive charm " . The musical approach on Kill ' Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early Eighties . Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica 's street appearance , it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock . 
 " Hit the Lights " was based on an unfinished Leather Charm song written by Hetfield and Hugh Tanner . Hetfield had brought the majority of the song to Ulrich and the two worked out different arrangements . Performed at 160 beats per minute , " Hit the Lights " opens with fade @-@ in distorted guitars and a short shriek by Hetfield . The song is driven by the 16th note repeated main riff and the continuous eighth note snare drum hits . The lyrics celebrate heavy metal itself and are sung with short and high pitched vocals . The song ends with several lengthy guitar solos by Hammett , who performed cleaner and more melodic version of Mustaine 's leads . " The Four Horsemen " is a revamp of the Mustaine @-@ penned " The Mechanix " , which originally had lyrics about having sex at a gas station . A modified version of his composition with the original lyrics appeared on Megadeth 's debut Killing Is My Business ... and Business Is Good ! ( 1985 ) . Although Mustaine told Metallica not to use any of his music , Hetfield wrote lyrics about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and added a bridge and cleanly picked guitar solo in the middle . Mustaine said the bridge was inspired by the main riff in Lynyrd Skynyrd 's " Sweet Home Alabama " . 
 " Motorbreath " was written by Hetfield during his time in Leather Charm and tells about life on the road . The song is based on a four @-@ chord verse and a stop @-@ and @-@ start chorus . The most recognizable parts are Ulrich 's drum rolls in each chorus and the riff that accompanies Hammett 's solos . Because of its speed , the song requires fast picking by the bassist . " Jump in the Fire " was originally written by Mustaine , with lyrics about teenage sexual experience . Hetfield 's revised lyrics for the album were written from Satan 's point of view , describing how the devil watches people killing each other , and is sure they will go to hell for their actions . " Jump in the Fire " was released as a single in the UK in February 1984 to promote a UK tour with Venom . The single featured " Phantom Lord " and " Seek & Destroy " as live tracks , although they are actually studio recordings with fake crowd noise dubbed over them . The single 's cover art features an oil painting titled The Devils of D @-@ Day , created by artist Les Edwards in 1978 . 
 " ( Anesthesia ) - Pulling Teeth " is a bass solo by Burton , accompanied on drums by Ulrich . A staple of Burton 's live performances since his high school days in the band Agents of Misfortune , the instrumental track featured Burton 's distinctive " lead @-@ bass " style of playing , incorporating heavy distortion , use of wah @-@ wah pedal and tapping . Bubacz introduces the track as " Bass solo , take one " , informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take . " ( Anesthesia ) - Pulling Teeth " was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig . Hetfield stated : " We heard this wild solo going on and thought , ' I don 't see any guitar player up there . ' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said , ' Dude , that 's a bass ! ' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah @-@ wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair . He didn 't care whether people were there . He was looking down at his bass , playing . " " Whiplash " was the album 's first single , issued on August 8 , 1983 . It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute . Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control . The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging . Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that " Whiplash " signified the birth of thrash metal , stating : " If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world , ' Whiplash ' is indisputably it . " 
 " Phantom Lord " is a lyrical nod to devilry . The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean , arpeggiated guitar chords . Written by Mustaine , its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion . " No Remorse " is a mid @-@ tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute . The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle . " Seek & Destroy " was inspired by Diamond Head 's " Dead Reckoning " and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill ' Em All sessions . Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working . Because of its simple , one @-@ line chorus , the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong . " Metal Militia " , one of the fastest songs on the album , is about heavy metal 's way of life and nonconformity . Mustaine composed the main riff , which emulates a marching army . The song ends with tramping feet and bullet ricochet in a fade @-@ out . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Kill ' Em All has received mostly positive reviews . Bernard Doe of Metal Forces described Kill ' Em All as one of the fastest and heaviest albums ever recorded , and remarked that the album is not for the faint @-@ hearted . Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune acknowledged it as the " speed metal prototype " , but felt the lyrical replication of Judas Priest and the Misfits kept the album short from becoming a classic . In a retrospective review , Billboard praised Kill ' Em All for changing the face of popular music with its unique combination of punk and metal . AllMusic 's Steve Huey called it " the true birth of thrash " . He praised Hetfield 's highly technical rhythm guitar style and said that the band was " playing with tightly controlled fury even at the most ridiculously fast tempos " . Rob Kemp , writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide , credited the album for consolidating the punk rock and heavy metal scenes , but felt that apart from " Seek & Destroy " and " ( Anesthesia ) - Pulling Teeth " , most of the album had the band " trying to look tough " over enthusiastic but unfinished riff @-@ based songs . Journalist Martin Popoff said Kill ' Em All differentiated from the debuts by Metallica 's Bay Area contemporaries because the fans could identify with Hetfield 's lyrics and the band 's appearance . Spin 's Chuck Eddy considered Kill ' Em All the inception of the " extreme metal mania " of the early 1980s . He noted the album did not receive much critical praise at the time of its release , but said it aged well and opened the doors for the less commercially successful bands . Although McIver credits Venom 's Welcome to Hell ( 1981 ) as the first thrash metal album , he acknowledged Kill ' Em All as a major influence on the flourishing American heavy metal scene . Despite its " less @-@ than @-@ perfect " production , Loudwire 's Jon Wiederhorn said that Kill ' Em All sounds like an " influential slice of history " and stands on the same level as classic albums by Black Sabbath , Iron Maiden , and Judas Priest . 
 Kill ' Em All was released July 25 , 1983 , by Megaforce with an initial pressing of 15 @,@ 000 copies . Because of the label 's financial restrictions , the album was pressed in batches of 500 copies . Kill ' Em All had sold 17 @,@ 000 copies in the US by the end of the year . Similarly to punk rock acts , Metallica promoted its material through the tape trading network and independent music magazines such as Metal Forces in the UK and Metal Mania in the US . The album did not enter the Billboard 200 chart until 1986 , when it peaked at number 155 following Metallica 's commercial success with its third studio album Master of Puppets . The 1988 re @-@ issue on Elektra Records also charted on the Billboard 200 , peaking at number 120 . It was certified 3 × platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States . Despite being the lowest selling Metallica studio album , it helped the band establish its image and build a fanbase in its inaugural years . 
 Kill ' Em All , as the first thrash metal album released in the US , had substantial impact on the emerging scene and inspired numerous bands with its aggression and austere seriousness . Guitarist Kerry King acknowledged Slayer was still finding its sound while Metallica had already determined its image and musical identity . Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian was impressed by the album 's heaviness and songwriting , and said it influenced him as much as the albums by Iron Maiden . Dream Theater 's drummer Mike Portnoy observed that Kill ' Em All surpassed the NWOBHM bands in terms of sheer velocity and cited Burton 's bass solo as the album 's peak . Guitarist Ulf Cederlund of Swedish black metal band Morbid cited " Motorbreath " and " Metal Militia " as songs that influenced him as a young musician . Kill ' Em All was ranked at number 35 on Rolling Stone 's list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the ' 80s . Additionally , the album placed at number 54 on " The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time " , a list compiled by the same magazine . Kerrang ! listed the album at number 29 among the " 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time " . In 2010 , Consequence of Sound ranked it number 94 among its " Top 100 Albums Ever " . 
 = = Touring = = 
 In late June 1983 , Metallica embarked on the two @-@ month Kill ' Em All for One tour with British co @-@ headliners Raven . The tour name melded the titles of the albums the two bands were promoting : Metallica 's Kill ' Em All and Raven 's All for One , both released on Megaforce . The two groups met in Zazula 's home two days before the tour began , and traveled in the same vehicle throughout the tour with five roadies and sound engineer Whitaker . The tour was set to conclude with three shows in San Francisco , thus Hetfield painted " No Life ' til Frisco " on the Winnebago tour bus . The tour had a few poorly attended gigs , such as a performance at the Cheers club in Babylon , New York , attended by some 50 people . After the conclusion of Kill ' Em All for One in early September , Metallica returned to El Cerrito to work on new material . Seven weeks after the tour ended , Metallica booked a number of performances at Bay Area clubs , the first a Halloween gig at the Keystone in Palo Alto . At the Country Club in Reseda , the group debuted " Fight Fire with Fire " and " Creeping Death " , along with an early version of " The Call of Ktulu " , then titled " When Hell Freezes Over " . Three days later , at a gig at The Stone in San Francisco , Metallica premiered " Ride the Lightning " , the title track from the upcoming album . In December , Metallica went on a short tour in the Midwest and eastern United States with a three @-@ man road crew : Whitaker , guitar technician John Marshall , and drum technician Dave Marrs . The January 14 , 1984 concert in Boston was canceled because the band 's equipment was stolen the night before . 
 In February , Metallica embarked on its first European trek with Twisted Sister , supporting Venom 's Seven Dates Of Hell tour . The tour was sponsored by Metallica 's UK distributor , Music For Nations , who released the " Jump in the Fire " EP for that occasion . The first show was at the <unk> in Zurich on February 3 . At the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle on February 11 , Metallica played in front of 7 @,@ 000 people , its largest audience at the time . The tour stretched through countries such as Italy , Germany , France , and Belgium , culminating in two sold @-@ out shows at the Marquee Club in London . After concluding the Seven Dates Of Hell tour , Metallica headed to Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen to record its sophomore album Ride the Lightning . By the end of the tour , Kill ' Em All had sold 60 @,@ 000 copies worldwide and Metallica began to gain international recognition .

 = List of Ops ( B ) staff = 
 Ops ( B ) was a deception planning department within the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) during the Second World War . Established in the United Kingdom in April 1943 , the section was in charge of operational deception planning for the Western Front . Their major contribution was to Operations Cockade and Bodyguard , the latter being the cover plan for their Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944 . 
 Originally under Colonel J. V. B. Jervis @-@ Read , the department suffered from a lack of authority and resources . In December 1943 , Jervis @-@ Read was replaced by Colonel Noel Wild , a member of the middle eastern ' A ' Force deception department , and expanded dramatically . Wild split the department into Operations and Intelligence sections . Lieutenant Colonel Roger Fleetwood @-@ Hesketh retained charge of the latter , and Wild placed Jervis @-@ Read in command of the former . Fleetwood @-@ Hesketh immediately expanded his staff , bringing in his brother , an MI5 liaison officer and a secretary . The operations section was not expanded until May , with three American officers and Major S. B. D. ( Sam ) Hood ( another ' A ' Force alumnus ) joining the department . 
 In July 1944 , Wild won a power struggle over who was in charge of deception planning in France ; consequently Ops ( B ) had a much more involved role . He sent Jervis @-@ Read to France at the head of a " Forward " section , accompanied by the American officers Lieutenant Colonel Frederic W. Barnes and Major Alfred ( Al ) J. F. Moody . By the end of October 1944 , all of the American members of the department had returned home , leaving an entirely British staff . 
 = = John Jervis @-@ Read = = 
 Brigadier John Vaughan Bruce Jervis @-@ Read OBE was the original head of Ops ( B ) . He had joined the Royal Engineers from university as a second lieutenant in 1933 . By March 1942 , when he was appointed head of the deception section , he held the rank of colonel . His main task was the planning of Operation Cockade . It was not a success , in part due to the complexity of the operation , but also because of the limited resources at his disposal . Lieutenant General Frederick E. Morgan , at that time the most senior officer at SHAEF , the Supreme Commander having yet to be appointed , viewed Colonel Dudley Clarke 's A Force as a " private army " which he would not have duplicated under his command . 
 In December 1943 Jervis @-@ Read was replaced by Colonel Noel Wild , who reorganised Ops ( B ) . Jervis @-@ Read was made head of the Operations section as his deputy . Following the Allied invasion of France , he became Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff at SHAEF . In 1945 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) , the citation recognised his work with Ops ( B ) and in France . He retired from the army in 1963 , having attained the rank of brigadier . 
 = = Noel Wild = = 
 Colonel Noel Wild was Dudley Clarke 's deputy in Cairo from April 1942 . Toward the end of 1943 , when Ops ( B ) was scheduled for expansion to assist with Bodyguard , a deception cover plan for the D @-@ Day landings , Clarke secretly suggested Wild as the department 's head . In December of that year Wild was sent to London , he believed on leave , where he was assessed for suitability and then appointed to the role . 
 Under Wild , Ops ( B ) was expanded and divided into two sections – Operations and Intelligence . It received greater power , including control of the information flowing to double agents . Wild used this to help with planning for Operation Fortitude , the major segment of the Bodyguard plan . This situation did not last long ; another ' A ' Force alumnus , Lieutenant Colonel David Strangeways , was brought over to head up R Force , the operational deception unit of the 21st Army Group . Strangeways and Wild clashed on a personal and professional level . Eventually , Strangeways rewrote large portions of the Fortitude South plan , and pushed Ops ( B ) into a more supporting role . 
 In July 1944 , Wild wrestled control of operational deception planning from Strangeways and others , and sent a portion of the department ( Jervis @-@ Read plus the American officers Barnes and Moody ) to France as the Forward section . He remained in the UK with the rest of the staff as the ' Read ' section . 
 = = Roger Fleetwood @-@ Hesketh = = 
 Lieutenant Colonel Roger Fleetwood Hesketh TD , DL , OBE , was the son of Major Charles Hesketh Fleetwood @-@ Hesketh . Like his father , he was educated at Eton and Oxford before becoming a barrister , and later a soldier . Hesketh , then a major , joined Ops ( B ) alongside Jervis @-@ Read as the department 's only intelligence officer . Colonel John Bevan , in setting up the unit , felt that it would only require operational capabilities , and that intelligence would remain with his own London Controlling Section ; but with the arrival of Wild , Hesketh was handed control of an expanded intelligence section , which included his brother , Cuthbert , a civilian secretary and an MI5 liaison officer . 
 Following the end of the war , Hesketh was sent to Germany , alongside his brother , to search through the files of German intelligence , and question officers . He was then asked to write a history of deception in Western Europe , including the work up to and including Operation Fortitude . 
 = = Other members = = 
 Prior to Wild 's arrival , Ops ( B ) had a very small staff – consisting of Jervis @-@ Read , Hesketh and two American officers . From January 1944 , Wild expanded the staff to include liaisons with MI5 , additional American officers and experienced deception staff from ' A ' Force in Cairo .

 = No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF = 
 No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit ( No. 1 OCU ) was an operational training unit of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Formed in January 1959 at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , its role was to convert pilots and navigators to the English Electric Canberra bombers flown by Nos. 1 , 2 and 6 Squadrons . The unit 's complement of Canberras included T.4 and Mk.21 dual @-@ control trainers , and Mk.20 bombers . Originally a component of No. 82 Wing , No. 1 OCU became an independent unit at Amberley in April 1968 , its focus being the provision of operationally ready pilots for service with No. 2 Squadron in the Vietnam War . No. 1 OCU was disbanded in June 1971 , following the withdrawal of No. 2 Squadron from South @-@ East Asia . By then the RAAF 's only Canberra unit , No. 2 Squadron ran its own conversion courses before disbanding in 1982 . 
 = = History = = 
 During World War II , the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) established several operational training units ( OTUs ) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft , and to add fighting ability to the flying skills they had already learned . Post @-@ war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs , and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front @-@ line squadrons . This practice impacted upon the squadrons ' standard duties , and the advent of the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated more a formal training system . The Air Force 's initial move in this direction was to re @-@ establish No. 2 ( Fighter ) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown , New South Wales , in March 1952 ; it was renamed No. 2 ( Fighter ) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958 . 
 In December 1953 , No. 82 ( Bomber ) Wing , headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , took delivery of Australia 's first jet bomber , the English Electric Canberra . Over the next five years , forty @-@ eight Canberras built in Australia by the Government Aircraft Factory ( GAF ) re @-@ equipped all three of the wing 's flying units , Nos. 1 , 2 and 6 Squadrons . During this period , operational training of new bomber aircrew was performed " in @-@ house " by the wing , primarily by No. 6 Squadron . Aside from its adverse effect on regular flying duties , the task was made technically challenging and potentially dangerous by virtue of the Canberra being designed for only one pilot , with a single control column . On 12 January 1959 , No. 1 ( Bomber ) Operational Conversion Unit ( No. 1 OCU ) was formed at Amberley . Coming under the control of No. 82 Wing , its purpose was to convert pilots and navigators to the Canberra , and train them for operations with Nos. 1 , 2 and 6 Squadrons . On establishment , the unit was commanded by Squadron Leader <unk> <unk> , and equipped with Mk.20 bombers and T.4 trainers . The T.4 was a dual @-@ control model with three seats ; the pilot and instructor sat side by side at the front of the cockpit , with the navigator seated behind them . Two of these models had been purchased from Britain . The unit was subsequently allocated Mk.21 trainers ; GAF built seven of these dual @-@ control models by converting five early <unk> and two British @-@ built B.2 bombers . Student aircrew underwent bombing and navigation instruction , as well as simulated operations . The first training course graduated in April 1959 . 
 As well as training , over the course of No. 1 OCU 's existence its aircrews flew operational sorties involving naval cooperation , aerial photography , target towing and radar targeting , and participated in exercises in Malaysia , Papua New Guinea , and New Zealand . During runway upgrades at Amberley in mid @-@ 1962 , the unit was based for a month at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales . Later that year , it briefly maintained a detachment at RAAF Base Townsville , Queensland . On 11 September 1964 , one of its Canberras was intercepted by a Sabre fighter of No. 76 Squadron based at RAAF Base Darwin , Northern Territory , as part of Operation Handover , a little @-@ known contingency plan put into effect during Konfrontasi to guard against possible attack by Indonesian forces following the recent establishment of the Federation of Malaysia . No. 1 OCU suffered a fatal accident on 16 February 1965 , when a Canberra Mk.21 ran off the runway and crashed at Amberley , killing both crew members . The unit was made independent of No. 82 Wing in April 1968 . Its role from then on was to provide trained crews solely for No. 2 Squadron , which was on active duty in the Vietnam War . At the same time , maintenance responsibilities for the Canberras transferred from No. 482 Squadron to No. 1 OCU , along with relevant staff and equipment . Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations while their crews underwent conversion to the General Dynamics F @-@ 111C , expected to enter service soon afterwards . Delivery of the F @-@ 111s was delayed , so Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons began operating leased F @-@ 4E Phantoms as an interim strike force in 1970 . 
 To prepare aircrew for their rotation through No. 2 Squadron in Vietnam , No. 1 OCU students participated in exercises such as Combat <unk> in August 1968 , which utilised radar controlled by No. 30 Squadron , and Strait Kris in September – October 1969 , in conjunction with the Australian Army . The unit lost two more aircrew when a Canberra <unk> on a training flight crashed near Amberley on 23 March 1970 . From 21 March to 25 April 1971 , four of the unit 's aircraft flew 10 @,@ 000 miles around Australia to conduct seven flying displays as part of the RAAF 's Golden Jubilee celebrations . Having completed thirty @-@ six conversion courses in its twelve years of operation , No. 1 OCU was disbanded on 9 June 1971 , following the withdrawal of No. 2 Squadron from Vietnam . Unit staff were transferred to No. 2 Squadron , which continued to operate the Canberra and carry out its own operational conversion until disbanding in June 1982 . Ten of No. 1 OCU 's fifteen Canberras were put into storage and the remainder , including surviving Mk.21 trainers , were taken on by No. 2 Squadron . When the F @-@ 111C eventually entered service with No. 82 Wing in 1973 , No. 6 Squadron again took responsibility for conversion training , while No. 1 Squadron acted as the lead strike unit . Canberra A84 @-@ 236 , which was allocated to No. 1 OCU in 1968 and 1970 when not in service with No. 2 Squadron in Vietnam , went on display at RAAF Museum , Point Cook , Victoria , in 1982 .

 Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action @-@ adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games . It was released on 17 September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , on 18 November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One , and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows . The game is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008 's Grand Theft Auto IV . Set within the fictional state of San Andreas , based on Southern California , the single @-@ player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency . The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas 's open countryside and fictional city of Los Santos , based on Los Angeles . 
 The game is played from either a first @-@ person or third @-@ person view and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle . Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single @-@ player and switch between them both during and outside of missions . The story is centred on the heist sequences , and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay . A " wanted " system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes . Grand Theft Auto Online , the online multiplayer mode , lets up to 30 players explore the open world and engage in cooperative or competitive game matches . 
 Development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IV 's release and was shared between many of Rockstar 's studios worldwide . The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 , and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors . Much of the development work constituted the open world 's creation , and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team . The game 's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years . 
 Extensively marketed and widely anticipated , the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest @-@ selling entertainment product in history , earning US $ 800 million in its first day and US $ 1 billion in its first three days . It received widespread critical acclaim , with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design , open world , presentation and gameplay . It caused controversies related to its depiction of women and a mission featuring torture during a hostage interrogation . Considered one of seventh generation console gaming 's most significant titles , it won year @-@ end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications . It has shipped over 65 million copies and is one of the best @-@ selling video games of all time . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Grand Theft Auto V is an action @-@ adventure game played from either a first @-@ person or third @-@ person view . Players complete missions — linear scenarios with set objectives — to progress through the story . Outside of missions , players may freely roam the open world . Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area and the fictional city of Los Santos , the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series . It may be fully explored after the game 's beginning without restriction , although story progress unlocks more gameplay content . 
 Players use melee attacks , firearms and explosives to fight enemies , and may run , jump , swim or use vehicles to navigate the world . To accommodate the map 's size , the game introduces vehicle types absent in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV , such as fixed @-@ wing aircraft . Auto @-@ aim and a cover system may be used as assistance against enemies in combat . Should players take damage , their health meter will gradually regenerate to its halfway point . Players respawn at hospitals when their health depletes . If players commit crimes while playing , law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a " wanted " meter in the head @-@ up display ( HUD ) . Stars displayed on the meter indicate the current wanted level ( for example , at the maximum five @-@ star level , police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally dispatch players ) . Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity . The meter enters a cooldown mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers ' line of sight ( as displayed on the mini @-@ map ) . 
 The single @-@ player mode lets players control three characters : Michael De Santa , Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton — criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions . Some missions are completed with only one character and others feature two or three . Throughout single @-@ player , players may switch between the protagonists at will by means of a directional compass on the HUD . The game may switch between characters automatically in single @-@ player missions to complete certain objectives . A character 's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help , and flash white if he has a strategic advantage . Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists , the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI @-@ controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving . If an accomplice survives a successful heist , they take a cut from the cash reward and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills . Differentiation in heist mission strategies is encouraged ; in a holdup mission , players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn . 
 Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability in certain areas such as shooting and driving . Though skills improve through play , each character has a skill with expertise by default ( i.e. Trevor 's flying skill ) . The eighth " special " skill determines the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each respective character . Michael enters bullet time in combat , Franklin slows down time while driving , and Trevor deals twice as much damage to enemies while taking half as much in combat . A meter on each character 's HUD depletes when an ability is being used and regenerates when players perform skilful actions ( for example , drifting in vehicles as Franklin or pulling off headshots as Michael ) . 
 While free roaming the game world , players may engage in context @-@ specific activities such as scuba diving underwater or BASE jumping via parachute . Each character has a smartphone for contacting friends , starting activities and accessing an in @-@ game Internet . The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock market . Players may purchase properties such as homes and businesses , upgrade the weapons and vehicles in each character 's arsenal , and customise their appearance by purchasing outfits , haircuts , tattoos and jewellery . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Nine years after a botched robbery in Ludendorff , North Yankton , former bank robber Michael Townley lives under witness protection with his family in Los Santos , San Andreas , under the alias Michael De Santa . He meets and befriends <unk> Franklin Clinton when the latter attempts to fraudulently repossess his son 's car on behalf of a corrupt Armenian car salesman . When Michael discovers his wife Amanda has been sleeping with her tennis coach , he chases the coach to a mansion and destroys it out of anger . The mansion 's owner turns out to be the girlfriend of Mexican drug lord Martin Madrazo , who demands compensation under the threat of further violence . Michael goes back into a life of crime to obtain the money and enlists Franklin as an accomplice . Together , they perform a jewellery shop heist to help pay the debt . Michael 's sole surviving partner in the Ludendorff robbery , Trevor Philips , hears of the jewellery heist and realises that it was Michael 's handiwork . The two reunite after Trevor tracks Michael down in Los Santos . 
 The personal lives of the protagonists begin to spiral out of control . Michael 's increasingly erratic behavior prompts his family to leave him , and his attempts to make something of himself bring him into conflict with Devin Weston , a self @-@ made billionaire venture capitalist and corporate raider who develops a grudge against him . Weston vows revenge after his lawyer dies in an accident that Michael is blamed for . Franklin rescues his friend Lamar Davis from gangster and former friend Harold " Stretch " Joseph , who repeatedly attempts to kill Lamar to prove himself to his brethren . Trevor 's reckless efforts to consolidate his control over various black markets in Blaine County see him waging war against the San Andreas chapter of The Lost outlaw motorcycle club , a number of Latin American street gangs , rival meth dealers , government @-@ sponsored mercenaries and Triad kingpin Wei Cheng . 
 Federal Investigation Bureau ( FIB ) government agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael and demand that he perform a series of operations with Franklin and Trevor to undermine a rival agency , the International Affairs Agency ( IAA ) . Under Haines ' direction , they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA and raid a bank containing the payroll for all corrupt police and public officials in Los Santos . As Haines comes under increasing scrutiny for his methods , he forces Franklin and Michael to infiltrate the FIB headquarters and erase any evidence being used against him from their servers . Michael takes the opportunity to wipe any data on his own activities , destroying Haines ' leverage over him . The trio start planning their most daring feat ever : raiding the Union Depository 's gold bullion reserve . 
 Michael makes amends with his family and they start living together again after returning to Los Santos . Meanwhile , Trevor discovers that a former Ludendorff heist accomplice , Brad Snider , was not in prison as he was led to believe , but killed during the heist and buried in the grave marked for Michael . Trevor 's feelings of betrayal cause friction within the group and threaten to undermine their Union Depository plans . When Michael and Norton , both of whom are betrayed by Haines , are caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB , IAA and private security firm Merryweather , Trevor aids in their escape , holding that only he has the right to kill Michael . Despite not forgiving Michael , Trevor still wants to perform the Union Depository heist ; the duo agree to part ways afterwards . 
 The Union Depository heist is completed successfully , but Franklin is approached by two parties separately who demand that he kill Trevor or Michael . Haines and Norton contend that Trevor is a liability , and Weston wants retribution for Michael 's betrayal . Franklin has three choices : kill Michael , kill Trevor or kill neither and face their enemies together . Should Franklin kill either Michael or Trevor , he ceases contact with the survivor and returns to his old life . Should he kill neither , the trio withstand an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Haines , Stretch , Cheng and Weston . Michael and Trevor reconcile , and the three cease working together but remain friends .

 Rockstar North began to develop Grand Theft Auto V in 2009 , following Grand Theft Auto IV 's release . Development was conducted by a team of more than 1 @,@ 000 people , including Rockstar North 's core team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games 's studios around the world . The proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine ( RAGE ) was overhauled for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities . The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks . Having become familiar with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware over time , Rockstar found they were able to push the consoles ' graphical capabilities further than in previous games . Analyst estimations place the game 's combined development and marketing budget at more than £ 170 million ( US $ 265 million ) , which would make it the most expensive game ever made at that time . 
 The open world was modelled on Southern California and Los Angeles , and its design and in @-@ game render constituted much of the game 's early work . Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage . Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos 's road networks . To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles 's demographic spread , the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city . The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game 's production . 
 A fundamental design goal from the outset was to innovate on the series 's core structure by giving players control of three lead protagonists instead of one . The idea was first raised during Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas 's development , but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible . Having developed two Grand Theft Auto IV episodic expansion packs featuring new protagonists in 2009 , the team wanted to base Grand Theft Auto V around three simultaneously controlled protagonists . The team viewed it as a spiritual successor to many of their previous games ( such as Grand Theft Auto IV , Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 ) , and designed it to improve upon their gameplay mechanics . They sought to improve the action gameplay by refining the shooting mechanics and cover system , and reworked the driving mechanics to correct Grand Theft Auto IV 's difficult vehicle controls . 
 After an audition process , Ned Luke , Shawn Fonteno and Steven Ogg were selected to portray Michael , Franklin and Trevor , respectively . Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology , but dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios instead . The game is the first in its series to feature an original score , composed by a team of producers collaborating with each other over several years . Licensed music provided by an in @-@ game radio is also used . The team licensed more than 241 tracks shared between fifteen radio stations , with an additional two stations providing talk radio . Some of the tracks were written specifically for the game , such as rapper and producer Flying Lotus 's original work composed for the <unk> FM radio station he hosts . 
 The game was first announced by Rockstar Games on 25 October 2011 . They released its debut trailer one week later , with an official press release acknowledging its setting . Journalists noted that the announcement ignited widespread anticipation within the gaming industry , which they owed to the cultural significance of the series . The game missed its original projected Q2 2013 release date , pushed back to 17 September to allow for further polishing . To spur pre @-@ order game sales , Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to make a special edition with extra in @-@ game features . They ran a viral marketing strategy with a website for a fictional religious cult , " The Epsilon Program " , that offered users the chance to feature in the game as members of the cult . 
 A re @-@ release of the game was announced for Microsoft Windows ( PC ) , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One at E3 2014 . This enhanced version features an increased draw distance , finer texture details , denser traffic , upgraded weather effects , and new wildlife and vegetation . It includes a new on @-@ foot first @-@ person view option , which required the development team to overhaul the animation system to accommodate first @-@ person gameplay . The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released on 18 November 2014 . The PC version , initially scheduled for simultaneous release with the console versions , was delayed until 14 April 2015 . According to Rockstar , it required extra development time for " polish " . The PC version is capable of 60 frames per second gameplay at 4K resolution , and the Rockstar Editor lets players capture and edit gameplay videos .

Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating in the 0 – 100 range , calculated an average score of 97 out of 100 based on 50 reviews for the PlayStation 3 version and 58 reviews for the Xbox 360 version . The game is Metacritic 's fifth @-@ highest rated , tied with a number of others . Reviewers liked the multiple lead character formula , heist mission design and presentation , but some did not agree on the quality of the story and characters . IGN 's Keza MacDonald called Grand Theft Auto V " one of the very best video games ever made " , and Play considered it " generation @-@ defining " and " exceptional " . Edge wrote that it is a " remarkable achievement " in open world design and storytelling , while The Daily Telegraph 's Tom Hoggins declared it a " colossal feat of technical engineering " . 
 CNET 's Jeff Bakalar felt that the game encouraged players to engage with all three characters . Edge found that switching players was helpful for avoiding long travel times to mission start points . Because of the switching mechanic , Game Informer 's Matt Bertz noted that players are kept " in the thick of the action " during shootouts . Eurogamer 's Tom Bramwell wrote that switching added a tactical element to shootouts as characters set up in strategic outposts would cause fewer " shooting gallery " situations than previous instalments . IGN 's MacDonald felt the switching feature gave players more choice in their approach and made missions less predictable . 
 Giant Bomb 's Jeff Gerstmann considered the heist missions a welcome deviation from series typical mission structure . Eurogamer 's Bramwell likened them to " blockbuster set @-@ pieces " and GameSpot 's Carolyn Petit cited the 1995 film Heat as a stylistic influence on their design . Joystiq 's Xav de Matos felt creativity and methodical approaches were encouraged . Polygon 's Chris Plante likened rapid character switching during heist missions to " film editing , with the player serving as editor , switching rapidly to the most interesting perspective for any moment " . Computer and Video Games 's Andy Kelly felt that overall mission design was more diverse than and lacked the escort errands of its predecessors . 
 Edge praised the game 's graphical fidelity and absence of load screens . Play complimented the draw distances and weather and lighting systems . Eurogamer 's Bramwell considered the lighting system to be the game 's biggest advancement . Official Xbox Magazine ( OXM ) ' s Mikel Reparaz thought that the game was " probably the Xbox 360 's greatest technical achievement " , and was surprised that the open world could render on the console . Reviewers lauded the open world 's design , some further complimenting the game for streamlining Los Angeles 's geography into a well @-@ designed city space . GameTrailers 's Brandon Jones considered the Los Angeles emulation authentic and the open world " full of voice and personality " . IGN and PlayStation Official Magazine ( OPM ) made favourable comparisons between Los Santos and Grand Theft Auto IV 's Liberty City . OXM 's <unk> felt Los Santos surpassed the " grey and gritty " Liberty City . Reviewers praised the world 's satire of contemporary American culture — OPM 's Joel Gregory opined that " the scathing social commentary is , of course , present and correct " . 
 Destructoid 's Jim Sterling called the sound design " impeccable " and praised the actors ' performances , original soundtrack and licensed music use . IGN and Giant Bomb commended the music selection and felt that the original score enhanced dramatic tension during missions . GameSpot 's Petit wrote that the score " lends missions more cinematic flavour " . Edge said that the licensed music enhanced the city 's " already remarkable sense of space " and that the original score improved the atmosphere of the gameplay . They summarised the game as " a compendium of everything Rockstar has learnt about the power of game music in the past decade " . 
 Many reviewers found the land @-@ based vehicles more responsive and easier to control than in previous games . Game Informer 's Bertz explained that " cars have a proper sense of weight , while retaining the agility necessary for navigating through traffic at high speeds " . In addition to the vehicle handling , most reviewers noted the shooting mechanics were tighter than they had been in previous games , but Destructoid 's Sterling felt that in spite of the improvements , auto @-@ aim was " twitchy and unreliable " and cover mechanics " still come off as dated and unwieldy " . Some reviewers felt the game solved a continual problem by adding mid @-@ mission checkpoints . 
 The story and characters — particularly Trevor — polarised reviewers . Some felt that the narrative was not as well @-@ written as previous Rockstar games and cited Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption 's plot strengths . Others felt that the protagonists ' contrasting personalities gave the narrative tighter pacing . Edge thought the choice to host multiple leads was crucial , writing " what [ at first ] seemed like a gimmick ultimately proves to be the bedrock for the game as a whole " . GamesRadar 's Hollander Cooper thought the game negated inconsistencies in the story of previous entries , whose single lead protagonists had muddled morality . GameSpot 's Petit considered Trevor in particular a " truly horrible , terrifying , psychotic human being — and a terrific character " . Eurogamer 's Bramwell found Trevor " shallow and unconvincing " , and felt that his eccentricities hurt the narrative and overshadowed Michael and Franklin 's character development . Joystiq 's de Matos faulted the protagonists ' lack of likability for him , and found the ambivalence between Michael and Trevor a tired plot device as their conflict grew into a " seemingly endless cycle " . The Escapist 's Greg Tito had difficulty connecting with the characters ' emotions since they acted out of greed with no sense of morality and thus gave players little reason to support them .

 Grand Theft Auto V 's re @-@ release received critical acclaim . Metacritic calculated an average score of 97 out of 100 based on 66 reviews for the PlayStation 4 version and 14 reviews for the Xbox One version , and 96 out of 100 based on 48 reviews for the PC version . GameRankings assigned an average score of 96 % based on 41 reviews for the PlayStation 4 version , 98 % based on 12 reviews for the Xbox One version and 95 % based on 26 reviews for the PC version . 
 Game Informer 's Andrew Reiner considered the addition of first @-@ person " another significant breakthrough for the series " in the vein of Grand Theft Auto III 's shift to third @-@ person from Grand Theft Auto 's bird 's @-@ eye view . GameSpot 's Mark Walton found that playing in first @-@ person heightened the impact of Grand Theft Auto V 's violence , which made him reflect on morality and character motivation more than before . VideoGamer.com opined that players feel like inhabitants of the world , rather than " guns attached to a floating camera " . IGN 's Dan Stapleton found the game more immersive in first @-@ person , creating a " surprisingly different experience " . VideoGamer.com praised the " finer details " in first @-@ person animations like camera lean when players take corners on motorcycles , or the navigational instruments in plane cockpits . Reviewers found playing the game more difficult in first @-@ person , but Game Informer 's Reiner preferred the challenge . 
 GameSpot 's Walton thought the graphics improvements made the open world " even more spectacular " , especially because of improved spatial anti @-@ aliasing . Of the first @-@ person view , he said that " at ground level everything looks bigger and more imposing " because of the improved graphics . IGN 's Stapleton favoured the PlayStation 4 version 's graphics over the Xbox One , but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent frame rates . He praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version . VideoGamer.com called the console version 's frame rate so consistent it was " scarcely believable " , although GameSpot 's Walton cited occasional frame rate dips . GameSpot 's Peter Brown opined that the PC version let players " witness the full extent of Rockstar 's admirable handiwork " , but noted that it " retains evidence of its last @-@ gen roots ... with simple geometry " . VideoGamer.com praised the Rockstar Editor 's accessibility on PC but criticised some of its limitations , such as camera angle restrictions . IGN 's Stapleton appreciated the PC version 's customisable controls , and GameSpot 's Brown felt that constant switching between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad was necessary for " the best experience " . PC Gamer 's Chris <unk> called the game " the most beautiful , expansive and generous " of the series . 
 On the game 's multiplayer , IGN 's Stapleton reported low player counts in matches , long wait times in lobbies , server disconnection and occasional crashes . " Because of that , " he wrote , " I can 't strongly recommend ... the multiplayer experience alone " . VideoGamer.com found online character progression streamlined by comparison with the original version . According to them , the " grind of just doing PvP until co @-@ op Jobs arrive with regularity " was lost , and newcomers would likely find multiplayer enjoyable and balanced . However , they wrote of frequent server disconnection , especially during load screens . GameSpot 's Walton thought that Grand Theft Auto Online " still suffers from a lack of direction " for its open @-@ ended and frenetic gameplay , but still is fun . Game Informer 's Reiner reported " minimal lag or issues in the expanded firefights and races " .

 Developed in tandem with the single @-@ player mode , the online multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world . Up to 30 players freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs ( story @-@ driven competitive and cooperative modes ) . The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs , like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points . Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together . Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in Max Payne 3 's multiplayer mode to that of Grand Theft Auto Online . Players may create their own crews and join up to five total . Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards . 
 Grand Theft Auto Online launched on 1 October 2013 , two weeks after Grand Theft Auto V 's release . Many players reported connection difficulties and game freezes during load screens . Rockstar released a technical patch on 5 October in an effort to resolve the issues , but problems persisted the second week following launch as some players reported their character progress as having disappeared . Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues and Rockstar offered a GTA $ 500 @,@ 000 ( in @-@ game currency ) stimulus to the accounts of all players connected to Online since launch as recompense . Because of the widespread technical issues present at launch , many reviewers bemoaned their experience with Grand Theft Auto Online , but generally recognised the open @-@ ended exploration and dynamic content as its strength . 
 Post @-@ release content is continually added to Grand Theft Auto Online through free title updates . Some updates add new game modes and features , and others feature themed gameplay content , such as the Independence Day Special update that added patriotic @-@ themed content on 1 July 2014 . The widely anticipated Online <unk> update launched on 10 March 2015 and suffered some initial technical difficulties due to the increased user load . Shortly after the game 's PC release , some players reported being banned from Grand Theft Auto Online for using field of view and cosmetic mods in single @-@ player . Rockstar stated in their official blog that nobody had been banned from Online for using single @-@ players mods , but that recent updates to the PC version had the " unintentional effect " of making such mods unplayable . They stated that mods are unauthorised and may cause unforeseen technical problems and instabilities . 
 = = Controversies = = 
 The game has generated several controversies related to its violence and depiction of women . A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers , who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste . The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti @-@ torture charity groups . The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women , particularly in the wake of backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit when she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review . After Petit 's review webpage received more than 20 @,@ 000 largely negative comments , many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community 's defensiveness towards criticism . Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan have both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses . Australian department store Target pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition against depictions of violence toward women in the game .

 Critics concurred that Grand Theft Auto V was among seventh generation console gaming 's best and a great closing title before the eighth generation 's emergence . Polygon 's Plante observed that the game would be " a bridge between games ' present and the future " , and declared it " the closure of this generation , and the benchmark for the next " . VideoGamer.com 's Simon Miller considered it " the ultimate swansong for this console cycle " that would " cast a long shadow over the next " . Three days after its release , the game ranked second on IGN 's list of " The Top 25 Xbox 360 Games " . Editor Ryan McCaffrey considered that the scale and detail of the open world succeeded the majority of other Xbox 360 games . He wrote that the game is " a triumph both for gamers and for the medium itself , and it deserves its runaway success " . Hardcore Gamer placed it at number three on their " Top 100 Games of the Generation " list . They cited the game 's improved shooting and driving mechanics over its predecessors . They also considered that the multiple protagonist design " was a welcome change of pace " and could become a benchmark for the eighth generation of gaming . In December 2013 , The Daily Telegraph listed the game among their " 50 best games of the console generation " . They called it a " cultural behemoth " that " will be Rockstar 's lasting legacy " . 
 In January 2014 , Computer and Video Games ranked the game fourth on their " Games of the Generation 20 @-@ 1 " list . Editor Rob Crossley said that for the first time , Rockstar created an " utterly beautiful " open world . He found that the game did away with Grand Theft Auto IV 's repetitive mission design and focused instead on fun gameplay . In May , IGN ranked it eighth on their list of the " Top 100 Games of a Generation " and called it a " huge , raucous , and wildly ambitious bridge towards the [ eighth ] generation of console gaming " . The next month , it placed at number three on IGN 's list of the " Games of a Generation : Your Top 100 " as voted by the site 's readers . In August , Game Informer ranked it third on their " Top 10 Action Games Of The Generation " list . They compared the game 's quality to that of its predecessor , but thought that its ensemble character set @-@ up , varied missions and multiplayer superseded Grand Theft Auto IV 's placement on the list . They wrote of the story 's absurd drama and the open world 's vastness , and did not " regret a single second " spent playing the game . In November , Edge named it the fifth best game of its generation and commented that " no other game studio is even daring to attempt an open @-@ world game in its tradition because there is simply no possibility of measuring up to [ its ] standards . " In 2015 the publication rated the game the second greatest videogame of all time . It also ranked high on several best game lists determined by the public . It featured eighth on Empire 's list of " The 100 Greatest Video Games Of All Time " , and fifth on Good Game 's " Top 100 Games " list , as voted by the audience of the magazine and show respectively . Grand Theft Auto V was the most tweeted game of 2015 , despite being released over a year earlier . 
 = Effects of Hurricane Isabel in Delaware = 
 The effects of Hurricane Isabel in Delaware resulted in one of only thirteen presidential disaster declarations for the state of Delaware . Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6 , 2003 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean . It moved northwestward , and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph ( 265 km / h ) on September 11 . After fluctuating in intensity for four days , Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) on September 18 . It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over Pennsylvania the next day . The storm 's center remained to the south and west of Delaware , and was about 175 miles ( 280 km ) from Delaware at its closest approach . At that time , Isabel was a strong tropical storm located in central Virginia . 
 The effects of the hurricane were compounded by flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri days before . Moderate winds of up to 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) downed numerous trees , tree limbs , and power lines across the state , leaving at least 15 @,@ 300 without power . Numerous low @-@ lying areas were flooded due to high surf , strong storm surge , or run @-@ off from flooding further inland . The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $ 40 million in damage ( 2003 USD , ( $ 51 @.@ 5 million 2016 USD ) ) and no casualties in the state . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 On September 16 , 44 hours before Hurricane Isabel made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch for the entire coastline of Delaware . The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane watch for the coastline . On September 17 , 26 hours before Isabel made landfall , the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings . While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a Category 5 hurricane , forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 155 miles ( 250 km ) south @-@ southeast of Lewes as a 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) major hurricane . Though located within the cone of uncertainty , all subsequent forecasts predicted a landfall on North Carolina with the hurricane passing to the west of the state . 
 Governor Ruth Ann Minner declared a state of emergency prior to the arrival of the hurricane . The declaration also included for the activation of the Delaware National Guard to assist in hurricane related duties . Minner mandated residents in 13 low @-@ lying areas of Sussex County to evacuate . In all , 787 people evacuated across the state to seven emergency shelters set up by the American Red Cross . Officials began recommending visitors to leave potentially affected areas by three days before Isabel made landfall . Governor Minner mandated all schools to be closed on the day of the hurricane 's landfall , and recommended all residents in mobile homes to evacuate and for businesses to close . The University of Delaware preemptively canceled classes . The Cape May @-@ Lewes Ferry closed for several days in anticipation of the storm . The Delaware Department of Transportation planned to place restrictions on state roads in the event strong wind gusts were recorded . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Strong swells from the hurricane produced a moderate storm surge which peaked at 8 @.@ 66 feet ( 2 @.@ 64 m ) in Reedy Point . Tides were only slightly above normal , though high surf on top of the storm surge resulted in beach erosion , particularly in Sussex County . Waves of 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 18 m ) in height were reported near the coastline . The high waters breached dunes south of Bethany Beach , and several locations along Delaware Route 1 were flooded . The large circulation of Isabel produced gusty winds across the state , including a maximum of 70 mph ( 113 km / h ) in Delaware Pilot Tower in the Delaware Bay . Onshore , gusts peaked at 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) in Lewes , where sustained winds of 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) were also reported . Precipitation was heavy but sporadic , amounting to a maximum of 1 @.@ 88 inches ( 48 mm ) in Greenwood . Heavy rainfall further inland resulted in moderate to severe river flooding . The Christina River at Cooch 's Bridge crested at 2 @.@ 38 feet ( 0 @.@ 725 m ) above flood stage , and the Red Clay Creek at <unk> crested at roughly 4 inches ( 100 mm ) above flood stage . Runoff from streams were slowed due to the approaching storm surge from the hurricane . 
 At the Delaware Breakwater East End Lighthouse in Lewes , strong waves destroyed the lower deck of the lighthouse , while powerful winds blew out the watchroom window . A group of eight volunteers quickly repaired the damage . Moderate wind gusts knocked down numerous trees , tree limbs , and power lines , causing widespread power outages in the state . <unk> Energy reported the power outage associated with the hurricane as one of the worst in its history . At least 15 @,@ 300 were left without power during the worst of the hurricane , including 2 @,@ 500 in the capital city of Dover . Due to the power outages , only one traffic light north of the city of Wilmington was operational . The strong winds also resulted in the Delaware River and Bay Authority to reduce the speed limit on the Delaware Memorial Bridge to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . 62 roads throughout the state were initially closed due to flooding , downed trees , or downed power lines . Eight roads , including U.S. Route 13A remained closed for several days , primarily due to flooding . Flooding affected the cities of Seaford , Blades , Bayview , and Augustine Beach , with residents in the latter two being forced to evacuate due to severe flooding conditions . Several state parks reported downed trees and damage . Damage in the state totaled $ 40 million ( 2003 USD , $ 44 million 2006 USD ) , and there were no deaths in the state as a result of the storm . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On September 20 , two days after Hurricane Isabel passed the state , Governor Ruth Ann Minner made a formal request for a federal disaster declaration for the state . Later that day , President George W. Bush issued a federal disaster declaration for Delaware , one of twelve disaster declarations for the state . The declaration allowed for the use of federal disaster funds and emergency resources to help families and businesses recover from the effects of Hurricane Isabel . State and federal officials opened a disaster recovery center in Georgetown and Wilmington to assist individuals who suffered losses from Isabel and the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri just days before . 761 people visited the recovery centers before they closed . One week after the disaster declaration , residents began receiving checks for those who applied for aid . By about two months after the passage of Hurricane Isabel , 659 residents applied for assistance , with slightly over $ 1 million ( 2003 USD , $ 1 @.@ 1 million 2006 USD ) being distributed to the victims . 141 loan applications were received , as well . FEMA distributed about $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( $ 3 @.@ 22 million 2016 USD ) in Small Business Administration loans , and also received 183 public assistance loans for repair or replacement of public facilities . 
 A total of 35 power crews , along with outside contractors , worked to restore power . By two days after the storm , 2 @,@ 000 remained without power in scattered areas . Various locations in the city of Dover were without power for about 30 hours . There , the removal of debris exceeded the capacity of the local landfall , resulting in officials temporarily storing it elsewhere . Over 200 volunteers donated time , food and money to provide hot meals for individuals and families affected by the storm . Support teams provided by county officials transported over 300 tons of ruined accessories from the storm , such as appliances , carpets , and drywall , to local landfills . Qualifying for two NASCAR races in Dover were cancelled due to the hurricane , although the races went on as scheduled . 
 = Brooklyn Free School = 
 The Brooklyn Free School is a private , ungraded , democratic free school in Fort Greene , Brooklyn , founded in 2004 . Students range in age from 4 to 18 years old . The school follows the <unk> philosophy of the 1960s / 70s free school movement schools , which encourages self @-@ directed learning and protects child freedom of activity . There are no grades , no tests , and classes are non @-@ compulsory . As of 2015 , the school enrolls 80 students and has about 24 graduates . 
 The school was the first free school in New York City since 1975 . It started in a rented portion of a Park Slope Methodist church , but moved to a brownstone in Fort Greene . Students participate in the design of classes and in the school 's governance , which is done at a weekly Democratic Meeting . Staff and students all have equal votes . The school is funded through sliding @-@ scale tuition , grants , and donations . In 2012 , Lucas Kavner of The Huffington Post called the Brooklyn Free School " arguably New York 's most radical center of learning " . 
 = = History = = 
 The Brooklyn Free School was founded in 2004 in Park Slope , Brooklyn , and began its first academic session later that year . Its director , Alan Berger , had been an assistant principal at a Manhattan high school before he left to found the alternative school . He had read about a free school in Woodstock , New York , and was " grabbed ... to the core " . Berger published his idea for the school in the October 2003 issue of the park Slope Food Co @-@ op newsletter . About 170 people showed interest , and a group held biweekly planning sessions until the school opened in the 16th Street Brooklyn First Free Methodist Church 's bottom two floors in 2004 . The original class was thirty students with three teachers . It was the first free school in New York City since the Park Slope Fifteenth Street School closed in 1975 . By November 2012 , the school had moved to a four @-@ floor brownstone in Fort Greene . The school had 42 pupils by November 2006 , 60 by 2012 , and 80 by 2015 . As of 2015 , Lily Mercogliano is the school 's director . 
 = = Program = = 
 The school operates under a " <unk> " philosophy where students are encouraged to develop their own interests and where all learning is self @-@ directed . As such , Brooklyn Free School has no grades , no tests , and no compulsory classes or homework . Students are free to pursue the activities of their interest , such as reading alone or taking a class . Students are free to leave classes as they please . Classes have included philosophy seminars , cheese @-@ tasting , book discussions , business , astrology , psychology , videography , and Tibet . Some classes are taught by volunteers . By law , students are required to attend for 5 @.@ 5 hours a day . Principal Alan Berger contends that the school provides an education better adapted for the Internet era , as one more original , enterprising , and adaptive in the face of a changing economy . 
 The Brooklyn Free School holds a weekly , mandatory Democratic Meeting on Wednesday mornings . The meeting runs the school , and students and teachers alike have equal votes . Students are not required to pay attention . Meeting topics range from disciplinary grievances to admissions to computer use . A meeting chair is chosen at the beginning of the meeting and the floor is opened for propositions . Anyone wishing to discuss a school issue can call schoolwide meetings . 
 As of 2015 , the school enrolls about 80 students , about half of whom are African @-@ American or Latino . The school is divided into upper and lower schools , the former ages 11 to 18 and the latter ages 4 to 11 , though they are not physically separated by age . Children apply for admission and visit for a five @-@ day orientation . Students are admitted by unanimous vote of a teacher @-@ parent @-@ student admissions committee . The group first determines whether applicants ' parents support their decision to attend and whether the school can provide for the students ' needs . The school keeps a waiting list . 
 The school is funded through tuition , grants , and donations . The majority of students come from middle @-@ class families from Brooklyn . The private school has sliding @-@ scale tuition , and less than half pay full tuition . Founding director Alan Berger said that 20 percent paid full tuition in 2012 . In 2015 , about a third paid less than $ 500 in tuition , and another third paid half tuition . The sliding scale 's full tuition is set at $ 22 @,@ 000 . 
 The school graduated 21 students as of 2012 , and 24 as of 2015 . Students compile their own transcript and nominate themselves for graduation . Some take standardized state and college entrance tests . The majority of Brooklyn Free School graduates continue to college . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Lucas Kavner of The Huffington Post wrote in 2012 that the school serves as a model for independent , democratic schools at the forefront of renewed interest in the 1960s / 70s free school movement . He added that critics contend that the school 's environment does not prepare students for real life , and that students from families that cannot hire tutors will suffer disproportionately . The school inspired the Manhattan Free School ( founded in 2008 ) , and , in turn , was inspired by the Albany Free School ( founded in 1969 ) . Kavner called the Brooklyn Free School " arguably New York 's most radical center of learning " . 
 An article in The New York Times in 2006 wrote that parents hired outside tutors in concern for the school 's academic preparation . A third of the original students left within the 2004 academic year , as did the original teachers .

 Enterprise returns to Earth in order to attend the formation of a " Coalition of Planets " . Nathan Samuels , a United Earth government minister , gives a speech , but he fails to mention the contribution they made to get the aliens to work collaboratively . A woman , later identified as Susan Khouri , staggers over to T 'Pol and produces a vial containing a hair follicle , before collapsing and dying from a phaser wound . Back on board Enterprise , Doctor Phlox examines the hair 's DNA , learning it is from the child of Commander T 'Pol and Commander Tucker , but T 'Pol denies ever being pregnant . 
 Captain Archer meets with Samuels , who is concerned that news of the child will stir xenophobic sentiment . Lieutenant Reed is ordered by Archer to liaise with Harris of Section 31 . He is informed that <unk> was a member of Terra Prime , an anti @-@ alien movement . Meanwhile , in the Terra Prime headquarters on the Moon , John Frederick Paxton and Doctor Mercer discuss the child . After Mercer leaves , Paxton sends for Daniel Greaves and tells him to deal with Mercer . On Earth , Archer tells Samuels that he knows that the minister was a former member of Terra Prime and convinces him to provide a case file on Khouri . Meanwhile , Ensign Mayweather gives his reporter ex @-@ girlfriend , Gannet Brooks , a tour of the ship . 
 On the Moon , Paxton watches footage of Colonel Phillip Green ( " The Savage Curtain " ) . Greaves enters and updates Paxton on the status of the child , and Paxton injects himself in the neck with an unknown substance . Phlox then reports that Khouri 's body contained traces of a substance used in a zero @-@ gravity mining facility . T 'Pol and Tucker volunteer for an away mission to the Moon . Disguised as miners , they are quickly detained after Brooks apparently leaks details of the mission . Paxton reveals that the entire complex is a warp capable ship , and the vessel travels to Mars where it takes control of the <unk> array , which normally protects the Earth from comets . He uses the array to fire a warning shot and issue an ultimatum — that all non @-@ humans must immediately leave Earth .

 Showrunner and writer Manny Coto explained that the " demons " in the episode refers to the demons of intolerance that humanity must defeat before they can form the United Federation of Planets . Colonel Philip Green ( the leading villain of World War III in the Star Trek universe ) was originally intended to appear earlier in the season in the episode " Borderland " but the episode was instead re @-@ written to feature Arik Soong after The Next Generation actor Brent Spiner became available ; Green 's appearance was one of several included in season four which linked Enterprise to The Original Series , which included the Mirror Universe and Gorn in " In a Mirror , Darkly " , Organians in " Observer Effect " and the Orions in " Borderland " and " Bound " . 
 Peter Weller was cast in the role of John Frederick Paxton . Weller had previously appeared in other science fiction productions , including as the main character in the film RoboCop ( 1987 ) . He also played Chuck Taggart in the television series Odyssey 5 , which had been created by Manny Coto . Weller said of the plot of the episode , " The great thing about the whole Star Trek legacy is that they ... <unk> , they <unk> and they narrate what 's going on the planet today " . He would later go on to gain a role in the movie Star Trek Into Darkness ( 2013 ) . This was the third Star Trek appearance of Harry Groener , who played Nathan Samuels . He had previously portrayed Tam <unk> in The Next Generation episode " Tin Man " and the Magistrate in the Voyager episode " Sacred Ground " . Eric Pierpoint returned as Harris , whom he had previously played earlier in the season in the episode " Affliction " . Game show host Tom Bergeron made a cameo in the episode as a <unk> Ambassador . He had previously appeared as D <unk> in the first season episode " Oasis " .

 The episode was directed by former Star Trek : The Next Generation actor LeVar Burton , his second of the season , and his ninth and final for the series . Filming began on February 4 , 2005 and completed on February 14 . The first day of shooting overlapped with the filming for the previous episode , " In a Mirror , Darkly " . The first day was spent filming scenes involving Mayweather and Brooks , while the second day overlapped with a re @-@ shoot of the conclusion of the episode " Bound " and inserts for " Affliction " and " Divergence " . The following three days were spent on the standing sets such as the bridge and sickbay , before moving onto the standing cave sets on stage 9 . These had previously been painted white for use in " The Aenar " , and were repainted grey to represent the tunnels on the Moon for " Demons " . 
 The only exterior location used was an alleyway on the Paramount lot near the soundstages . The alley had previously been used as a location in the Deep Space Nine episode " Little Green Men " . Production moved to the Paramount Theatre on the final day of filming , which hosted the season premieres . It was used to portray the Assembly Hall of Starfleet Command . The footage of Colonel Green was shot later , with a greenscreen placed on the monitor during the filming with Weller .

 Michelle Erica Green at TrekNation described the episode as a " riveting hour of television " . She thought that the episode posed the same types of ideological questions that The Original Series did on occasion and caused her to look forward to the following episode . Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website " Jammer 's Reviews " gave the episode a score of three out of four , saying that it was a " pretty good story [ told ] in an exceptionally average way " . Jay Garmon , whilst compiling a list of the best episodes of Enterprise for TechRepublic , listed " Demons " and " Terra Prime " as the third best .

 = The Bus Uncle = 
 The Bus Uncle is a Cantonese YouTube viral video clip of a quarrel between two men aboard a bus in Hong Kong on 27 April 2006 . While the older man , who came to be nicknamed the Bus Uncle , scolded the man seated behind him , a nearby passenger used a camera phone to record the entire incident . The resulting six @-@ minute video was uploaded to the Hong Kong Golden Forum , YouTube , and Google Videos . The clip became YouTube 's most viewed video in May 2006 , attracting viewers with its rhetorical outbursts and copious use of profanity by the older man , receiving 1 @.@ 7 million hits in the first 3 weeks of that month . 
 The video became a cultural sensation in Hong Kong , inspiring vigorous debate and discussion on lifestyle , etiquette , civic awareness and media ethics within the city , eventually attracting the attention of the media around the world . 
 = = Incident = = 
 The video depicts the incident that took place on the upper deck of a double decker Kowloon Motor Bus , Route no . 68X en route to Yuen Long , Hong Kong at approximately 11 : 00 pm on 27 April 2006 . It began when a young bespectacled male passenger tapped the shoulder of a middle @-@ aged man in front of him who was chatting on his mobile phone , asking the man to lower his voice . The older man later claimed that when he was tapped on the shoulder , he was under stress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the Samaritans . However , the younger man said that he was in fact merely chatting with friends . The older man turned around and started a monologue , ranting about being unnecessarily provoked under stress . The younger man , who seldom talked back , expressed a desire to end the discussion . However , the middle @-@ aged man insisted that the matter was not settled and requested an apology from him . The younger man apologised , reluctantly shook hands , but also warned the older man regarding the use of mother insults . This last warning resulted in more profanities from the older man . The video ends with the older man receiving a phone call . 
 = = Video = = 
 The video was shot by a 21 @-@ year @-@ old accountant and part @-@ time psychology student identified as Jon Fong Wing Hang ( Chinese : <unk> ) . In a radio station phone @-@ in on 25 May 2006 , Fong said he recorded the incident on a mobile phone in case the abusive man became violent . He claimed there was a second video yet to be posted online in which the younger man fought back by making fun of " Bus Uncle " with a friend on the phone . However , Fong " told reporters that he often takes videos as a hobby , and had just planned to share this one with friends . " The video clip has English subtitles which , while erroneous in parts , never stray far from the general tenor of the Cantonese version . 
 The " Bus Uncle " title for the video was coined by members of an Internet forum in reference to the older man in the video . In Hong Kong , it is common to refer to an older man as " Uncle " ( <unk> ) , hence the English translation " The Bus Uncle " . Lam 's name appears as part of the title of the original video . Contrary to reports in Western media , the word " Uncle " ( <unk> ) was not used . 
 On 28 May 2006 , this incident was mentioned on the main evening news on TVB , as well as Cable TV news . News of the video clip has penetrated Western media and has been widely syndicated , and reported in prominent international journals in late May 2006 , such as Channel <unk> , CNN , and The Wall Street Journal . 
 = = Characters = = 
 As the video became well @-@ known , reporters located the " Bus Uncle " near the end of the 68X bus route . He was found to be Roger Chan Yuet Tung ( Chinese : <unk> ; Jyutping : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a 51 @-@ year @-@ old restaurant worker who lives in Yuen Long . On 23 May 2006 , 23 @-@ year @-@ old property agent Elvis Ho Yui Hei ( Chinese : <unk> ; Jyutping : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , previously misidentified as " Alvin " or " Elvin " ) called a talk show on Commercial Radio Hong Kong claiming to be the young man involved in the argument . 
 Chan lives by himself , with rare contact with his family , though he has a girlfriend in Mong Kok . He has been unemployed for more than ten years , living off welfare payments . After his identity was revealed , Chan was criticised for reportedly demanding remuneration for interviews . 
 Ho often takes long bus rides home , frequently asking passengers to lower their voices so he can nap . Despite being threatened , Ho said he forgave " Bus Uncle " and sympathised with whatever stress the older man was suffering . He said his patience throughout the ordeal was inspired by t 'ai chi ch 'uan . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Sing Tao Daily reported that Chan visited Ho 's office on 31 May 2006 in Mong Kok to apologise for the dispute and to initiate a business proposal for the duo to hold a " Bus Uncle Rave Party " . Chan was quickly rejected and expelled by Ho , who expressed outrage towards the journalists who arranged the meeting and threatened legal action against the press . 
 Ming Pao opined that the use of profanity by the " Bus Uncle " and threatening behaviour theoretically contravened the general code of conduct of bus passengers , and that he had violated two public order laws – Section 46 ( 1 ) ( a ) , ( n ) ( ii ) and 57 ( 1 ) of the Road Traffic ( Public Service Vehicles ) Regulations , and Section 17B ( 2 ) of the Public Order Ordinance – which potentially carried financial penalties and imprisonment . 
 Next Magazine journalists interviewed Chan at his home in Yuen Long , and his interview became the magazine 's cover story on 1 June 2006 . On 7 June 2006 , Chan , who had been hired as a Public Relations officer in the Steak Expert restaurant chain , was physically assaulted while on duty in front of witnesses by three unidentified masked men who then fled the scene . He sustained severe injuries to his eyes and face and was admitted to the emergency department for treatment . The restaurant owner , Mr. Lee , then faced pressure from his wife and daughter to fire Chan due to magazine allegations of Chan 's exploits in a Shenzhen karaoke hostess bar . Chan resigned after the owner 's wife attempted to overdose on drugs , ostensibly in an effort to force the issue .

 = = = Effects on popular culture = = = 
 Some of Chan 's phrases are now frequently used , mimicked , and parodied in Hong Kong , particularly by teenagers . 「 <unk> ， <unk> 」 ( You have pressure , I have pressure ) , 「 <unk> ！ 」 ( It 's not settled ! ) have become catchphrases on Internet forums , posters , and radio programmes . Various music videos have been created using the catchphrases , including pop , karaoke , rap , dance and disco remixes . There have also been parodies of an apology , " re @-@ enactments " of the incident with video game characters , composite pictures , movie posters , and versions involving Darth Vader and Adagio for Strings . Merchandise such as cartoon T @-@ shirts and mobile phone ringtones have also been produced and sold on the Internet . 
 In June 2006 , TVB television made a parody of the Bus Uncle video in promoting its coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup , featuring its sports commentator Lam Sheung Yee ( <unk> ) , whose voice resembles Chan 's , on a bus playing the role of the Bus Uncle . In the advertisement , a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung Yee ( played by Lam Man Chung ) questions whether Lam Sheung Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup , which would be his last TV appearance before retirement . Turning around , Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasises the issue ( i.e. the viewers ' demand for World Cup coverage ) has been resolved . The passenger then offers to shake hands with Lam Sheung Yee , calling for a truce . 
 In addition , sitcoms of ATV and TVB imitated the video in argument scenes . In episode 67 of the TVB sitcom Welcome to the House ( <unk> ) , the young bespectacled main character tried to stop a man from talking too loudly on the mobile phone in the cinema . As a result , he was harshly rebuked by the man . Once his family knew about the incident from a video uploaded on the Internet , they taught the character to be more assertive and not to allow himself to be bullied . In the end , he was able to stand up to the same man when they met again in the cinema and remove him from the premises . 
 = = = Stress in Hong Kong = = = 
 Although many found the video humorous and entertaining , others warned that it hinted at a more alarming and sinister prognosis of life in stress @-@ filled Hong Kong , particularly inside buses , nicknamed " flying cars of death " and other overcrowded areas . Lee Sing , director of the Hong Kong Mood Disorders Centre at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , warned that Hong Kong 's high @-@ stress working environments are spawning a city @-@ full of " Bus Uncles " . Lee estimated that one of every 50 Hongkongers suffers from intermittent explosive disorder , turning one into a " ticking time bomb " of rage and violence . 
 Journalism professor and Internet expert Anthony Fung Ying @-@ him also attributed the popularity of the low @-@ resolution video of a " trivial event " to the emotional climate of the city . While other viral videos are favoured by specific demographics , this one spread widely due to its universal expression of " the true feelings of ordinary people . " 
 On the other hand , Ho Kwok Leung , an applied social science lecturer at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University , held that attention surrounding the video reflected the boring lives of Hong Kong people . With few interesting topics to discuss , they savour the pleasure of spreading information to a vast audience and the creation of Internet memes . Furthermore , the banning of the use of some video catchphrases in certain schools made the incident more appealing . This lifestyle , according to Leung , is fertile ground for the cultivation of a " video clip culture " . 
 = = = Civic awareness concerns = = = 
 Ah Nong ( <unk> , J : <unk> <unk> , P : <unk> <unk> ) , a popular literary figure and artist in Hong Kong , believed that the incident highlighted the apathy of the common Hong Kong people . He emphasised that during the heated exchange between Chan and Ho , not a single bystander came to Ho 's aid . He recalled an incident a few years back where he confronted a man smoking on the lower deck of a bus and was scolded for the rest of the journey . He said it was useless to complain to the bus driver who would not bother to waste his time , let alone the other passengers . Ah Nong argued that in such a society , a person can be accused of wrongdoing despite good intentions . 
 There was support for Ho 's desire for a lower volume as well as sympathy for the stress felt by the " Bus Uncle . " Others maintained that Chan 's actions were atypical of etiquette in Hong Kong . Apple Tse Ho Yi , minister of the Hong Kong Christian Service , carried out a survey of 506 students over the age of 12 following the incident . Of the respondents who claim they regularly encountered people speaking loudly on the phone on buses , only 47 % said they would intervene by talking to the phone user or alerting the driver . Reasons for inaction include fear , apathy and inability to solve the problem . On civic awareness , the majority of the respondents did not consider chatting loudly on the phone to be wrong . Tse concluded that the current generation of Hong Kong young people have poor civic awareness , and it is natural that disputes often occur due to <unk> . Speaking about the incident on Commercial Radio , Journalist Chip Tsao described Chan 's behaviour as " noise raping " and said that the incident was a manifestation of underlying social tension as well as the mindset of a " common <unk> " . He criticised Ho as being a stereotype of present @-@ day Hong Kong youth – speechless and too weak . 
 Chan 's placement as runner @-@ up " Person of the Year " announced by Radio Television Hong Kong was seen by Michael DeGolyer of the Hong Kong Standard that it might have struck a chord with the general population . Ng Fung Sheung , a social science lecturer of the City University of Hong Kong , explained that Hong Kong people tend to chat loudly in public places . She attributed this phenomenon to the television screens found in many vehicles and trains , which broadcast programmes at high volumes . She suggested that the government should provide better civic education for the public to make them more considerate of others . When it comes to schools which banned the usage of catch phrases like " I 'm stressed ! " Ng stated that teachers must be able to distinguish whether the students really face pressure or are simply following the trend , and provide guidance if necessary . 
 = = = Criticism of media ethics = = = 
 Some denied that any social insight could be gleaned from the video clip , arguing that the frenzy was artificially created by sensationalist newspapers in order to boost circulation and profits . Clement So York @-@ kee , Director of the School of Journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , warned that methods to uncover the incident between Chan and Ho " did not seem to ... [ involve the ] traditional practice of news reporting . " For example , several media outlets offered rewards on unmasking Bus Uncle 's identity . In late May 2006 , a group of journalists and photographers initiated and followed Chan 's second meeting with Ho . After Ho 's refusal , they brought Bus Uncle to a dinner and karaoke session . Although the session was widely reported , many believed it was artificially created news and unworthy of front @-@ page attention . 
 Ta Kung Pao stated that the Bus Uncle incident tested the professionalism of the Hong Kong mass media , its editorial noting that Chan sought remuneration for interviews and made many extraordinary claims about himself which were published without verification . The editorial concluded by advising journalists not to fabricate news , but instead to emphasise the verifiability of stories and consider carefully whether an incident is newsworthy . 
 Others held that the frenzy was not the product of a media conspiracy , but rather a reflection of the public 's curiosity and Hong Kong 's competitive consumer @-@ driven media market . The situation also allowed camera phone marketers to highlight the potential comedic value and draw attention away from privacy concerns . 
 In the aftermath , other such videos appeared including a woman at Hong Kong 's airport who was driven into a hysterical panic after missing her flight . That video was viewed 750 @,@ 000 times in five days . 
 = The Monster Ball Tour = 
 The Monster Ball Tour was the second worldwide concert tour by American singer Lady Gaga . Staged in support of her extended play The Fame Monster ( 2009 ) and comprising a set list of songs from that and her debut album The Fame ( 2008 ) , the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 2009 through 2011 . Described as " the first @-@ ever pop electro opera " by Gaga , the tour was announced in October 2009 after an intended joint concert tour with hip @-@ hop artist Kanye West was suddenly canceled . The Monster Ball Tour commenced four days after the release of The Fame Monster in November 2009 . 
 A revision of the tour occurred after only a few months of performances , due to Gaga 's concern that the original version was constructed within a very short span of time . The stage of the original show looked like a frame , comparable to that of a hollowed @-@ out television set . Since The Fame Monster dealt with the paranoias Gaga had faced , the main theme of the original shows became human evolution , while elements of the canceled tour with West were still included in some parts . From 2010 onwards , the revamped shows had a New York theme and portrayed a story set in the city , where Gaga and her friends got lost and had to find their way to " the Monster Ball " . Both versions of the show were divided into five segments , with the last being the encore . Each of them featured Gaga in new outfits , singing songs related to the concept of the segment , as they were followed by a video interlude . 
 The tour received general critical acclaim , with critics praising Gaga 's singing abilities , the theatricality of the show , and her sense of style and fashion . The Monster Ball was a commercial success , with sold @-@ out shows and demand for tickets prompting organizers to add more dates to the itinerary . It ultimately grossed an estimated US $ 227 @.@ 4 million from 200 reported shows and an audience of 2 @.@ 5 million . At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards , Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award , as well as the Concert Marketing & Promotion Award , the latter being an acknowledgment of her partnership with sponsor Virgin Mobile . HBO filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga 's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City . Documenting the whole concert with intersperses of backstage footage , Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour : At Madison Square Garden , aired in May and was released on DVD and Blu @-@ ray on November 21 , 2011 .

 Initially , hip @-@ hop artist Kanye West and Lady Gaga had plans to launch a joint tour in October 2009 , known as " Fame Kills : Starring Lady Gaga and Kanye West " . Amid negative response to his controversial outbursts at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards , West declared that he would take a hiatus from his music career . Nevertheless , the complete schedule for Fame Kills was released , with the tour set to begin on November 10 , 2009 , in Phoenix , Arizona . Shortly afterwards , the tour was officially cancelled without any explanation . Gaga addressed the situation at Billboard 's annual Women in Music luncheon , where she cited creative differences as the reason for the tour 's cancellation . In an interview she stated , " [ Kanye ] is going to take a break , but the good news is , I am not . " 
 After assuring the public that she would be embarking on her own tour , Gaga officially announced The Monster Ball Tour on October 15 , 2009 . It was originally planned to debut in London in early 2010 , but ended up kicking off on November 27 , 2009 , in Montreal . Rapper Kid Cudi and singer Jason Derülo were confirmed as the supporting acts for the tour , with Cudi supporting Gaga from the beginning of the tour , and Derülo joining from December 28 , 2009 . The official poster for the tour featured Gaga in Versace 676 sunglasses and wearing a gyroscope around her called " The Orbit " , which she first wore on the October 3 , 2009 , episode of Saturday Night Live . The contraption was designed by Nasir Mazhar in collaboration with Gaga 's own creative production company , Haus of Gaga . The tour 's sponsor of the American leg was Virgin Mobile USA , who introduced the " Free I.P. " program which offered free show tickets to fans who volunteered their time to homeless youth organizations .

 In an interview with Rolling Stone , Gaga explained that she wanted to put together an expensive looking , beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans . She asserted that the tour was a " pop @-@ electro opera " because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an opera . According to her , the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness . Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was " essentially a frame with forced perspective , and the frame is put inside the stage . " The stage had a triangular inset , like a diamond , and everywhere the show took place , the dimensions were measured in such a way that the box fit any stage . " So no matter where I go , my fans get the same experience . So often you go into theaters and there 's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places , and the audience is in different spots , and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths , so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show " , she added . 
 The show revolved around themes of evolution , as well as her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster . While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings ; " So we talked about growth , and that led us into this kind of scientific space , and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing , and we become another . " This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour , which according to Gaga was " another level from where we were with the Fame Ball . [ ... ] It 's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post @-@ apocalyptic house party that you 've ever been to . " Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour , she concluded that she did not want to use any of the things that they had designed together . Later , she said that Fame Kills was " the great lost tour " , but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball . 
 In an interview with MTV News , Gaga further described the tour : 
 " I begin as a cell and I grow and change throughout the show . And it 's also done in what now is becoming my aesthetic , which is , you know , it 's part pop , part performance art , part fashion installation — so all of those things are present ... It 's a story , it 's me battling all my monsters along the way . I 'm playing all the music from The Fame , all the music from The Fame Monster . And the stage that I designed with the Haus [ of Gaga ] is a giant cube that sits . Imagine you were to hollow out a TV and just break the fourth wall on a TV screen . It forces you to look at the center of the TV . It 's my way of saying , ' My music is art . ' " 
 For the performance of " Paparazzi " , Gaga had collaborated with her Haus of Gaga creative partner Matthew " Matty Dada " Williams . She had a different vision for it in the beginning . Dada thought that Gaga should wear her hair braided , which Gaga had never done before . Dada 's explanation for the concept was the look of Rapunzel , the fairy @-@ tale character . He felt that " it 's something people deeply understand . And when you 're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing behind you , I promised [ to Gaga ] it 's not going to look like Rapunzel . ' " 
 = = = Revamped concept = = = 
 In December 2009 , Gaga revealed that she planned to cancel the concept of the original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh . She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time . Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour , she was unsure if she could get a show together in time , but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster . Hence she was able to put together " something that , in truth , I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time " . The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010 . " My team thinks I 'm completely psychotic . But I don 't fucking care what they think . [ ... ] Well , just to give you an idea , the stage is about four times the size of the one we 're on now and conceptually , it 's completely different . One thing that has been lost over the past 10 @-@ 15 years , in pop music , is the idea of showbiz . And this is definitely going to bring that back " , clarified Gaga . According to James Montgomery of MTV , the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) and West Side Story ( 1961 ) , the science @-@ fiction film Metropolis ( 1927 ) , and the television mini @-@ series Angels in America ( 2003 ) . 
 During an interview with London 's 95 @.@ 8 Capital FM radio station , Gaga further elaborated on the changes in the show . She said that the show was constructed like a piece of musical theater . It also incorporated a number of contemporary and old musical pieces , some of them being re @-@ recorded specifically for the show itself . A new keytar was constructed for the show and was named Emma . The instrument was created by the Haus of Gaga and the singer said , " We have this new instrument that I brought to the Brits tonight , ' Emma ' , which is what I was playing on the stage . She 's a hybrid from all these other instruments . " During an interview on KISS @-@ FM with Ryan Seacrest , on his show On Air with Ryan Seacrest , Gaga explained that the concert tour was still called Monster Ball , but it had become more of a musical and less of a concert . It had a New York theme at its core ; telling a story where Gaga and her friends traveled to the Monster Ball , but got lost .

 Beginning behind a giant , green , laser lit video screen featuring scrim lights , Gaga appeared in a bulb @-@ covered futuristic silver jeweled jumpsuit with matching eye makeup and mask and sang " Dance in the Dark " as dancers , dressed in white balaclavas and white jumpsuits , moved around her . The video screen , resembling an electric mathematical grid , was eventually lifted during the performance . After the song , Gaga strapped a portable silver jeweled keyboard to herself and began to perform " Just Dance " while emerging from the inside of a white cube on a platform . This was followed by a brief video intermission and Gaga returned onstage in an off @-@ white costume , that resembled an alien <unk> @-@ skeleton , while the dancers wore skeletal headgear . She started performing " LoveGame " , which ended with Gaga pointing towards her groin . Flames appeared on the video screens , as she got out of her <unk> @-@ skeleton outfit . After stripping down to a silver bodysuit she performed " Alejandro " , and was carried by her crotch by one of her male dancers , and later lowered onto another one of them . 
 The section was followed by a video interlude featuring snarling dogs and brooding ravens . The performance of " Monster " began with Gaga emerging in a black feathered jacket and performing dance moves reminiscent of Michael Jackson as the backdrops featured a black bird 's wings . She continued with two songs from The Fame Monster titled " So Happy I Could Die " and " Teeth " , after which she removed the feathered dress . Gaga then started performing the song " Speechless " on piano , and continued with an acoustic version of " Poker Face " . Rapper Kid Cudi joined her then to perform his song " Make Her Say " which contains a sample of " Poker Face " . This segment was followed by the performance of " Fashion " and " The Fame " , during which Gaga wore a gold Egyptian styled crown and matching body suit , compared to the garment of a viking . Gaga crawled atop her piano during the follow @-@ up songs " The Fame " and " Money Honey " , after which she returned to the stage , dressed in black vinyl and nearly nude in a red patent leather bikini , to perform " Boys Boys Boys " , backed by a squadron of skinny and shirtless leather boys . During " Poker Face " , she wore a bondage inspired black leather dress with guns hanging from it and a hat made of muzzles , and pumped her hands in the air while performing the song . This was followed by Gaga sitting on a dentist 's chair and spreading her legs during " Paper Gangsta " . Another video interlude followed , displaying arty poses of Gaga in gothic looks . 
 She returned to the stage while wearing multiple donned braided extensions for " Paparazzi " . Gaga was perched atop a railing and from each of her braids , a dancer was attached on the stage . A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance . The performance ended with the railing taking Gaga high above the stage , where she faked her death . This was followed by " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " as she descended from the top — which signified her rebirth — amidst white lights and mechanical fog . She wore a giant gyroscope around her , akin to " The Orbit " by Haus of Gaga . The last song of the show was " Bad Romance " which she performed in an ' 80s @-@ inspired white power suit with exaggerated high shoulders and high @-@ waisted pants . The show ended with a video of Gaga getting a heart @-@ shaped tattoo on her shoulder , with the word " Dad " in the center of it .

 After revisions , the show was divided into four sections : City , Subway , Forest , Monster Ball and concluded with an encore . It began with a projected video onto a curtain — which contained images of Gaga smoking a cigarette — while a club remix of " Dance in the Dark " played . Surrounded by violet light , her silhouette appeared on the curtain while she performed " Dance in the Dark " . Once the curtain was removed and the chorus reached , the New York cityscape and neon lights were revealed . Gaga gyrated on the set dressed in a " futuristic , angular , glitter ball suit " . After descending from her fire escape , she poked around in the hood of a dilapidated green Rolls Royce while performing " Glitter and Grease " . Upon checking under the vehicle 's bonnet , Gaga revealed a keyboard and began to play the opening notes of " Just Dance " . Gaga then performed " Beautiful , Dirty , Rich " while scaling various pieces of scaffolding and subsequently " The Fame " where she rose from beneath the stage and played her keytar Emma , wearing a giant red cape . 
 " LoveGame " saw the beginning of the Subway section , with Gaga wearing a translucent nun 's habit , and a skeletal hand . The song was performed with the aid of a gilded subway car and a " disco stick " while her next number " Boys Boys Boys " featured muscly male dancers cavorting in spandex shorts . After a costume change , Gaga burst into " Money Honey " with an extended keytar solo after emerging from beneath the stage as the New York scenery disappeared around her . As she walked towards the Glitter way , Gaga recalls when she was in jail and her friend Beyoncé bailed her out , thus performing the song " Telephone " . A piano is then brought in and Gaga goes into the song " Brown Eyes " , after which she performs " Speechless " . This segment also saw the performance of " You and I " in some of the shows ; the song was later added to Gaga 's second studio album , Born This Way . During this song , she tells the audience about her life as a teen in New York , and how she became who she is today . Gaga and her friends then continue down the Glitter Way , and soon they run into an angel , who plays a tune that summons a twister , taking them closer to the Monster Ball , but landing them in a strange place that they did not know . Gaga sings " So Happy I Could Die " , decked in a white dress , that moves on its own accord . 
 The third segment begins with Gaga returning on the stage and singing " Monster " , inside a forest with black , thorn @-@ like trees . Her dancers conglomerate around her near the end and Gaga reveals herself to be covered with blood . She then states that the thing she hates more than money is the truth and performs " Teeth " , while introducing her band . Gaga and her friends then find the Eternal Fountain , which pours out red colored liquid and Gaga explains that it bleeds for anyone . She starts singing " Alejandro " while jumping into the fountain and singing , as blood pours over her . Gaga then returns and sings " Poker Face " on the cat @-@ walk . After the performance , she and her friends find themselves in a dark place , and after some dialogue , Gaga 's friends run off , leaving her alone to deal with the Fame Monster , a giant angler fish . Gaga starts singing " Paparazzi " and eventually kills the Fame Monster by shooting sparks from her pyrotechnic bra and underwear . She then leaves for the Monster Ball and after appearing there , meanwhile Fan 's assume the show is over , suddenly Gaga appears on stage and performs " Bad Romance " while standing inside a giant gyroscope . In the 2011 dates , she performed Born This Way . In May 5 – 6 at the last two dates , she performed Judas as an encore .

 The original version of the tour was acclaimed by critics . Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun gave the concert four out of five stars and said that Lady Gaga came across as a " confident , colourful , and campy performer . [ ... ] Gaga 's success was evident with slick @-@ looking videos , lights , elaborate costumes , dancers , and yes , a band , even if her stage was sometimes left dark as she left to make numerous changes . " T 'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking — adding that the show never reached its peak until the end , when Gaga performed the " real rendition " of " Poker Face " and " Bad Romance . " " Better late than never " , Dunlevy concluded . <unk> Helmer from Jam ! magazine said that " At first blush , it might seem the real driving force behind Gaga 's meteoric rise to fame is her hand @-@ picked cadre of costume and set designers — dubbed Haus of Gaga — who seemingly know no bounds when it comes to pushing the envelope of haute couture and the theatre of the absurd . [ ... ] But what really sets Gaga apart from the middling masses of lip @-@ synching Britney clones and Idol wannabes is her pure , unadulterated musical talent . [ ... ] The Lady can sing . " Theatre critic Kelly <unk> , while writing for The Guardian , said " While The Monster Ball has nothing on the great operas or the golden age of musical theatre , Lady Gaga 's ' electro @-@ pop opera ' is at least twice as entertaining and infinitely fresher than any stage musical written over the last decade . " Lauren Carter from Boston Herald praised the show saying " [ Gaga ] only has two albums under her belt but who cares ? Every song feels like a hit , and Gaga @-@ as @-@ star is already taking on Madonna @-@ like proportions . [ ... ] After [ the show ] at the Wang Theater , fans could justifiably walk away thinking Lady Gaga is crazy , brilliant or both . " Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone reviewed the performance at Wang Center in Boston and said that " Throughout the evening , Gaga [ .. ] aimed for a kind of pop theatricality that might potentially cement her burgeoning status as performance artist . " 
 Chris Johnson of Daily Mail complimented the costumes worn in the tour . Aidin Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle said that " During her 90 @-@ minute performance — not so much a live concert as a meticulously choreographed spectacle — Lady Gaga also evoked Kanye West with the futuristic set , Britney Spears in her heavy @-@ lidded stage movements , Courtney Love with her interminable between @-@ song monologues highlighted by four @-@ letter squelches and — who else ? — Madonna for , oh , just about everything else . " Jim Harrington from San Jose Mercury News felt that the show would have been better technically if around thirty minutes were lessened from it . James Montogomery from MTV reviewed the concert at San Diego and said that " [ Gaga ] powered through and turned the San Diego Sports Arena into a raucous , delightfully raw discotheque . " Writing for the Las Vegas Sun , Joe Brown observed that " Lady Gaga out @-@ Cher @-@ ed Cher , made Cirque du Soleil and Britney 's ' Circus Tour ' look like county fair carnivals , and made New Year 's Eve in Las Vegas anticlimactic . " Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers avouched that the tour was " an invigoratingly ambitious show , executed with vigor by its star and her expressive dancers . " Jon Pareles from The New York Times said that the tour always provided " something worth a snapshot : a sci @-@ fi tableau , perhaps , or a skimpy , glittery costume . The more her image gets around , the better Lady Gaga does . " 
 = = = Revamped show = = = 
 The revamped concerts were also met with critical acclaim . Mark Savage from BBC Online reviewed the first of the revised performances in the United Kingdom . Savage described the concert as a hugely ambitious , terrifyingly loud show , " spread over four acts and held together by a flimsy ' narrative ' about Gaga and her dancer friends trying to get to a party . " He was also impressed that the entire spectacle was put together in just four weeks . MTV 's James Montogomery reviewed the first North American performance of the tour in Montreal , Canada . He said that the tour was " packed with more wattage than an overheated power plant and more costume changes than a thousand Vegas reviews , it 's the kind of show that leaves you with wide eyes , ringing ears , aching limbs and absolutely zero chance of making it to work in the morning . " New York Daily News writer Jim Farber expected that the theatricality of the show might have obscured the songs , but instead felt that Gaga 's voice was perfect and the concert actually " pushed Gaga a long way towards her obvious goal – to be the queen of this pop moment . " Glenn Gamboa from Newsday said that Gaga " built her monster @-@ sized fame on knowing how to create a spectacle and then having the substance to back it up . For every coat made of Kermit the Frog dolls or headdresses that covered her face in red lace , there was a stomping disco anthem or tender piano ballad to match . That back and forth is the centerpiece of her Monster Ball Tour . " Dan Aquilante from the New York Post was critical of the show , calling it " scripted , silly , and tired , right down to Gaga 's patter . " He added that the 15 costumes Gaga wore during the two @-@ hour plus gig were " more successful helping her cement the notion of an erotic and exotic otherworld . " Writing in the Telegram & Gazette , Craig S. Semon was appreciative of the show , calling it " an out @-@ of @-@ this @-@ world blast and end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ world blow @-@ out that must be seen to be believed . " 
 Rick Massimo , reviewing the concert for The Providence Journal , wrote that as a musical theater , the Monster Ball was not that exciting , but " that leaves the music , and when you lay two hours of her songs end @-@ to @-@ end , it 's easy to see the vision , the intelligence and a serious songwriting talent at work . " Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise was impressed with the show , saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge , but " always danceable " . Philip <unk> from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York 's Madison Square Garden and found it average , calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the " most entertaining " . Toronto Star 's Ben Rayner appreciated the show , exclaiming " hot damn , that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn ’ t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir . " Mariel Concepción from Billboard felt that Gaga " may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over @-@ the @-@ top stage shows , but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night , the pop phenomenon proved she 's a regular girl at heart . " The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as " one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year , [ Gaga ] stimulated the crowd 's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can . She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul . " The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg , and commented that " it takes a certain je ne sais quoi to open your show doing something that looks suspiciously like mime on a rickety metal staircase while wearing an outfit with <unk> the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier . "

 As soon as the dates for the show were announced , there was high demand for tickets . As sponsor of the North American Monster Ball Tour , Virgin Mobile customers had access to presale tickets . Bob <unk> , VP of Marketing for Virgin Mobile USA said " We are excited to take our partnership with Lady Gaga and The Monster Ball Tour to another level . [ ... ] We 'll also build on our partnership around combating youth homelessness and continue to enhance the tour experience for fans and our customers . " Shows in the first leg of the tour were sold @-@ out completely , prompting Live Nation Inc. to announce that Gaga will return to the U.S. in February 2011 for another run of U.S. dates . The 2011 dates for the North American Monster Ball Tour were announced as starting from February 19 in Atlantic City , with ten arena dates confirmed through April 18 . Additional shows were announced , and Semi Precious Weapons collaborated with Gaga until the tour ended . Live Nation Entertainment 's global touring division , headed by chairman Arthur Fogel , held the reins as promoter / producer of the Monster Ball tour . 
 Fogel commented on Gaga 's lack of experience in a tour and said that it was an opportunity for her . " As an artist with that kind of talent and vision emerges , it creates a lot of excitement , and ticket sales worldwide demonstrate that people are really excited to see the show . Over the course of the next many months we 're trying to play to as many people in as many places as possible " , Fogel added . " It 's an across the board home run . " Demands increased and another additional six dates were added to the announced itinerary . The Monster Ball sold out shows in Toronto , Vancouver and San Jose who were compelled to add second dates in each city . In Los Angeles , to ensure that concert goers had the best possible access to tickets , a second performance was announced prior to the <unk> of the first shows , and both Staples Center concerts were completely sold out . Billboard estimated that by the time the tour wraps up in 2011 , it would have grossed close to US $ 200 million worldwide . 
 The ticket money from the final performance at Radio City was donated for the Haiti earthquake relief . Gaga announced on the re @-@ scheduled show at Elliott Hall of Music on January 26 , 2010 , that about US $ 500 @,@ 000 was collected for the relief . At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards , Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award , as well as the Concert Marketing & Promotion Award , the latter being an acknowledgement of her partnership with Virgin Mobile . Billboard also placed The Monster Ball Tour at position four on their Year @-@ end Top 25 Tours of 2010 .

By the end of the year , Pollstar announced that the tour had earned a total of US $ 133 @.@ 6 million from 138 shows , making her the only woman to be placed in their list of the Top 10 Tours of 2010 . 
 The top grosser of The Monster Ball Tour were the two concerts at the Bell Centre in Montreal , which collectively earned over US $ 10 million . By amassing an audience of 111 @,@ 060 from two shows , the performances at the Foro Sol in Mexico City attained the largest audience of the tour .

 = James Hogun = 
 James Hogun ( died January 4 , 1781 ) was an Irish @-@ American military officer who was as one of five generals from North Carolina to serve with the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War . Born in Ireland , Hogan migrated to North Carolina – then a British colony – in 1751 . Settling in Halifax County , he raised a family and established himself as a prominent local figure . 
 A member of the county 's Committee of Safety , he represented it at the North Carolina Provincial Congress and helped to draft the first Constitution of North Carolina . Initially a major in the 7th North Carolina Regiment , Hogun advanced quickly in rank during 1776 to become the unit 's commanding officer . He participated in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown in 1777 . The Continental Congress promoted Hogun to brigadier general in 1779 , although several congressmen and the North Carolina General Assembly wished to see Thomas Clark of North Carolina promoted instead . 
 Hogun was in command of North Carolina 's line brigade during the Siege of Charleston in the spring of 1780 , which ended in the surrender of all but one of North Carolina 's regiments of regular infantry as well as more than 5 @,@ 000 Patriot soldiers under Major General Benjamin Lincoln . Hogun was the highest @-@ ranking officer from North Carolina to be captured and imprisoned after the surrender of Charleston , and despite being offered the opportunity to leave internment under a parole that was generally extended to other captured Continental officers , he remained in a British prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp near Charleston . Hogun likely chose imprisonment in order to prevent the British Army from recruiting Continental soldiers for its campaign in the West Indies . He became ill and died in the prison on Haddrel 's Point , a peninsula in Charleston 's harbor . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Much of Hogun 's early life remains unknown , due to his relative obscurity until the American Revolutionary War . He immigrated to North Carolina from Ireland , his place of birth , in 1751 , and on October 3 that year he married Ruth Norfleet . The couple had a son , Lemuel . Hogun made his home near the modern @-@ day community of <unk> in Halifax County . 
 In 1774 , Hogun became a member of the Halifax County Committee of Safety , which indicated his rise to prominence since arriving in the colony 23 years prior . Between August , 1775 , and November , 1776 , Hogun represented Halifax County in the Third , Fourth , and Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congresses , and demonstrated an interest in military matters . As a delegate , Hogun assisted in drafting the first Constitution of North Carolina . 
 = = American Revolutionary War = = 
 = = = Initial command = = = 
 Hogun was named a major in the 7th North Carolina Regiment in April 1776 , and was given command of the unit on November 26 , 1776 . Initially , the regiment had some difficulty organizing after several of the officers delayed their military work in order to take care of their personal affairs . Hogun was forced to reprimand his officers sharply , threatening them with the loss of their commissions . At the same time , currents of doubt ran through North Carolina , as Loyalists attempted to hinder enlistment of Patriots by spreading rumors about the imminent demise of the Patriot army in the north , and disease that was allegedly ravaging that force . 
 While commanding his regiment , Hogun fought against the British Army in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown , and was present at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777 – 78 . In 1778 , Hogun was given orders to assist in recruiting the so @-@ called " additional regiments " requested by the Continental Congress from North Carolina , and afterwards was ordered to West Point with the first regiment so recruited . After his arrival , and throughout the late autumn and winter of 1778 – 79 , Hogun 's regiment served on a work detail tasked with building up the fortifications at West Point . Hogun was not satisfied with this task , but his men lacked sufficient weapons to allow them to serve as a combat unit at that time . Approximately 400 muskets had to be requisitioned for the regiment to be fully armed . 
 = = = Promotion and Philadelphia = = = 
 In early 1779 , Major General Benedict Arnold , then Commandant of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , requested that General George Washington send him an additional regiment of Continental soldiers to guard the Patriot stores in Philadelphia . Hogun was sent to Arnold with his newly recruited regiment , arriving on or before January 19 , 1779 . 
 On January 9 , 1779 , while en route to Philadelphia , Hogun was promoted to brigadier general by the Continental Congress . His promotion came about in part as a result of what Thomas Burke , a delegate to the Continental Congress from North Carolina , and a fellow Irishman , termed the " distinguished intrepidity " Hogun had exhibited at Germantown . This caused some controversy , as the North Carolina General Assembly , which was customarily consulted for the promotion of generals from that state , had already nominated Thomas Clark and Jethro Sumner for promotion to the rank of brigadier general . Sumner was promoted , but Clark was passed over in favor of Hogun , who received the support of nine of the thirteen states . Hogun 's surprising victory was due in large part Burke 's lobbying efforts among his colleagues in the Continental Congress . By political conventions governing such matters , Burke was bound by the vote of the North Carolina General Assembly to support the state legislature 's recommendations of Clark and Sumner , but he worked to convince other Congressmen to vote for Hogun over Clark . Hogun was appointed to succeed Arnold as Commandant of Philadelphia on March 19 , 1779 , serving until November 22 that year . 
 = = = Charleston campaign = = = 
 In November 1779 , Hogun took command of the North Carolina Brigade , composed of the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , and 4th North Carolina Regiments of the North Carolina Line . Through the winter of 1779 – 80 , Hogun led the brigade of about 700 men from Philadelphia to Charleston , South Carolina , where he was placed under the command of Major General Benjamin Lincoln . The march was arduous , and Hogun 's brigade endured one of the coldest , harshest winters in years . 
 Hogun 's command arrived at Charleston on March 13 , 1780 , which according to Lincoln gave " great spirit to the Town , and confidence to the Army . " The North Carolinians were immediately put to the task of defending the city , which was threatened with a siege by British General Henry Clinton in early March . Shortly after Hogun 's arrival , many of North Carolina 's militia present in the city began to return home because their enlistment terms ended on or about March 24 . The militiamen had only agreed to serve limited terms , and as they were not under Hogun 's direct command he was powerless to stop them leaving . 
 Charleston was principally located on a peninsula , and so Lincoln aligned his Continental units in defensive works that barricaded the " neck " of the peninsula , using a line of redoubts , redans , and batteries . These defensive works were connected by a parapet , and commanded from a concrete hornwork jutting out from the defensive line . In front of the fortifications , the Patriot forces dug an 18 @-@ foot @-@ wide moat , and between the moat and parapet they constructed a line of abatis to stall any British assault . When the siege by the British Army began in earnest on April 1 , Hogun and his men were positioned on the right of the Continental Army 's lines , near the Cooper River . 
 Hogun participated in a council of war on April 20 , 1780 . Several members of the South Carolina Privy Council , a part of the civilian government , threatened to block the Continental Army 's attempts to withdraw from Charleston , if the council of war voted to do so . Although the defending army had only eight to ten days worth of provisions , Lincoln bowed to pressure from civil authorities and delayed evacuation . On April 26 , another council of war at which Hogun was present determined that the British presence on all sides of the city prevented the army 's escape . For the next two weeks , the British and Patriot forces exchanged artillery and rifle fire at all times of day , and the British bombardment whittled down the American breastworks . 
 On May 8 , Lincoln called another council of war with all his army 's general and field officers and ships ' captains to discuss terms of surrender that had been proposed by Clinton . Of the 61 officers in attendance at that council , 49 , including Hogun , voted to offer terms of capitulation with the British commander . When these were rejected , hostilities continued , and Lincoln called another council of war on May 11 to further discuss terms of capitulation . The council voted to present further terms to Clinton , which he accepted . On May 12 , 1780 , Hogun was among the officers under Lincoln who formally surrendered to the British Army , along with approximately 5 @,@ 000 Continental and militia soldiers . The surrender led to the loss of all but one of the regiments of the North Carolina Line then in existence , depriving the state of all regular , non @-@ militia soldiers . As a brigadier general , Hogun held the highest rank of the approximately 814 Continental soldiers from North Carolina who capitulated at Charleston . 
 = = = Imprisonment and death = = = 
 Rather than allowing himself to be paroled , Hogun requested he be taken prisoner , and was interned at the British prison camp at Haddrel 's Point on Point Pleasant , located in what is now Mount Pleasant , South Carolina , across from Sullivan 's Island . Hogun 's decision was based , in part , on his desire to stifle the recruiting efforts of the British , who sought to enlist captured Continental soldiers to serve in the British West Indies . The British , however , held only the officers at Haddrel 's Point , deciding to house the enlisted men in barracks in Charleston . 
 Officers at Haddrel 's Point were subjected to harsh treatment , barred from fishing to catch much @-@ needed food , and threatened with deportation from South Carolina . Approximately 3 @,@ 300 Patriot soldiers were confined in prison camps around Charleston that were similar to the one at Haddrel 's Point , and many were destined for cramped , unsanitary prison ships . Because of the conditions , many Continental soldiers agreed to join Loyalist regiments , but Hogun and other officers set up courts martial in the camps and attempted to maintain a dignified military structure . Hogun 's health soon declined , and he died in the prison camp on January 4 , 1781 . He was buried in an unmarked grave . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 On March 14 , 1786 , the North Carolina legislature granted Hogun 's son , Lemuel , a 12 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 4 @,@ 900 ha ; 19 sq mi ) tract near modern @-@ day Nashville , Tennessee , in recognition of his father 's service . The elder Hogun was one of twenty @-@ two Patriot generals who perished during the American Revolutionary War , and one of twelve who died from disease or other non @-@ combat causes . In the early 20th century , North Carolina jurist and historian Walter Clark noted that while the careers of three of North Carolina 's other generals — Brigadier Generals Francis Nash and James Moore , and Major General Robert Howe — were well known to contemporary historians , the story of Hogun 's career as well as that of Jethro Sumner had been neglected . 
 Hogun 's personal papers appear to have been destroyed while in the possession of his descendants in Alabama during the American Civil War , leaving virtually no surviving correspondence that would shed further light on his life . In 1954 , the North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program , a division of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources , erected a historical marker in Hogun 's honor near his former home in Halifax County .

 = Spongiforma = 
 Spongiforma is a genus of sponge @-@ like fungi in the Boletaceae family . Newly described in 2009 , the genus contains two species : S. thailandica and S. squarepantsii . The type species S. thailandica is known only from Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand , where it grows in soil in old @-@ growth forests dominated by dipterocarp trees . The rubbery fruit bodies , which has a strong odour of coal @-@ tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum , consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore @-@ producing tissue . S. squarepantsii , described as new to science in 2011 , is found in Malaysia . It produces sponge @-@ like , rubbery orange fruit bodies with a fruity or musky odour . These fruit bodies will — like a sponge — resume their original shape if water is squeezed out . The origin of the specific name derives from its perceived resemblance to the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants . Apart from differences in distribution , S. squarepantsii differs from S. thailandica in its colour , odour , and spore structure .

 The fruit bodies of Spongiforma species have a brain @-@ like to sponge @-@ like form , and grow on the surface of the ground . They do not have a stalk , and lack a layer of outer skin . The small cavities ( locules ) of the fruit body are irregular in outline and measure between 2 and 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 and 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter . They are lined with a smooth , greyish @-@ orange to brown or reddish brown hymenium ( spore @-@ bearing tissue ) , with sterile ridges that range in colour from white to cream . The columella ( a column @-@ like structure extending up into the fruit body ) is poorly developed , pear @-@ shaped , cream @-@ coloured , and attached at the base to white rhizomorphs . The basidiospores are brown to vinaceous @-@ brown in mass , almond @-@ shaped , bilaterally symmetrical , and finely wrinkled . Spores bear a central apiculus ( a region that was once attached to the sterigmata at the end of a basidium ) and a small apical pore . The spores are reddish @-@ brown in water , violet grey in 3 % potassium hydroxide , inamyloid , and cyanophilic ( turning red in the stain acetocarmine ) . The basidia are four @-@ spored , and do not discharge the spores forcibly . Cystidia are common on the sterile locule edges ; they are hyaline ( translucent ) and range in shape from cylindrical to ventricose ( swollen in the middle ) or rostrate ( with a <unk> proboscis ) . The hyphae of the flesh are gelatinous and inamyloid . Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae .

 The type species S. thailandica was first described scientifically in 2009 by Egon Horak , Timothy <unk> and Dennis E. Desjardin , based on specimens collected in July 2002 in Khao Yai National Park , central Thailand , and roughly three years later in the same location . Before this , S. thailandica had been reported and illustrated in a 2001 Thai publication as an unidentified species of <unk> . 
 S. squarepantsii was first described scientifically in 2011 in the journal Mycologia , authored by a team headed by Desjardin with Kabir Peay , and Thomas Bruns . The description was based on two specimens collected by Bruns in 2010 in Lambir Hills National Park , in Sarawak , Malaysia . The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature in 2010 in a study of the ectomycorrhizal mushrooms in a tropical dipterocarp rainforest in Lambir Hills , although it was not formally described in this publication . 
 The genus name Spongiforma refers to the sponge @-@ like nature of the fruit body . The specific epithet thailandica denotes the country in which the type species is found ; the epithet squarepantsii honors the well @-@ known cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants . The unusual epithet garnered the species attention in the popular press . 
 = = Phylogeny and classification = = 
 Molecular analysis of the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer ( IT ) region of S. thailandica showed that the species was part of the Boletineae , one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder . The similarity between S. thailandica and S. squarepantsii was confirmed with molecular analysis , which showed a 98 % match between large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of the two — a value typical of many species in the same genus of Boletaceae . Spongiforma is sister ( sharing a common ancestor ) to the genus Porphyrellus ; Spongiforma and Porphyrellus form a clade that is sister to Strobilomyces . All three genera are members of the Boletaceae family . 
 The phylogenetic relationships determined by molecular techniques are not consistent with a classification scheme based on similarities in spore morphology . Several bolete taxa have been proposed to accommodate species with reddish @-@ brown to vinaceous @-@ brown , finely wrinkled ( rugulose ) to perforated or punctate spores ; these include Boletus subgenus Tylopilus , Tylopilus subgenus Porphyrellus , Austroboletus , or Porphyrellus . Austroboletus tristis and A. longipes , two species from Southeast Asia , share several spore characteristics with Spongiforma thailandica . All three species have spores with rugulose surfaces , sometimes with minute punctures , and the spores turn purple in potassium hydroxide . Additionally , the pores from the three species share similar surface ornamentation visible with scanning electron microscopy . In contrast to Spongiforma , however , Austroboletus spores do not have an apical pore . Genetic analysis shows that Spongiforma is more closely allied with the smooth @-@ spored Porphyrellus than with the rugulose @-@ punctate @-@ spored Austroboletus . 
 Relatively few boletes have an apical pore at the distal end of their basidiospores . The dark reddish @-@ brown , smooth spores of Porphyrellus <unk> are truncate with a thin @-@ walled depression . Some species of <unk> have spores with apical pores , but molecular analyses demonstrate that <unk> is only distantly related to Spongiforma . 
 Spongiforma further resembles Austroboletus and Porphyrellus species in the cellular structure of the cap cuticle ( pileipellis ) . The arrangement , known as a trichodermium , features the outermost hyphae emerging roughly parallel , like hairs , perpendicular to the surface of the fruit body . The trichodermium comprises chains of short , cylindrical to somewhat moniliform cells ( resembling a string of beads ) with terminal ( end ) cells that are cylindrical to club @-@ shaped . This cellular arrangement is similar to that present in the sterile edges of the tissues that demarcate the locules in Spongiforma . According to Desjardins and colleagues , this may represent vestiges of what was once cap cuticle or peridial tissue in an ancestor . Spongiforma is the only genus of the Boletales that forms above @-@ ground fruit bodies that lack a peridium and have many exposed locules lined with basidia that do not forcibly discharge spores . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 Both species of Spongiforma are known only from their original collection locations . S. thailandica was found growing on the ground in an old growth forest in Khao Yai National Park ( Nakhon <unk> Province , Thailand ) , at an elevation of about 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) . The fungus is thought to grow in a mycorrhizal association with Shorea <unk> and Dipterocarpus gracilis , species considered to be endangered and critically endangered , respectively , by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Spongiforma squarepantsii was collected from the ground where it was growing solitarily under undetermined dipterocarp trees in Lambir Hills National Park ( Sarawak State , Malaysia ) , northern Borneo . This tropical rainforest receives about 3 @,@ 000 mm ( 120 in ) of rain yearly , with average temperatures ranging from 24 to 32 ° C ( 75 to 90 ° F ) . Spongiforma species have lost the ability to eject their spores forcefully , and have distinctive odours , suggesting that the fungus relies on the activity of animals to help disperse spores . Because the island habitat of the genus restricts gene flow and because the two known species are separated by considerable distance geographically , the authors suggest that other unexplored , isolated tracts of dipterocarp forests between Thailand and Malaysia may contain additional species . 
 = CSG International = 
 CSG International ( <unk> ) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Meridian , Colorado , though the postal designation of Englewood is used in the corporate mailing address . It provides Business Support Systems ( BSS ) software and services , primarily to the telecommunications industry . 
 CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982 . It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $ 137 million . A contract with Tele @-@ Communications Inc . ( TCI ) , the largest cable TV business at the time , was influential in the company 's growth from $ 80 million in revenue in 1994 to $ 171 million by 1997 . CSG went public in 1996 . A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $ 120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast , who acquired the TCI business . The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014 . CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s , mostly of companies that sold billing , customer service and operations software .

 CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group ( CSG ) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation . At the time First Data was operated by American Express , which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980 . CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company , which was formed in 1989 . The CSG group 's first large @-@ scale billing statement processing center , which prints and mails bills to consumers , was established in Omaha in 1990 . 
 Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications , where he met George Haddix . Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994 , which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $ 137 million . In November 1994 , Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International . 
 CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994 , serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers . However , according to The International Directory of Company Histories , its profit margins were small and the company was " still in need of a turnaround . " Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent . Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company , which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months . 
 The new CSG International grew quickly . The convergence of phone , internet , on @-@ demand movies , and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers , which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG . Professional services and international clients , which were previously not a significant portion of revenues , grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid @-@ 1990s . 
 = = = Post IPO = = = 
 In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions , CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996 , which valued the firm at five @-@ fold its original acquisition price . CSG grew from $ 80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired , to $ 132 @.@ 3 million when it went public in 1996 and $ 171 @.@ 7 million by 1997 . 
 In the 1990s , Tele @-@ Communications Inc . ( TCI ) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International . The 15 @-@ year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11 , 1997 made CSG the largest vendor in the industry and was the primary contributor to its growth in the ' 90s . By 2001 , the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG 's revenue . As part of the deal , CSG also acquired TCI 's internally developed software , <unk> , for $ 106 million . CSG 's services to TCI included billing , customer management and payment processing for TCI customers . In October 1997 , CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company , mc2 . 
 At the end of 1997 , CSG co @-@ founder George Haddix retired , and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place . In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government , which expanded roads and provided other incentives . In 2002 , CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $ 260 million . The deal was estimated to increase CSG 's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent . 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition . An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions .

 AT & T acquired TCI in 2000 , inheriting its agreement with CSG . AT & T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract 's terms to provide favorable rates . A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court . Before the dispute was resolved , AT & T Broadband was acquired by Comcast , who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor . In October 2002 , a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $ 120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices . The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term . CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004 and in 2008 . In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services . 
 In March 2005 , co @-@ founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64 . Ed <unk> , prior president of the broadband services division , took his place . <unk> was replaced by the current CEO , Peter Kalan , at the end of 2007 .

 = Watermill at Opwetten = 
 The Watermill at Opwetten ( Dutch : <unk> <unk> ) is a watermill along the river Kleine Dommel , located on the <unk> 203 in Opwetten , Nuenen , <unk> en <unk> , in the province of North Brabant , Netherlands . First mentioned in the 11th century , the watermill burned down and was rebuilt in 1764 . 
 There have been several buildings in the watermill complex . One building was a gristmill and sawmill , while another functioned as oil mill and fulling mill . The mill operated two undershot water wheels , including the largest water wheel in the Netherlands . The gristmill is still in functioning order and is used on a small scale , the building of the former oil and fulling mill now houses a restaurant . A tannery was located in a building in the back and up to 1910 an inn was located in the miller 's house . Vincent van Gogh lived nearby and made several paintings while in the area , including a painting of the mill in 1884 . The watermill was listed as a national monument in 1972 . 
 = = History = = 
 The gristmill was built in the early 11th century along the river Kleine Dommel , by monks of a Benedictine monastery in Sint @-@ Truiden , Belgium . In the 14th century the mill was owned by the lords and ladies of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and was a <unk> ( nl ) , meaning peasants in the locality were obligated to use this mill to grind their wheat . 
 In 1664 the mill partially burned down . It was rebuilt and , in order to recover from the losses , the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years . In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill , according to an <unk> from the States General after the miller requested assistance . The mill was rebuilt with the addition of a second water wheel . The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill . In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building , and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill . 
 A plaque placed on the miller 's house in 1973 to celebrate the 100th birthday of miller Gerardus van Hoorn commemorates both fires . Van Hoorn had known the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh , who lived in nearby Nuenen from 1883 until 1885 . Van Gogh painted several paintings around the mill , including an 1884 painting of the mill itself , Water Mill at Opwetten ( F48 ) . In a video interview in 1973 , Van Hoorn said that he had seen Van Gogh paint and had supplied him with bird nests for his paintings . 
 The mill has had several names and during the first centuries it was known as the Saint Anthony Mill ( Dutch : St. <unk> ) , named after a nearby chapel dedicated to saint Anthony the Great . From 1726 until it came into the possession of Gerardus van Hoorn in 1916 , the mill was known as Jan 's Mill ( Dutch : <unk> ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Watermill at Opwetten is situated along the river Kleine Dommel . Diverted river water flows along a channel with force to drive two wooden undershot water wheels , connected to two buildings on either side of the channel . 
 The buildings are made of painted wood on a brick foundation , with tiled roofs , and an extruding hatch covering the main entrance of the higher building . The gristmill , originally used to grind spelt , later ground bread wheat , and then a sawmill was added . It has a water wheel of 9 @.@ 30 metres ( 30 ft 6 in ) in diameter , consisting of 44 paddles of 80 centimetres ( 2 ft 7 in ) width , which makes it the largest water wheel in the Netherlands . The gristmill is still in functioning order , and uses a pair of Cullen millstones from Mayen ( " Cullen " for " Cologne " , where such millstones were marketed from ) , and a pair of cast millstones , both 17 hands in diameter or 1 @.@ 50 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) . Only some remainders are left of the sawmill , including one of only two watermill circular saws in the Netherlands . Inside the larger mill is a room for the assistants of the miller , where the names of millers and their assistants have been carved in the wood . 
 The oil mill and fulling mill used a water wheel of 7 @.@ 50 metres ( 24 ft 7 in ) in diameter and used 30 paddles with a width of 30 centimetres ( 1 ft 0 in ) . The oil mill was used to crush and press oil @-@ bearing seeds to extract vegetable oils , and the <unk> kneaded wool for hours or days in order to make it thicker . Both structures are completely gone , and only two edge stones posted outside remind of its former function as oil mill . It currently houses a restaurant .

 The mill was listed as a national monument ( nr <unk> ) on 14 June 1972 . The grounds are freely accessible . The gristmill is operated and open to the public on Sunday afternoon , and the restaurant is open every day of the week except on Mondays . The mill is located on the <unk> 203 in Nuenen , <unk> en <unk> , in the province of North Brabant , Netherlands . The next mill upstream is the <unk> <unk> on the Kleine Dommel . The next mill downstream is the <unk> <unk> on the Dommel . 
 In 2011 , a full @-@ size replica of the mill was built at the <unk> Park in Nanjing , China . Together with replicas of three other Dutch monuments , it is part of the ' Van Gogh Friendship Park ' , in honour of the relationships between the sister cities of Eindhoven and Nanjing , and the sister provinces of North @-@ Brabant and Jiangsu . The mayor of Nanjing , Ji Jianye , visited the Watermill at Opwetten in 2012 , during his visit to Eindhoven . 
 = Entoloma murrayi = 
 Entoloma murrayi , commonly known as the yellow unicorn Entoloma or the unicorn pinkgill , is a species of fungus in the Entolomataceae family . First described from New England ( USA ) in 1859 , the species is found in eastern North America , Central and South America , and southeast Asia , where it grows on the ground in wet coniferous and deciduous forests . The fungus produces yellow mushrooms that have a characteristic sharp umbo on the top of a conical cap . The mushroom is inedible and may be poisonous . Other similar species can be distinguished from E. murrayi by differences in color , morphology , or microscopic characteristics . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was originally described by Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1859 as Agaricus murrayi , based on collections made in New England . Berkeley and Curtis called it " An extremely pretty species " . Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred the species to Entoloma in 1899 . Synonyms include combinations resulting from generic transfers to Rhodophyllus by Rolf Singer in 1942 , <unk> by R. W. G. Dennis in 1970 , and to Inocephalus by Gordon Rutter and Roy Watling in 1997 . Depending on the authority , these latter three genera are considered either subgenera of Entoloma , or independent genera . In a large @-@ scale molecular phylogenetic analysis of Agaricales species published in 2002 , E. murrayi grouped in a clade together with E. canescens and two <unk> traditionally classified in Inocephalus – E. quadrata and E. lactifluus . The Dictionary of the Fungi ( 10th edition , 2008 ) lumps Inocephalus and Rhodophyllus into Entoloma . 
 The specific epithet murrayi honors the original collector , Dennis Murray of Massachusetts . Its common names " yellow unicorn Entoloma " or " unicorn pinkgill " refer to the characteristic sharp umbo at the top of its cap . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of E. murrayi is bell @-@ shaped to conical , and measures 1 @.@ 3 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) in diameter . It features a sharp umbo in the center . The cap color is bright yellow to orange @-@ yellow , but tends to fade in maturity . The gills have a narrowly adnate attachment to the stem , and are well @-@ spaced . Initially yellow , they acquire a pinkish tone as the spores mature . The slender hollow stem is 4 – 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) long and roughly equal in width throughout its length . It is pale yellow , with a fibrous surface , and often twisted with longitudinal striations . Its surface is smooth , and there may be a whitish mycelium at the base . The flesh is thin and pale yellow . The taste and odor of the fruit bodies have been described as either " pleasant " , or indistinct . The mushroom is not edible and may be poisonous . 
 The spore print is salmon @-@ pink . Spores are smooth , angular ( four @-@ sided ) , hyaline ( translucent ) , and measure 9 – 12 by 8 – 10 μm . The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophore tissue is parallel to interwoven and inamyloid . In the cap cuticle , the hyphae are interwoven radially , or alternatively in somewhat erect bundles . Hyphae of Entoloma murrayi rarely have clamp connections . The cap and gill tissue contain " repository hyphae " ( storage units containing byproducts of metabolism ) that release a watery , yellow @-@ colored liquid when injured . These distinctive hyphae can be seen with light microscopy of both fresh and dried specimens . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Characteristic diagnostic features of Entoloma murrayi include the bright yellow coloring , the conical cap , cube @-@ shaped spores , and club @-@ shaped cheilocystidia . Entoloma <unk> is similar in size and morphology , but is colored salmon @-@ orange . E. murrayi has the habit and form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe ( such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor ) , but it can be readily distinguished from those by its salmon @-@ pink spore print , non @-@ waxy gills , and the angular shape of its spores . Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color , with a less distinctly pointed umbo . The South American species E. <unk> , originally misidentified as E. murrayi , can be distinguished from the latter by its less conical cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5 @.@ 5 – 7 μm . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 A saprobic species , Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients by breaking down organic matter . Fruit bodies are found in wet coniferous and deciduous forests , where they grow singly or in small groups on the ground in litterfall or humus , or in moss . Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn . 
 In North America , the species is found eastern Canada ( Atlantic Maritime Ecozone ) , the eastern United States ( from Maine south to Alabama and west to the Great Lakes ) , and Mexico . The distribution includes Central and South America , and Southeast Asia . It has also been recorded from Jamaica and the Dominican Republic . 
 = 1986 Pacific typhoon season = 
 The 1986 Pacific typhoon season has no official bounds ; it ran year @-@ round in 1986 , but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and December . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names . 
 A total of 32 tropical depressions formed in 1986 in the Western Pacific over an eleven @-@ month time span . Of the 32 , 30 became tropical storms , 19 storms reached typhoon intensity , and 3 reached super typhoon strength . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Vera as two tropical cyclones , when all the warning centers treated Vera as one in real time , while another , Georgette , originated in the Eastern Pacific . Six of the tropical cyclones formed in August , which was the busiest month of the season . Eight tropical cyclones moved through the Philippines this season . Most of the deaths attributed to <unk> in 1986 were caused by Peggy and Wayne

 Of the thirty tropical storms formed in 1986 in the Western Pacific ( from 32 tropical depressions ) , 19 reached typhoon intensity , and three reached super typhoon strength . Broken down by month , one tropical cyclone formed in February , one in April , two in May , three in June , three in July , seven in August , three in September , four in October , six in November , and two forming in December . Vera was considered two tropical cyclones by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center after the fact , though it was operationally treated as one system , and Georgette , was a former Eastern Pacific cyclone . Eight tropical cyclones moved through the Philippines this season , while three struck mainland China , one struck Korea , and one crossed the Japanese coast .

A slight weakening of the subtropical ridge brought Peggy more northward , where it hit southeastern China as a 55 kn ( 102 km / h ) tropical storm on the July 11 . In Hong Kong , winds gusted to 78 knots ( 144 km / h ) at Tate 's Cairn and rainfall totals reached 449 millimetres ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) at Tai Mo Shan . Peggy 's fury resulted in 333 casualties and US $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( 1986 dollars ) in damage from torrential flooding . 
 = = = Typhoon Roger ( Heling ) = = = 
 An upper level low <unk> westward across the tropical Pacific ocean beginning on July 4 . On July 8 , a tropical disturbance formed southeast of the upper low southwest of Enewetak Atoll . The system moved westward , slowly organizing . Becoming a tropical depression on July 13 , the small system turned northwest , recurving gradually around a subtropical ridge to its east and northeast . The system strengthened into a tropical storm later on July 13 , and a typhoon on July 14 to the south of Japan . After turning to the northeast , the system began to experience northeasterly vertical wind shear and began to weaken . After passing east of Okinawa , the system began to transition into an extratropical cyclone , a process which completed on July 17 near the southern coast of Japan . 
 = = = July Tropical Storm = = = 
 Forming on the South China sea on July 19 , the cyclone moved northwest into mainland China on July 22 , maintaining its circulation as it turned westward before dissipating on July 24 . This system was recognized by the Japanese Meteorological Agency as a tropical storm . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Sarah ( Iliang ) = = = 
 Developing in the Philippine Sea on July 30 , the system developed as it moved westward , becoming a tropical storm on July 31 . On August 1 , its mid @-@ level circulation center crossed into the South China sea while its surface circulation was left behind east of the Philippines . Sarah 's broad circulation center was difficult to locate until it began moving northeast east of Luzon on August 2 , when it intensified to its peak intensity . As Sarah moved east of Honshu , it evolved into an extratropical cyclone . Fourteen died in Japan due to Sarah . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Georgette = = = 
 From August 3 to August 4 , Tropical Storm Georgette existed in the Eastern Pacific , but degraded into a tropical wave while moving rapidly westward . Five days later in the Western Pacific , Georgette regenerated into a tropical storm , and became a typhoon on August 10 . At this time , a tropical disturbance was developing to its west , and it became Tropical Storm Tip on the 11th . Tip and Georgette underwent <unk> interaction , causing smaller Georgette to loop as the larger storm Tip headed to the north . Georgette weakened to a tropical depression on August 15 , and was absorbed by Tip 's large inflow band on August 16 . 
 = = = August Tropical Storm = = = 
 This system formed in the South China sea on August 9 , and moved northwest through Hainan Island into mainland China , dissipating on August 12 . In Hong Kong , winds gusted to 70 knots ( 130 km / h ) at Tate 's Cairn and Tai Mo Shan while Tai Po received 343 millimetres ( 13 @.@ 5 in ) of rainfall from the depression . Extensive flooding occurred on Hainan and western Guangdong Province , killing two people . The Hong Kong Royal Observatory considered this system a tropical depression . 
 = = = Typhoon Tip = = = 
 Georgette became a typhoon on August 10 to the east of a tropical disturbance , which developed into Tropical Storm Tip on August 11 . Tip and Georgette underwent the Fujiwhara effect , causing smaller Georgette to loop as the larger storm Tip headed to the north . Georgette became absorbed by Tip 's large inflow band on August 16 . Tip strengthened to a typhoon , and reached a peak intensity of 80 kn ( 150 km / h ) winds before vertical wind shear caused the system to weaken . On August 19 , Tip became extratropical , and persisted as a remnant low for six more days . 
 = = = Typhoon Vera ( Loleng ) = = = 
 The most intense and extensive monsoon trough since 1974 spawned a tropical depression on August 15 . It drifted to the southeast , relocating several times in its formative stages . On August 16 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Vera , and operationally the storm was to continue eastward , continuing to relocate in the broad monsoon trough and becoming a storm again on August 17 after weakening . Post @-@ analysis by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center suggested that the first storm turned to the west and dissipated , and that a new , separate storm formed well to the east on August 17 . However , the Japan Meteorological Agency maintained the system as a single storm . 
 Vera drifted northward until an upper level ridge forced the storm to the east , providing upper level outflow for Vera to strengthen to a typhoon on August 20 . On August 22 , Vera attained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) before the weakening ridge forced the typhoon to the west , retracing its path it took days before . The typhoon slowly weakened , and hit Okinawa on August 25 as a 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) typhoon . Vera turned to the northeast , hit South Korea on August 28 as a minimal typhoon , and became extratropical on August 29 in the Sea of Japan . A total of 23 people were killed from the storm , with moderate to heavy damage in its path as far north as the Soviet Far East . Damage totalled US $ 22 million ( 1986 dollars ) across South Korea . 
 = = = Typhoon Wayne ( Miding ) = = = 
 One of the longest lasting Western Pacific system on record began its long life on August 16 in the South China Sea , having formed from the monsoon trough . It drifted to the southwest , then looped back to the northwest , becoming a tropical storm on August 18 . Wayne turned to the northeast and became a typhoon on August 19 . In Hong Kong , winds gusted to 78 knots ( 144 km / h ) at Tate 's Cairn . The typhoon passed offshore of southeastern China and hit western Taiwan on August 22 . Wayne turned back to the south and southwest . Vertical shear caused Wayne to weaken to a depression on August 25 . Wayne turned back to the northeast , rotating around Vera . Once Vera accelerated away , Wayne drifted northeastward through the South China Sea , becoming a tropical storm on August 27 . 
 Wayne turned southward , becoming a typhoon again on August 30 . Wayne passed close to northern Luzon on September 2 before turning back to the west . Two days later while moving quickly westward through the South China Sea , Wayne reached a peak of 85 knots ( 157 km / h ) winds . During its various passages of Hong Kong , a total of 295 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 6 in ) of rainfall accumulated at Sai Kung . The cyclone hit northern Hainan on September 5 , entered the Gulf of Tonkin , and made its final landfall on northern Vietnam later that day as a 60 knots ( 110 km / h ) tropical storm . The next day , Wayne dissipated over Vietnam , after 85 advisories and being the longest lasting Western Pacific system in history . Wayne brought torrential rains through its path to the Philippines , Taiwan , southeastern China , Hainan Island , and Vietnam . Because of this , 490 fatalities ( most in Vietnam ) , tens of thousands left homeless , and US $ 399 million ( 1986 dollars ) in damage can be attributed to Typhoon Wayne . 
 = = = September Tropical Storm = = = 
 Originating in the subtropical west @-@ central Pacific , this large cyclone moved westward to a point south of Japan before becoming a tropical storm . Soon afterward , the system recurved across central Japan on September 2 and evolved into an extratropical cyclone as it returned to the northern Pacific ocean on September 3 . This system was recognized by the Japanese Meteorological Agency as a tropical storm , and the Hong Kong Royal Observatory as a tropical depression . 
 = = = Typhoon Abby ( Norming ) = = = 
 Typhoon Abby developed from an area of persistent convection to the southwest of Truk in early August . A tropical depression formed on August 13 to the southeast of Guam and was upgraded to a tropical storm a day after passing south of the island . Abby then steadily intensified to a peak of 95 kn ( 176 km / h ) but weakened before striking Taiwan . Typhoon Abby lashed the island with winds of 85 kn ( 157 km / h ) and heavy rains . Flooding on Taiwan killed 13 people , and agricultural damage totalled $ 81 million ( 1986 USD , $ 173 million 2013 USD ) . After departing Taiwan Abby continued north @-@ northeast before dissipating in the East China Sea . 
 = = = Typhoon Ben = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance formed near Majuro on September 15 . The system moved west @-@ northwest , becoming a tropical depression on September 18 and a tropical storm on September 19 . Thirteen perished on a fishing vessel passing by Pagan as Ben passed nearby . Ben turned north @-@ northwest for a day and a half , moving around an upper level cyclone in its vicinity , before resuming a west @-@ northwest track on September 20 . Vertical wind shear , caused by strong north @-@ northeast winds aloft , weakened Ben to minimal tropical storm intensity by September 21 . Ben entered a more favourable environment , achieving typhoon intensity on September 23 before rounding the southwest portion of the subtropical ridge . Ben recurved to the northeast on September 26 , moving well to the east of Japan , as vertical wind shear increased due to strengthening winds aloft from the southwest . Ben subsequently weakened back into a tropical storm on September 30 before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day . 
 = = = Typhoon Carmen = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance was first noted to the east @-@ southeast of Majuro on September 27 . The system tracked north of due west , before consolidating slowly into a tropical depression on September 30 and a tropical storm on October 2 . After passing between Rota and Saipan , Carmen turned northwest and intensified into a typhoon on October 4 . Winds at Rota peaked at 53 knots ( 98 km / h ) as it passed by the island . Heavy rains fell at Guam , where amounts totalled between 254 millimetres ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) and 279 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) . Moving through a break in the subtropical ridge , Carmen rapidly strengthened as it turned north , then northeast , on October 6 when maximum sustained winds reached 100 knots ( 190 km / h ) . As vertical wind shear increased due to strengthening southwest winds aloft , the cyclone weakened into a tropical storm on October 8 , evolving into an extratropical cyclone by October 9 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Dom ( Oyang ) = = = 
 Initially noted as a tropical disturbance in the Philippine Sea on October 2 , the system moved slowly west @-@ northwest to the south of the subtropical ridge , becoming a tropical depression on October 4 . Crossing the Philippines , the depression caused heavy rainfall and flooding as it emerged into the South China sea and developed into a tropical storm on October 9 . Development was slow due to strong upper level winds from the northeast displacing thunderstorms west @-@ southwest of its center . Continuing to track north of due west , Dom made landfall in Vietnam and dissipated as it moved along the Laos / Vietnam border on October 12 . A total of 16 perished and damage totalled US $ 4 million ( 1986 dollars ) in Luzon . 
 = = = Typhoon Ellen ( Pasing ) = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance formed just west of the International Dateline within the monsoon trough on October 3 . The system moved westward for nearly a week without significant development . Becoming a tropical depression on October 9 and a tropical storm on October 11 , the cyclone turned to the west @-@ northwest , moving through the central Philippines into the South China sea . Turning more northerly , Ellen intensified to a typhoon while paralleling the west coast of Luzon on October 14 . By October 15 , Ellen 's track became increasingly more westerly due to a building surface high pressure area to its north . Weakening began due to westerly winds aloft and land interaction with China , and Ellen dropped back to tropical storm strength on October 17 . The cyclone moved south of Hong Kong and north of Hainan Island into mainland China on October 19 . In Hong Kong , winds gusted to 78 knots ( 144 km / h ) at Tai Mo Shan . As it neared the border between Vietnam and China , Ellen dissipated on October 20 . 
 = = = Typhoon Forrest = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance formed near the International Dateline on October 10 before moving on a parabolic track well east of Asia . A small system , it moved west @-@ northwest and organized into a tropical depression on October 15 , then a tropical storm later in the day . Late on October 16 , Forrest intensified into a typhoon . The next day , the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 100 knots ( 190 km / h ) and passed near the island of Agrihan where one building was left standing and communications were eliminated . Forrest then recurved south @-@ southeast of Iwo Jima . As winds aloft increased out of the west , Forrest slowly weakened , becoming a tropical storm once more on October 20 and evolving into an extratropical cyclone by October 21 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Georgia ( <unk> ) = = = 
 First noted as a tropical disturbance east of Ulithi within the monsoon trough on October 14 , the system moved north of due west . Slowly developing , the system evolved into a tropical depression on October 17 and tropical storm on October 18 . The cyclone reached its peak intensity before it crossed the central Philippines on October 19 and emerged into the South China sea . On October 22 , Georgia made landfall across Vietnam and crossed Laos into Thailand . The system subsequently dissipated by October 23 .
