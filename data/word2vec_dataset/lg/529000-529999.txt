 = Galactic habitable zone = 
 In astrobiology and planetary astrophysics , the galactic habitable zone is the region of a galaxy in which life is most likely to develop . More specifically , the concept of a galactic habitable zone incorporates various factors , such as metallicity and the rate of major catastrophes such as supernovae , in order to calculate which regions of the galaxy are more likely to form terrestrial planets , initially develop simple life , and provide a suitable environment for this life to evolve and advance . According to research published in August 2015 , very large galaxies may be more favorable to the creation and development of habitable planets than smaller galaxies , like the Milky Way . For the Milky Way , the galactic habitable zone is commonly believed to be an annulus with an outer radius of about 10 kiloparsecs and an inner radius close to the Galactic Center , both of which lack hard boundaries . 
 Galactic habitable zone theory , however , has been criticized due to an inability to quantify accurately the factors making a region of the galaxy good for the emergence of life . In addition , computer simulations suggest that stars may change their orbits around the galactic center significantly , therefore challenging at least part of the view that some areas of the galaxy are necessarily more life @-@ supporting than others . 
 = = Background = = 
 The idea of the circumstellar habitable zone was introduced in 1953 by Hubertus Strughold and Harlow Shapley and in 1959 by Su @-@ Shu Huang as the region around a star in which an orbiting planet could retain water at its surface . From the 1970s , planetary scientists and <unk> began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life , including the impact that a nearby supernova may have on life 's development . In 1981 , Jim Clarke proposed that the apparent lack of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way could be explained by Seyfert @-@ type outbursts from an active galactic nucleus , with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy . In the same year , Wallace Hampton Tucker analyzed galactic habitability in a more general context , but later work superseded his proposals . 
 Modern galactic habitable @-@ zone theory was introduced in 1986 by L.S. <unk> and L.M. <unk> , who defined the zone as the region in which intelligent life could flourish . Donald Brownlee and palaeontologist Peter Ward expanded upon the concept of a galactic habitable zone , as well as the other factors required for the emergence of complex life , in their 2000 book Rare Earth : Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe . In that book , the authors used the galactic habitable zone , among other factors , to argue that intelligent life is not a common occurrence in the Universe . 
 The idea of a galactic habitable zone was further developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee , in collaboration with Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington . In that paper , Gonzalez , Brownlee , and Ward stated that regions near the galactic halo would lack the heavier elements required to produce habitable terrestrial planets , thus creating an outward limit to the size of the galactic habitable zone . Being too close to the galactic center , however , would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events , as well as excessive cometary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star 's Oort cloud . Therefore , the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic habitable zone , located just outside the galactic bulge . 
 = = Considerations = = 
 In order to identify a location in the galaxy as being a part of the galactic habitable zone , a variety of factors must be accounted for . These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms , the presence or absence of an active galactic nucleus , the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life , the metallicity of that location , and other factors . Without fulfilling these factors , a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency . 
 = = = Chemical evolution = = = 
 One of the most basic requirements for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient mass to sustain it . Various elements , such as iron , magnesium , titanium , carbon , oxygen , silicon , and others , are required to produce habitable planets , and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy . 
 One important elemental ratio is that of [ Fe / H ] , one of the factors determining the propensity of a region of the galaxy to produce terrestrial planets . The galactic bulge , the region of the galaxy closest to the galactic center , has an [ Fe / H ] distribution peaking at − 0 @.@ 2 decimal exponent units ( dex ) relative to the Sun 's ratio ; the thin disk , where the Sun is located , has an average metallicity of − 0 @.@ 02 dex at the orbital distance of the Sun around the galactic center , reducing by 0 @.@ 07 dex for every additional kiloparsec of orbital distance . The extended thick disk has an average [ Fe / H ] of − 0 @.@ 6 dex , while the halo , the region farthest from the galactic center , has the lowest [ Fe / H ] distribution peak , at around − 1 @.@ 5 dex . In addition , ratios such as [ C / O ] , [ Mg / Fe ] , [ Si / Fe ] , and [ S / Fe ] may be relevant to the ability of a region of a galaxy to form habitable terrestrial planets , and of these [ Mg / Fe ] and [ Si / Fe ] are slowly reducing over time , meaning that future terrestrial planets are more likely to possess larger iron cores . 
 In addition to specific amounts of the various stable elements that comprise a terrestrial planet 's mass , an abundance of radionuclides such as 40K , 235U , 238U , and 232Th is required in order to heat the planet 's interior and power life @-@ sustaining processes such as plate tectonics , volcanism , and a geomagnetic dynamo . The [ U / H ] and [ Th / H ] ratios are dependent on the [ Fe / H ] ratio ; however , a general function for the abundance of 40K cannot be created with existing data . 
 Even on a habitable planet with enough radioisotopes to heat its interior , various prebiotic molecules are required in order to produce life ; therefore , the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone . A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine the outer edge of the galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way ; however , the data is neither conclusive nor complete . 
 While high metallicity is beneficial for the creation of terrestrial extrasolar planets , an excess amount can be harmful for life . Excess metallicity may lead to the formation of a large number of gas giants in a given system , which may subsequently migrate from beyond the system 's frost line and become hot Jupiters , disturbing planets that would otherwise have been located in the system 's circumstellar habitable zone . Thus , it was found that the Goldilocks principle applies to metallicity as well ; low @-@ metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial @-@ mass planets at all , while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop , disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability of terrestrial planets in the system . 
 = = = Catastrophic events = = = 
 As well as being located in a region of the galaxy that is chemically advantageous for the development of life , a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets . Nearby supernovae , for example , have the potential to severely harm life on a planet ; with excessive frequency , such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years . The galactic bulge , for example , experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation , triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life . 
 In addition to supernovae , gamma @-@ ray bursts , excessive amounts of radiation , gravitational perturbations and various other events have been proposed to affect the distribution of life within the galaxy . These include , controversially , such proposals as " galactic tides " with the potential to induce cometary impacts or even cold bodies of dark matter that pass through organisms and induce genetic mutations . However , the impact of many of these events may be difficult to quantify . 
 = = = Galactic morphology = = = 
 Various morphological features of galaxies can affect their potential for habitability . Spiral arms , for example , are the location of star formation , but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star 's Oort cloud , sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in . In addition , the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions , reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life . Considering these factors , the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because , in addition to being outside a spiral arm , it orbits near the <unk> radius , maximizing the interval between spiral @-@ arm crossings . 
 Spiral arms also have the ability to cause climatic changes on a planet . Passing through the dense molecular clouds of galactic spiral arms , stellar winds may be pushed back to the point that a reflective hydrogen layer accumulates in an orbiting planet 's atmosphere , perhaps leading to a snowball Earth scenario . 
 A galactic bar also has the potential to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone . Galactic bars are thought to grow over time , eventually reaching the <unk> radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there . High @-@ metallicity stars like our Sun , for example , located at an intermediate location between the low @-@ metallicity galactic halo and the high @-@ radiation galactic center , may be scattered throughout the galaxy , affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone . It has been suggested that for this reason , it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone . 
 = = Boundaries = = 
 Early research on the galactic habitable zone , including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez , Brownlee , and Ward , did not demarcate any specific boundaries , merely stating that the zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation , and that habitability would be more likely in the galaxy 's thin disk . However , later research conducted in 2004 by Lineweaver and colleagues did create boundaries for this annulus , in the case of the Milky Way ranging from 4 kpc to 10 kpc from the galactic center . 
 The Lineweaver team also analyzed the evolution of the galactic habitable zone with respect to time , finding , for example , that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a time window of about two billion years in order to have habitable planets . Before that window , galactic @-@ bulge stars would be prevented from having life @-@ sustaining planets from frequent supernova events . After the supernova threat had subsided , though , the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets , with the potential to destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star 's circumstellar habitable zone . Simulations conducted in 2005 at the University of Washington , however , show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters , terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales . 
 A 2006 study by Milan Ćirković and colleagues extended the notion of a time @-@ dependent galactic habitable zone , analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics . The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events , thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others . Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way , the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time , though not in a perfectly linear pattern . 
 Subsequent studies saw more fundamental revision of the old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an annulus . In 2008 , a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that , while the probability of a planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from the galactic center , the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there . The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael <unk> , who calculated the frequency of supernova @-@ surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center , their height above the galactic plane , and their age , ultimately discovering that about 0 @.@ 3 % of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life , or 1 @.@ 2 % if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 The idea of the galactic habitable zone has been criticized by Nikos Prantzos , on the grounds that the parameters to create it are impossible to define even approximately , and that thus the galactic habitable zone may merely be a useful conceptual tool to enable a better understanding of the distribution of life , rather than an end to itself . For these reasons , Prantzos has suggested that the entire galaxy may be habitable , rather than habitability being restricted to a specific region in space and time . In addition , stars " riding " the galaxy 's spiral arms may move tens of thousands of light years from their original orbits , thus supporting the notion that there may not be one specific galactic habitable zone . A Monte Carlo simulation , improving on the mechanisms used by Ćirković in 2006 , was conducted in 2010 by Duncan Forgan of Royal Observatory Edinburgh . The data collected from the experiments support Prantzos 's notion that there is no solidly defined galactic habitable zone , indicating the possibility of hundreds of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way , though further data will be required in order for a definitive determination to be made . 
 = SM U @-@ 5 ( Austria @-@ Hungary ) = 
 SM U @-@ 5 or U @-@ V was the lead boat of the U @-@ 5 class of submarines or U @-@ boats built for and operated by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) before and during the First World War . The submarine was built as part of a plan to evaluate foreign submarine designs , and was the first of three boats of the class built by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume after a design by American John Philip Holland . 
 U @-@ 5 was laid down in April 1907 and launched in February 1909 . The double @-@ hulled submarine was just over 105 feet ( 32 m ) long and displaced between 240 and 273 metric tons ( 265 and 301 short tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . U @-@ 5 's design had inadequate ventilation and exhaust from her twin gasoline engines often intoxicated the crew . The boat was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy in April 1910 , and served as a training boat — sometimes making as many as ten cruises a month — through the beginning of the First World War in 1914 . 
 The submarine scored most of her wartime successes during the first year of the war while under the command of Georg Ritter von Trapp . The French armoured cruiser Léon Gambetta , sunk in April 1915 , was the largest ship sunk by U @-@ 5 . The sinking of Italian Troop Transport ship SS Principe Umberto in June 1916 with the loss of 1 @,@ 926 men , was the worst naval disaster of World War I in terms of human lives lost . In May 1917 , U @-@ 5 hit a mine and sank with the loss of six men . She was raised , rebuilt , and recommissioned , but sank no more ships . At the end of the war , U @-@ 5 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation , and scrapped in 1920 . In all , U @-@ 5 sank four ships totaling 21 @,@ 604 gross register tons ( GRT ) .

 U @-@ 5 was built as part of a plan by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy to competitively evaluate foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake , Germaniawerft , and John Philip Holland . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy authorized the construction of U @-@ 5 ( and sister ship , U @-@ 6 ) in 1906 by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume . The boat was designed by American John Philip Holland and licensed by Holland and his company , Electric Boat . U @-@ 5 was laid down on 9 April 1907 in the United States , partially assembled , and shipped to Whitehead 's for final assembly , a process which , author Edwin <unk> notes , " caused a lot of trouble " . She was launched at Fiume on 10 February 1909 by Agathe Whitehead , and towed to Pola on 17 August . 
 U @-@ 5 's design featured a single @-@ hull with a teardrop @-@ shaped body that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines . She was 105 feet 4 inches ( 32 @.@ 11 m ) long by 13 feet 9 inches ( 4 @.@ 19 m ) abeam and had a draft of 12 feet 10 inches ( 3 @.@ 91 m ) . She displaced 240 metric tons ( 260 short tons ) surfaced , and 273 metric tons ( 301 short tons ) submerged . Her two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes featured unique , cloverleaf @-@ shaped design hatches that rotated on a central axis , and the boat was designed to carry up to four torpedoes . For surface running , U @-@ 5 was outfitted with 2 gasoline engines , but suffered from inadequate ventilation , which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew ; her underwater propulsion was by two electric motors . 
 = = Service career = = 
 U @-@ 5 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1910 , with Linienschiffsleutnant Urban <unk> in command . Over the next three years she served primarily as a training boat , making as many as ten training cruises per month . On 1 May 1911 , she hosted a delegation of Peruvian Navy officers that inspected her . In June 1912 , she towed a balloon as part of efforts to assess the underwater visibility of hull paint schemes . 
 At the outbreak of World War I , U @-@ 5 was one of only four fully operational U @-@ boats in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy fleet . She was initially stationed at the submarine base on Brioni , but was moved to Cattaro by late 1914 . U @-@ 5 made an unsuccessful attack on a French battleship squadron off Punta Stilo on 3 November . In December , the ship 's armament was augmented by a 3 @.@ 7 cm / 23 ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) deck gun , and had her first radio receiver installed . In April 1915 , Georg Ritter von Trapp assumed command of U @-@ 5 , and the following month , led the boat in sinking the French armored cruiser Léon Gambetta off Santa Maria di Leuca . On the night of 26 April , Léon Gambetta was patrolling the Straits of Otranto at a leisurely 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ) without the benefit of a destroyer screen . U @-@ 5 launched two torpedoes at the French cruiser , hitting with both . The ship was rocked by the explosions of the two torpedoes and went down in ten minutes , taking down with her the entire complement of officers , including Rear Admiral Victor <unk> <unk> . Of the French ship 's complement , 648 were killed in the attack ; there were 137 survivors . Léon Gambetta was the largest ship of any kind sunk by U @-@ 5 .

 In June , U @-@ 5 helped search for the lost Austro @-@ Hungarian seaplane L 41 , and in July , received an upgrade of her deck gun to a 4 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) QF gun . In early August , U @-@ 5 was sent out from Lissa when the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy received word from a reconnaissance aircraft that an Italian submarine had been sighted at Pelagosa . On the morning of 5 August , the Italian submarine Nereide was on the surface , moored under a cliff in the island 's harbor . When U @-@ 5 surfaced just offshore , Nereide 's commanding officer , Capitano di <unk> Carlo del Greco , cast off the lines and maneuvered to get a shot at von Trapp 's boat . Nereide launched a single torpedo at U @-@ 5 that missed , after which del Greco ordered his boat submerged . U @-@ 5 lined up a shot and launched a single torpedo at the slowly submerging target , striking her , and sending her to the bottom with all hands . The Italian captain received the Medaglia d 'Oro al Valore Militare for his actions . At the end of August , U @-@ 5 captured the 1 @,@ 034 GRT Greek steamer Cefalonia as a prize off Durazzo . In late November , Friedrich Schlosser succeeded von Trapp as U @-@ 5 's commanding officer . 
 Schlosser and U @-@ 5 made an unsuccessful attack on an Italian Indomito @-@ class destroyer on 7 June 1916 , but the boat managed to torpedo the Italian armed merchant cruiser Principe Umberto off Cape <unk> on the next day . According to a contemporary account , Principe Umberto and two other ships were transporting troops and materiel under escort of two destroyers . After the torpedo hit , Principe Umberto went down quickly with the loss 1 @,@ 750 men . Principe Umberto was the last ship hit by U @-@ 5 .

 On 16 May 1917 , U @-@ 5 was conducting a training cruise in the Fasana Channel near Pula when her stern struck a mine . The boat sank at a depth of 36 meters ( 118 ft ) with a loss of 6 of the 19 men on board . From 20 to 24 May the submarine was raised , and through November underwent a refit . During this reconditioning , a new conning tower was added and the deck gun was upgraded again , this time to a 7 @.@ 5 cm / 30 ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) gun . Upon completion , U @-@ 5 was recommissioned , but had no more war successes . In her career , U @-@ 5 sank a total of four ships totaling 21 @,@ 604 GRT . After the war 's end , U @-@ 5 was transferred to Venice where she was inspected by British military commissions . U @-@ 5 was later ceded to Italy as a war reparation in 1920 and was scrapped . 
 = Hurricane Emilia ( 1994 ) = 
 Hurricane Emilia was , at the time , the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the central Pacific Ocean , and the first of such to be classified as a Category 5 hurricane – the highest rating on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . However , hurricanes Gilma later that year and Ioke in 2006 later reached lower barometric pressures in the Central Pacific . The fifth named storm and the first of three Category 5 hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season , Emilia developed from an area of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July 16 . Tracking westward , the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical cyclogenesis . Subsequently , Emilia entered Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) . 
 After reaching hurricane intensity the following day , the tropical cyclone began to rapidly intensify , and late on July 17 , Emilia reached its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 926 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 34 inHg ) , rating it as a Category 5 hurricane . After slight oscillations in strength , and upper @-@ level trough forced the intense hurricane northwest on July 21 , and Emilia began to weaken thereafter . The tropical cyclone encountered an area of vertical wind shear and cool sea surface temperatures , which further weakened the system . The following day , Emilia made its closest approach to the Big Island of Hawaii , but subsequently weakened to below hurricane intensity . This weakening trend continued , and the tropical cyclone fully dissipated on July 25 . Though the hurricane per se did not make landfall , Emilia brought strong surf to the islands of Hawaii and caused gusty winds , which resulted in some property damage . Precipitation was also reported , but remained under moderate levels .

 On June 29 , a weak tropical wave exited the west African coast and traversed the Atlantic with no signs of organization or convective activity . Moving within the Intertropical Convergence Zone , the tropical disturbance remained inactive until July 14 , when it developed into an area of low pressure roughly 2 @,@ 110 mi ( 3 @,@ 400 km ) east @-@ southeast of the Hawaiian Islands . A low @-@ level circulation was present , and a tropical depression is believed to have formed on July 17 due to increasing organization . Later , satellite imagery suggested that the system had intensified to Tropical Storm Emilia with 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) sustained winds . Emilia steadily strengthened to a minimal hurricane , moving west @-@ northwest . It crossed 140 ° W and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's ( CPHC ) area of responsibility , which noted that Emilia was " well developed . " Emilia attained winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , which marked the beginning of a rapid intensification period . Maximum sustained winds increased from 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) on July 17 to 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) late on July 19 , which was a period of 42 hours . At the time , an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft measured a minimum central pressure of 926 mbar ( 27 @.@ 34 inHg ) and maximum winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) , hinting that the storm has reached peak intensity . 
 On July 20 , Emilia briefly weakened to a Category 4 hurricane , but it re @-@ intensified to Category 5 status 12 hours later during the day . Subsequently , Emilia began to weaken for the final time . An upper @-@ level trough in the westerlies caused the cyclone to turn northwest on July 21 . Emilia moved over progressively cooler waters , and vertical wind shear from the westerlies negatively impacted the hurricane . The central pressure steadily rose to 965 mbar ( 28 @.@ 50 inHg ) , and Emilia diminished to a marginal Category 3 hurricane . On July 22 , Emilia continued to weaken , and it passed within 170 mi ( 270 km ) of the Big Island . It was the closest approach to the islands . Later , the peak winds dropped to 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Emilia gradually turned west @-@ northwest , and the circulation moved with the trade winds . Emilia weakened to a tropical depression on July 24 , and a remnant swirl of stratocumulus clouds was noted . The system dissipated on the same day .

 Initially , forecasts significantly underestimated the intensification of Emilia , which was one of three tropical cyclones to attain Category 5 status in the central Pacific during the season . On July 16 , a 72 @-@ hour forecast misjudged the strengthening of Emilia by 41 m / s ( 92 mph ) . Later , winds at 72 hours were 31 m / s ( 69 mph ) too high when the cyclone began to weaken . Tropical cyclone forecast models consistently predicted Emilia to remain south of the Hawaiian Islands because of the upper troughs ' climatologically weak nature during the summer . This led to high confidence in the forecasts , resulting in a lack of watches or warnings . Nonetheless , a high surf advisory was issued for the south and east coasts of all islands . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 Despite the storm 's offshore <unk> , wells of 6 – 10 feet ( 2 – 3 @.@ 3 m ) were reported near the Puna and Ka ‘ <unk> coasts . Waikiki Beach in Honolulu reported a 5 ft high ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) surf . Surf was lower along the Kona and Kohala coasts . Winds were gusty , causing a few trees to be blown over and branches to be broken . Some minor roof damage was caused by the winds . International observatories and the Keck Telescope on the top of Mauna Kea were forced to close their domes due to the high winds . Rainfall ranged from light to moderate . The storm passed near two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) weather buoys during its passage through the state . All in all , Hurricane Emilia had mostly minor effects in the Hawaiian Islands . 
 Emilia is one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record in the Eastern Pacific , with a lowest pressure of 926 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 34 inHg ) . In the CPHC warning zone , only Gilma and Ioke of 2006 attained deeper pressures . Emilia was also a Category 5 hurricane for 18 hours , the most ever at the time in the Central Pacific . That record was broken later in the season by Hurricane John . 
 The storm was the subject of a disagreement between the Central Pacific Hurricane Center and the National Hurricane Center . Specifically , they debated Emilia 's peak strength in relation to the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale ( SSHWS ) . The CPHC reported that Emilia 's maximum winds peaked at 140 knots ( 260 km / h ) , making it a Category 5 hurricane . However , the NHC considered Emilia to be a high @-@ end Category 4 with maximum winds of 135 knots ( 250 km / h ) , in both its " best track " and its preliminary report . During 2008 , the NHC upgraded its " best track " to make Emilia a Category 5 , although there continues to be a discrepancy in Emilia 's duration at Category 5 intensity . 
 = Hurricane Dolly ( 1996 ) = 
 Hurricane Dolly caused flooding throughout Mexico in August 1996 . The fourth named storm and third hurricane of the season , Dolly developed from a tropical wave to the west @-@ southwest of Jamaica on August 19 . Initially a tropical depression , the system strengthened into a tropical storm about twelve hours later . Dolly headed westward and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane late on August 20 . It then made landfall near Chetumal , Quintana Roo . The system weakened to a tropical depression on August 21 . Later that day or early on August 22 , Dolly emerged into the Bay of Campeche and quickly re @-@ strengthened into a tropical storm . The storm deepened further and was upgraded to a hurricane again by midday on August 23 ; Dolly simultaneously peaked with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Around that time , it struck between Tuxpan , Veracruz , and Tampico , Tamaulipas . Dolly quickly weakened to a tropical depression early on August 24 , but remained intact while crossing Mexico and dissipated over the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25 . 
 The storm brought heavy rainfall to much of Mexico , peaking at 37 @.@ 41 inches ( 950 mm ) . In Quintana Roo , flooding destroyed a large amount of farmlands . Widespread flooding occurred after a river in the Pueblo Viejo area overflowed its banks . Hundreds of homes were destroyed , displacing about 35 @,@ 000 people . Large scale evacuations occurred in San Luis Potosí , while about 6 @,@ 500 fled their homes in the Tampico area . Communications and power outages were reported as far west as Mazatlán , Sinaloa . Throughout Mexico , there were fourteen fatalities reported , including six in Veracruz , three in Nuevo León , one in Monterrey , and another in Pueblo Viejo . Additionally , two people were left missing in Nuevo León . The outer bands of Dolly brought rainfall to southern Texas , which caused minor flooding , but was mostly beneficial due to drought conditions in the state .

 A large tropical wave , an elongated trough of low pressure , emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa around August 9 . Although deep convection was associated with the wave when it entered the Atlantic , showers and thunderstorms remained minimal for several days as the system tracked westward . Upon reaching the eastern Caribbean Sea , deep convection redeveloped , but failed to persist , until the wave reached an area southwest of Jamaica on August 18 . Around that time , a reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated a low to mid @-@ level circulation , but the system was too weak to classify using the Dvorak technique . After a center fix was made by another reconnaissance flight and satellite imagery , as well as a ship observing winds of 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) , the system was classified as Tropical Depression Four at 06 : 00 UTC on August 19 , while situated about 140 mi ( 230 km ) west @-@ southwest of South <unk> Point , Jamaica . 
 With an initially poorly @-@ defined circulation , the depression moved west @-@ northwestward . Because it developed near a mid to upper @-@ level anticyclone , conditions were favorable for intensification , with the system becoming Tropical Storm Dolly around 18 : 00 UTC on August 19 . Convection became more organized , and the storm strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale just under twenty four hours later . At 17 : 30 UTC on August 20 , Dolly made landfall near Punta Herrero , Quintana Roo – located northeast of Chetumal , with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Early the following day , the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm , and then to a tropical depression several hours later . 
 Late on August 21 , Dolly emerged into the Bay of Campeche , with satellite imagery indicating that convection was displaced to the south of the center of circulation . However , the system soon began to restrengthening , regaining tropical storm intensity by 00 : 00 UTC on August 22 . Early on the following day , the cyclone began turning westward . At 12 : 00 UTC on August 23 , Dolly reintensified into a hurricane and attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 989 mbar ( 29 @.@ 2 inHg ) . Simultaneously , the hurricane made landfall between Tuxpan , Veracruz , and Tampico , Tamaulipas . Six hours after moving inland , Dolly weakened to a tropical storm . Early on August 24 , the system deteriorated to a tropical depression . Dolly remained intact while crossing Mexico and emerged into the Pacific Ocean several hours later , but was not reclassified as an eastern Pacific tropical cyclone and dissipated about 40 mi ( 65 km ) west of San Juanito in the Islas Marías .

 = Joffrey Tower = 
 The Joffrey Tower is a high @-@ rise commercial real estate development on the northeast corner of North State Street and East Randolph Street in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States that is the permanent home of the Joffrey Ballet . It is located immediately south of the Chicago Theatre and directly across the street from Macy 's largest Chicago ( and its second largest overall ) department store on State Street , within the Loop Retail Historic District . Its address had once been the site of the Chicago Masonic Temple . The placement of the Joffrey Ballet in this building appears to have involved political dealings with the Mayor of Chicago , Richard M. Daley and his brother , William M. Daley , a co @-@ chairman of the Joffrey board of trustees . The building was scheduled for completion in December 2007 , but was not finished until September 12 , 2008 . 
 = = Details = = 
 The building was originally named the Modern Momentum Building ( nicknamed the <unk> ) . Like the ballet company , it has been named after Robert Joffrey , co @-@ founder of the company . The Joffrey Ballet acquired the naming rights when it purchased 45 @,@ 000 square feet ( 4 @,@ 200 m2 ) of space on the third and fourth floors to serve as its new permanent home . The floors include the Joffrey administrative offices plus seven state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art rehearsal studios and a black @-@ box theatre . The building occupies the southwest quarter of the block bounded by North State Street to the West , North Wabash Street to the East , East Randolph Street to the South , and East Lake Street to the North . The Modern Momentum Project now holds the Joffrey name when the Ballet company took possession ( originally anticipated in December 2007 ) . The first two floors of the Joffrey Tower house retail tenants and floors 9 through 32 host residential condominiums . All four of the foundation floors are 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) high . The four @-@ story cutout above the foundation and green roof is capped by " legs " with only elevators and stairwells that compensate for the fact the building does not have the typical lower level parking spaces to improve the views by raising the units . The building 's main largest rehearsal space had been named the Arpino Studio in honor of Gerald Arpino , Joffrey Ballet co @-@ founder and artistic director emeritus . 
 The building was originally scheduled for completion in December 2007 with the official renaming and company move accompanying the completion . By January 2008 , the anticipated grand opening had been rescheduled to occur in the summer of 2008 . The grand opening events , including performances by Shelley MacArthur and Ramsey Lewis , were sponsored by The <unk> , Bank of America , and the McCormick Foundation . July 2008 advertisements announced a September 12 , 2008 opening night and a set of opening events from September 11 to 15 . 
 The building was designed by Booth Hansen Architects . Construction started in 2005 and was completed for the September 2008 grand opening . The height of the structure is 409 feet ( 125 m ) ( including spires and antennae ) . 
 The September 11 , 2008 , free performance at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion served the dual purpose of heralding the grand opening weekend and paying tribute to the September 11 attacks victims . Other events during the grand opening weekend included a September 12 black tie gala , September 13 Tower tours , and September 15 party and fashion show . The September 15 event also included an auction for various items , including a pair of $ 25 @,@ 000 Van Cleef and <unk> diamond earrings .

 The building is located on the site of the former Masonic Temple , which had once been the tallest building in Chicago . Since the demolition of the Masonic Temple , the address had housed a two @-@ story retail building .

Another failed plan was the subsequent 33 @-@ story Randolph Court design . 
 The Daley administration has been a proponent of the Joffrey Ballet having a permanent Theatre District home in order to establish it as a major Chicago institution . However , the cost of building their own building at State and Lake was prohibitive . Supposedly , the city of Chicago held the development of this project hostage until the developer agreed to the Joffrey initiative . The delay tactic used was to delay closing long enough to cause the developer to have to file suit . William Daley , a co @-@ chairman of the Joffrey board of trustees , is a former Cabinet member in the Clinton administration and clout @-@ heavy brother of Chicago 's former mayor , Richard M. Daley . The arts @-@ loving mayor has revitalized the Loop in part by re @-@ establishing a central theatre district . The Joffrey Tower is within three blocks of Cadillac Palace , Chicago , Goodman , Harris , Ford Center / Oriental , and Storefront Theatres , as well as the Chicago Cultural Center , the Tiffany @-@ decorated former central library . 
 = = Center Stage Campaign = = 
 The Joffrey Ballet launched its first Chicago capital campaign on March 7 , 2007 . As of May 2008 , it has raised $ 30 million towards a goal of $ 35 million for Joffrey Tower construction costs and an endowment . When the purchase was finalized , the Joffrey had $ 2 @.@ 5 million in reserves and the state had recently approved a $ 4 million grant . The construction costs alone were estimated to be $ 21 million . The fundraising enticements include the possibility that for $ 10 million a corporate donor could acquire renaming rights to the entire building and for lesser amounts they could acquire naming rights for various specific spaces . Facility details released at the hard hat preview and launch include the following : 
 A dedicated entrance and elevators on Randolph Street , with a lobby box office selling tickets to company events . 
 A " black box " theater space that will serve primarily as a full @-@ company rehearsal space but , with its lighting booth and fully foldable seating for 144 , also can double as an intimate showcase for open rehearsals , works @-@ in @-@ progress viewings and more . When unused , the studio also can be rented to visiting dance companies . 
 An additional six rehearsal studios with high ceilings and no obstructions . The Joffrey could use these for classes if it starts a school here . For now they will be the site of activities related to the Joffrey 's extensive outreach school programs . 
 Locker rooms , dressing rooms , showers , wardrobe and laundry suites , a lounge , physical therapy areas , and artistic and executive staff offices . 
 A Green roof to cover the Joffrey part of the building . 
 In Chicago , the administration and the performers had previously been in separate buildings . The Joffrey Ballet had rented both a 17 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 600 m2 ) rehearsal studio at 17 N. State Street , which it leased in July 2005 , and administrative offices at 70 E. Lake Street . The Joffrey now has the company 's creative leadership , dancers , administration , technical staff , guest artists , students , and apprentices united under one roof , creating streamlined operations and a more efficient and accomplished organization . The new space nearly doubles the current space . The new permanent state of the art facilities enable The Joffrey to recruit and retain elite dancers and simultaneously attract world @-@ class performers , guest artists and collaborators . The planned space allows the company to rehearse and present more of its repertoire , mount additional full @-@ length ballets , extend its apprentice program , launch additional revivals , and provide young dancers and choreographers the opportunity to train and present their new works .

 = E.T. the Extra @-@ Terrestrial ( video game ) = 
 E.T. the Extra @-@ Terrestrial ( also referred to simply as E.T. ) is a 1982 adventure video game developed and published by Atari , Inc. for the Atari 2600 video game console . It is based on the film of the same name , and was designed by Howard Scott Warshaw . The objective of the game is to guide the eponymous character through various screens to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone that will allow him to contact his home planet . 
 Warshaw intended the game to be an innovative adaptation of the film , and Atari thought it would achieve high sales figures based on its connection with the film , which was extremely popular throughout the world . Negotiations to secure the rights to make the game ended in late July 1982 , giving Warshaw only five and a half weeks to develop the game in time for the 1982 Christmas season . The result is often cited as one of the worst video games released and was one of the biggest commercial failures in video gaming history . The game 's commercial failure and resulting effects on Atari are frequently cited as a contributing factor to the video game industry crash of 1983 . 
 It was believed that as a result of overproduction and returns , millions of unsold cartridges were buried in an Alamogordo , New Mexico landfill . In 2013 , plans were revealed to conduct an excavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial , and in April of the following year , the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo Burial did include E.T. cartridges among other titles . James Heller , the former Atari manager who was in charge of the original burial , was also on hand at the excavation and revealed to the Associated Press that 728 @,@ 000 cartridges of various titles were buried . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 E.T. is an adventure game in which players control an alien ( E.T. ) from a top @-@ down perspective . The objective of the game is to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone . The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits ( also referred to as wells ) . The player is provided with an on @-@ screen energy bar , which decreases when E.T. performs any actions ( including moving , teleporting , or falling into a pit , as well as levitating back to the top ) . To prevent this , E.T. can collect Reese 's Pieces , which are used to restore his energy or , when nine are collected , E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone , or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end . After the three phone pieces have been collected , the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone , which allows him to call his home planet . When the call is made , E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit . Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come , the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet . Then the game starts over , with the same difficulty level , while changing the location of the telephone pieces . The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration . The game ends when the energy bar depletes . E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him . E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells . It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made , such as Raiders of the Lost Ark . 
 The game is divided into six environments , each representing a different setting from the film . To accomplish the objective of the game , the player must guide E.T. into the wells . Once all items found in a well are collected , the player must levitate E.T. out of them . An icon at the top of each screen represents the current area , each area enabling the player to perform different actions . Antagonists include a scientist who takes E.T. for observation and an FBI agent who chases the alien to confiscate one of the collected telephone pieces , or candy . The game offers diverse difficulty settings that affect the number and speed of humans present , and the conditions needed to accomplish the objective . 
 = = Development = = 
 The process began in July 1982 and was completed before the end of the year . Following the commercial success of the film in June 1982 , Steve Ross , chief executive officer ( CEO ) of Atari 's parent company Warner Communications , started negotiations with Steven Spielberg and Universal Pictures to acquire the license to produce a video game based on the film . In late July , Warner announced its exclusive worldwide rights to market coin @-@ operated and console games based on the movie . Although the exact details of the transaction were not disclosed in the announcement , it was later reported that Atari had paid US $ 20 – 25 million for the rights , a high figure for video game licensing at the time . When asked by Ross what he thought about making an <unk> video game , Atari CEO Ray Kassar replied , " I think it 's a dumb idea . We 've never really made an action game out of a movie . " An arcade game based on the E.T. property had also been planned , but this was deemed to be impossible given the short deadline . 
 After negotiations completed , Kassar called Howard Scott Warshaw on July 27 , 1982 to commission him as developer of the video game . Kassar informed him that Spielberg asked for Warshaw specifically and that development needed to be completed by September 1 to meet a production schedule for the Christmas holiday . Though Warshaw had spent over a year working on consecutive development schedules for games ( seven months working on <unk> ' Revenge and then six months on Raiders of the Lost Ark ) , he accepted the offer based on the challenge of completing a game in a short time frame and at Spielberg 's request . Warshaw considered it an opportunity to develop an innovative Atari 2600 game based on a movie he enjoyed , " provided we reach the right arrangement " . Kassar reportedly offered Warshaw US $ 200 @,@ 000 and an all @-@ expenses @-@ paid vacation to Hawaii in compensation . Kassar then told him to arrive at the San Jose Airport a few days later to have a meeting with Spielberg . 
 Warshaw used those days to design the structure of the game and segmented the concept into four ideas : world , objective , path to achieve the objective , and obstacles . He envisioned a three @-@ dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film 's plot , E.T. phoning home , as the goal . Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal . He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game , and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console . Inspired by the movie , adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien . Feeling more adversity was needed , Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal . Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of the phone as well as expand the game 's world . 
 Warshaw and other Atari executives presented this design to Spielberg , who did not express enthusiasm . Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to Namco 's Pac @-@ Man . Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design , Warshaw proceeded with his concept , which he felt would capture the sentimentality he saw in the original film . In retrospect , however , Warshaw stated that Spielberg 's idea might have had merit . He spent the remaining time programming the game . Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film , as well as the stability the video game industry was experiencing in 1982 . Due to time limitations , Atari decided to skip audience testing for the product . <unk> Gerard , co @-@ chief operating officer of Warner at the time , later suggested that the company had fallen into a false sense of security by the success of its previous releases , particularly its console version of Pac @-@ Man , which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Anticipation for E.T. was high in 1982 , and it was a sought @-@ after Christmas gift . In early December 1982 , the New York Times reported that video games based on successful movies , specifically E.T. , would become " an increasingly profitable source " for video game development . At first , retailers ordered more supplies than what was expected to be sold , but Atari received an increasing number of order cancellations as new competitors entered the market , an event the company had not anticipated . John Hubner and William Kistner of InfoWorld attribute the cancellations to changes Atari initiated between its relationship between distributors . On November 1 , 1982 , Atari informed them that their contracts were canceled and that exclusive deals would be established with select distributors . Hubner and Kistner believed the action prompted retailers to cancel orders , which Atari had not properly tracked . 
 E.T. met with initial commercial success . It was among the top four on Billboard magazine 's " Top 15 Video Games " sales list in December 1982 and January 1983 . The game eventually sold 1 @.@ 5 million units , becoming one of the best @-@ selling Atari 2600 titles . However , between 2 @.@ 5 and 3 @.@ 5 million cartridges went unsold . Hubner and Kistner commented that the large number of produced cartridges may have resulted in excess inventory regardless of E.T. ' s success . Even though the game was a best seller during the holiday season , retailers still stated that its sales figures did not meet expectations . Warner Communications also expressed disappointment at the number of sales . Lower than expected sales figures combined with excess inventory , which produced a negative supply and demand event , prompted retailers to repeatedly discount price . According to Ray Kassar , about 3 @.@ 5 million of the 4 million produced were sent back to the company as unsold inventory or customer returns . Despite sales figures , the quantity of unsold merchandise , coupled with the expensive movie license and the large amount of returns , made E.T. a major financial failure for Atari . By 2004 , the cartridges were still very common and priced at very low amounts . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 While reviews of the movie version of E.T. were highly positive , the game was negatively received by critics , with common complaints focused on the plot , gameplay , and visuals . New York magazine 's Nicholas Pileggi described it as a loser when compared to other games Atari could have released like Donkey Kong and Frogger . Video Games called the game " really for kids ( the <unk> ones ) . " Kevin Bowen of GameSpy 's Classic Gaming called the gameplay " convoluted and inane " , also criticizing its story for departing from the serious tone of the film . Author Steven Kent described the game as " infamous " within the industry , citing " primitive " graphics , " dull " gameplay , and a " disappointing story " . In 1984 Softline readers named the game the second @-@ worst Atari program of 1983 , after Congo Bongo . 
 Nevertheless , the game also received some more positive reviews . An editor for The Miami Herald described it as a difficult game to learn to play , but felt it was worth dedicating the time . <unk> 's Kevin Christopher criticized the protagonist 's repeated falling down back into holes , but considered it " about the only flaw with an otherwise A @-@ 1 game . " Arcade Express scored it 6 out of 10 in December 1982 . 
 Critics bemoaned the gameplay 's repetitive use of falling down holes . <unk> Townsend of PC World discussed the game with a group , and found a universal dislike for the pits that E.T. falls into , describing it as " monotonous " . Writer Sean " <unk> " Reiley also criticized the pits , claiming that they are " time @-@ consuming " and " difficult to leave without falling back in " . Trent Ward , a former Next Generation Magazine reviewer , commented that this element prompted him to immediately return the game for a refund after purchasing it in his youth , and the children who found games in the New Mexico landfill gave the E.T. cartridges away because , as one later said , the " game sucked ... you couldn 't finish it " . Classic Gaming argued that despite the negative reception , the game can be enjoyable after the player has learned to navigate the pits . 
 In published materials written over a decade after its initial release , E.T. has been universally panned by critics and is frequently listed as the worst video game ever . Reiley ranked it number one in a list of the 20 worst games of all time in Electronic Gaming Monthly 's 150th issue . Michael Dolan , deputy editor of FHM magazine , has also listed the game as his pick for the worst video game of all time . Townsend placed E.T. at the top of his list of worst video games , noting that , " about a third of the people I quizzed came up with this title almost instantly , and it 's not hard to see why . " GameTrailers ranked the game the second worst on their " Top Ten Best and Worst Games of All Time " list . 
 Critics often attribute the poor quality to the short development time . Townsend commented that the rushed development was very apparent after playing the game . Warshaw 's contributions to the game have been met with mixed responses . Classic Gaming called the game poorly designed , while IGN 's Levi Buchanan stated the " impossibly tight schedule " given to Warshaw absolves him of blame . Warshaw does not express regret for his part in E.T. , and feels he created a good game given the time available to him .

The publication listed the game as the second " worst movie game ever " , citing it as an example of how poor gameplay can bring negative reception to strong licenses . 
 = = = Effect on the industry = = = 
 The game is often cited as one of the most important titles in the industry 's history . Billboard magazine 's Earl Paige reported that the large number of unsold E.T. games along with an increase in competition prompted retailers to demand official return programs from video game manufacturers . The game is also considered to be one of the causes of the video game industry crisis of 1983 . By the end of 1982 , Atari had begun to lose dominance as more competitors entered the market . Poor critical reception and lack of a profitable marketing strategy made this game one of many cited decisions that led Atari to report a $ 536 million loss in 1983 and led to the company being divided and sold in 1984 . GameSpy 's Classic Gaming called E.T. Atari 's biggest mistake , as well as the largest financial failure in the industry . Reiley commented that the game 's poor quality was responsible for ending the product life of the Atari 2600 . Occurring soon after Pac @-@ Man 's negative critical response on the Atari 2600 , E.T. ' s poor reception was attributed by Kent to a negative impact on Atari 's reputation and profitability . Authors Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost echoed similar comments about Pac @-@ Man and E.T. ' s combined effect on the company 's reputation and the industry 's reaction . Buchanan also cited the game as a factor to Atari and the industry 's crash . He stated that the large amount of unsold merchandise was a financial burden to Atari , which pushed the company into debt . 
 On December 7 , 1982 , Kassar announced that Atari 's revenue forecasts for 1982 were cut from a 50 percent increase over 1981 to a 15 percent increase . Immediately following the announcement , Warner Communications ' stock value dropped by around 35 percent — from US $ 54 to US $ 35 — resulting in the company losing US $ 1 @.@ 3 billion in market valuation . Kassar sold five thousand of his Warner shares a half @-@ hour before the announcement . This prompted an investigation for insider trading against him by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Atari attempted to regain their market share by licensing popular arcade games for the Atari consoles . The games , however , did not reverse Atari 's decline and they went further into debt . In 1983 , the company had decreased its workforce by 30 percent and lost US $ 356 million . Other companies — Activision , Bally Manufacturing , and Mattel — experienced similar results as the industry declined . 
 = = = Atari video game burial = = = 
 In September 1983 , the Alamogordo Daily News of Alamogordo , New Mexico , reported in a series of articles that between ten and twenty semi @-@ trailer truckloads of Atari boxes , cartridges , and systems from an Atari storehouse in El Paso , Texas , were crushed and buried at the landfill within the city . It was Atari 's first dealings with the landfill , which was chosen because no scavenging was allowed and its garbage was crushed and buried nightly . Atari officials and others gave differing reports of what was buried , but it has been speculated that most unsold copies of E.T. are buried in this landfill , crushed and encased in cement . The story of the buried cartridges was erroneously regarded by some as an urban legend , with skeptics — including Warshaw — disregarding the official accounts . 
 On May 28 , 2013 , the Alamogordo City Commission approved Fuel Industries , an Ottawa @-@ based entertainment company , for six months of landfill access both to create a documentary about the legend and to excavate the burial site . On April 26 , 2014 , remnants of E.T. and other Atari games were discovered in the early hours of the excavation . 
 A fictional account of the game 's disposal is the main basis for James Rolfe 's 2014 independent film Angry Video Game Nerd : The Movie . A documentary called Atari : Game Over in which several of the buried games were unearthed was released in 2014 . 
 In December 2014 , The Smithsonian Institution added an excavated cartridge of E.T. to their collection . In 2015 , The Henry Ford museum added several excavated cartridges and a video touchpad , a sample of landfill dirt taken from the site of the burial , and items of clothing worn by the excavation team to their collection . A selection of these items are on permanent display .

 = Spooks ( series 7 ) = 
 The seventh series of the BBC espionage television series Spooks ( known as MI @-@ 5 in the United States ) began broadcasting on 27 October 2008 on BBC One before ending on 8 December 2008 on the same channel , and consists of eight episodes , two fewer than previous series . It follows the actions of Section D , a counter @-@ terrorism division in MI5 . The primary storyline involves Sugarhorse , a top secret operation set up by MI5 during the final years of the Cold War , and a mole working for the FSB who intends to leak the operation to the Russians . Peter Firth , Rupert Penry @-@ Jones , Hermione Norris , Richard Armitage , Miranda Raison , Gemma Jones , Hugh Simon and Alex Lanipekun are credited as the main cast . 
 Penry @-@ Jones announced his intention to leave the series in December 2007 , while it was later announced Armitage would join . Norris and Raison were both asked to return after their characters were left open for return after the end of the last series . In developing the series , the producers wanted to repeat the serialised style from series six , and settled on using the resurgence of Russia as the primary storyline , as they felt that at the time , the resurgence is in subtle ways threatening the security of the west . The producers also participated in several meetings with the writers to discuss the purpose of Sugarhorse . Filming started in London in March 2008 , and later finished on August in the same year , in Moscow , the first time in series history where Spooks was filmed outside the United Kingdom . 
 The seventh series received healthy ratings , with both BBC One and BBC Three ratings together achieving 6 @.@ 13 million viewers per episode . It series also attracted critical acclaim , with some reviewers considering it to be the best series of Spooks . Both factors allowed the BBC to commission an eighth series of the programme for 2009 . The seventh series was released on DVD on 12 October 2009 in the United Kingdom , 30 March 2009 in Australia , and 26 January 2010 in the United States .

 The series consists of eight main cast members . Rupert Penry @-@ Jones returns as Adam Carter for the first episode . Penry @-@ Jones announced his intention to leave the series after appearing on the show for four years in December 2007 , because he felt his character ran its course and " getting to the point where I needed to move on , " adding he would like to explore other venues in his career . In order to keep the series fresh , the producers still wanted Adam 's exit to be a shock to the audience . The actor found that his last days on Spooks was generally upsetting and " welled up " on his final day . 
 Later in March 2008 , the BBC announced that Richard Armitage would join the series as Lucas North . The character was designed by the producers to become a " new heroic figure , " and to become much more distant than Adam . Armitage was chosen early in the casting process as the producers believed he could carry the mystery of the character . Armitage was approached by the producers after he finished work on the second series of Robin Hood , for which he portrayed the regular part of Sir Guy of Gisbourne . He accepted the role but was initially hesitant to join because of the " tall order " for replacing Penry @-@ Jones . Armitage lost a stone in weight in preparation to keep with the description that Lucas is malnourished in the first episode , but still kept physically fit . 
 Elsewhere , Hermione Norris returns as Ros Myers . The character was initially written off after the eighth episode of the sixth series due to the actress 's pregnancy , however when the seventh series entered pre @-@ production , Norris was asked to return and she accepted . Miranda Raison also returns as Jo Portman ; the cliffhanger of the sixth series finale , where Jo was apparently killed , was to leave the audience wonder whether she survived . Raison stated that she realised the producers wanted her to return , and she wanted to return . Alex Lanipekun returns as Ben Kaplan , and was upgraded to a series regular from the last series . Lanipekun believed that the seventh series was " kind of for Ben , " adding that there was an episode that would see his coming of age by dealing with his first undercover operation and his burdens , namely getting close to someone who is involved with the group he was sent to stop . Peter Firth , Gemma Jones and Hugh Simon returns as superior Harry Pearce , Connie James and Malcolm Wynn @-@ Jones , respectively . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 The writers and producers got together to discuss what direction they would take for the seventh series . They wanted to repeat the same style for series six , which was to add a serial element to be carried throughout the duration of the series . They got together to think about what they would believe to be a big political story that would affect politics in the United Kingdom in within twelve to eighteen months after their initial meetings early in 2008 . They settled on using Russia , which was facing a resurgence in power after the Cold War , which the producers felt , in subtle ways , would threaten the security of the west . Sometime through the writing process , the producers set up a story @-@ arc , Sugarhorse , to be a threat throughout the series and have it resolved by the finale . The writers enjoyed making the Sugarhorse storyline because it was one of the instances that " really brings Harry to the edge " and causing him to doubt everything he has done or achieved . The writing team took several meetings together to discuss what it is and how it should work into the storyline . Christian Spurrier noted it was " kind of a headache " to figure out how to " weave it in " to the series and work out what parts would be used in which episodes . The producers wanted to use a scene relating to Sugarhorse as the finale scene of every episode it was featured in , as the producers believed it would provide a " right hook " to the audience . Adding the new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying , truth , and who the characters should trust . 
 Throughout the writing process , several cast members would give suggestion notes to the writers on how to improve some scenes . The writers were frequently annoyed with Armitage , who gave out more notes than any other cast members , however the writers also liked some of his ideas and included them in the scripts . The producers believed that the seventh series was among the more brutal than the others , citing the violent death of Ben . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming started in March 2008 , and later finished on August in the same year . Before principal photography commenced , director Colm McCarthy participated in helicopter shots over London . In each block of episodes , the cast and crew would often film all scenes held in certain locations at once , for instance all scenes set on the Grid , although taking place in different parts of each episodes , would all be filmed together before moving on to another set . However , the cast had trouble following the storylines with this method . A different Director of Photography was hired in each episode . Because of this , the filming style inside the Grid set changed in every episode . To film public shots , a small filming crew were used as to not attract too much attention from passers by . However , by using the small crew , they and the actors generally film the scenes unnoticed by the public , which the producers felt gave the characters such gravitas . 
 Filming finished in August 2008 in Moscow , Russia ; it was the first time in series history where filming took place outside the United Kingdom ; producer Katie Swinden stated that Spooks is usually " London @-@ orientated , " including when it comes to filming scenes set in other countries , and it usually does not take place outside the confines of the M25 , an orbital motorway which encircles the UK 's capital . However , the producers were able to afford to shoot in another country . A small crew were used to save costs . Armitage and Norris were the only two of the main actors who participated in the shoot . However , the main problem with filming in Moscow was of the 30 plus degree heat , and the actors had to wear winter coats because the episodes were set during the colder months . 
 = = = Stunts = = = 
 The producers allow the cast to perform many of their own stunts . In filming fight sequences , they were carefully choreographed beforehand so the actors could participate themselves . The guns featured on the series are real . In scenes where guns are included , an armourer is on hand throughout the entirety of the sequence to see if the actors are handling them properly and gives out the guns to the actors at the last possible second before filming . After the sequence is shot , the guns have to be returned and locked in a case to prevent anybody from playing with them , even if the guns are not loaded . Among other stunt work , Armitage was asked to be subjected to an actual waterboarding scene to ensure the authenticity of the sequence . The actor agreed after he was convinced by <unk> from the FSB and CIA . Kudos film and television , the production company behind Spooks , had to follow several health and safety provisions from an advisor to ensure the sequence strictly adheres to the advice . The advisor and a medic were present during filming . Armitage was only waterboarded for a short time , and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear as if he was on for longer . The ambient temperature of the room was also raised to make Armitage as comfortable as possible . Following the sequence , Armitage stated " I only lasted five to ten seconds , and the sound of my voice crying out to stop isn 't me acting . "

 The series was broadcast every Monday from 27 October to 8 December 2008 on BBC One , with the exception of the second episode , which aired on a Tuesday , the day after the first episode . However , the second through to the seventh episodes were pre @-@ empted to BBC Three sometime after the BBC One broadcasts of the previous episode . The first episode " New Allegiances " was seen by 5 @.@ 5 million and was given a strong audience share of 23 @.@ 4 per cent . Although ratings were high , the premiere was down from the 6 @.@ 6 million seen by the premiere of the previous sixth series . Some of the later episode faced heavy competition from I 'm a Celebrity , Get Me Out of Here ! on ITV1 , however despite this , ratings for Spooks remained steady . The finale " Nuclear Strike " gave the seventh series its strongest ratings , with six million viewers . Compiling both BBC One and BBC Three viewings , viewing figures for the seventh series averaged 6 @.@ 13 million per episode . The series also became the ninth most watched series from BBC iPlayer , an Internet television service , of 2008 . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The seventh series attracted critical acclaim , with some reviewers considering it to be the best series of Spooks . Leigh Holmwood of The Guardian feared that the death of Adam " would have cast a long shadow , " but barely noticed his absence given the pace of the episodes . Holmwood also believed that Lucas ' introduction " more than made amends " for replacing Adam , and also felt the return of Ros Myers and her promotion was " a genius move . " Mark Wright of The Stage thought that it was " stunning " with the last three episodes in particular " hitting new heights of tension and storytelling for the series , " adding it is " as good as , if not the better , than the first couple of seasons . " Wright also believed the series performed well with a reduced series length of eight as opposed to the ten episodes from the last few series , which he said allowed for " tighter , more focussed storytelling . " He also felt the cast changes " always felt naturally organic , " and praised Adam 's exit , Lucas ' introduction , and the " fantastic , strong female role model " of Hermione Norris ' portrayal . Wright ended by saying " Spooks has been my favourite show of the last few months and indeed of 2008 . " 
 Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop named Spooks series seven as the best television show of 2008 out of 50 programmes . Gimmers felt the seventh series performed better than the previous , as it " lost its way slightly " with the concentration of Islamic extremists . The seventh series however , was praised for bringing back the more traditional enemy , the Russians . With the introduction of Lucas North , Gimmers stated " the possibilities for double @-@ blinding the audience were legion and every single one was exploited to the max . " Gimmers also cited the more " pacy " plots due to a shorter series as another factor of the series 's success , and also said " the only problem with having a series as good as this in the bag is how they will match it next year ? " David Blackwell of Enterline Media said that the series ' storylines " have a grain of truth reflecting today 's climate " and also " more deeply rooted in gritty realism and preying on the real dangers that terrorists and other countries pose to the UK . " Blackwell also posed the storylines also " keeps the characters human and show what they go through " and reacted <unk> towards Lucas ' introduction , stating " I like Lucas North better than Adam Carter or Tom Quinn . His dark and conflicted persona adds to the story and makes him a more interesting character than Adam or Tom ever were . " Blackwell summed up the series as " as great as the first six seasons . The show maintains a high standard of quality . " 
 Following the end of the eighth series , Last Broadcast held a poll for the top five most shocking death scenes in Spooks . Two of them were deaths from the seventh series . Adam Carter 's death was voted the fourth most shocking , while Ben Kaplan 's death was voted third . Connie 's death however , was not listed . The featuring of an actual waterboarding scene drew criticism from Guardian columnist Zoe Williams , who wrote " it 's really unpleasant , [ Armitage ] concurred . ' I only lasted five to 10 seconds , and the sound of my voice crying out to stop isn 't me acting . ' Pal , that 's nice that you 're not showing off but this is all wrong and despicable : it 's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train , to see what it would be like on the train to Auschwitz . If you can make it stop whenever you like , you 're learning nothing and kicking people in the face while you 're at it . "

 The seventh series was nominated for a British Academy Television Award ( BAFTA ) for " Best Drama Series " in 2009 , but lost to Wallander . Because of the strong ratings and positive feedback from fans and critics , the BBC announced they would recommission Spooks for an eighth series for 2009 on 4 December 2008 , just days before the finale was set to air .

 = Fin whale = 
 The fin whale ( Balaenoptera physalus ) , also called the finback whale , razorback , or common rorqual , is a marine mammal belonging to the suborder of baleen whales . It is the second @-@ largest animal after the blue whale . The largest reportedly grow to 27 @.@ 3 m ( 89 @.@ 6 ft ) long with a maximum confirmed length of 25 @.@ 9 m ( 85 ft ) , a maximum recorded weight of nearly 74 tonnes ( 73 long tons ; 82 short tons ) , and a maximum estimated weight of around 120 tonnes ( 132 @.@ 5 tons ) . American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews called the fin whale " the greyhound of the sea ... for its beautiful , slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship . " 
 The fin whale 's body is long and slender , coloured brownish @-@ grey with a paler <unk> fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the cetacean order , which is composed of all species of whale , dolphin and porpoise . At least two recognized subspecies exist , in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere . It is found in all the major oceans , from polar to tropical waters . It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean . The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters . Its food consists of small schooling fish , squid , and crustaceans including copepods and krill . 
 Like all other large whales , the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century and is an endangered species . Over 725 @,@ 000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976 , as of 1997 survived by only 38 @,@ 000 . 
 The International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) issued a moratorium on commercial hunting of this whale , although Iceland and Japan have resumed hunting . The species is also hunted by Greenlanders under the IWC 's Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling provisions . Global population estimates range from less than 100 @,@ 000 to roughly 119 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The fin whale was first described by <unk> Martens in 1675 and then again by Paul Dudley in 1725 . The former description was used as the primary basis of the species Balaena physalus by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 . In 1804 , Bernard Germain de Lacépède reclassified the species as Balaenoptera rorqual , based on a specimen that had stranded on Île Sainte @-@ Marguerite ( Cannes , France ) in 1798 . In 1830 , Louis <unk> described a specimen that had stranded near Saint @-@ Cyprien , southern France , in 1828 as Balaena musculus . Most later authors followed him in using the specific name musculus , until Frederick W. True ( 1898 ) showed that it referred to the blue whale . In 1846 , British taxonomist John Edward Gray described a 16 @.@ 7 m ( 55 ft ) specimen from the Falkland Islands as Balaenoptera australis . In 1865 , German naturalist Hermann Burmeister described a roughly 15 m ( 49 ft ) specimen found near Buenos Aires about 30 years earlier as Balaenoptera <unk> . In 1903 , Romanian scientist Emil <unk> placed all these designations into Balaenoptera physalus . The word physalus comes from the Greek word <unk> , meaning " blows " , referring to the prominent blow of the species ( as described by Martens [ 1675 , p . 132 ] : " They know the <unk> @-@ fish by the ... vehement blowing and spouting up of the water ... " ) . 
 Fin whales are rorquals , members of the family Balaenopteridae , which also includes the humpback whale , the blue whale , Bryde 's whale , the sei whale , and the minke whales . The family diverged from the other baleen whales in the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene , although it is not known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species . 
 Recent DNA evidence indicates the fin whale may be more closely related to the humpback whale ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) and in at least one study the gray whale ( Eschrichtius robustus ) , two whales in different genera , than it is to members of its own genus , such as the minke whales . As of 2006 , two subspecies are named , each with distinct physical features and vocalizations . The northern fin whale , B. p. physalus ( Linnaeus 1758 ) inhabits the North Atlantic and the southern fin whale , B. p. quoyi ( Fischer 1829 ) occupies the Southern Ocean . Most experts consider the fin whales of the North Pacific to be a third , as yet unnamed subspecies – this was supported by a 2013 study , which found that the Northern Hemisphere B. p. physalus was not composed of a single subspecies . The three groups mix at most , rarely . 
 Clarke ( 2004 ) proposed a " pygmy " subspecies ( B. p. <unk> , Burmeister , 1865 ) that is purportedly darker in colour and has black baleen . He based this on a single physically mature 19 @.@ 8 m ( 65 ft ) female caught in the Antarctic in 1947 – 48 , the smaller average size ( a few feet ) of sexually and physically mature fin whales caught by the Japanese around 50 ° S , and smaller , darker sexually immature fin whales caught in the Antarctic which he believed were a " migratory phase " of his proposed subspecies . His proposal is not widely accepted and no genetic evidence for their existence is available . 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 The genetic distance between blue and fin whales has been compared to that between a gorilla and human ( 3 @.@ 5 million years on the evolutionary tree . ) Nevertheless , hybrid individuals between blue and fin whales with characteristics of both are known to occur with relative frequency in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific . 
 The DNA profile of a sampling of whale meat in the Japanese market found evidence of blue / fin hybrids . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 The fin whale is usually distinguished by its tall spout , long back , prominent dorsal fin , and asymmetrical colouration . 
 The animal 's large size aids in identification , and it is usually only confused with the blue whale , the sei whale , or , in warmer waters , Bryde 's whale . 
 = = = Size = = = 
 In the Northern Hemisphere , the average size of adult males and females is about 18 @.@ 5 m ( 61 ft ) and 20 m ( 66 ft ) , respectively , averaging 38 @.@ 5 and 50 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 42 @.@ 5 and 55 @.@ 5 tons ) while in the Southern Hemisphere , it is 20 @.@ 5 m ( 67 ft ) and 22 m ( 72 ft ) , weighing 52 @.@ 5 and 63 tonnes ( 58 and 69 @.@ 5 tons ) . 
 In the North Atlantic , the longest reported were a 24 @.@ 4 m ( 80 @.@ 1 ft ) male caught off Shetland in 1905 and a 25 m ( 82 @.@ 0 ft ) female caught off Scotland sometime between 1908 and 1914 , while the longest reliably measured were three 20 @.@ 7 m ( 67 @.@ 9 ft ) males caught off Iceland in 1973 – 74 and a 22 @.@ 5 m ( 73 @.@ 8 ft ) female also caught off Iceland in 1975 . Mediterranean population are generally smaller , reaching just above 20 m ( 65 @.@ 6 ft ) at maximum , or may possibly up to 21 m ( 68 @.@ 9 ft ) - 23 m ( 75 @.@ 5 ft ) . 
 In the North Pacific , the longest reported were three 22 @.@ 9 m ( 75 @.@ 1 ft ) males , two caught off California between 1919 and 1926 and the other caught off Alaska in 1925 , and a 24 @.@ 7 m ( 81 @.@ 0 ft ) female also caught off California , while the longest reliably measured were a 21 m ( 68 @.@ 9 ft ) male caught off British Columbia in 1959 and a 22 @.@ 9 m ( 75 @.@ 1 ft ) female caught off central California between 1959 and 1970 . 
 In the Southern Hemisphere , the longest reported for each sex were 25 m ( 82 @.@ 0 ft ) and 27 @.@ 3 m ( 89 @.@ 6 ft ) , while the longest measured by Mackintosh and Wheeler ( 1929 ) were 22 @.@ 65 m ( 74 @.@ 3 ft ) and 24 @.@ 53 m ( 80 @.@ 5 ft ) . Major F. A. Spencer , while whaling inspector of the factory ship Southern Princess ( 1936 – 38 ) , confirmed the length of a 25 @.@ 9 m ( 85 @.@ 0 ft ) female caught in the Antarctic south of the southern Indian Ocean ; scientist David Edward Gaskin also measured a 25 @.@ 9 m ( 85 @.@ 0 ft ) female while whaling inspector of the British factory ship Southern Venturer in the Southern Ocean in the 1961 – 62 season . Terence Wise , who worked as a winch operator aboard the British factory ship Balaena , claimed that " the biggest fin [ he ] ever saw " was a 25 @.@ 6 m ( 84 @.@ 0 ft ) specimen caught near Bouvet Island in January 1958 . The largest fin whale ever weighed ( piecemeal ) was a 22 @.@ 7 m ( 74 @.@ 5 ft ) pregnant female caught by Japanese whalers in the Antarctic in 1948 which weighed 69 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 68 @.@ 4 long tons ; 76 @.@ 6 short tons ) , minus 6 % for loss of fluids during the flensing process . An individual over 27 m ( 88 @.@ 6 ft ) is estimated to weigh in excess of 120 tonnes ( 120 long tons ; 130 short tons ) . 
 A newborn fin whale measures about 6 @.@ 0 – 6 @.@ 5 m ( 20 – 21 ft ) in length and weighs about 1 @,@ 800 kilograms ( 4 @,@ 000 lb ) . 
 = = = Colouration and markings = = = 
 The fin whale is brownish to dark or light gray dorsally and white ventrally . The left side of the head is dark gray , while the right side exhibits a complex pattern of contrasting light and dark markings . On the right lower jaw is a white or light gray " right mandible patch " , which sometimes extends out as a light " blaze " laterally and dorsally unto the upper jaw and back to just behind the blowholes . Two narrow dark stripes originate from the eye and ear , the former widening into a large dark area on the shoulder — these are separated by a light area called the " <unk> wash " . These markings are more prominent on individuals in the North Atlantic than in the North Pacific , where they can appear indistinct . The left side exhibits similar but much fainter markings . Dark , oval @-@ shaped areas of pigment called " flipper shadows " extend below and posterior to the pectoral fins . This type of asymmetry is seen in Omura 's whale and occasionally in minke whales . It was thought to have evolved because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and it sometimes circles to the right while at the surface above a prey patch . However , the whales just as often circle to the left . No accepted hypothesis explains the asymmetry . It has paired blowholes on a prominent <unk> and a broad , flat , V @-@ shaped rostrum . A single median ridge stops well short of the rostrum tip . A light V @-@ shaped marking , the chevron , begins behind the blowholes and extends back and then forward again . The whale has a series of 56 – 100 pleats or grooves along the bottom of the body that run from the tip of the chin to the navel that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding . It has a curved , prominent dorsal fin that ranges in height from 26 – 75 cm ( 10 – 30 in ) ( usually 45 – 60 cm ( 18 – 24 in ) ) and averages about 51 cm ( 20 in ) , lying about three @-@ quarters of the way along the back . Its flippers are small and tapered and its tail is wide , pointed at the tip , and notched in the centre . 
 When the whale surfaces , the dorsal fin is visible soon after the spout . The spout is vertical and narrow and can reach heights of 6 m ( 20 ft ) or more .

 Fin whales have very stretchy nerves . 
 = = Life history = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Mating occurs in temperate , low @-@ latitude seas during the winter , followed by an 11- to 12 @-@ month gestation period . A newborn <unk> from its mother at 6 or 7 months of age when it is 11 to 12 m ( 36 to 39 ft ) in length , and the calf accompanies the mother to the summer feeding ground . Females reproduce every 2 or 3 years , with as many as six fetuses being reported , but single births are far more common . Females reach sexual maturity between 6 and 12 years of age at lengths of 17 @.@ 7 – 19 m ( 58 – 62 ft ) in the Northern Hemisphere and 20 m ( 66 ft ) in the Southern Hemisphere . 
 Full physical maturity is attained between 25 and 30 years . Fin whales live to 94 years of age , although specimens have been found aged at an estimated 135 – 140 years . 
 The fin whale is one of the fastest cetaceans and can sustain speeds between 37 km / h ( 23 mph ) and 41 km / h ( 25 mph ) and bursts up to 46 km / h ( 29 mph ) have been recorded , earning the fin whale the nickname " the greyhound of the sea " . 
 Fin whales are more gregarious than other rorquals , and often live in groups of 6 – 10 , although feeding groups may reach up to 100 animals . 
 = = = Vocalizations = = = 
 Like other whales , males make long , loud , low @-@ frequency sounds . The vocalizations of blue and fin whales are the lowest @-@ frequency sounds made by any animal . Most sounds are frequency @-@ modulated ( FM ) down @-@ swept infrasonic pulses from 16 to 40 hertz frequency ( the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz ) . Each sound lasts one to two seconds , and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each . The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days . The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184 – 186 decibels relative to 1 micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected hundreds of miles from their source . 
 When fin whale sounds were first recorded by US biologists , they did not realize that these unusually loud , long , pure and regular sounds were being made by whales . They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to equipment malfunction , geophysical phenomena , or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines . Eventually , biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of fin whales . 
 Direct association of these vocalizations with the reproductive season for the species and that only males make the sounds point to these vocalizations as possible reproductive displays . Over the past 100 years , the dramatic increase in ocean noise from shipping and naval activity may have slowed the recovery of the fin whale population , by impeding communications between males and receptive females . 
 = = = Breathing = = = 
 When feeding , they blow 5 – 7 times in quick succession , but while traveling or resting will blow once every minute or two . On their terminal ( last ) dive they arch their back high out of the water , but rarely raise their flukes out of the water . It then dives to depths of up to 470 metres ( 1 @,@ 540 ft ) when feeding or a few hundred feet when resting or traveling . The average feeding dive off California and Baja lasts 6 minutes , with a maximum of 17 minutes ; when traveling or resting they usually dive for only a few minutes at a time .

 = = = Range and habitat = = = 
 Like many large rorquals , the fin whale is a cosmopolitan species . It is found in all the world 's major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical . It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at both the north and south extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans , such as the Red Sea and the Baltic Sea . The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters . It is less densely populated in the warmest , equatorial regions . 
 The North Atlantic fin whale has an extensive distribution , occurring from the Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea , northward to Baffin Bay and Spitsbergen . In general , fin whales are more common north of approximately 30 ° N latitude , but considerable confusion arises about their occurrence south of 30 ° N latitude because of the difficulty in distinguishing fin whales from Bryde 's whales . Extensive ship surveys have led researchers to conclude that the summer feeding range of fin whales in the western North Atlantic is mainly between 41 ° <unk> and 51 ° <unk> , from shore seaward to the 1 @,@ 000 fathoms ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) contour . 
 Summer distribution of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan and as far north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean . They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern Bering Sea between May and October , with some movement through the Aleutian passes into and out of the Bering Sea . Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California , Oregon , British Columbia , and in the Gulf of Alaska . Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid @-@ May , and several winter sightings have been made there . Some researchers have suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter . 
 Although fin whales are certainly migratory , moving seasonally in and out of high @-@ latitude feeding areas , the overall migration pattern is not well understood . Acoustic readings from passive @-@ <unk> arrays indicate a southward migration of the North Atlantic fin whale occurs in the autumn from the Labrador @-@ Newfoundland region , south past Bermuda , and into the West Indies . One or more populations of fin whales are thought to remain year @-@ round in high latitudes , moving offshore , but not southward in late autumn . In the Pacific , migration patterns are poorly characterized . Although some fin whales are apparently present year @-@ round in the Gulf of California , there is a significant increase in their numbers in the winter and spring . Southern fin whales migrate seasonally from relatively high @-@ latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low @-@ latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter . The location of winter breeding areas is still unknown , since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean .

 North Atlantic fin whales are defined by the International Whaling Commission to exist in one of seven discrete population zones : Nova Scotia @-@ New England , Newfoundland @-@ Labrador , western Greenland , eastern Greenland @-@ Iceland , North Norway , West Norway @-@ Faroe Islands , and Ireland @-@ Spain @-@ United Kingdom @-@ Portugal . Results of mark @-@ and @-@ recapture surveys have indicated that some movement occurs across the boundaries of these zones , suggesting that they are not entirely discrete and that some immigration and emigration does occur . <unk> estimated in 1995 that total pre @-@ exploitation population size in the <unk> Atlantic ranged between 50 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 animals , but his research is criticized for lack of supporting data and an explanation of his reasoning . In 1977 , D.E. Sergeant suggested a " primeval " aggregate total of 30 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 throughout the North Atlantic . Of that number , 8 @,@ 000 to 9 @,@ 000 would have resided in the Newfoundland and Nova Scotia areas , with whales summering in U.S. waters south of Nova Scotia presumably omitted . J.M. <unk> estimated that the " exploitable " ( above the legal size limit of 50 ft ) component of the Nova Scotia population was 1 @,@ 500 to 1 @,@ 600 animals in 1964 , reduced to only about 325 in 1973 . Two aerial surveys in Canadian waters since the early 1970s gave numbers of 79 to 926 whales on the eastern Newfoundland @-@ Labrador shelf in August 1980 , and a few hundred in the northern and central Gulf of Saint Lawrence in August 1995 – 1996 . Summer estimates in the waters off western Greenland range between 500 and 2 @,@ 000 , and in 1974 , <unk> considered the fin whales off Western Norway and the Faroe Islands to " have been considerably depleted in postwar years , probably by overexploitation " . The population around Iceland appears to have fared much better , and in 1981 , appeared to have undergone only a minor decline since the early 1960s . Surveys during the summers of 1987 and 1989 estimated of 10 @,@ 000 to 11 @,@ 000 between eastern Greenland and Norway . This shows a substantial recovery when compared to a survey in 1976 showing an estimate of 6 @,@ 900 , which was considered to be a " slight " decline since 1948 . A Spanish <unk> survey in 1989 of the France @-@ Portugal @-@ Spain sub @-@ area estimated a summer population range at 17 @,@ 355 . The aggregate population level in the Mediterranean basin is estimated to be between 40 @,@ 000 and 56 @,@ 000 individuals . Satellite tracking revealed that those found in <unk> Sanctuary migrate southward to off Tunisia , Malta , Pantelleria , and Sicily , and also possibly winter off coastal southern Italy , Sardinia , within the Strait of Messina , Aeolian Islands , and off Libya , <unk> Islands , Lampedusa , and whales may recolonize out of the Ligurian Sea to other areas such as in Ionian and in Adriatic Sea . Biology of the species along southern and southeastern parts of the basin such as off Libya , Algeria , and northern Egypt , is unclear due to lacks of scientific approaches although whales have been confirmed off the <unk> of the basin such as along Levantine Sea including Israel , Lebanon , and Cyprus . Documented records within Turkish waters have been in very small numbers ; one sighting off Antalya in 1994 and 5 documented strandings as of 2016 . 
 Recently discovered , possible resident group exist in waters of Cape Verde Islands , uniquely being feasted by cookiecutter sharks . 
 = = = = North Pacific = = = = 
 The total historical North Pacific population was estimated at 42 @,@ 000 to 45 @,@ 000 before the start of whaling . Of this , the population in the eastern portion of the North Pacific was estimated to be 25 @,@ 000 to 27 @,@ 000 . By 1975 , the estimate had declined to between 8 @,@ 000 and 16 @,@ 000 . Surveys conducted in 1991 , 1993 , 1996 , and 2001 produced estimates between 1 @,@ 600 and 3 @,@ 200 off California and 280 and 380 off Oregon and Washington . The minimum estimate for the California @-@ Oregon @-@ Washington population , as defined in the U.S. Pacific Marine Mammal Stock Assessments : 2005 , is about 2 @,@ 500 . Surveys in coastal waters of British Columbia in summers 2004 and 2005 produced abundance estimates of approximately 500 animals . Surveys near the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea indicated a substantial increase in the local abundance of fin whales between 1975 – 1978 and 1987 – 1989 . In 1984 , the entire population was estimated to be less than 38 % of its historic carrying capacity . Fin whales might have started returning to the coastal waters off British Columbia ( a sighting occurred in Johnstone Strait in 2011 ) and Kodiak Island . Size of the local population migrating to Hawaiian Archipelago is unknown . Historically , several other wintering grounds were scattered in the North Pacific in the past , such as off the Northern Mariana Islands , Bonin Islands , and Ryukyu Islands ( for other possible habitats , see blue whale as their habitat preferences may correspond ) . 
 For Asian stocks , resident groups may exist in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea , and the Sea of Japan ( though these populations are critically endangered and the population off China , Korea , and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers ) . Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula , Abashiri , and Kushiro in Hokkaido , Tsushima , Sado Island , off <unk> in the Sea of Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats ( for coastal Sakhalin , as well ) . Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea . 
 Studies of historical catches suggest several resident groups once existed in the North Pacific - the Baja California group and the Yellow Sea – East China Sea ( including Ryukyu Islands and western <unk> ) group . Additionally , respective groups in northern Sea of Japan and the group along Pacific coasts of Japan from Hokkaido to Sanriku might have been resident or less migratory , as well . Recent sightings of large whales exceeding 20 m in length , likely to be fin whales , as blue whales in coastal northeast Asia are considered to be extinct , indicate that remnants of the Sea of Japan or the Yellow – <unk> Sea groups still pass through the Tsushima Strait where all the larger cetaceans are under threats of being struck by high @-@ speed vessels . Southward migrations to Taiwan or East and South China Seas may still occur , but the whole scale of current migrations along Eurasian continent including population size is unclear . The only modern record among Ryukyu Islands was of a rotten carcass beached on Ishigaki Island in 2005 . 
 There had been congregation areas among Sea of Japan to Yellow Sea such as in East Korea Bay , along eastern coasts of Korean Peninsula , and Ulleungdo , although recent occurrences into these locations are of unclear due to locational disorders . 
 Fin whales in Yellow Sea could have been a unique form from outer Pacific populations due to their smaller size of around 20m or more at near maximum , and breeding season in these regions was mainly in winter . 
 Modern sightings around Commander Islands have been annual but not in great numbers , and whales likely to migrate through the areas rather than summering . Possibilities of whales seen in Commander Islands might mix with other populations among Asian and eastern Pacific populations has been considered .

 Very little information has been revealed about the ecology of current migration from Antarctic waters are unknown , but small increases in sighting rates are confirmed off New Zealand , such as off Kaikoura , and wintering grounds may exist in further north such as in Papua New Guinea , Fiji , and off East Timor . <unk> in Rarotonga have been increased recently where interactions with humpback whales occur on occasions . <unk> are also relatively abundant along the coast of Peru and Chile ( in Chile , most notably off Los Lagos region such as Gulf of Corcovado in Chiloé National Park , Punta de <unk> , port of <unk> , and Caleta Zorra . Year @-@ round confirmations indicate possible residents off pelagic north eastern to central Chile such as around coastal Caleta <unk> and <unk> de Humboldt National Reserve , east of Juan Fernández Islands , and northeast of Easter Island and possible wintering ground exist for eastern south Pacific population . They are known to make mixed groups with other rorquals such as blue whales and sei whales . Their recovery is confirmed vicinity to various subantarctic islands such as South Georgia and Falkland , but unknown in other historical habitats including Campbell Island , Kermadec to Chatham Islands , Tristan da Cunha , and Gough Island .

 Relatively little is known about the historical and current population levels of the Southern fin whale . The IWC officially estimates that the Southern Hemisphere pre @-@ whaling population was 400 @,@ 000 whales and that the population in 1979 ( at the cessation of Antarctic large scale whaling ) was 85 @,@ 200 . Both the current and historical estimates should be considered as poor estimates because the methodology and data used in the study are known to be flawed . Other estimates cite current size to be between 15 @,@ 000 ( 1983 ) and 38 @,@ 000 ( 1997 ) . As of 2006 , there is no scientifically accepted estimate of current population or trends in abundance . 
 = = = Predation = = = 
 The only known predator of the fin whale is the killer whale , with at least 20 eyewitness and second @-@ hand accounts of attack or harassment . They usually flee and offer little resistance to attack . Only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred . In October 2005 , 16 killer whales attacked and killed a fin whale in the Canal de <unk> , Gulf of California , after chasing it for about an hour . They fed on its sinking carcass for about 15 minutes before leaving the area . In June 2012 , a pod of killer whales was seen in La Paz Bay , in the Gulf of California , chasing a fin whale for over an hour before finally killing it and feeding on its carcass . The whale bore numerous tooth rakes over its back and dorsal fin ; several killer whales flanked it on either side , with one individual visible under water biting at its right lower jaw . In July 1908 , a whaler reportedly saw two killer whales attack and kill a fin whale off western Greenland . In January 1984 , seven were seen from the air circling , holding the flippers , and ramming a fin whale in the Gulf of California , but the observation ended at nightfall . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The fin whale is a filter @-@ feeder , feeding on small schooling fish , squid and crustaceans including copepods and krill . 
 In the North Pacific , they feed on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia , Thysanoessa , and Nyctiphanes , large copepods in the genus Neocalanus , small schooling fish ( e.g. the genera Engraulis , Mallotus , Clupea , and <unk> ) , and squid . Based on stomach content analysis of over 19 @,@ 500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971 , 64 @.@ 1 % contained only krill , 25 @.@ 5 % copepods , 5 @.@ 0 % fish , 3 @.@ 4 % krill and copepods and 1 @.@ 7 % squid . <unk> ( 1959 ) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958 , found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka . In the northern Bering Sea ( north of 58 ° N ) , their main prey species were capelin ( Mallotus villosus ) , Alaska pollock ( <unk> <unk> ) and Pacific herring ( Clupea pallasii ) ; they also consumed saffron cod ( <unk> gracilis ) . Arctic krill ( Thysanoessa raschii ) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea . Off Kamchatka , they appeared to primarily feed on herring . They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in <unk> Bay off northeast Kamchatka , areas where the species was abundant . Five species of euphausiid ( Euphausia pacifica , Thysanoessa spinifera , T. inermis , T. raschii , and T. longipes ) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska . Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area , with euphausiids ( T. longipes , T. inermis , and T. raschii ) and copepods ( Neocalanus <unk> and N. cristatus ) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid ( Todarodes pacificus pacificus ) and small schooling fish ( e.g. Pacific saury , <unk> saira ; and Japanese anchovy , Engraulis japonicus ) dominating the diet in the southern area . 
 Of the fin whale stomachs sampled off British Columbia between 1963 and 1967 , euphausiids dominated the diet for four of the five years ( 82 @.@ 3 to 100 % of the diet ) , while copepods only formed a major portion of the diet in 1965 ( 35 @.@ 7 % ) . Miscellaneous fish , squid , and octopus played only a very minor part of the diet in two of the five years ( 3 @.@ 6 to 4 @.@ 8 % ) . Fin whales caught off California between 1959 and 1970 fed on the pelagic euphausiid Euphausia pacifica ( 86 % of sampled individuals ) , the more neritic euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera ( 9 % ) , and the northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax ) ( 7 % ) ; only trace amounts ( < 0 @.@ 5 % each ) were found of Pacific saury ( C. saira ) and juvenile rockfish ( Sebastes jordani ) . In the Gulf of California , they have been observed feeding on swarms of the euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex . 
 In the North Atlantic , they prey on euphausiids in the genera Meganyctiphanes , Thysanoessa and Nyctiphanes and small schooling fish ( e.g. the genera Clupea , Mallotus , and Ammodytes ) . Of the 1 @,@ 609 fin whale stomachs examined at the Hvalfjörður whaling station in southwestern Iceland from 1967 to 1989 ( caught between June and September ) , 96 % contained only krill , 2 @.@ 5 % krill and fish , 0 @.@ 8 % some fish remains , 0 @.@ 7 % capelin ( M. villosus ) , and 0 @.@ 1 % <unk> ( family <unk> ) ; a small proportion of ( mainly juvenile ) blue whiting ( <unk> <unk> ) were also found . Of the krill sampled between 1979 and 1989 , the vast majority ( over 99 % ) was northern krill ( Meganyctiphanes norvegica ) ; only one stomach contained Thysanoessa <unk> . Off West Greenland , 75 % of the fin whales caught between July and October had consumed krill ( family <unk> ) , 17 % capelin ( Mallotus ) and 8 % sand lance ( Ammodytes sp . ) . Off eastern Newfoundland , they chiefly feed on capelin , but also take small quantities of euphausiids ( mostly T. raschii and T. inermis ) . In the Ligurian @-@ Corsican @-@ Provençal Basin in the Mediterranean Sea they make dives as deep as 470 metres ( 1 @,@ 540 ft ) to feed on the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica , while off the island of Lampedusa , between Tunisia and Sicily , they have been observed in mid @-@ winter feeding on surface swarms of the small euphausiid Nyctiphanes <unk> . 
 In the Southern Hemisphere , they feed almost exclusively on euphausiids ( mainly the genera Euphausia and Thysanoessa ) , as well as taking small amounts of amphipods ( e.g. Themisto <unk> ) and various species of fish . Of the more than 16 @,@ 000 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Hemisphere between 1961 and 1965 that contained food in their stomachs , 99 @.@ 4 % fed on euphausiids , 0 @.@ 5 % on fish , and 0 @.@ 1 % on amphipods . In the Southern Ocean they mainly consume E. superba . 
 The animal feeds by opening its jaws while swimming at some 11 kilometres per hour ( 6 @.@ 8 mph ) in one study , which causes it to engulf up to 70 cubic metres ( 18 @,@ 000 US gal ; 15 @,@ 000 imp gal ) of water in one gulp . It then closes its jaws and pushes the water back out of its mouth through its baleen , which allows the water to leave while trapping the prey . An adult has between 262 and 473 baleen plates on each side of the mouth . Each plate is made of keratin that frays out into fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the tongue . Each plate can measure up to 76 centimetres ( 30 in ) in length and 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) in width . 
 The whale routinely dives to depths of more than 200 metres ( 660 ft ) where it executes an average of four " lunges " , to accumulate krill . Each gulp provides the whale with approximately 10 kilograms ( 22 lb ) of food . One whale can consume up to 1 @,@ 800 kilograms ( 4 @,@ 000 lb ) of food a day , leading scientists to conclude that the whale spends about three hours a day feeding to meet its energy requirements , roughly the same as humans . If prey patches are not sufficiently dense , or are located too deep in the water , the whale has to spend a larger portion of its day searching for food . One hunting technique is to circle schools of fish at high speed , frightening the fish into a tight ball , then turning on its side before engulfing the massed prey . 
 = = = Pathology = = = 
 Fin whales suffer from a number of pathological conditions . The parasitic copepod <unk> <unk> — usually found on the flank of fin whales — burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood , while the pseudo @-@ stalked barnacle <unk> <unk> is generally found more often on the dorsal fin , pectoral fins , and flukes . 
 Other barnacles found on fin whales include the acorn barnacle <unk> reginae and the stalked barnacle <unk> <unk> , which attaches to <unk> or the baleen . The <unk> copepod <unk> unisetus ( heavy infestations of which have been found in fin whales caught off northwestern Spain ) and the ciliate <unk> also infest the baleen , the former feeding on the baleen itself and the latter on red blood cells . 
 The remora Remora australis and occasionally the amphipod <unk> <unk> can also be found on fin whales , both feeding on the skin . <unk> of the giant nematode <unk> <unk> can cause inflammation of the renal arteries and potential kidney failure , while the smaller C. <unk> infects the lower urinary tract . 
 An emaciated 13 m ( 43 ft ) female fin whale , which stranded along the Belgian coast in 1997 , was found to be infected with lesions of Morbillivirus . In January 2011 , a 16 @.@ 7 m ( 55 ft ) emaciated adult male fin whale stranded dead on the Tyrrhenian coastline of Italy was found to be infected with Morbillivirus and the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii , as well as carrying heavy loads of organochlorine pollutants .

 In the 19th century , the fin whale was occasionally hunted by open @-@ boat whalers , but it was relatively safe , because it could easily outrun ships of the time and often sank when killed , making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers . However , the later introduction of steam @-@ powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale . As other whale species became overhunted , the whaling industry turned to the still @-@ abundant fin whale as a substitute . It was primarily hunted for its blubber , oil , and baleen . Around 704 @,@ 000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975 . 
 The introduction of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially increased the number of whales taken per year . In 1937 – 38 alone , over 29 @,@ 000 fin whales were taken . From 1953 – 54 to 1961 – 62 , the catch averaged over 30 @,@ 000 per year . By 1962 – 63 , sei whale catches began to increase as fin whales became scarce . By 1975 – 76 , fewer than 1 @,@ 000 fin whales were being caught each year . In the North Pacific , over 74 @,@ 000 fin whales were caught between 1910 and 1975 . Between 1910 and 1989 , over 55 @,@ 000 were caught in the North Atlantic . Coastal groups in northeast Asian waters , along with many other baleen species , were likely driven into serious perils or functional extinctions by industrial catches by Japan covering wide ranges of China and Korean EEZ within very short period in 20th century . Migrations of the species into Japanese EEZ and in East China Sea were likely to be exterminated relatively earlier , as the last catch records on Amami Oshima was between the 1910s and 1930s . After the cease of exploiting Asian stocks , Japan kept mass commercial and illegal hunts until 1975 . Several thousand individuals were hunted from various stations mainly along coasts of <unk> , Sanriku , and the Gotō Islands . 
 The IWC prohibited hunting in the Southern Hemisphere in 1976 . The Soviet Union engaged in the illegal killing of protected whale species in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere , over @-@ reporting fin whale catches to cover up illegal takes of other species . In the North Pacific , they reported taking over 10 @,@ 000 fin whales between 1961 – 79 , while the true catch was less than 9 @,@ 000 . In the Southern Hemisphere , they reported taking nearly 53 @,@ 000 between 1948 and 1973 , when the true total was a little over 41 @,@ 000 . The fin whale was given full protection from commercial whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific in 1976 , and in the North Atlantic in 1987 , with small exceptions for aboriginal catches and catches for research purposes . All populations worldwide remain listed as endangered species by the US National Marine Fisheries Service and the International Conservation Union Red List . The fin whale is on Appendix 1 of CITES . 
 The IWC has set a quota of 19 fin whales per year for Greenland . Meat and other products from whales killed in these hunts are widely marketed within Greenland , but export is illegal . Iceland and Norway are not bound by the IWC 's moratorium on commercial whaling because both countries filed objections to it . 
 In October 2006 , Iceland 's fisheries ministry authorized the hunting of 9 fin whales through August 2007 . In 2009 and 2010 , Iceland caught 125 and 148 fin whales , respectively . An Icelandic company , <unk> , caught over a hundred fin whales in 2014 , and exported a record quantity of <unk> tonnes in a single shipment in 2014 . Since 2006 , <unk> has caught more than 500 fin whales and exported more than 5000 tonnes of whale meat to Japan . 
 In the Southern Hemisphere , Japan permits annual takes of 10 fin whales under its Antarctic Special Permit whaling program for the 2005 – 2006 and 2006 – 2007 seasons . The proposal for 2007 – 2008 and the subsequent 12 seasons allows taking 50 per year . While 10 fin whales were caught in the 2005 – 06 season and three in the 2006 – 07 season , none was caught in the 2007 – 2008 season . A single fin whale was caught in both the 2008 – 09 and 2009 – 10 seasons , two were taken in the 2010 – 11 season , and one was taken in the 2011 – 12 season . 
 Not only humpback , minkes , sperm , and many other smaller Odontoceti , but also including critically endangered species such as North Pacific right , western gray , and Northern fin whales have been targets of illegal captures using harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets , and later reports to administrative organs or research institutions as cases of ' entanglements where fishermen tried their best to save whales ' . Protected species ' meats can also be found on markets even today which are mostly " byproducts " of entanglements , and one case scientifically revealed that at least some humpbacks with other species were illegally hunted in EEZ of antiwhaling nations such as off Mexico or South Africa , and tried to import into Japan by hiring vessels from other countries and even trying to go on overland routes within other nations . 
 = = = Ship interaction = = = 
 Collisions with ships are a major cause of mortality . In some areas , they cause a substantial portion of large whale strandings . Most serious injuries are caused by large , fast @-@ moving ships over or near continental shelves . 
 A 60 @-@ ft @-@ long fin whale was found stuck on the bow of a container ship in New York harbor on 12 April 2014 .

 Fin whales are regularly encountered on whale @-@ watching excursions worldwide . In the Southern California Bight , fin whales are encountered year @-@ round , with the best sightings between November and March . They can even be seen from land ( for example , from Point Vicente , Palos Verdes , where they can be seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half mile to a few miles offshore ) . They are regularly sighted in the summer and fall in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , the Gulf of Maine , the Bay of Fundy , the Bay of Biscay , Strait of Gibraltar , the Mediterranean . In southern Ireland , they are seen inshore from June to February , with peak sightings in November and December . Cruise ships en route to and from the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes encounter fin whales in the Drake Passage . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The fin whale is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( CMS ) . It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of its range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals , conserving or restoring the places where they live , mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them . 
 It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co @-@ operation organised by tailored agreements . In addition , the fin whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea , Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area ( ACCOBAMS ) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region ( Pacific Cetaceans MOU ) . 
 = Mary , Queen of Scots = 
 Mary , Queen of Scots ( 8 December 1542 – 8 February 1587 ) , also known as Mary Stuart or Mary I of Scotland , was Queen of Scotland from 14 December 1542 to 24 July 1567 and Queen consort of France from 10 July 1559 to 5 December 1560 . 
 Mary , the only surviving legitimate child of King James V of Scotland , was six days old when her father died and she acceded to the throne . She spent most of her childhood in France while Scotland was ruled by regents , and in 1558 , she married the Dauphin of France , Francis . He ascended the French throne as King Francis II in 1559 , and Mary briefly became queen consort of France , until his death in December 1560 . Widowed , Mary returned to Scotland , arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561 . Four years later , she married her first cousin , Henry Stuart , Lord Darnley , but their union was unhappy . In February 1567 , his residence was destroyed by an explosion , and Darnley was found murdered in the garden . 
 James Hepburn , 4th Earl of Bothwell , was generally believed to have orchestrated Darnley 's death , but he was acquitted of the charge in April 1567 , and the following month he married Mary . Following an uprising against the couple , Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle . On 24 July 1567 , she was forced to abdicate in favour of James , her one @-@ year @-@ old son by Darnley . After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne , she fled southwards seeking the protection of her first cousin once removed , Queen Elizabeth I of England . Mary had previously claimed Elizabeth 's throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign of England by many English Catholics , including participants in a rebellion known as the Rising of the North . Perceiving her as a threat , Elizabeth had her confined in various castles and manor houses in the interior of England . After eighteen and a half years in custody , Mary was found guilty of plotting to assassinate Elizabeth , and was subsequently beheaded . 
 = = Childhood and early reign = = 
 Mary was born on 7 or 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow , Scotland , to James V , King of Scots , and his French second wife , Mary of Guise . She was said to have been born prematurely and was the only legitimate child of James to survive him . She was the great @-@ niece of King Henry VIII of England , as her paternal grandmother , Margaret Tudor , was Henry VIII 's sister . On 14 December , six days after her birth , she became Queen of Scots when her father died , perhaps from the effects of a nervous collapse following the Battle of Solway Moss , or from drinking contaminated water while on campaign . 
 A popular legend , first recorded by John Knox , states that James , hearing on his deathbed that his wife had given birth to a daughter , ruefully exclaimed , " It cam wi ' a lass and it will gang wi ' a lass ! " His House of Stewart had gained the throne of Scotland by the marriage of Marjorie Bruce , daughter of Robert the Bruce , to Walter Stewart , 6th High Steward of Scotland . The crown had come to his family through a woman , and would be lost from his family through a woman . This legendary statement came true much later — not through Mary , but through her descendant Queen Anne . 
 Mary was baptised at the nearby Church of St Michael shortly after she was born . Rumours spread that she was weak and frail , but an English diplomat , Ralph Sadler , saw the infant at Linlithgow Palace in March 1543 , unwrapped by her nurse , and wrote , " it is as goodly a child as I have seen of her age , and as like to live . " 
 As Mary was an infant when she inherited the throne , Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult . From the outset , there were two claims to the Regency : one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton , and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran , who was next in line to the throne . Beaton 's claim was based on a version of the late king 's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery . Arran , with the support of his friends and relations , became the regent until 1554 when Mary 's mother managed to remove and succeed him . 
 = = = Treaty of Greenwich = = = 
 King Henry VIII of England took the opportunity of the regency to propose marriage between Mary and his own son , Prince Edward , hoping for a union of Scotland and England . On 1 July 1543 , when Mary was six months old , the Treaty of Greenwich was signed , which promised that at the age of ten Mary would marry Edward and move to England , where Henry could oversee her upbringing . The treaty provided that the two countries would remain legally separate and that if the couple should fail to have children the temporary union would dissolve . However , Cardinal Beaton rose to power again and began to push a pro @-@ Catholic pro @-@ French agenda , which angered Henry , who wanted to break the Scottish alliance with France . Beaton wanted to move Mary away from the coast to the safety of Stirling Castle . Regent Arran resisted the move , but backed down when Beaton 's armed supporters gathered at Linlithgow . The Earl of Lennox escorted Mary and her mother to Stirling on 27 July 1543 with 3 @,@ 500 armed men . Mary was crowned in the castle chapel on 9 September 1543 , with " such solemnity as they do use in this country , which is not very costly " according to the report of Ralph Sadler and Henry Ray . 
 Shortly before Mary 's coronation , Scottish merchants headed for France were arrested by Henry , and their goods impounded . The arrests caused anger in Scotland , and Arran joined Beaton and became a Catholic . The Treaty of Greenwich was rejected by the Parliament of Scotland in December . The rejection of the marriage treaty and the renewal of the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland prompted Henry 's " Rough Wooing " , a military campaign designed to impose the marriage of Mary to his son . English forces mounted a series of raids on Scottish and French territory . In May 1544 , the English Earl of Hertford ( later Duke of Somerset ) raided Edinburgh , and the Scots took Mary to Dunkeld for safety . 
 In May 1546 , Beaton was murdered by Protestant lairds , and on 10 September 1547 , nine months after the death of Henry VIII , the Scots suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh . Mary 's guardians , fearful for her safety , sent her to Inchmahome Priory for no more than three weeks , and turned to the French for help . 
 The French king , Henry II , proposed to unite France and Scotland by marrying the young queen to his three @-@ year @-@ old son , the Dauphin Francis . On the promise of French military help , and a French dukedom for himself , Arran agreed to the marriage . In February 1548 , Mary was moved , again for her safety , to Dumbarton Castle . The English left a trail of devastation behind once more and seized the strategic town of Haddington . In June , the much awaited French help arrived at Leith to besiege and ultimately take Haddington . On 7 July 1548 , a Scottish Parliament held at a nunnery near the town agreed to a French marriage treaty . 
 = = = Life in France = = = 
 With her marriage agreement in place , five @-@ year @-@ old Mary was sent to France to spend the next thirteen years at the French court . The French fleet sent by Henry II , commanded by Nicolas de <unk> , sailed with Mary from Dumbarton on 7 August 1548 and arrived a week or more later at Roscoff or Saint @-@ Pol @-@ de @-@ Léon in Brittany . 
 Mary was accompanied by her own court including two illegitimate half @-@ brothers , and the " four Marys " , four girls her own age , all named Mary , who were the daughters of some of the noblest families in Scotland : Beaton , Seton , Fleming , and Livingston . Janet , Lady Fleming , who was Mary Fleming 's mother and James V 's half @-@ sister , was appointed governess . 
 <unk> , beautiful , and clever ( according to contemporary accounts ) , Mary had a promising childhood . At the French court , she was a favourite with everyone , except Henry II 's wife Catherine de ' Medici . Mary learned to play lute and virginals , was competent in prose , poetry , horsemanship , falconry and needlework , and was taught French , Italian , Latin , Spanish , and Greek , in addition to speaking her native Scots . Her future sister @-@ in @-@ law , Elisabeth of Valois , became a close friend of whom Mary " retained nostalgic memories in later life " . Her maternal grandmother , Antoinette de Bourbon , was another strong influence on her childhood , and acted as one of her principal advisors . 
 Portraits of Mary show that she had a small , oval @-@ shaped head , a long , graceful neck , bright auburn hair , hazel @-@ brown eyes , under heavy lowered eyelids and finely arched brows , smooth pale skin , a high forehead , and regular , firm features . She was considered a pretty child and later , as a woman , strikingly attractive . At some point in her infancy or childhood , she caught smallpox , but it did not mark her features . 
 Mary was eloquent and especially tall by sixteenth @-@ century standards ( she attained an adult height of 5 feet 11 inches or 1 @.@ 80 m ) , while Henry II 's son and heir , Francis , stuttered and was abnormally short . Henry commented that " from the very first day they met , my son and she got on as well together as if they had known each other for a long time " . On 4 April 1558 , Mary signed a secret agreement bequeathing Scotland and her claim to England to the French crown if she died without issue . Twenty days later , she married the Dauphin at Notre Dame de Paris , and Francis became king consort of Scotland . 
 = = = Claim to the English throne = = = 
 In November 1558 , Henry VIII 's elder daughter , Queen Mary I of England , was succeeded by her only surviving sibling , Elizabeth I. Under the Third Succession Act , passed in 1543 by the Parliament of England , Elizabeth was recognised as her sister 's heir , and Henry VIII 's last will and testament had excluded the Stuarts from succeeding to the English throne . Yet , in the eyes of many Catholics , Elizabeth was illegitimate , and Mary Stuart , as the senior descendant of Henry VIII 's elder sister , was the rightful queen of England . Henry II of France proclaimed his eldest son and daughter @-@ in @-@ law king and queen of England , and in France the royal arms of England were quartered with those of Francis and Mary . Mary 's claim to the English throne was a perennial sticking point between her and Elizabeth I. 
 When Henry II died on 10 July 1559 from injuries sustained in a joust , fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Francis became King of France , with Mary , aged sixteen , as his queen consort . Two of Mary 's uncles , the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal of Lorraine , were now dominant in French politics , enjoying an ascendancy called by some historians la <unk> <unk> . 
 In Scotland , the power of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation was rising at the expense of Mary 's mother , Mary of Guise , who maintained effective control only through the use of French troops . The Protestant Lords invited English troops into Scotland in an attempt to secure Protestantism , and a Huguenot rising in France , called the Tumult of Amboise , in March 1560 made it impossible for the French to send further support . Instead , the Guise brothers sent ambassadors to negotiate a settlement . On 11 June 1560 , their sister Mary of Guise died , and so the question of future Franco @-@ Scots relations was a pressing one . Under the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh , signed by Mary 's representatives on 6 July 1560 , France and England undertook to withdraw troops from Scotland and France recognised Elizabeth 's right to rule England . However , the seventeen @-@ year @-@ old Mary , still in France and grieving for her mother , refused to ratify the treaty . 
 = = Return to Scotland = = 
 King Francis II died on 5 December 1560 , of a middle ear infection which led to an abscess in his brain . Mary was grief @-@ stricken . Her mother @-@ in @-@ law , Catherine de ' Medici , became regent for the late king 's ten @-@ year @-@ old brother Charles IX , who inherited the French throne . 
 Mary returned to Scotland nine months after her husband 's death , arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561 . Having lived in France since the age of five , Mary had little direct experience of the dangerous and complex political situation in Scotland . As a devout Catholic , she was regarded with suspicion by many of her subjects , as well as by Elizabeth , her father 's cousin . Scotland was torn between Catholic and Protestant factions , and Mary 's illegitimate half @-@ brother , the Earl of Moray , was a leader of the Protestants . The Protestant reformer John Knox preached against Mary , condemning her for hearing Mass , dancing , and dressing too elaborately . She summoned him to her presence to remonstrate with him unsuccessfully , and later charged him with treason , but he was acquitted and released . 
 To the disappointment of the Catholic party , however , Mary tolerated the newly established Protestant ascendancy , and kept her half @-@ brother Lord Moray as her chief advisor . Her privy council of 16 men , appointed on 6 September 1561 , retained those who already held the offices of state and was dominated by the Protestant leaders from the reformation crisis of 1559 – 1560 : the Earls of Argyll , Glencairn , and Moray . Only four of the councillors were Catholic : the Earls of Atholl , Erroll , Montrose , and Huntly , who was Lord Chancellor . Modern historian Jenny Wormald found this remarkable , suggesting that Mary 's failure to appoint a council sympathetic to Catholic and French interests was an indication of her focus on the goal of the English throne over the internal problems of Scotland . Even the one significant later addition to the council , in December 1563 , Lord Ruthven , was another Protestant whom Mary personally disliked . In this , she was acknowledging her lack of effective military power in the face of the Protestant lords , while also following a policy which strengthened her links with England . She joined with Lord Moray in the destruction of Scotland 's leading Catholic magnate , Lord Huntly , in 1562 after he led a rebellion in the Highlands against her . 
 Mary sent William Maitland of Lethington as an ambassador to the English court to put the case for Mary as the heir presumptive to the English throne . Elizabeth refused to name a potential heir , fearing that to do so would invite conspiracy to displace her with the nominated successor . However , Elizabeth assured Maitland that she knew no one with a better claim than Mary . In late 1561 and early 1562 , arrangements were made for the two queens to meet in England at York or Nottingham in August or September 1562 , but Elizabeth sent Sir Henry Sidney to cancel in July because of the civil war in France . 
 Mary turned her attention to finding a new husband from the royalty of Europe . However , when her uncle , the Cardinal of Lorraine , began negotiations with Archduke Charles of Austria without her consent , she angrily objected and the negotiations foundered . Her own attempt to negotiate a marriage to Don Carlos , the mentally unstable heir apparent of King Philip II of Spain , was rebuffed by Philip . Elizabeth attempted to neutralise Mary by suggesting that she marry English Protestant Robert Dudley , 1st Earl of Leicester ( Sir Henry Sidney 's brother @-@ in @-@ law and the English queen 's own favourite ) , whom Elizabeth trusted and thought she could control . She sent an ambassador , Thomas Randolph , to tell Mary that if she would marry an English nobleman , Elizabeth would " proceed to the inquisition of her right and title to be our next cousin and heir " . The proposal came to nothing , not least because the intended bridegroom was unwilling . 
 In contrast , a French poet at Mary 's court , Pierre de <unk> de Chastelard , was apparently besotted by Mary . In early 1563 , he was discovered during a security search hidden underneath her bed , apparently planning to surprise her when she was alone and declare his love for her . Mary was horrified and banished him from Scotland . He ignored the edict , and two days later he forced his way into her chamber as she was about to disrobe . She reacted with fury and fear , and when Moray rushed into the room , in reaction to her cries for help , she shouted , " Thrust your dagger into the villain ! " , which Moray refused to do , as Chastelard was already under restraint . Chastelard was tried for treason , and beheaded . Maitland claimed that Chastelard 's ardour was feigned , and that he was part of a Huguenot plot to discredit Mary by tarnishing her reputation . 
 = = Marriage to Lord Darnley = = 
 Mary had briefly met her English @-@ born first cousin Henry Stuart , Lord Darnley , in February 1561 when she was in mourning for Francis . Darnley 's parents , the Earl and Countess of Lennox , who were Scottish aristocrats as well as English landowners , had sent him to France ostensibly to extend their condolences while hoping for a potential match between their son and Mary . Both Mary and Darnley were grandchildren of Margaret Tudor , sister of Henry VIII of England , and patrilineal descendants of the High Stewards of Scotland . Darnley shared a more recent Stewart lineage with the Hamilton family as a descendant of Mary Stewart , Countess of Arran , a daughter of James II of Scotland . They next met on Saturday 17 February 1565 at Wemyss Castle in Scotland , after which Mary fell in love with the " long lad " ( as Queen Elizabeth called him — he was over six feet tall ) . They married at Holyrood Palace on 29 July 1565 , even though both were Catholic and a papal dispensation for the marriage of first cousins had not been obtained . 
 English statesmen William Cecil and the Earl of Leicester had worked to obtain Darnley 's licence to travel to Scotland from his home in England . Although her advisors had thus brought the couple together , Elizabeth felt threatened by the marriage , because as descendants of her aunt , both Mary and Darnley were claimants to the English throne and their children , if any , would inherit an even stronger , combined claim . However , Mary 's insistence on the marriage seems to have stemmed from passion rather than calculation . The English ambassador Nicholas Throckmorton stated " the saying is that surely she [ Queen Mary ] is bewitched " , adding that the marriage could only be averted " by violence " . The union infuriated Elizabeth , who felt the marriage should not have gone ahead without her permission , as Darnley was both her cousin and an English subject . 
 Mary 's marriage to a leading Catholic precipitated Mary 's half @-@ brother , the Earl of Moray , to join with other Protestant lords , including Lords Argyll and Glencairn , in open rebellion . Mary set out from Edinburgh on 26 August 1565 to confront them , and on the 30th Moray entered Edinburgh , but left soon afterward having failed to take the castle . Mary returned to Edinburgh the following month to raise more troops . In what became known as the <unk> Raid , Mary and her forces and Moray and the rebellious lords roamed around Scotland without ever engaging in direct combat . Mary 's numbers were boosted by the release and restoration to favour of Lord Huntly 's son , and the return of James Hepburn , 4th Earl of Bothwell , from exile in France . Unable to muster sufficient support , in October Moray left Scotland for asylum in England . Mary broadened her privy council , bringing in both Catholics ( Bishop of Ross John Lesley and provost of Edinburgh Simon Preston of Craigmillar ) and Protestants ( the new Lord Huntly , Bishop of Galloway Alexander Gordon , John Maxwell of <unk> and Sir James Balfour ) . 
 Before long , Darnley grew arrogant . Not content with his position as king consort , he demanded the Crown Matrimonial , which would have made him a co @-@ sovereign of Scotland with the right to keep the Scottish throne for himself if he outlived his wife . Mary refused his request , and their marriage grew strained even though they conceived by October 1565 . He was jealous of her friendship with her Catholic private secretary , David Rizzio , who was rumoured to be the father of her child . By March 1566 , Darnley had entered into a secret conspiracy with Protestant lords , including the nobles who had rebelled against Mary in the <unk> Raid . On 9 March , a group of the conspirators , accompanied by Darnley , murdered Rizzio in front of the pregnant Mary at a dinner party in Holyrood Palace . Over the next two days , a disillusioned Darnley switched sides , and Mary received Moray at Holyrood . On the night of 11 – 12 March , Darnley and Mary escaped from the palace , and took temporary refuge in Dunbar Castle before returning to Edinburgh on 18 March . The former rebels Lords Moray , Argyll and Glencairn were restored to the council . 
 = = = Murder of Darnley = = = 
 Mary 's son by Darnley , James , was born on 19 June 1566 in Edinburgh Castle , but the murder of Rizzio led inevitably to the breakdown of her marriage . In October 1566 , while staying at Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders , Mary made a journey on horseback of at least four hours each way to visit the Earl of Bothwell at Hermitage Castle , where he lay ill from wounds sustained in a skirmish with border <unk> . The ride was later used as evidence by Mary 's enemies that the two were lovers , though no suspicions were voiced at the time and Mary had been accompanied by her councillors and guards . Immediately after her return to Jedburgh , she suffered a serious illness that included frequent vomiting , loss of sight , loss of speech , convulsions and periods of unconsciousness . She was thought to be near death or dying . Her recovery from 25 October onwards was credited to the skill of her French physicians . The cause of her illness is unknown ; diagnoses include physical exhaustion and mental stress , haemorrhage of a gastric ulcer , and porphyria . 
 At Craigmillar Castle , near Edinburgh , at the end of November 1566 , Mary and leading nobles held a meeting to discuss the " problem of Darnley " . Divorce was discussed , but then a bond was probably sworn between the lords present to remove Darnley by other means : " It was thought expedient and most profitable for the common wealth ... that such a young fool and proud tyrant should not reign or bear rule over them ; ... that he should be put off by one way or another ; and whosoever should take the deed in hand or do it , they should defend . " Darnley feared for his safety and after the baptism of his son at Stirling shortly before Christmas , he went to Glasgow to stay on his father 's estates . At the start of the journey , he was afflicted by a fever , possibly smallpox , syphilis , or the result of poison , and he remained ill for some weeks . 
 In late January 1567 , Mary prompted her husband to return to Edinburgh . He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o ' Field , just within the city wall . Mary visited him daily , so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress . On the night of 9 – 10 February 1567 , Mary visited her husband in the early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household , Bastian Pagez . In the early hours of the morning , an explosion devastated Kirk o ' Field , and Darnley was found dead in the garden , apparently smothered . There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body . Bothwell , Moray , Secretary Maitland , the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion . Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours , " I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not ... tell you what all the world is thinking . Men say that , instead of seizing the murderers , you are looking through your fingers while they escape ; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure , as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity . For myself , I beg you to believe that I would not harbour such a thought . " 
 By the end of February , Bothwell was generally believed to be guilty of Darnley 's assassination . Lennox , Darnley 's father , demanded that Bothwell be tried before the Estates of Parliament , to which Mary agreed , but Lennox 's request for a delay to gather evidence was denied . In the absence of Lennox , and with no evidence presented , Bothwell was acquitted after a seven @-@ hour trial on 12 April . A week later , Bothwell managed to convince more than two dozen lords and bishops to sign the Ainslie Tavern Bond , in which they agreed to support his aim to marry the queen . 
 = = Imprisonment in Scotland and abdication = = 
 Between 21 and 23 April 1567 , Mary visited her son at Stirling for the last time . On her way back to Edinburgh on 24 April , Mary was abducted , willingly or not , by Lord Bothwell and his men and taken to Dunbar Castle , where he may have raped her . On 6 May , Mary and Bothwell returned to Edinburgh and on 15 May , at either Holyrood Palace or Holyrood Abbey , they were married according to Protestant rites . Bothwell and his first wife , Jean Gordon , who was the sister of Lord Huntly , had divorced twelve days previously . 
 Originally Mary believed that many nobles supported her marriage , but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell ( created Duke of Orkney and consort of the Queen ) and his former peers , and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular . Catholics considered the marriage unlawful , since they did not recognise Bothwell 's divorce or the validity of the Protestant service . Both Protestants and Catholics were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband . The marriage was tempestuous , and Mary became despondent . Twenty @-@ six Scottish peers , known as the confederate lords , turned against Mary and Bothwell , raising an army against them . Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June , but there was no battle as Mary 's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations . Bothwell was given safe passage from the field , and the lords took Mary to Edinburgh , where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer . The following night , she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle , on an island in the middle of Loch Leven . Between 20 and 23 July , Mary miscarried twins . On 24 July , she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one @-@ year @-@ old son James . Moray was made regent , while Bothwell was driven into exile . He was imprisoned in Denmark , became insane and died in 1578 . 
 = = Escape and imprisonment in England = = 
 On 2 May 1568 , Mary escaped from Loch Leven Castle with the aid of George Douglas , brother of Sir William Douglas , the castle 's owner . Managing to raise an army of 6 @,@ 000 men , she met Moray 's smaller forces at the Battle of Langside on 13 May . Defeated , she fled south ; after spending the night at Dundrennan Abbey , she crossed the Solway Firth into England by fishing boat on 16 May . She landed at Workington in Cumberland in the north of England and stayed overnight at Workington Hall . On 18 May , local officials took her into protective custody at Carlisle Castle . 
 Mary apparently expected Elizabeth to help her regain her throne . Elizabeth was cautious , ordering an inquiry into the conduct of the confederate lords and the question of whether Mary was guilty of Darnley 's murder . In mid @-@ July 1568 , English authorities moved Mary to Bolton Castle , because it was further from the Scottish border but not too close to London . A commission of inquiry , or conference as it was known , was held in York and later Westminster between October 1568 and January 1569 . In Scotland , her supporters fought a civil war against Regent Moray and his successors . 
 = = = Casket letters = = = 
 As an anointed queen , Mary refused to acknowledge the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally ( she sent representatives ) , but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway . As evidence against Mary , Moray presented the so @-@ called casket letters — eight unsigned letters purportedly from Mary to Bothwell , two marriage contracts , and a love sonnet or sonnets said to have been found in a silver @-@ gilt casket just less than one foot ( 30 cm ) long , decorated with the monogram of King Francis II . Mary denied writing them , arguing that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate , and insisted they were forgeries . They are widely believed to be crucial as to whether Mary shares the guilt for Darnley 's murder . The chair of the commission of inquiry , the Duke of Norfolk , described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads , and sent copies to Elizabeth , saying that if they were genuine they might prove Mary 's guilt . 
 The authenticity of the casket letters has been the source of much controversy among historians . It is impossible now to prove either way . The originals , written in French , were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary 's son . The surviving copies , in French or translated into English , do not form a complete set . There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English , Scots , French , and Latin from the 1570s . Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell 's divorce from Jean Gordon . Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town 's registers . 
 Mary 's biographers , such as Antonia Fraser , Alison Weir , and John Guy , have come to the conclusion that either the documents were complete forgeries , or incriminating passages were inserted into genuine letters , or that the letters were written to Bothwell by some other person or by Mary to some other person . Guy points out that the letters are disjointed , and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary 's education . However , certain phrases of the letters ( including verses in the style of Ronsard ) and certain characteristics of style would be compatible with known writings of Mary . 
 The casket letters did not appear publicly until the Conference of 1568 , although the Scottish privy council had seen them by December 1567 . Mary had been forced to abdicate and held captive for the best part of a year in Scotland . The letters were never made public to support her imprisonment and forced abdication . Historian Jenny Wormald believes this reluctance on the part of the Scots to produce the letters , and their destruction in 1584 , whatever their content , constitute proof that they contained real evidence against Mary , whereas Weir thinks it demonstrates the lords required time to fabricate them . At least some of Mary 's contemporaries who saw the letters had no doubt that they were genuine . Among them was the Duke of Norfolk , who secretly conspired to marry Mary in the course of the commission , although he denied it when Elizabeth alluded to his marriage plans , saying " he meant never to marry with a person , where he could not be sure of his pillow " . 
 The majority of the commissioners accepted the casket letters as genuine after a study of their contents and comparison of the penmanship with examples of Mary 's handwriting . Elizabeth , as she had wished , concluded the inquiry with a verdict that nothing was proven , either against the confederate lords or Mary . For overriding political reasons , Elizabeth wished neither to convict nor acquit Mary of murder , and there was never any intention to proceed judicially ; the conference was intended as a political exercise . In the end , Moray returned to Scotland as its regent , and Mary remained in custody in England . Elizabeth had succeeded in maintaining a Protestant government in Scotland , without either condemning or releasing her fellow sovereign . In Fraser 's opinion , it was one of the strangest " trials " in legal history , ending with no finding of guilt against either party with one let home to Scotland while the other remained in custody . 
 = = = Plots = = = 
 On 26 January 1569 , Mary was moved to Tutbury Castle and placed in the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his formidable wife Bess of Hardwick . Elizabeth considered Mary 's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury 's properties , including Tutbury , Sheffield Castle , Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House , all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London , and distant from the sea . Mary was permitted her own domestic staff , which never numbered less than 16 , and needed 30 carts to transport her belongings from house to house . Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets , as well as her cloth of state on which she had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement ( " In my end lies my beginning " ) embroidered . Her bedlinen was changed daily , and her own chefs prepared meals with a choice of 32 dishes served on silver plates . She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision , spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton , and spent much of her time doing embroidery . Her health declined , perhaps through porphyria or lack of exercise , and by the 1580s , she had severe rheumatism in her limbs , rendering her lame . 
 In May 1569 , Elizabeth attempted to mediate the restoration of Mary in return for guarantees of the Protestant religion , but a convention held at Perth rejected the deal overwhelmingly . Norfolk continued to scheme for a marriage with Mary , and Elizabeth imprisoned him in the Tower of London between October 1569 and August 1570 . Early in the following year , Moray was assassinated . Moray 's death coincided with a rebellion in the North of England , led by Catholic earls , which persuaded Elizabeth that Mary was a threat . English troops intervened in the Scottish civil war , consolidating the power of the anti @-@ Marian forces . Elizabeth 's principal secretaries Sir Francis Walsingham and William Cecil , Lord Burghley , watched Mary carefully with the aid of spies placed in Mary 's household . 
 In 1571 , Cecil and Walsingham uncovered the Ridolfi Plot , which was a plan to replace Elizabeth with Mary with the help of Spanish troops and the Duke of Norfolk . Norfolk was executed , and the English Parliament introduced a bill barring Mary from the throne , to which Elizabeth refused to give royal assent . To discredit Mary , the casket letters were published in London . Plots centred on Mary continued . Pope Gregory XIII endorsed one plan in the latter half of the 1570s to marry her to the governor of the Low Countries and half @-@ brother of Philip II of Spain , Don John of Austria , who was supposed to organise the invasion of England from the Spanish Netherlands . After the Throckmorton Plot of 1583 , Walsingham introduced the Bond of Association and the Act for the Queen 's Safety , which sanctioned the killing of anyone who plotted against Elizabeth and aimed to prevent a putative successor from profiting from her murder . In February 1585 , William Parry was convicted of plotting to assassinate Elizabeth , without Mary 's knowledge , though her agent Thomas Morgan was implicated . In April , Mary was placed in the stricter custody of Sir Amias Paulet , and at Christmas she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley .

 = = = Trial = = = 
 On 11 August 1586 , after being implicated in the Babington Plot , Mary was arrested while out riding and taken to <unk> . In a successful attempt to entrap her , Walsingham had deliberately arranged for Mary 's letters to be smuggled out of Chartley . Mary was misled into thinking her letters were secure , while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham . From these letters it was clear that Mary had sanctioned the attempted assassination of Elizabeth . She was moved to Fotheringhay Castle in a four @-@ day journey ending on 25 September , and in October was put on trial for treason under the Act for the Queen 's Safety before a court of 36 noblemen , including Cecil , Shrewsbury , and Walsingham . Spirited in her defence , Mary denied the charges . She told her <unk> , " Look to your consciences and remember that the theatre of the whole world is wider than the kingdom of England " . She drew attention to the facts that she was denied the opportunity to review the evidence , that her papers had been removed from her , that she was denied access to legal counsel and that as a foreign anointed queen she had never been an English subject and thus could not be convicted of treason . 
 Mary was convicted on 25 October and sentenced to death with only one commissioner , Lord Zouche , expressing any form of dissent . Despite this , Elizabeth hesitated to order her execution , even in the face of pressure from the English Parliament to carry out the sentence . She was concerned that the killing of a queen set a discreditable precedent , and was fearful of the consequences , especially if , in retaliation , Mary 's son James formed an alliance with the Catholic powers and invaded England . Elizabeth asked Paulet , Mary 's final custodian , if he would contrive a clandestine way to " shorten the life " of Mary , which he refused to do on the grounds that he would not make " a shipwreck of my conscience , or leave so great a blot on my poor posterity " . On 1 February 1587 , Elizabeth signed the death warrant , and entrusted it to William Davison , a privy councillor . On the 3rd , ten members of the Privy Council of England , having been summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth 's knowledge , decided to carry out the sentence at once . 
 = = = Execution = = = 
 At Fotheringhay on the evening of 7 February 1587 , Mary was told that she was to be executed the next morning . She spent the last hours of her life in prayer , distributing her belongings to her household , and writing her will and a letter to the King of France . The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black . It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block , a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools , for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent , who were there to witness the execution . The executioners ( one named Bull and his assistant ) knelt before her and asked forgiveness . She replied , " I forgive you with all my heart , for now , I hope , you shall make an end of all my troubles . " Her servants , Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle , and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments , revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson @-@ brown , the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church , with a black satin bodice and black trimmings . As she disrobed she smiled and said that she " never had such grooms before ... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company " . She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold , knelt down on the cushion in front of the block , on which she positioned her head , and stretched out her arms . Her last words were , " In manus <unk> , Domine , <unk> <unk> meum " ( " Into thy hands , O Lord , I commend my spirit " ) . 
 Mary was not beheaded with a single strike . The first blow missed her neck and struck the back of her head . The second blow severed the neck , except for a small bit of sinew , which the executioner cut through using the axe . Afterward , he held her head aloft and declared , " God save the Queen . " At that moment , the auburn tresses in his hand turned out to be a wig and the head fell to the ground , revealing that Mary had very short , grey hair . A small dog owned by the queen , a Skye terrier , is said to have been hiding among her skirts , unseen by the spectators . Following the beheading , it refused to be parted from its owner 's body and was covered in her blood , until it was forcibly taken away and washed . Items supposedly worn or carried by Mary at her execution are of doubtful provenance ; contemporary accounts state that all her clothing , the block , and everything touched by her blood was burnt in the fireplace of the Great Hall to obstruct relic @-@ hunters . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 When the news of the execution reached Elizabeth , she became indignant and asserted that Davison had disobeyed her instructions not to part with the warrant and that the Privy Council had acted without her authority . Elizabeth 's vacillation and deliberately vague instructions gave her plausible deniability , to attempt to avoid the direct stain of Mary 's blood . Davison was arrested , thrown into the Tower of London , and found guilty of misprision . He was released 19 months later after Cecil and Walsingham interceded on his behalf . 
 Mary 's request to be buried in France was refused by Elizabeth . Her body was embalmed and left unburied in a secure lead coffin until her burial , in a Protestant service , at Peterborough Cathedral in late July 1587 . Her entrails , removed as part of the embalming process , were buried secretly within Fotheringhay Castle . Her body was exhumed in 1612 when her son , King James VI and I , ordered that she be reinterred in Westminster Abbey , in a chapel opposite the tomb of Elizabeth I. In 1867 , her tomb was opened to try to ascertain the resting place of James I ; he was ultimately found with Henry VII , but many of her other descendants , including Elizabeth of Bohemia , Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the children of Anne , Queen of Great Britain , were interred in her vault . 
 Assessments of Mary in the sixteenth century divided between Protestant reformers such as George Buchanan and John Knox , who vilified her mercilessly , and Catholic apologists such as Adam Blackwood , who praised , defended and eulogised her . After the accession of James I in England , historian William Camden wrote an officially sanctioned biography that drew from original documents . It condemned Buchanan 's work as an invention , and " emphasized Mary 's evil fortunes rather than her evil character " . Differing interpretations persisted into the eighteenth century : William Robertson and David Hume argued that the casket letters were genuine and that Mary was guilty of adultery and murder , while William Tytler argued the reverse . In the latter half of the twentieth century , the work of Antonia Fraser was acclaimed as " more objective ... free from the excesses of adulation or attack " that had characterised older biographies , and her contemporaries Gordon Donaldson and Ian B. Cowan also produced more balanced works . Historian Jenny Wormald concluded that Mary was a tragic failure , who was unable to cope with the demands placed on her , but hers was a rare dissenting view in a post @-@ Fraser tradition that Mary was a pawn in the hands of scheming noblemen . There is no concrete proof of her complicity in Darnley 's murder or of a conspiracy with Bothwell . Such accusations rest on assumptions , and Buchanan 's biography is today discredited as " almost complete fantasy " . Mary 's courage at her execution helped establish her popular image as the heroic victim in a dramatic tragedy .

 Route 147 is a 4 @.@ 20 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 76 km ) state highway located in Cape May County in New Jersey , United States . It is a short connector between U.S. Route 9 in Middle Township and North Wildwood at New York Avenue . West of U.S. Route 9 , the road continues to Route 47 as County Route 618 ( Indian Trail Road ) ; this route along with Route 147 provides an alternate route to The Wildwoods from Route 47 . East of New York Avenue , the route continues south through The Wildwoods as County Route 621 ( New Jersey Avenue ) . The route passes through mostly marshland along its journey , intersecting the Garden State Parkway at a partial interchange and County Route 619 ( Ocean Drive ) . The portion of the route east of the intersection with the latter forms a part of Ocean Drive . When the 500 @-@ series county routes were established in New Jersey in the 1950s , what is now Route 147 became a part of County Route 585 , a route running from Lower Township north to Absecon . Route 147 was designated along County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 and the North Wildwood border . The route was extended to its current location in North Wildwood by the 1990s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 147 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 in the Burleigh section of Middle Township , heading to the east along North Wildwood Boulevard , a two @-@ lane undivided road . The road continues to the west of U.S. Route 9 as County Route 618 ( Indian Trail Road ) to Route 47 . The road passes residences and businesses to the north and woodland to the south before coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Garden State Parkway that has access to and from the northbound direction of the parkway . 
 Past the Garden State Parkway , Route 147 becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway that briefly passes more homes and commercial establishments before entering a delta @-@ type series of marshy rivers and inlets . It turns to the southeast and comes to an intersection with County Route 665 before crossing the Grassy Sound on a bridge . After the bridge , the route comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of County Route 619 ( Ocean Drive ) . 
 At this point , the Ocean Drive moniker merges onto Route 147 and the road crosses over the Beach Creek into the beach resort of North Wildwood . Here , the route turns south and becomes Spruce Avenue , which heads between marshland to the west and resort homes to the east . At the intersection with West <unk> Drive , Route 147 becomes a four @-@ lane undivided road that continues past more developments , turning to the southeast . Route 147 heads through a mix or residential and commercial establishments before ending at the intersection with New York Avenue . From here , County Route 621 continues south along the roadway as New Jersey Avenue . Route 147 , along with County Route 618 , provide an alternate route to The Wildwoods from Route 47 . 
 = = History = = 
 What is now Route 147 was an unimproved road back in 1927 . When the 500 @-@ series county routes were established in the 1950s , this road became a part of County Route 585 , a route that ran from Route 109 ( then a part of U.S. Route 9 ) in Lower Township north to U.S. Route 30 and Route 157 in Absecon . The route was also designated as part of County Route 18 , which continued west past U.S. Route 9 to Route 47 . In 1971 , Route 147 was designated to replace the portion of County Route 18 / County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 in Burleigh and the North Wildwood border . As a result of a bridge replacement over the Grassy Sound , Route 147 was realigned off its former drawbridge , and the former alignment became Cape May County Route 665 . The southern terminus of County Route 585 was eventually truncated its current location at Route 52 in Somers Point . By the 1990s , Route 147 was extended to its current terminus at New York Avenue in North Wildwood .

 Lawless joined Conference National team Forest Green Rovers on non @-@ contract terms on 4 August 2006 . He made his debut in a 1 – 0 defeat to Dagenham & Redbridge on 12 August 2006 . Lawless scored his first goal for the club with a " spectacular " strike from long @-@ range to give Forest Green the lead against Morecambe on 24 February 2007 , but they went on to lose 3 – 1 . He finished the 2006 – 07 season with 40 appearances and one goal . He scored the only goal for Forest Green in their 1 – 0 victory over Crawley Town on 10 February 2008 , after scoring in the 73rd minute . After playing for the Wales semi @-@ pro team manager Jim Harvey was worried over Lawless ' fitness , although he was able to play in Forest Green 's following game against Cambridge United . Lawless made 41 appearances and scored three goals for Forest Green as they earned their highest ever finish of eighth in the Conference Premier in the 2007 – 08 season . He won the players ' player of the season award , being described as the team 's unsung hero . 
 On the opening day of the 2008 – 09 season he filled in at right @-@ back due to an injury to Kris Thomas and scored with a 20 yard strike to give Forest Green a 1 – 1 draw against Kettering Town . He garnered praise from Harvey , who said Lawless had a " super game " . A hip injury forced him to miss a game against Northwich Victoria in September 2008 , before making his return later that month in a 3 – 0 defeat to Stevenage Borough . During a game against former club Torquay on 23 September 2008 he suffered an ankle injury which forced him to miss three games .

 On 8 November 2010 , Lawless joined York 's Conference Premier rivals Luton Town , initially on loan , with a permanent transfer due to take place in January 2011 . York were reluctant to let him leave , but relented when Luton increased their original offer on three occasions . He made his debut in a 1 – 0 defeat at Wrexham on 11 November 2010 and , in the following game , Lawless scored his first Luton goal with the winner in a 1 – 0 victory at Altrincham . Lawless signed for Luton permanently for an undisclosed fee on a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract on 5 January 2011 . His first appearance after signing was as a 74th @-@ minute substitute in a 0 – 0 draw at Bath City on 8 January 2011 . After the departure of fellow midfielder Andy Drury to Ipswich Town in late January 2011 , Lawless played a much more prominent role in a Luton side that eventually finished the 2010 – 11 season third in the table . He scored the opening goal , a 35 yard strike described as " superb " , in Luton 's 3 – 0 play @-@ off semi @-@ final first leg victory away at Wrexham . He then played in the 2 – 1 home victory in the second leg , and in the 2011 Conference Premier play @-@ off Final against AFC Wimbledon at Wembley he missed the opening penalty kick in the penalty shoot @-@ out , which Luton lost 4 – 3 . 
 During the half @-@ time break of Luton 's 3 – 0 defeat away at his former club York on 24 September 2011 , Lawless broke his hand after punching a wall out of frustration , resulting in him being ruled out for around a month and being handed a fine by his club . He played in Luton 's 2012 Conference Premier play @-@ off Final 2 – 1 defeat at Wembley , coincidentally against York , on 20 May 2012 . Lawless signed a one @-@ year contract extension in July 2012 , despite poor performances during the 2011 – 12 season making him a target for fans . 
 Manager Paul Buckle praised Lawless for his " quality ... hard work and ... discipline " following his 100th appearance for the club in December 2012 . He scored the winning goal with a volley into the bottom corner in Luton 's 1 – 0 victory over Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup third round on 5 January 2013 , and was voted as the competition 's Player of the Round . Lawless finished the season with 48 appearances and five goals . His performances saw him voted by both Luton supporters and his teammates as the club 's Player of the Season for the 2012 – 13 season ; a marked turnaround from the previous year . He signed a new two @-@ year contract with Luton in May 2013 after having talks with two unnamed League One clubs . 
 Lawless was sidelined with a groin injury at the beginning of the 2013 – 14 season , and did not make his first start until 17 September in a 3 – 0 victory against Dartford , in which he scored one goal and set up another . This victory provided the springboard for Luton to embark on a 27 @-@ game unbeaten run in the league , in which Lawless was heavily involved , scoring five further times and contributing ten assists . After playing in 32 games and scoring six goals , including many games in an unfamiliar position as a left midfielder , he missed the final part of the season due to injury . On 15 April 2014 , with three games to spare , Luton won the Conference Premier title and were promoted to League Two ; this was Lawless ' first title and promotion as a player . 
 Lawless struggled with multiple injuries during the 2014 – 15 season , making 15 league appearances ( only six of which were starts ) and scoring three goals . Despite this limited playing time , Lawless triggered a contract extension during the season to keep him at the club until the end of the 2015 – 16 season . 
 On 10 May 2016 , it was announced that Lawless would not have his contract renewed after making 203 appearances and scoring 22 goals for Luton since joining the club in 2010 . He left the club upon the expiry of his contract .

 = Leotia lubrica = 
 Leotia lubrica , commonly referred to as a jelly baby , is a species of fungus in the family <unk> . The species produces small fruit bodies up to 6 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) in height , featuring a " head " and a stalk . Ochre tinted with olive @-@ green in colour , the heads are irregularly shaped , while the stalk , of a similar colour , attaches them to the ground . The appearance can be somewhat variable and is similar to a number of other species , including Cudonia confusa , C. <unk> , L. atrovirens and L. viscosa . L. lubrica was first validly described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli , but it was later transferred to Leotia by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon . Its relationship with other members of the genus , of which it is the type species , is complicated . 
 Growing in woodland among moss , plant detritus or other habitats , the L. lubrica fruit bodies are typically found in large numbers , though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually . The species feeds as a saprotroph . The youngest fruit bodies are small and conical , but the fertile head quickly grows from the stalk . It is often described as inedible , despite its common name , but has also been reported as edible and even good . L. lubrica has been recorded in Europe , North America , Asia and Australasia . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The first species was first validly described scientifically by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in his 1772 work Flora <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> et <unk> in classes , genera , species , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . Scopoli either named the species <unk> lubrica or Helvella lubrica , with the specific name lubrica meaning slimy . Christiaan Hendrik Persoon transferred the species to Leotia , where it remains , in 1794 . Other synonyms include Leotia gelatinosa , used by John Hill in 1751 , Helvella gelatinosa , used in Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard 's Histoire des champignons de la France , and Peziza <unk> , a name given by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1790 . The fruit bodies of the mushrooms are typically referred to as jelly babies , but other common names include the lizard tuft , the ochre jelly club , the slippery cap , the green slime fungus , and the <unk> fungus . The term " yellow jelly babies " is sometimes used to differentiate the species from green jelly babies , Leotia viscosa . 
 Leotia lubrica is the type species of the genus Leotia . It has been hypothesised that the species has a close relationship with L. atrovirens ; mycologist Geoffrey Kibby suggested that greenish color of L. atrovirens may be due to infection by an imperfect fungus on L. lubrica , while David Arora proposed that the two species may intergrade . In 2004 , results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that L. lubrica , L. atrovirens and L. viscosa , while morphologically well @-@ defined , were not monophyletic . L. lubrica specimens could be split into at least two different groups , one of which also contained specimens of L. viscosa . These groups could be differentiated morphologically by the colour of the stalk when dried . The most basal was shown to be L. atrovirens . 
 = = Description = = 
 Leotia lubrica produces fruit bodies which range from 1 to 6 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 4 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) in height . Each body has a single fertile " head " measuring up to 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) across , which is an olive @-@ greenish ochre and gelatinous . To the touch , the surface of the head can be smooth , clammy or slimey . While in shape it is convex , the head is made up of irregular lobes and undulations , and the edge is rolled inward . The underside is paler in colour than the upper surface , and smooth . The head is attached to a central stalk , which ranges from 3 to 6 mm wide , though thinner toward the substrate . The stalk is typically cylindrical , but can be flattened , and occasionally has furrows . The colour is similar to that of the head , though more yellow , and the surface is covered in very small granules of a greenish colour . The flesh is gelatinous in the head , while the stalk is mostly hollow , but it can be filled with gel . 
 = = = Microscopic features = = = 
 Leotia lubrica spores are borne in asci measuring around 150 by 10 – 12 micrometres ( μm ) . They are club @-@ shaped , and each ascus typically bears eight spores . The asci are <unk> , meaning that they lack a " lid " and must split to release their spores . The elongated ascospores themselves measure 20 to 25 by 5 to 6 μm , and are <unk> , that is , they taper slightly at each end . The surface is smooth , and they can be curved , and the spores typically contain four small drops of oil . The mature spores are septate ; that is , they are divided by several septa throughout their length , with 5 to 7 partitions typical , and hyaline . The threadlike , colourless paraphyses measure 105 to 124 by 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 8 μm . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Leotia lubrica fruit bodies are similar to those of Cudonia confusa , commonly known as the cinnamon <unk> . The species can be differentiated by the fact that L. lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy , and those of C. confusa are much paler in colour . Another Cudonia species , C. <unk> ( which is highly similar to C. lutea ) , is similar to L. lubrica , though it can be differentiated by its colour ( which is more brown ) , spores ( which are smaller and thinner ) and texture ( which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica ) . L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L. atrovirens , which can be differentiated by its darker colouration . L. viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration ; the species has a green head . However , as L. lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue , differentiation between the two species is not always easy . 
 = = Edibility = = 
 Its fruit bodies are of little culinary interest , and , contrary to what is suggested by the common name , are typically described as inedible by field guides . However , it has also been reported that , while it is little known , the species is in fact edible , with Charles McIlvaine even considering it good . By comparison , American mycologists Alan Bessette and Walter J. Sundberg describe the species as edible , but describe the taste as " bland " . In the field , the flesh has no discernible smell or taste . 
 = = Habitat , distribution and ecology = = 
 Leotia lubrica favours damp deciduous woodland , but can also be found under hardwoods . Particular favoured habitats include path sides and underneath bracken , while favoured substrates include soil , moss and plant waste , where it feeds as a saprotroph . Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe , and from late spring to autumn in North America , where it is the most common Leotia species . It has also been recorded in eastern Asia , in China and Tibet , as well as in New Zealand and Australia . 
 The fruit bodies are typically found growing in large numbers , sometimes in clumps , though solitary specimens are occasionally encountered . Several bodies can be connected at their bases , or younger bodies can grow out of the bases of older ones . The youngest fruit bodies are conical in shape . When the body reaches around 2 mm in length , the tip of the cone begins to expand , forming the head . This is the stage at which the hymenium becomes differentiated from the rest of the body , and the bodies quickly reach their mature form , maturing only through growth after that point . Fruit bodies can be infected by the mould Hypomyces <unk> .

 U.S. Route 219 ( US 219 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Rich Creek , Virginia to West Seneca , New York . In the U.S. state of Maryland , the U.S. Highway runs 48 @.@ 40 miles ( 77 @.@ 89 km ) from the West Virginia state line near Red House to the Pennsylvania state line near Grantsville . Known as Garrett Highway for much of its length in Maryland , US 219 is the primary north – south route in Garrett County , connecting Interstate 68 ( I @-@ 68 ) and Oakland . The highway also provides the main access to the resort area of Deep Creek Lake , which includes Maryland 's only ski area , Wisp Ski Resort . 
 The part of US 219 between Oakland and Keyser 's Ridge was designated as part of the original state road system in 1909 by the Maryland State Roads Commission and constructed in the early 1910s . Chestnut Ridge Road near Grantsville was upgraded to a modern road in the late 1910s , while the Seneca Trail south of Oakland was mostly built in the 1920s . The US 219 designation was assigned to Chestnut Ridge Road and Maryland Route 37 ( MD 37 ) was assigned to the highway south of Keyser 's Ridge when national and state route numbers were assigned in 1926 and 1927 . The intersection with US 40 near Grantsville was the southern terminus of US 219 until the U.S. Highway was extended through West Virginia in 1935 . US 219 was almost completely rebuilt in the 1940s and 1950s , and moved onto I @-@ 68 in the late 1970s . Future plans call for a bypass of Oakland and construction of freeway north from I @-@ 68 to connect with other freeway portions of US 219 in Pennsylvania . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 219 enters Maryland in the southwest corner of Garrett County just to the west of Backbone Mountain . The U.S. Highway heads northeast from the West Virginia state line as two @-@ lane Garrett Highway . After crossing the Youghiogheny River , US 219 meets US 50 ( George Washington Highway ) at an intersection with a two @-@ way stop in the hamlet of Red House . The highway turns northwest to intersect Ben Dewitt Road , a shortcut between US 219 and US 50 at the state line to the west , then resumes its northeasterly course heading toward Gortner , where the highway crosses Cherry Creek and Ambrose Run . US 219 veers north and crosses the Little Youghiogheny River and CSX 's Mountain Subdivision before entering the town of Oakland and meeting the west end of MD 135 ( Maryland Highway ) . The U.S. Highway turns west onto Oak Street while Ninth Street ( unsigned MD 219 ) continues north . US 219 heads west through the Oakland Historic District . At the intersection with MD 39 ( Oak Street ) next to the Garrett County Courthouse , the highway turns north onto Third Street . US 219 parallels Cherry Glade Run north out of town . 
 US 219 passes along the eastern edge of Mount Nebo Wildlife Management Area and crosses Hoop Pole Hill . North of Sand Flat Road , the highway passes Mayhew Inn Road , which leads west to Swallow Falls State Park . US 219 descends from Hoop Pole Ridge and reaches the southwestern shore of Deep Creek Lake in the hamlet of Thayerville . After passing Glendale Road , which heads east toward Deep Creek Lake State Park and other destinations on the east side of the lake , the highway turns northwest and parallels the west shore of the lake east of Roman Nose Hill . After passing Lakeshore Drive , US 219 crosses the lake on the Deep Creek Bridge . The highway becomes a partially controlled access highway on the hillside above the lake , while Deep Creek Drive follows the shore . US 219 continues north through the unincorporated village of McHenry . In McHenry , the highway intersects Mosser Road , which provides access to Garrett College and Garrett County Airport , and Sang Run Road , which leads to Wisp Ski Resort . After meeting the northern end of Deep Creek Drive , the highway leaves Deep Creek Lake and curves northeast at its junction with MD 42 ( Friendsville Road ) . US 219 continues northeast along <unk> Creek and the South Branch of Bear Creek . After leaving the South Branch , the highway follows Main Street through the town of Accident . Within the town , the highway intersects Accident Friendsville Road and Accident Bittinger Road , which heads east toward the James <unk> House . 
 After leaving Accident , US 219 intersects an access road to Bear Creek Road and Fish Hatchery Road near the <unk> Mill . After the highway crosses the latter road and Bear Creek , it begins the ascent to Keyser 's Ridge , with the northbound direction gaining a climbing lane . After passing Accident Garage Road , Northern Garrett High School , and a scenic overlook , the highway curves to the east and then back north as it approaches the summit . The climbing lane ends northbound and another climbing lane begins in the southbound direction . Shortly after the descent from the summit , US 219 meets I @-@ 68 ( National Freeway ) and US 40 at Exit 14 of I @-@ 68 at Keyser 's Ridge . US 219 exits onto the eastbound direction of the freeway at a cloverleaf interchange , while US 40 heads north from the interchange to meet the west end of US 40 Alternate then turn northwest into Pennsylvania . After meeting MD 495 at Exit 19 in Grantsville , US 219 exits north onto Chestnut Ridge Road at Exit 22 . The highway intersects US 40 Alternate ( National Pike ) in the hamlet of High Point before crossing the Pennsylvania state line , where US 219 continues north toward Meyersdale . 
 US 219 is part of the National Highway System for its entire length in Maryland . The highway is also part of Corridor N of the Appalachian Development Highway System from I @-@ 68 to the Pennsylvania state line . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1909 , the Maryland State Roads Commission targeted the pre @-@ existing road from the Northwestern Turnpike at Red House to the National Turnpike at Keyser 's Ridge for upgrade to an all @-@ weather road as part of the original state road system . The existing road followed roughly the same alignment as the present US 219 , with four major deviations : south of Oakland , where the road followed Monte Vista Road , Underwood Road , and Third Street north to Oak Street ; at Deep Creek , where the road crossed Deep Creek to the east of the present Deep Creek Bridge ; Hoyes , where the road followed Friendsville Road north to Hoyes , then Hoyes Road east to the present alignment ; and north of Accident , where the road turned northeast and used a very curvy alignment to cross Bear Creek and climb the lower slopes of Keyser 's Ridge to meet the present road near Northern Garrett High School . The new highway was completed from Oakland to Thayerville in 1910 . The segment from Thayerville to McHenry , which followed the pre @-@ existing alignment , was under construction by 1911 and completed in 1913 . The highway from McHenry to Accident , which bypassed Hoyes , was completed in 1914 . Finally , the section from Accident to Keyser 's Ridge , which bypassed the crooked road around Bear Creek , was completed in 1915 . 
 Once the highway from Oakland to Keyser 's Ridge was completed , attention turned to the south of Oakland . The new road , constructed from Oakland to Gortner in 1915 and 1916 , met the road to Mountain Lake Park , now Oakland Drive , next to Southern Garrett High School , then followed Oak Street west into the county seat . The road from Gortner to Red House was constructed between 1924 and 1927 . The highway was paved south to the West Virginia state line in 1928 . The Chestnut Ridge Road was completed in 1923 . The Deep Creek Dam was constructed starting in 1923 and Deep Creek Lake began to fill in January 1925 . The road was relocated around Deep Creek Lake and the first Deep Creek Bridge was built in 1924 . Chestnut Ridge Road was designated the southern end of US 219 in the U.S. Highway System designated in 1926 . The road south from Keyser 's Ridge was marked as MD 37 in 1927 . In 1935 , US 219 was extended west along US 40 and then south toward West Virginia , replacing the MD 37 designation for its entire length . 
 After World War II , US 219 was reconstructed into its modern form for most of its length . The segment between Oakland and Thayerville was reconstructed between 1948 and 1950 . The stretch from Keyser 's Ridge to Accident was relocated around 1950 . The section of US 219 between Gortner and Red House was widened between 1950 and 1952 . The stretch between Thayerville and the Deep Creek Bridge was rebuilt from 1952 to 1955 . The McHenry to Accident part of US 219 was reconstructed starting in 1952 . Chestnut Ridge Road was relocated around 1956 . Finally , US 219 between Gortner and Oakland was rebuilt between 1957 and 1959 , including a relocation at the northern end that included its present intersection with MD 135 and a bridge over the B & O Railroad . In the late 1960s , US 219 was relocated from the Deep Creek Bridge through McHenry , leaving behind Deep Creek Drive as an old alignment . After the construction of I @-@ 68 in the mid @-@ 1970s , US 219 was moved to the new freeway between Keyser 's Ridge and Chestnut Ridge Road in 1978 . The present Deep Creek Bridge was completed in 1987 , replacing the 1924 structure .

 The annelids ( Annelida , from Latin <unk> , " little ring " ) , also known as the ringed worms or segmented worms , are a large phylum , with over 17 @,@ 000 extant species including <unk> , earthworms , and leeches . The species exist in and have adapted to various ecologies - some in marine environments as distinct as tidal zones and hydrothermal vents , others in fresh water , and yet others in moist terrestrial environments . 
 The annelids are bilaterally symmetrical , triploblastic , <unk> , invertebrate organisms . They also have parapodia for locomotion . Most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes ( almost all marine ) , oligochaetes ( which include earthworms ) and leech @-@ like species . Cladistic research since 1997 has radically changed this scheme , viewing leeches as a sub @-@ group of oligochaetes and oligochaetes as a sub @-@ group of polychaetes . In addition , the Pogonophora , Echiura and Sipuncula , previously regarded as separate phyla , are now regarded as sub @-@ groups of polychaetes . Annelids are considered members of the Lophotrochozoa , a " super @-@ phylum " of protostomes that also includes molluscs , brachiopods , flatworms and nemerteans . 
 The basic annelid form consists of multiple segments . Each segment has the same sets of organs and , in most polychaetes , has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion . Septa separate the segments of many species , but are poorly defined or absent in others , and Echiura and Sipuncula show no obvious signs of segmentation . In species with well @-@ developed septa , the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels , and the vessels in segments near the front ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as hearts . The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments , which facilitates movement by peristalsis ( " ripples " that pass along the body ) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia . In species with incomplete septa or none , the blood circulates through the main body cavity without any kind of pump , and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques – some burrowing species turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves through the sediment . 
 Although many species can reproduce asexually and use similar mechanisms to regenerate after severe injuries , sexual reproduction is the normal method in species whose reproduction has been studied . The minority of living polychaetes whose reproduction and lifecycles are known produce trochophore larvae , that live as plankton and then sink and metamorphose into miniature adults . Oligochaetes are full hermaphrodites and produce a ring @-@ like cocoon around their bodies , in which the eggs and hatchlings are nourished until they are ready to emerge . 
 Earthworms are Oligochaetes that support terrestrial food chains both as prey and in some regions are important in aeration and enriching of soil . The burrowing of marine polychaetes , which may constitute up to a third of all species in near @-@ shore environments , encourages the development of ecosystems by enabling water and oxygen to penetrate the sea floor . In addition to improving soil fertility , annelids serve humans as food and as bait . Scientists observe annelids to monitor the quality of marine and fresh water . Although blood @-@ letting is no longer in favor with doctors , some leech species are regarded as endangered species because they have been over @-@ harvested for this purpose in the last few centuries . Ragworms ' jaws are now being studied by engineers as they offer an exceptional combination of lightness and strength . 
 Since annelids are soft @-@ bodied , their fossils are rare – mostly jaws and the mineralized tubes that some of the species secreted . Although some late Ediacaran fossils may represent annelids , the oldest known fossil that is identified with confidence comes from about 518 million years ago in the early Cambrian period . Fossils of most modern mobile polychaete groups appeared by the end of the Carboniferous , about 299 million years ago . Palaeontologists disagree about whether some body fossils from the mid Ordovician , about 472 to 461 million years ago , are the remains of oligochaetes , and the earliest indisputable fossils of the group appear in the Tertiary period , which began 65 million years ago . 
 = = Classification and diversity = = 
 There are over 22 @,@ 000 living annelid species , ranging in size from microscopic to the Australian giant Gippsland earthworm and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , 1922 ) , which can both grow up to 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) long . Although research since 1997 has radically changed scientists ' views about the evolutionary family tree of the annelids , most textbooks use the traditional classification into the following sub @-@ groups : 
 Polychaetes ( about 12 @,@ 000 species ) . As their name suggests , they have multiple chetae ( " hairs " ) per segment . Polychaetes have parapodia that function as limbs , and nuchal organs that are thought to be <unk> . Most are marine animals , although a few species live in fresh water and even fewer on land . 
 <unk> ( about 10 @,@ 000 species ) . These have few or no chetae per segment , and no nuchal organs or parapodia . However , they have a unique reproductive organ , the ring @-@ shaped <unk> ( " pack saddle " ) around their bodies , which produces a cocoon that stores and nourishes fertilized eggs until they hatch or , in <unk> , yolky eggs that provide nutrition for the <unk> . The clitellates are sub @-@ divided into : Oligochaetes ( " with few hairs " ) , which includes earthworms . Oligochaetes have a sticky pad in the roof of the mouth . Most are burrowers that feed on wholly or partly decomposed organic materials . 
 <unk> , whose name means " leech @-@ shaped " and whose best known members are leeches . Marine species are mostly blood @-@ sucking parasites , mainly on fish , while most freshwater species are predators . They have suckers at both ends of their bodies , and use these to move rather like inchworms . 
 The <unk> , minute annelids that live in the spaces between grains of marine sediment , were treated as a separate class because of their simple body structure , but are now regarded as polychaetes . Some other groups of animals have been classified in various ways , but are now widely regarded as annelids : 
 Pogonophora / Siboglinidae were first discovered in 1914 , and their lack of a recognizable gut made it difficult to classify them . They have been classified as a separate phylum , Pogonophora , or as two phyla , Pogonophora and <unk> . More recently they have been re @-@ classified as a family , Siboglinidae , within the polychaetes . 
 The Echiura have a checkered taxonomic history : in the 19th century they were assigned to the phylum " <unk> " , which is now empty as its members have been assigned to other phyla ; the Echiura were next regarded as annelids until the 1940s , when they were classified as a phylum in their own right ; but a molecular phylogenetics analysis in 1997 concluded that echiurans are annelids . 
 <unk> live on crinoids and other echinoderms , mainly as parasites . In the past they have been regarded as close relatives of the trematode flatworms or of the tardigrades , but in 1998 it was suggested that they are a sub @-@ group of polychaetes . However , another analysis in 2002 suggested that <unk> are more closely related to flatworms or to rotifers and <unk> . 
 = = Distinguishing features = = 
 No single feature distinguishes Annelids from other invertebrate phyla , but they have a distinctive combination of features . Their bodies are long , with segments that are divided externally by shallow ring @-@ like constrictions called annuli and internally by septa ( " partitions " ) at the same points , although in some species the septa are incomplete and in a few cases missing . Most of the segments contain the same sets of organs , although sharing a common gut , circulatory system and nervous system makes them inter @-@ dependent . Their bodies are covered by a cuticle ( outer covering ) that does not contain cells but is secreted by cells in the skin underneath , is made of tough but flexible collagen and does not molt – on the other hand arthropods ' cuticles are made of the more rigid α @-@ chitin , and molt until the arthropods reach their full size . Most annelids have closed circulatory systems , where the blood makes its entire circuit via blood vessels . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = Segmentation = = = 
 Most of an annelid 's body consists of segments that are practically identical , having the same sets of internal organs and external chaetae ( Greek <unk> , meaning " hair " ) and , in some species , appendages . However , the frontmost and rearmost sections are not regarded as true segments as they do not contain the standard sets of organs and do not develop in the same way as the true segments . The frontmost section , called the prostomium ( Greek <unk> meaning " in front of " and <unk> meaning " mouth " ) contains the brain and sense organs , while the rearmost , called the pygidium ( Greek <unk> , meaning " little tail " ) or <unk> contains the anus , generally on the underside . The first section behind the prostomium , called the peristomium ( Greek <unk> meaning " around " and <unk> meaning " mouth " ) , is regarded by some zoologists as not a true segment , but in some polychaetes the peristomium has chetae and appendages like those of other segments . 
 The segments develop one at a time from a growth zone just ahead of the pygidium , so that an annelid 's youngest segment is just in front of the growth zone while the peristomium is the oldest . This pattern is called <unk> growth . Some groups of annelids , including all leeches , have fixed maximum numbers of segments , while others add segments throughout their lives . 
 The phylum 's name is derived from the Latin word <unk> , meaning " little ring " . 
 = = = Body wall , chetae and parapodia = = = 
 Annelids ' cuticles are made of collagen fibers , usually in layers that spiral in alternating directions so that the fibers cross each other . These are secreted by the one @-@ cell deep epidermis ( outermost skin layer ) . A few marine annelids that live in tubes lack cuticles , but their tubes have a similar structure , and mucus @-@ secreting glands in the epidermis protect their skins . Under the epidermis is the dermis , which is made of connective tissue , in other words a combination of cells and non @-@ cellular materials such as collagen . Below this are two layers of muscles , which develop from the lining of the coelom ( body cavity ) : circular muscles make a segment longer and slimmer when they contract , while under them are longitudinal muscles , usually four distinct strips , whose contractions make the segment shorter and fatter . Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side . 
 The setae ( " hairs " ) of annelids project out from the epidermis to provide traction and other capabilities . The simplest are unjointed and form paired bundles near the top and bottom of each side of each segment . The parapodia ( " limbs " ) of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips – for example jointed , comb @-@ like or hooked . <unk> are made of moderately flexible β @-@ chitin and are formed by follicles , each of which has a <unk> ( " hair @-@ forming " ) cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta . The <unk> produce chetae by forming microvilli , fine hair @-@ like extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta . When the cheta is complete , the microvilli withdraw into the <unk> , leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta . Hence annelids ' chetae are structurally different from the setae ( " bristles " ) of arthropods , which are made of the more rigid α @-@ chitin , have a single internal cavity , and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle . 
 Nearly all polychaetes have parapodia that function as limbs , while other major annelid groups lack them . <unk> are unjointed paired extensions of the body wall , and their muscles are derived from the circular muscles of the body . They are often supported internally by one or more large , thick chetae . The parapodia of burrowing and tube @-@ dwelling polychaetes are often just ridges whose tips bear hooked chetae . In active crawlers and swimmers the parapodia are often divided into large upper and lower paddles on a very short trunk , and the paddles are generally fringed with chetae and sometimes with <unk> ( fused bundles of cilia ) and gills . 
 = = = Nervous system and senses = = = 
 The brain generally forms a ring round the pharynx ( throat ) , consisting of a pair of ganglia ( local control centers ) above and in front of the pharynx , linked by nerve cords either side of the pharynx to another pair of ganglia just below and behind it . The brains of polychaetes are generally in the prostomium , while those of clitellates are in the peristomium or sometimes the first segment behind the peristomium . In some very mobile and active polychaetes the brain is enlarged and more complex , with visible hindbrain , midbrain and forebrain sections . The rest of the central nervous system is generally " ladder @-@ like " , consisting of a pair of nerve cords that run through the bottom part of the body and have in each segment paired ganglia linked by a transverse connection . From each segmental ganglion a branching system of local nerves runs into the body wall and then encircles the body . However , in most polychaetes the two main nerve cords are fused , and in the tube @-@ dwelling genus <unk> the single nerve chord has no ganglia and is located in the epidermis . 
 As in arthropods , each muscle fiber ( cell ) is controlled by more than one neuron , and the speed and power of the fiber 's contractions depends on the combined effects of all its neurons . Vertebrates have a different system , in which one neuron controls a group of muscle fibers . Most annelids ' longitudinal nerve trunks include giant axons ( the output signal lines of nerve cells ) . Their large diameter decreases their resistance , which allows them to transmit signals exceptionally fast . This enables these worms to withdraw rapidly from danger by shortening their bodies . Experiments have shown that cutting the giant axons prevents this escape response but does not affect normal movement . 
 The sensors are primarily single cells that detect light , chemicals , pressure waves and contact , and are present on the head , appendages ( if any ) and other parts of the body . <unk> ( " on the neck " ) organs are paired , ciliated structures found only in polychaetes , and are thought to be <unk> . Some polychaetes also have various combinations of ocelli ( " little eyes " ) that detect the direction from which light is coming and camera eyes or compound eyes that can probably form images . The compound eyes probably evolved independently of arthropods ' eyes . Some tube @-@ worms use ocelli widely spread over their bodies to detect the shadows of fish , so that they can quickly withdraw into their tubes . Some burrowing and tube @-@ dwelling polychaetes have statocysts ( tilt and balance sensors ) that tell them which way is down . A few polychaete genera have on the undersides of their heads palps that are used both in feeding and as " feelers " , and some of these also have antennae that are structurally similar but probably are used mainly as " feelers " . 
 = = = <unk> , locomotion and circulatory system = = = 
 Most annelids have a pair of coelomata ( body cavities ) in each segment , separated from other segments by septa and from each other by vertical mesenteries . Each septum forms a sandwich with connective tissue in the middle and mesothelium ( membrane that serves as a lining ) from the preceding and following segments on either side . Each mesentery is similar except that the mesothelium is the lining of each of the pair of coelomata , and the blood vessels and , in polychaetes , the main nerve cords are embedded in it . The mesothelium is made of modified <unk> cells ; in other words , their bodies form part of the epithelium but their bases extend to form muscle fibers in the body wall . The mesothelium may also form radial and circular muscles on the septa , and circular muscles around the blood vessels and gut . Parts of the mesothelium , especially on the outside of the gut , may also form <unk> cells that perform similar functions to the livers of vertebrates : producing and storing glycogen and fat ; producing the oxygen @-@ carrier hemoglobin ; breaking down proteins ; and turning nitrogenous waste products into ammonia and urea to be excreted . 
 Many annelids move by peristalsis ( waves of contraction and expansion that sweep along the body ) , or flex the body while using parapodia to crawl or swim . In these animals the septa enable the circular and longitudinal muscles to change the shape of individual segments , by making each segment a separate fluid @-@ filled " balloon " . However , the septa are often incomplete in annelids that are semi @-@ sessile or that do not move by peristalsis or by movements of parapodia – for example some move by whipping movements of the body , some small marine species move by means of cilia ( fine muscle @-@ powered hairs ) and some burrowers turn their pharynges ( throats ) inside out to penetrate the sea @-@ floor and drag themselves into it . 
 The fluid in the coelomata contains <unk> cells that defend the animals against parasites and infections . In some species <unk> may also contain a respiratory pigment – red hemoglobin in some species , green <unk> in others ( dissolved in the plasma ) – and provide oxygen transport within their segments . Respiratory pigment is also dissolved in the blood plasma . Species with well @-@ developed septa generally also have blood vessels running all long their bodies above and below the gut , the upper one carrying blood forwards while the lower one carries it backwards . Networks of capillaries in the body wall and around the gut transfer blood between the main blood vessels and to parts of the segment that need oxygen and nutrients . Both of the major vessels , especially the upper one , can pump blood by contracting . In some annelids the forward end of the upper blood vessel is enlarged with muscles to form a heart , while in the forward ends of many earthworms some of the vessels that connect the upper and lower main vessels function as hearts . Species with poorly developed or no septa generally have no blood vessels and rely on the circulation within the coelom for delivering nutrients and oxygen . 
 However , leeches and their closest relatives have a body structure that is very uniform within the group but significantly different from that of other annelids , including other members of the <unk> . In leeches there are no septa , the connective tissue layer of the body wall is so thick that it occupies much of the body , and the two coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body . They function as the main blood vessels , although they are side @-@ by @-@ side rather than upper and lower . However , they are lined with mesothelium , like the coelomata and unlike the blood vessels of other annelids . Leeches generally use suckers at their front and rear ends to move like inchworms . The anus is on the upper surface of the pygidium . 
 = = = Respiration = = = 
 In some annelids , including earthworms , all respiration is via the skin . However , many polychaetes and some clitellates ( the group to which earthworms belong ) have gills associated with most segments , often as extensions of the parapodia in polychaetes . The gills of tube @-@ dwellers and burrowers usually cluster around whichever end has the stronger water flow . 
 = = = Feeding and excretion = = = 
 Feeding structures in the mouth region vary widely , and have little correlation with the animals ' diets . Many polychaetes have a muscular pharynx that can be everted ( turned inside out to extend it ) . In these animals the foremost few segments often lack septa so that , when the muscles in these segments contract , the sharp increase in fluid pressure from all these segments everts the pharynx very quickly . Two families , the <unk> and <unk> , have evolved jaws , which can be used for seizing prey , biting off pieces of vegetation , or grasping dead and decaying matter . On the other hand , some predatory polychaetes have neither jaws nor eversible pharynges . Selective deposit feeders generally live in tubes on the sea @-@ floor and use palps to find food particles in the sediment and then wipe them into their mouths . Filter feeders use " crowns " of palps covered in cilia that wash food particles towards their mouths . Non @-@ selective deposit feeders ingest soil or marine sediments via mouths that are generally unspecialized . Some clitellates have sticky pads in the roofs of their mouths , and some of these can <unk> the pads to capture prey . Leeches often have an eversible proboscis , or a muscular pharynx with two or three teeth . 
 The gut is generally an almost straight tube supported by the mesenteries ( vertical partitions within segments ) , and ends with the anus on the underside of the pygidium . However , in members of the tube @-@ dwelling family Siboglinidae the gut is blocked by a swollen lining that houses symbiotic bacteria , which can make up 15 % of the worms ' total weight . The bacteria convert inorganic matter – such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from hydrothermal vents , or methane from seeps – to organic matter that feeds themselves and their hosts , while the worms extend their palps into the gas flows to absorb the gases needed by the bacteria . 
 Annelids with blood vessels use metanephridia to remove soluble waste products , while those without use protonephridia . Both of these systems use a two @-@ stage filtration process , in which fluid and waste products are first extracted and these are filtered again to re @-@ absorb any re @-@ usable materials while dumping toxic and spent materials as urine . The difference is that protonephridia combine both filtration stages in the same organ , while metanephridia perform only the second filtration and rely on other mechanisms for the first – in annelids special filter cells in the walls of the blood vessels let fluids and other small molecules pass into the coelomic fluid , where it circulates to the metanephridia . In annelids the points at which fluid enters the protonephridia or metanephridia are on the forward side of a septum while the second @-@ stage filter and the <unk> ( exit opening in the body wall ) are in the following segment . As a result , the hindmost segment ( before the growth zone and pygidium ) has no structure that extracts its wastes , as there is no following segment to filter and discharge them , while the first segment contains an extraction structure that passes wastes to the second , but does not contain the structures that re @-@ filter and discharge urine . 
 = = = Reproduction and life cycle = = = 
 = = = = Asexual reproduction = = = = 
 Polychaetes can reproduce asexually , by dividing into two or more pieces or by budding off a new individual while the parent remains a complete organism . Some oligochaetes , such as <unk> <unk> , seem to reproduce entirely asexually , while others reproduce asexually in summer and sexually in autumn . Asexual reproduction in oligochaetes is always by dividing into two or more pieces , rather than by budding . However , leeches have never been seen reproducing asexually . 
 Most polychaetes and oligochaetes also use similar mechanisms to regenerate after suffering damage . Two polychaete genera , <unk> and <unk> , can regenerate from a single segment , and others can regenerate even if their heads are removed . Annelids are the most complex animals that can regenerate after such severe damage . On the other hand , leeches cannot regenerate . 
 = = = = Sexual reproduction = = = = 
 It is thought that annelids were originally animals with two separate sexes , which released ova and sperm into the water via their nephridia . The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae , which live as plankton . Later they sink to the sea @-@ floor and metamorphose into miniature adults : the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium ( head ) ; a small area round the trochophore 's anus becomes the pygidium ( tail @-@ piece ) ; a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments ; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium ( the segment that contains the mouth ) . 
 However , the lifecycles of most living polychaetes , which are almost all marine animals , are unknown , and only about 25 % of the 300 + species whose lifecycles are known follow this pattern . About 14 % use a similar external fertilization but produce yolk @-@ rich eggs , which reduce the time the larva needs to spend among the plankton , or eggs from which miniature adults emerge rather than larvae . The rest care for the fertilized eggs until they hatch – some by producing jelly @-@ covered masses of eggs which they tend , some by attaching the eggs to their bodies and a few species by keeping the eggs within their bodies until they hatch . These species use a variety of methods for sperm transfer ; for example , in some the females collect sperm released into the water , while in others the males have a penis that inject sperm into the female . There is no guarantee that this is a representative sample of polychaetes ' reproductive patterns , and it simply reflects scientists ' current knowledge . 
 Some polychaetes breed only once in their lives , while others breed almost continuously or through several breeding seasons . While most polychaetes remain of one sex all their lives , a significant percentage of species are full hermaphrodites or change sex during their lives . Most polychaetes whose reproduction has been studied lack permanent gonads , and it is uncertain how they produce ova and sperm . In a few species the rear of the body splits off and becomes a separate individual that lives just long enough to swim to a suitable environment , usually near the surface , and spawn . 
 Most mature clitellates ( the group that includes earthworms and leeches ) are full hermaphrodites , although in a few leech species younger adults function as males and become female at maturity . All have well @-@ developed gonads , and all copulate . Earthworms store their partners ' sperm in spermathecae ( " sperm stores " ) and then the <unk> produces a cocoon that collects ova from the ovaries and then sperm from the spermathecae . Fertilization and development of earthworm eggs takes place in the cocoon . Leeches ' eggs are fertilized in the ovaries , and then transferred to the cocoon . In all clitellates the cocoon also either produces yolk when the eggs are fertilized or nutrients while they are developing . All clitellates hatch as miniature adults rather than larvae . 
 = = Ecological significance = = 
 Charles Darwin 's book The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms ( 1881 ) presented the first scientific analysis of earthworms ' contributions to soil fertility . Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface , generally in moist leaf litter . The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it , and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter , by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms , and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily . Earthworms are also important prey for birds ranging in size from robins to storks , and for mammals ranging from shrews to badgers , and in some cases conserving earthworms may be essential for conserving endangered birds . 
 Terrestrial annelids can be invasive in some situations . In the glaciated areas of North America , for example , almost all native earthworms are thought to have been killed by the glaciers and the worms currently found in those areas are all introduced from other areas , primarily from Europe , and , more recently , from Asia . Northern hardwood forests are especially negatively impacted by invasive worms through the loss of leaf duff , soil fertility , changes in soil chemistry and the loss of ecological diversity . Especially of concern is <unk> <unk> and at least one state ( Wisconsin ) has listed it as a prohibited species . 
 Earthworms migrate only a limited distance annually on their own , and the spread of invasive worms is increased rapidly by anglers and from worms or their cocoons in the dirt on vehicle tires or footwear . 
 Marine annelids may account for over one @-@ third of bottom @-@ dwelling animal species around coral reefs and in tidal zones . Burrowing species increase the penetration of water and oxygen into the sea @-@ floor sediment , which encourages the growth of populations of aerobic bacteria and small animals alongside their burrows . 
 Although blood @-@ sucking leeches do little direct harm to their victims , some transmit flagellates that can be very dangerous to their hosts . Some small tube @-@ dwelling oligochaetes transmit myxosporean parasites that cause whirling disease in fish . 
 = = Interaction with humans = = 
 Earthworms make a significant contribution to soil fertility . The rear end of the <unk> worm , a marine polychaete that tunnels through coral , detaches in order to spawn at the surface , and the people of Samoa regard these spawning modules as a delicacy . Anglers sometimes find that worms are more effective bait than artificial flies , and worms can be kept for several days in a tin lined with damp moss . Ragworms are commercially important as bait and as food sources for aquaculture , and there have been proposals to farm them in order to reduce over @-@ fishing of their natural populations . Some marine polychaetes ' predation on molluscs causes serious losses to fishery and aquaculture operations . 
 Scientists study aquatic annelids to monitor the oxygen content , salinity and pollution levels in fresh and marine water . 
 Accounts of the use of leeches for the medically dubious practise of blood @-@ letting have come from China around 30 AD , India around 200 AD , ancient Rome around 50 AD and later throughout Europe . In the 19th century medical demand for leeches was so high that some areas ' stocks were exhausted and other regions imposed restrictions or bans on exports , and <unk> medicinalis is treated as an endangered species by both IUCN and CITES . More recently leeches have been used to assist in microsurgery , and their saliva has provided anti @-@ inflammatory compounds and several important anticoagulants , one of which also prevents tumors from spreading . 
 Ragworms ' jaws are strong but much lighter than the hard parts of many other organisms , which are biomineralized with calcium salts . These advantages have attracted the attention of engineers . Investigations showed that <unk> jaws are made of unusual proteins that bind strongly to zinc . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 Since annelids are soft @-@ bodied , their fossils are rare . Polychaetes ' fossil record consists mainly of the jaws that some species had and the mineralized tubes that some secreted . Some Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia in some ways resemble polychaetes , but the similarities are too vague for these fossils to be classified with confidence . The small shelly fossil Cloudina , from 549 to 542 million years ago , has been classified by some authors as an annelid , but by others as a cnidarian ( i.e. in the phylum to which jellyfish and sea anemones belong ) . Until 2008 the earliest fossils widely accepted as annelids were the polychaetes <unk> and <unk> , both from Canada 's Burgess Shale , formed about 505 million years ago in the early Cambrian . Myoscolex , found in Australia and a little older than the Burgess Shale , was possibly an annelid . However , it lacks some typical annelid features and has features which are not usually found in annelids and some of which are associated with other phyla . Then Simon Conway Morris and John Peel reported <unk> from Sirius Passet , about 518 million years old , and concluded that it was the oldest annelid known to date . There has been vigorous debate about whether the Burgess Shale fossil Wiwaxia was a mollusc or an annelid . Polychaetes diversified in the early Ordovician , about 488 to 474 million years ago . It is not until the early Ordovician that the first annelid jaws are found , thus the crown @-@ group cannot have appeared before this date and probably appeared somewhat later . By the end of the Carboniferous , about 299 million years ago , fossils of most of the modern mobile polychaete groups had appeared . Many fossil tubes look like those made by modern sessile polychaetes , but the first tubes clearly produced by polychaetes date from the Jurassic , less than 199 million years ago . 
 The earliest good evidence for oligochaetes occurs in the Tertiary period , which began 65 million years ago , and it has been suggested that these animals evolved around the same time as flowering plants in the early Cretaceous , from 130 to 90 million years ago . A trace fossil consisting of a convoluted burrow partly filled with small fecal pellets may be evidence that earthworms were present in the early Triassic period from 251 to 245 million years ago . Body fossils going back to the mid Ordovician , from 472 to 461 million years ago , have been tentatively classified as oligochaetes , but these identifications are uncertain and some have been disputed . 
 = = = Family tree = = = 
 Traditionally the annelids have been divided into two major groups , the polychaetes and clitellates . In turn the clitellates were divided into oligochaetes , which include earthworms , and <unk> , whose best @-@ known members are leeches . For many years there was no clear arrangement of the approximately 80 polychaete families into higher @-@ level groups . In 1997 Greg Rouse and Kristian <unk> attempted a " first heuristic step in terms of bringing polychaete systematics to an acceptable level of rigour " , based on anatomical structures , and divided polychaetes into : 
 <unk> , less than 1 @,@ 000 burrowing species that look rather like earthworms . 
 <unk> , the great majority of polychaetes , divided into : 
 <unk> , which are distinguished by having long grooved palps that they use for feeding , and most of which live in tubes . 
 <unk> , the most active polychaetes , which have parapodia reinforced by internal spines ( <unk> ) . 
 Also in 1997 <unk> McHugh , using molecular phylogenetics to compare similarities and differences in one gene , presented a very different view , in which : the clitellates were an offshoot of one branch of the polychaete family tree ; the <unk> and echiurans , which for a few decades had been regarded as a separate phyla , were placed on other branches of the polychaete tree . Subsequent molecular phylogenetics analyses on a similar scale presented similar conclusions . 
 In 2007 Torsten Struck and colleagues compared 3 genes in 81 taxa , of which 9 were <unk> , in other words not considered closely related to annelids but included to give an indication of where the organisms under study are placed on the larger tree of life . For a cross @-@ check the study used an analysis of 11 genes ( including the original 3 ) in 10 taxa . This analysis agreed that clitellates , <unk> and echiurans were on various branches of the polychaete family tree . It also concluded that the classification of polychaetes into <unk> , <unk> and <unk> was useless , as the members of these alleged groups were scattered all over the family tree derived from comparing the 81 taxa . In addition , it also placed sipunculans , generally regarded at the time as a separate phylum , on another branch of the polychaete tree , and concluded that leeches were a sub @-@ group of oligochaetes rather than their sister @-@ group among the clitellates . Rouse accepted the analyses based on molecular phylogenetics , and their main conclusions are now the scientific consensus , although the details of the annelid family tree remain uncertain . 
 In addition to re @-@ writing the classification of annelids and 3 previously independent phyla , the molecular phylogenetics analyses undermine the emphasis that decades of previous writings placed on the importance of segmentation in the classification of invertebrates . Polychaetes , which these analyses found to be the parent group , have completely segmented bodies , while polychaetes ' echiurans and <unk> offshoots are not segmented and <unk> are segmented only in the rear parts of their bodies . It now seems that segmentation can appear and disappear much more easily in the course of evolution than was previously thought . The 2007 study also noted that the ladder @-@ like nervous system , which is associated with segmentation , is less universal previously thought in both annelids and arthropods . 
 Annelids are members of the protostomes , one of the two major <unk> of bilaterian animals – the other is the deuterostomes , which includes vertebrates . Within the protostomes , annelids used to be grouped with arthropods under the super @-@ group Articulata ( " jointed animals " ) , as segmentation is obvious in most members of both phyla . However , the genes that drive segmentation in arthropods do not appear to do the same in annelids . Arthropods and annelids both have close relatives that are unsegmented . It is at least as easy to assume that they evolved segmented bodies independently as it is to assume that the ancestral protostome or bilaterian was segmented and that segmentation disappeared in many descendant phyla . The current view is that annelids are grouped with molluscs , brachiopods and several other phyla that have lophophores ( fan @-@ like feeding structures ) and / or trochophore larvae as members of Lophotrochozoa . Bryozoa may be the most basal phylum ( the one that first became distinctive ) within the Lophotrochozoa , and the relationships between the other members are not yet known . Arthropods are now regarded as members of the Ecdysozoa ( " animals that molt " ) , along with some phyla that are unsegmented . 
 The " Lophotrochozoa " hypothesis is also supported by the fact that many phyla within this group , including annelids , molluscs , nemerteans and flatworms , follow a similar pattern in the fertilized egg 's development . When their cells divide after the 4 @-@ cell stage , descendants of these 4 cells form a spiral pattern . In these phyla the " fates " of the embryo 's cells , in other words the roles their descendants will play in the adult animal , are the same and can be predicted from a very early stage . Hence this development pattern is often described as " spiral determinate cleavage " .

 " Hunting Trip " is the tenth episode of the second season of American comedy television series Parks and Recreation , and the sixteenth overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on November 19 , 2009 . In the episode , Leslie tries to prove she can hang out with the guys by attending Ron 's annual hunting trip , where Ron is accidentally shot . 
 The episode was written by Daniel J. Goor and was directed by series co @-@ creator Greg Daniels . It also introduced a romantic subplot between the characters Andy and April which continued throughout the second season and into the third . Series co @-@ creator Michael Schur said the pairing was not previously planned , but grew when it was discovered actors Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt had strong comedic chemistry together . 
 According to Nielsen Media Research , " Hunting Trip " was seen by 4 @.@ 61 million viewers , a slight drop from the previous week 's episode , " The Camel " . The episode received generally positive to mixed reviews , with commentators particularly praising the Andy and April subplot , as well as the continued development of Leslie Knope 's character . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode opens with Andy ( Chris Pratt ) giving piggyback rides to everyone in the parks department . Later , Ron ( Nick Offerman ) , Jerry ( Jim O 'Heir ) and Mark ( Paul Schneider ) look forward to their annual " trail survey " , which is actually a yearly secret hunting trip . Determined to prove she can be just like one of the guys around the office , Leslie insists the ladies of the parks department attend the trip this year , as well as Tom ( Aziz Ansari ) , who has also never been invited . Ron is visibly disappointed . 
 Leslie asks April ( Aubrey Plaza ) to check on a budgeting request while they are gone . What should be a simple chore , however , has April waiting on hold at the phone for hours . When she desperately has to use the restroom , Andy agrees to wait by the phone . When she returns , the two start to bond by making up their own lyrics to the hold music , playing a non @-@ water game of Marco Polo around the office , and seeing who can make the best spit @-@ take . When Andy says he is jealous that his ex @-@ girlfriend Ann ( Rashida Jones ) is going to the hunting trip with Mark , April offers to give him a <unk> to make Ann jealous , which Andy accepts . 
 Meanwhile , the others arrive at the cabin for the hunting trip . Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) proves to be an excellent hunter and bags the first quail . Growing increasingly agitated , Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can , and they split up . After a few hours of hunting , Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head . Ann , a nurse , takes Ron back to the cabin , where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious . Ron asks whether Leslie shot him , but she insists she did not . Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch , which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting , despite fierce opposition from Ron himself . 
 The others discuss who shot Ron , and Tom creates a minor panic when he suggests perhaps an outsider is hunting them . Ann takes Leslie aside and says she knows who shot Ron , and a few minutes later Leslie admits to the group that she was the shooter , even though Ann knows this is not the case . A park ranger ( Jay Johnston ) arrives and interrogates Leslie , implying that the accident is the result of her femininity . Leslie knows that she is a good hunter , but goes along with the ranger 's sexist implications in order to appease him . Later , a bandaged Ron repeatedly berates Leslie , prompting Ann to insist Tom come forward . Tom admits he shot Ron , and that Leslie covered for him because he did not have his hunting license , which could have resulted in a $ 25 @,@ 000 fine and prison time . Ron is impressed with Leslie , whom he calls a " stand @-@ up guy " . The episode ends with a get well party for Ron , where Ann is unimpressed with Andy 's <unk> , and the whole party is horrified by Ron 's head wound .

Series co @-@ creator Michael Schur said the pairing was not previously planned , but grew when it was discovered during the filming of " Hunting Trip " that actors Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt had strong comedic chemistry together . However , Schur also said the idea to pair them together in " Hunting Trip " stemmed in part from a line Plaza improvised in the first season finale " Rock Show " , when Andy explained his style of music and April replied that she completely understood him . Schur said , " At the time , it was this little nothing , throwaway thing , but when we watched it , we thought there might be something there . " 
 During a November 2009 panel at the Paley Center for Media in New York City , Plaza said , " You 're going to see more scenes with Andy and April . There could be a love connection for them . " Daniels said some of his favorite moments from the series were in " Hunting Trip " and he particularly loved the " interpersonal stuff " between Andy and April , who he described as " two characters that you didn 't know had any interest in one another " . Pratt specifically sought to make Plaza laugh during their scene together and was ultimately successful . He told Daniels before filming , " I 'm gonna get something out of her . " " Hunting Trip " included a scene in which Leslie tells the state trooper multiple reasons or excuses for why she apparently shot Ron , all of which were edited together in a series of jump cuts . The technique has been commonly used throughout the Parks and Recreation series to condense multiple takes of improvisation from Poehler .

 In its original American broadcast on November 19 , 2009 , " Hunting Trip " was seen by 4 @.@ 61 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research . " Hunting Trip " drew a 2 @.@ 0 rating / 6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49 . It constituted about a five percent drop in viewership from the previous week 's episode , " The Camel " , which itself was a five percent drop from the previous episode , " Ron and Tammy " . The episode received generally positive reviews , with several particularly praising the subplot between Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt . Reviewers also praised the continued developed of the Leslie Knope character , who proves to be intelligent and capable in " Hunting Trip " , rather than the clueless protagonist she appeared to be in earlier episodes . In 2011 , New York magazine writer called it " one of the breakout episodes that saw the show finding its momentum and figuring out how to transfer the dynamic outside of the office " . 
 Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger said " Hunting Trip " was not as funny as the previous episode , " The Camel " , but that it included excellent physical comedy like Ron 's refusal to throw up , and Andy 's piggyback rides throughout Pawnee town hall . Sepinwall also praised Leslie 's intelligence and savvy , which he said differentiates the show from Greg Daniels ' other show , The Office and its protagonist Michael Scott . IGN writer Matt Fowler particularly praised the pairing of Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt , which he called simultaneously funny , naturalistic and sweet . Fowler said the main hunting plot was funny , but " I 'm not a huge fan of horrific personal injury as a vehicle for humor " . Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said he liked the episode , but that the main hunting subplot was messy because there was too much action involving too many supporting cast members . Heisler said the Andy and April subplot was more effective . Slate magazine writer Jonah Weiner praised " Hunting Trip " , especially the scene in which the characters become convinced they are being stalked by the Predator , the alien antagonist from the 1987 film of the same name . Weiner called it a " detour into an inspired absurdity that tugs against and tweaks the show 's bureaucratic backdrop " . Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik said " Hunting Trip " demonstrated how far Leslie Knope had developed since the first season . Poniewozik praised the " ultra @-@ deadpan " pairing of Andy and April , which he said was another in a continued line of " interesting combinations for its side players " .

 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from August 20 , 1910 . It states : " May Merrill and Will Marshall are sweethearts and both reporters on the Daily Wave . Will leaves the paper to accept a position of private secretary to Blake , commissioner of public works . Shortly after Will takes up his new work Blake is threatened with exposure and punishment on his charge of accepting a bribe .

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . Though the roles of the actors are unknown , it is likely that numerous other character roles and persons appeared in the film . Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions . The cast could include either or both leading ladies of the company , Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming . One of the more prominent leading male actors was Frank H. Crane . 
 Though critics would reveal that the plot strained plausibility , the little known production details surrounding the film show that the Thanhouser staging was effective to one reviewer . Recently , the quality of the Thanhouser films were commended in an editorial by " The Spectator " in The New York Dramatic Mirror contained specific praise for Thanhouser productions by stating , " ... practically all other Independent American companies , excepting Thanhouser , show haste and lack of thought in their production . Crude stories are crudely handled , giving the impression that they are rushed through in a hurry - anything to get a thousand feet of negative ready for the market . Such pictures , of course , do not cost much to produce , but they are not of a class to make reputation . The Thanhouser company , alone of the Independents , shows a consistent effort to do things worthwhile ... " Bowers would note that the plot focusing on a female reporter would prove to be a popular subject and referred to The Girl Reporter 's Big Scoop by the Kalem Company and Perils of Our Girl Reporter by Niagara Film Studios @-@ Mutual . Bowers also included another production bearing the same name The Girl Reporter by the Crystal Film Company in 1913 . Another girl reporter would be featured A Columbus Day Conspiracy by the Thanhouser Company .

A good , healthy , vigorous production in every sense . " The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer said the acting was good , but found fault with the plot itself . The reviewer states , " This film story has melodramatic interest , and the acting is good , but the means by which some of the incidents are brought about will not stand the acid test . For instance , if a political boss wants to ' shake down ' a traction company for $ 5 @,@ 000 , would he submit the proposition in writing ? ...

 = Barton Fink = 
 Barton Fink is a 1991 American period film written , produced , directed and edited by the Coen brothers . Set in 1941 , it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood , and John Goodman as Charlie , the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run @-@ down Hotel Earle . 
 The Coens wrote the screenplay in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during the writing of Miller 's Crossing . Soon after Miller 's Crossing was finished , the Coens began filming Barton Fink , which had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991 . In a rare sweep , Barton Fink won the Palme d 'Or , as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor ( Turturro ) . Although the film received critical acclaim and was nominated for three Academy Awards , it was a box office bomb , only grossing $ 6 million against its $ 9 million budget . The process of writing and the culture of entertainment production are two prominent themes of Barton Fink . The world of Hollywood is contrasted with that of Broadway , and the film analyzes superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture . Other themes in the film include fascism and World War II ; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries ; and how intellectuals relate to " the common man " . Because of its diverse elements , the film has defied efforts at genre classification , being variously referred to as a film noir , a horror film , a Künstlerroman , and a buddy film . 
 The feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the development of the story , and careful deliberation went into its design . There is a sharp contrast between Fink 's living quarters and the polished , pristine environs of Hollywood , especially the home of Jack Lipnick . On the wall of Fink 's room there hangs a single picture of a woman at the beach ; this captures Barton 's attention , and the image reappears in the final scene of the film . Although the picture and other elements of the film ( including a mysterious box given to Fink by Charlie ) appear laden with symbolism , critics disagree over their possible meanings . The Coens have acknowledged some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any message in the film overall . The film contains allusions to many real @-@ life people and events , most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner . The characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew are widely seen as fictional representations of these men , but the Coens stress important differences . They have also admitted to parodying film magnates like Louis B. Mayer , but they note that Fink 's agonizing tribulations in Hollywood are not meant to reflect their own experiences . 
 Barton Fink was influenced by several earlier works , including the films of Roman Polanski , particularly Repulsion ( 1965 ) and The Tenant ( 1976 ) . Other influences are Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining and Preston Sturges 's Sullivan 's Travels . The film contains a number of literary allusions to works by William Shakespeare , John Keats , and Flannery O 'Connor , and in particular , Nikos Kazantzakis 's novel , Zorba the Greek . There are also religious overtones , including references to the Book of Daniel , King Nebuchadnezzar , and Bathsheba .

 In 1941 , Barton Fink 's first Broadway play , Bare Ruined Choirs , has achieved critical and popular success . His agent informs him that Capitol Pictures in Hollywood has offered him a thousand dollars per week to write film scripts . Barton hesitates , worried that moving to California would separate him from " the common man " , his focus as a writer . He accepts the offer , however , and checks into the Hotel Earle , a large and unusually deserted building . His room is sparse and draped in subdued colors ; its only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach , arm raised to block the sun . 
 In his first meeting with Capitol Pictures boss Jack Lipnick , Barton explains that he chose the Earle because he wants lodging that is ( as Lipnick says ) " less Hollywood " . Lipnick promises that his only concern is Barton 's writing ability and assigns his new employee to a wrestling film . Back in his room , however , Barton is unable to write . He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door , and he phones the front desk to complain . His neighbor , Charlie Meadows , is the source of the noise and visits Barton to apologize , insisting on sharing some alcohol from a hip flask to make amends . As they talk , Barton proclaims his affection for " the common man " , and Charlie describes his life as an insurance salesman . Later , Barton falls asleep , but is awakened by the incessant whine of a mosquito . 
 Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script , Barton consults producer Ben Geisler for advice . Irritated , the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance . While in the men 's room , Barton meets the novelist William Preston ( W.P. ) " Bill " Mayhew , who is vomiting in the next stall . They briefly discuss movie writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day . When Barton arrives , Mayhew is drunk and yelling wildly . His secretary , Audrey Taylor , <unk> the meeting and confesses to Barton that she and Mayhew are in love . When they finally meet for lunch , Mayhew , Audrey , and Barton discuss writing and drinking . Before long , Mayhew argues with Audrey , slaps her , and wanders off , drunk . Rejecting Barton 's offer of consolation , Audrey explains that she feels sorry for Mayhew since he is married to another woman who is " disturbed " . 
 With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the movie , Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance . She visits him at the Earle , and after she admits that she wrote most of Mayhew 's scripts , they apparently have sex ; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so . When Barton awakens the next morning , he , again , hears the sound of the mosquito , finds it on Audrey 's back , and slaps it dead . When Audrey does not respond , Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered . He has no memory of the night 's events . Horrified , he summons Charlie and asks for help . Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the police . After a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick , Barton tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie , who announces he is going to New York for several days . Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him to watch it . 
 Soon afterward , Barton is visited by two police detectives , who inform him that Charlie 's real name is Karl " Madman " Mundt . Mundt is a serial killer wanted for several murders ; after shooting his victims , they explain , he decapitates them and keeps the heads . Stunned , Barton returns to his room and examines the box . Placing it on his desk without opening it , he begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting . After a night of celebratory dancing , Barton returns to find the detectives in his room , who , after handcuffing Barton to the bed , then reveal they 've found evidence of Mundt 's latest murders . Each of the men notes how hot it is , and Charlie appears , and does the same ; soon the source of heat is revealed : the hotel has become engulfed in flames . Running through the hallway , screaming , Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun . As the hallway burns , Charlie speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel , breaks the bed frame to which Barton is handcuffed ( thus freeing him ) , then retires to his own room , saying as he goes that he paid a visit to Barton 's parents and uncle in New York . Barton leaves the ( still @-@ burning ) hotel , carrying the box and his script . Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family , but there is no answer . 
 In a final meeting , a disappointed Lipnick , in uniform ( as he attempts to secure an Army Reserve commission ) , angrily chastises Barton for writing " a fruity movie about suffering " then informs him that he is to remain in Los Angeles ; although Barton will remain under contract , Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes so he can be ridiculed as a loser around the studio while Lipnick is in the war . Dazed , Barton wanders onto a beach , still carrying the package . He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle , and she asks about the box . He tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it . She then assumes the pose from the picture .

 = = = Background and writing = = = 
 In 1989 , filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen began writing the script for a film eventually released as Miller 's Crossing . The many threads of the story became complicated , and after four months they found themselves lost in the process . Although biographers and critics later referred to it as writer 's block , the Coen brothers rejected this description . " It 's not really the case that we were suffering from writer 's block , " Joel said in a 1991 interview , " but our working speed had slowed , and we were eager to get a certain distance from Miller 's Crossing . " They went from Los Angeles to New York and began work on a different project . 
 In three weeks , the Coens wrote a script with a title role written specifically for actor John Turturro , with whom they 'd been working on Miller 's Crossing . The new movie , Barton Fink , was set in a large , seemingly @-@ abandoned hotel . This setting , which they named the Hotel Earle , was a driving force behind the story and mood of the new project . While filming their 1984 film Blood Simple in Austin , Texas , the Coens had seen a hotel which made a significant impression : " We thought , ' Wow , Motel Hell . ' You know , being condemned to live in the weirdest hotel in the world . " 
 The writing process for Barton Fink was smooth , they said , suggesting that the relief of being away from Miller 's Crossing may have been a catalyst . They also felt satisfied with the overall shape of the story , which helped them move quickly through the composition . " Certain films come entirely in one 's head ; we just sort of burped out Barton Fink . " While writing , the Coens created a second leading role with another actor in mind : John Goodman , who had appeared in their 1987 comedy Raising Arizona . His new character , Charlie , was Barton 's next @-@ door neighbor in the cavernous hotel . Even before writing , the Coens knew how the story would end , and wrote Charlie 's final speech at the start of the writing process . 
 The script served its diversionary purpose , and the Coens put it aside : " Barton Fink sort of washed out our brain and we were able to go back and finish Miller 's Crossing . " Once production of the first movie was finished , the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink . Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role , and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project : " I felt I could bring something more human to Barton . Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution . I tried to go a little further than they expected . " 
 As they designed detailed storyboards for Barton Fink , the Coens began looking for a new cinematographer , since their associate Barry Sonnenfeld – who had filmed their first three movies – was occupied with his own directorial debut , The Addams Family . The Coens had been impressed with the work of English cinematographer Roger Deakins , particularly the interior scenes of the 1988 film Stormy Monday . After screening other films he had worked on ( including Sid and Nancy and <unk> 's Island ) , they sent a script to Deakins and invited him to join the project . His agent advised against working with the Coens , but Deakins met with them at a cafe in Notting Hill and they soon began working together on Barton Fink . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming began in June 1990 and took eight weeks ( a third less time than required by Miller 's Crossing ) , and the estimated final budget for the movie was US $ 9 million . The Coens worked well with Deakins , and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film . " There was only one moment we surprised him , " Joel Coen recalled later . An extended scene called for a tracking shot out of the bedroom and into a sink drain " plug hole " in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse . " The shot was a lot of fun and we had a great time working out how to do it , " Joel said . " After that , every time we asked Roger to do something difficult , he would raise an eyebrow and say , ' Don 't be having me track down any plug @-@ holes now . ' " 
 Three weeks of filming were spent in the Hotel Earle , a set created by art director Dennis Gassner . The film 's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel 's hallway , which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post @-@ production . When they decided to use real flames , however , the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach . A series of gas jets were installed behind the hallway , and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration . As Goodman ran through the hallway , a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet , giving the impression of a fire racing ahead of Charlie . Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus , and a second hallway ( sans fire ) stood ready nearby for filming pick @-@ up shots between takes . The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach , as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock . 
 The Coens edited the film themselves , as is their custom . " We prefer a hands @-@ on approach , " Joel explained in 1996 , " rather than sitting next to someone and telling them what to cut . " Because of rules for membership in film production guilds , they are required to use a pseudonym ; " Roderick Jaynes " is credited with editing Barton Fink . Only a few filmed scenes were removed from the final cut , including a transition scene to show Barton 's movement from New York to Hollywood . ( In the movie , this is shown enigmatically with a wave crashing against a rock . ) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios were also filmed , but edited out because they were " too conventional " . 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 The spooky , inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the Coens ' conception of the movie . " We wanted an art deco stylization " , Joel explained in a 1991 interview , " and a place that was falling into ruin after having seen better days " . Barton 's room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building . The Coens later described the hotel as a " ghost ship floating adrift , where you notice signs of the presence of other passengers , without ever laying eyes on any " . In the movie , residents ' shoes are an indication of this unseen presence ; another rare sign of other inhabitants is the sound from adjacent rooms . Joel said : " You can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers , with pathetic sex lives , who cry alone in their rooms " . 
 Heat and moisture are other important elements of the setting . The wallpaper in Barton 's room peels and droops ; Charlie experiences the same problem and guesses heat is the cause . The Coens used green and yellow colors liberally in designing the hotel " to suggest an aura of putrefaction " . 
 The atmosphere of the hotel was meant to connect with the character of Charlie . As Joel explained : " Our intention , moreover , was that the hotel function as an exteriorization of the character played by John Goodman . The sweat drips off his forehead like the paper peels off the walls . At the end , when Goodman says that he is a prisoner of his own mental state , that this is like some kind of hell , it was necessary for the hotel to have already suggested something infernal . " The peeling wallpaper and the paste which seeps through it also mirror Charlie 's chronic ear infection and the resultant pus . 
 When Barton first arrives at the Hotel Earle , he is asked by the friendly bellhop Chet ( Steve Buscemi ) if he is " a trans or a res " – transient or resident . Barton explains that he isn 't sure but will be staying " indefinitely " . The dichotomy between permanent inhabitants and guests reappears several times , notably in the hotel 's motto , " A day or a lifetime " , which Barton notices on the room 's stationery . This idea returns at the end of the movie , when Charlie describes Barton as " a tourist with a typewriter " . His ability to leave the Earle ( while Charlie remains ) is presented by critic Erica Rowell as evidence that Barton 's story represents the process of writing itself . Barton , she says , represents an author who is able to leave a story , while characters like Charlie cannot . 
 In contrast , the offices of Capitol Pictures and Lipnick 's house are pristine , lavishly decorated , and extremely comfortable . The company 's rooms are bathed in sunlight , and Ben Geisler 's office faces a lush array of flora . Barton meets Lipnick in one scene beside an enormous , spotless swimming pool . This echoes his position as studio head , as he explains : " ... you can 't always be honest , not with the sharks swimming around this town ... if I 'd been totally honest , I wouldn 't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it . " In his office , Lipnick showcases another trophy of his power : statues of Atlas , the Titan of Greek mythology who declared war on the gods of Mount Olympus and was severely punished . 
 Barton watches dailies from another wrestling film being made by Capitol Pictures ; the date on the clapperboard is December 9 , two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor . Later , when Barton celebrates the completed script by dancing at a USO show , he is surrounded by soldiers . In Lipnick 's next appearance , he wears a colonel 's uniform , which is really a costume from his company . Lipnick has not actually entered the military but declares himself ready to fight the " little yellow bastards " . Originally , this historical moment just after the United States entered World War II was to have a significant impact on the Hotel Earle . As the Coens explained : " [ W ] e were thinking of a hotel where the lodgers were old people , the insane , the physically handicapped , because all the others had left for the war . The further the script was developed , the more this theme got left behind , but it had led us , in the beginning , to settle on that period . " 
 = = = = The Picture = = = = 
 The picture in Barton 's room of a woman at the beach is a central focus for both the character and camera . He examines it frequently while at his desk , and after finding Audrey 's corpse in his bed he goes to stand near it . The image is repeated at the end of the film , when he meets an identical @-@ looking woman at an identical @-@ looking beach , who strikes an identical pose . After complimenting her beauty , he asks her : " Are you in pictures ? " She blushes and replies : " Don 't be silly . " 
 The Coens decided early in the writing process to include the picture as a key element in the room . " Our intention , " Joel explained later , " was that the room would have very little decoration , that the walls would be bare and that the windows would offer no view of any particular interest . In fact , we wanted the only opening on the exterior world to be this picture . It seemed important to us to create a feeling of isolation . " 
 Later in the film , Barton places into the frame a small picture of Charlie , dressed in a fine suit and holding a briefcase . The juxtaposition of his neighbor in the uniform of an insurance salesman and the escapist image of the woman on the beach leads to a confusion of reality and fantasy for Barton . Critic Michael Dunne notes : " [ V ] <unk> can only wonder how ' real ' Charlie is . ... In the film 's final shot ... viewers must wonder how ' real ' [ the woman ] is . The question leads to others : How real is Fink ? Lipnick ? Audrey ? Mayhew ? How real are films anyway ? " 
 The picture 's significance has been the subject of broad speculation . Washington Post reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact , the final scene " feels more like a punchline for punchline 's sake , a trumped @-@ up coda " . In her book @-@ length analysis of the Coen brothers ' films , Rowell suggests that Barton 's fixation on the picture is ironic , considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture ( speeches to the contrary notwithstanding ) . She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it . At one point , the camera moves past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach . This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film , when Barton finds himself – in a sense – inside the picture . 
 Critic M. Keith Booker calls the final scene an " enigmatic comment on representation and the relationship between art and reality " . He suggests that the identical images point to the absurdity of art which reflects life directly . The film transposes the woman directly from art to reality , prompting confusion in the viewer ; Booker asserts that such a literal depiction therefore leads inevitably to uncertainty . 
 = = Genre = = 
 The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification . Although they refer to their first film , Blood Simple ( 1984 ) , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction , the Coens wrote their next script , Raising Arizona ( 1987 ) , without trying to fit a particular genre . They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls " a pretty savage film " . Their third film , Miller 's Crossing ( 1990 ) , reversed this order , mixing bits of comedy into a crime film . Yet it also subverts single @-@ genre identity by using conventions from melodrama , love stories , and political satire . 
 This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ( 1991 ) ; the Coens insist the film " does not belong to any genre " . Ethan has described it as " a buddy movie for the ' 90s " . It contains elements of comedy , film noir , and horror , but other film categories are present . Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story , while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a Künstlerroman , highlighting the importance of the main character 's evolution as a writer . Critic Donald Lyons describes the movie as " a retro @-@ surrealist vision " . 
 Because it crosses genres , fragments the characters ' experiences , and resists straightforward narrative resolution , Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film . In his book Postmodern Hollywood , Booker says the movie renders the past with an impressionist technique , not a precise accuracy . This technique , he notes , is " typical of postmodern film , which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material " . In his analysis of the Coens ' films , Palmer calls Barton Fink a " postmodern pastiche " which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves . He compares it to The Hours ( 2002 ) , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work . He asserts that both films , far from rejecting the importance of the past , add to our understanding of it . He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon : the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films " does not deny the existence of the past ; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its <unk> remains " . 
 Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism : the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio 's desire to create formulaic high @-@ profit films ; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism . The Coens ' cinematic style is another example ; when Barton and Audrey begin making love , the camera pans away to the bathroom , then moves toward the sink and down its drain . Rowell calls this a " postmodern update " of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel , used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest ( 1959 ) . 
 = = Style = = 
 Barton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story 's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes . For example , the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle 's wallpaper , as the camera moves downward . This motion is repeated many times in the film , especially pursuant to Barton 's claim that his job is to " plumb the depths " while writing . His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope ; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor , carrying a shoe ( which he has presumably been polishing ) suggesting the real activity is underground . Although Barton 's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby , the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending . These elements – combined with many dramatic pauses , surreal dialogue , and implied threats of violence – create an atmosphere of extreme tension . The Coens explained that " the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe . And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling " . 
 The style of Barton Fink is also evocative – and representative – of films of the 1930s and ' 40s . As critic Michael Dunne points out : " Fink 's heavy overcoat , his hat , his dark , drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties , but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties . " The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre @-@ WWII filmmaking . Even Charlie 's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack <unk> . At the same time , camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original . Careful tracking shots and extreme close @-@ ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century . 
 From the start , the film moves continuously between Barton 's subjective view of the world and one which is objective . After the opening credits roll , the camera pans down to Barton , watching the end of his play . Soon we see the audience from his point of view , cheering wildly for him . As he walks forward , he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view . This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene . 
 The shifting point of view coincides with the movie 's subject matter : filmmaking . The film begins with the end of a play , and the story explores the process of creation . This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera 's focus in the first scene on Barton ( who is mouthing the words spoken by actors offscreen ) , not on the play he is watching . As Rowell says : " [ T ] hough we listen to one scene , we watch another . ... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two ' views ' of artifice : the world created by the protagonist ( his play ) and the world outside it ( what goes into creating a performance ) " . 
 The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques . Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton , the word " head " appears 60 times in the original screenplay . In a grim nod to later events , Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his " job " of selling insurance : " Fire , theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people . " 
 = = = Symbolism = = = 
 Much has been written about the symbolic meanings of Barton Fink . Rowell proposes that it is " a figurative head swelling of ideas that all lead back to the artist " . The proximity of the sex scene to Audrey 's murder prompts Lyons to insist : " Sex in Barton Fink is death " . Others have suggested that the second half of the movie is an extended dream sequence . 
 The Coens , however , have denied any intent to create a systematic unity from symbols in the film . " We never , ever go into our films with anything like that in mind " , Joel said in a 1998 interview . " There 's never anything approaching that kind of specific intellectual breakdown . It 's always a bunch of instinctive things that feel right , for whatever reason " . The Coens have noted their comfort with unresolved ambiguity . Ethan said in 1991 : " Barton Fink does end up telling you what 's going on to the extent that it 's important to know ... What isn 't crystal clear isn 't intended to become crystal clear , and it 's fine to leave it at that . " Regarding fantasies and dream sequences , he said : 
 It is correct to say that we wanted the spectator to share in the interior life of Barton Fink as well as his point of view . But there was no need to go too far . For example , it would have been incongruous for Barton Fink to wake up at the end of the film and for us to suggest thereby that he actually inhabited a reality greater than what is depicted in the film . In any case , it is always artificial to talk about " reality " in regard to a fictional character . 
 The homoerotic overtones of Barton 's relationship with Charlie are not unintentional . Although one detective demands to know if they had " some sick sex thing " , their intimacy is presented as anything but deviant , and cloaked in conventions of mainstream sexuality . Charlie 's first friendly overture toward his neighbor , for example , comes in the form of a standard pick @-@ up line : " I 'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you 'd let me buy you a drink " . The wrestling scene between Barton and Charlie is also cited as an example of homoerotic affection . " We consider that a sex scene " , Joel Coen said in 2001 . 
 = = = Sound and music = = = 
 Many of the sound effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning . For example , Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York ; its sound is light and pleasant . By contrast , the eerie sustained bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby , until Chet silences it . The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries , moans , and assorted unidentifiable noises . These sounds coincide with Barton 's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie 's claim that " I hear everything that goes on in this dump " . The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton 's move west , mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashing – an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter . 
 Another symbolic sound is the hum of a mosquito . Although his producer insists that these parasites don 't live in Los Angeles ( since " mosquitos breed in swamps ; this is a desert " ) , its distinctive sound is heard clearly as Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room . Later , he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face . The insect also figures prominently into the revelation of Audrey 's death ; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she 's been murdered . The high pitch of the mosquito 's hum is echoed in the high strings used for the movie 's score . During filming , the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated . 
 The score was composed by Carter Burwell , who has worked with the Coens since their first film . Unlike earlier projects , however – the Irish folk tune used for Miller 's Crossing and an American folk song as the basis for Raising Arizona – Burwell wrote the music for Barton Fink without a specific inspiration . The score was released in 1996 on a compact disc , combined with the score for the Coens ' film Fargo ( 1996 ) . 
 Several songs used in the film are laden with meaning . At one point Mayhew stumbles away from Barton and Audrey , drunk . As he wanders , he hollers the folk song " Old Black Joe " ( 1853 ) . Composed by Stephen Foster , it tells the tale of an elderly slave preparing to join his friends in " a better land " . Mayhew 's rendition of the song coincides with his condition as an oppressed employee of Capitol Pictures , and it foreshadows Barton 's own situation at the movie 's end . 
 When he finishes writing his script , Barton celebrates by dancing at a USO show . The song used in this scene is a rendition of " Down South Camp Meeting " , a swing tune . Its lyrics ( unheard in the film ) state : " Git ready ( Sing ) / Here they come ! The choir 's all set " . These lines echo the title of Barton 's play , Bare Ruined Choirs . As the celebration erupts into a melee , the intensity of the music increases , and the camera zooms into the cavernous hollow of a trumpet . This sequence mirrors the camera 's zoom into a sink drain just before Audrey is murdered earlier in the film . 
 = = = Clifford Odets = = = 
 The character of Barton Fink is based loosely on Clifford Odets , a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre , a gathering of dramatists which included Harold <unk> , Cheryl Crawford , and Lee Strasberg . Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski 's system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible . Several of Odets ' plays were successfully performed on Broadway , including Awake and Sing ! and Waiting for Lefty ( both in 1935 ) . When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward the familial realism of Eugene O 'Neill , Odets had difficulty producing successful work , so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts . 
 The Coens wrote with Odets in mind ; they imagined Barton Fink as " a serious dramatist , honest , politically engaged , and rather naive " . As Ethan said in 1991 : " It seemed natural that he comes from Group Theater and the decade of the thirties . " Like Odets , Barton believes that the theatre should celebrate the trials and triumphs of everyday people ; like Barton , Odets was highly egotistical . In the movie , a review of Barton 's play Bare Ruined Choirs indicates that his characters face a " brute struggle for existence ... in the most squalid corners " . This wording is similar to the comment of biographer Gerald <unk> that Odets ' characters " struggle for life amidst petty conditions " . Lines of dialogue from Barton 's work are reminiscent of Odets ' play Awake and Sing ! . For example , one character declares : " I 'm awake now , awake for the first time " . Another says : " Take that ruined choir . Make it sing " . 
 However , many important differences exist between the two men . Joel Coen said : " Both writers wrote the same kind of plays with proletarian heroes , but their personalities were quite different . Odets was much more of an extrovert ; in fact he was quite sociable even in Hollywood , and this is not the case with Barton Fink ! " Although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in New York , Odets was successful during his time in Hollywood . Several of his later plays were adapted – by him and others – into movies . One of these , The Big Knife ( 1955 ) , matches Barton 's life much more than Odets ' . In it , an actor becomes overwhelmed by the greed of a movie studio which hires him and eventually commits suicide . Another similarity to Odets ' work is Audrey 's death , which mirrors a scene in Deadline at Dawn ( 1946 ) , a film noir written by Odets . In that film , a character awakens to find that the woman he bedded the night before has been inexplicably murdered . 
 Odets chronicled his difficult transition from Broadway to Hollywood in his diary , published as The Time Is Ripe : The 1940 Journal of Clifford Odets ( 1988 ) . The diary explored Odets ' philosophical deliberations about writing and romance . He often invited women into his apartment , and he describes many of his affairs in the diary . These experiences , like the extended speeches about writing , are echoed in Barton Fink when Audrey visits and seduces Barton at the Hotel Earle . Turturro was the only member of the production who read Odets ' Journal , however , and the Coen brothers urge audiences to " take account of the difference between the character and the man " . 
 = = = William Faulkner = = = 
 Some similarities exist between the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist William Faulkner . Like Mayhew , Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of Southern literature and later worked in the movie business . Like Faulkner , Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood . Faulkner 's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book City of Nets , which the Coens read while creating Barton Fink . Ethan explained in 1998 : " I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture .... That was part of what got us going on the whole Barton Fink thing . " Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called Flesh ( 1932 ) , which starred Wallace Beery , the actor for whom Barton is writing . The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens , as they participated in the sport in high school . 
 However , the Coens disavow a significant connection between Faulkner and Mayhew , calling the similarities " superficial " . " As far as the details of the character are concerned , " Ethan said in 1991 , " Mayhew is very different from Faulkner , whose experiences in Hollywood were not the same at all . " Unlike Mayhew 's inability to write due to drink and personal problems , Faulkner continued to pen novels after working in the movie business , winning several awards for fiction completed during and after his time in Hollywood . 
 = = = Jack Lipnick = = = 
 Lerner 's Academy Award @-@ nominated character of studio mogul Jack Lipnick is a composite of several Hollywood producers , including Harry Cohn , Louis B. Mayer , and Jack L. Warner – three of the most powerful men in the film industry at the time in which Barton Fink is set . Like Mayer , Lipnick is originally from the Belarusian capital city Minsk . When World War II broke out , Warner pressed for a position in the military and ordered his wardrobe department to create a military uniform for him ; Lipnick does the same in his final scene . Warner once referred to writers as " <unk> with Underwoods " , leading to Barton 's use in the film of an Underwood typewriter . 
 At the same time , the Coens stress that the labyrinth of deception and difficulty Barton endures is not based on their own experience . Although Joel has said that artists tend to " meet up with Philistines " , he added : " Barton Fink is quite far from our own experience . Our professional life in Hollywood has been especially easy , and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair " . Ethan has suggested that Lipnick – like the men on which he is based – is in some ways a product of his time . " I don 't know that that kind of character exists anymore . Hollywood is a little more bland and corporate than that now " . 
 = = = Cinema = = = 
 The Coens have acknowledged several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink . Chief among these are three movies by Polish @-@ French filmmaker Roman Polanski : Repulsion ( 1965 ) , Cul @-@ de @-@ Sac ( 1966 ) , and The Tenant ( 1976 ) . These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters . Barton 's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently compared to that of <unk> in his apartment in The Tenant . Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink : " [ I ] t is kind of a Polanski movie . It is closer to that than anything else . " By coincidence , Polanski was the head of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991 , where Barton Fink premiered . This created an awkward situation . " Obviously " , Joel Coen said later , " we have been influenced by his films , but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up " . 
 Other works cited as influences for Barton Fink include the film The Shining ( 1980 ) , produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick , and the comedy Sullivan 's Travels ( 1941 ) , written and directed by Preston Sturges . Set in an empty hotel , Kubrick 's movie concerns a writer unable to proceed with his latest work . Although the Coens approve of comparisons to The Shining , Joel suggests that Kubrick 's film " belongs in a more global sense to the horror film genre " . Sullivan 's Travels , released the year in which Barton Fink is set , follows successful director John Sullivan , who decides to create a movie of deep social import – not unlike Barton 's desire to create entertainment for " the common man " . Sullivan eventually decides that comedic entertainment is a key role for filmmakers , similar to Jack Lipnick 's assertion at the end of Barton Fink that " the audience wants to see action , adventure " . 
 Additional allusions to films and film history abound in Barton Fink . At one point a character discusses " Victor Soderberg " ; the name is a reference to Victor Sjöström , a Swedish director who worked in Hollywood under the name Victor <unk> . Charlie 's line about how his troubles " don 't amount to a hill of beans " is a probable homage to the film Casablanca ( 1942 ) . Another similarity is that of Barton Fink 's beach scene to the final moment in La Dolce Vita ( 1960 ) , wherein a young woman 's final line of dialogue is obliterated by the noise of the ocean . The unsettling emptiness of the Hotel Earle has also been compared to the living spaces in Key Largo ( 1948 ) and Sunset Boulevard ( 1950 ) . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Two of the film 's central themes – the culture of entertainment production and the writing process – are intertwined and relate specifically to the self @-@ referential nature of the work ( as well as the work within the work ) . It is a movie about a man who writes a movie based on a play , and at the centre of Barton 's entire opus is Barton himself . The dialogue in his play Bare Ruined Choirs ( also the first lines of the film , some of which are repeated at the end of the film as lines in Barton 's screenplay The <unk> ) give us a glimpse into Barton 's self @-@ descriptive art . The mother in the play is named " Lil " , which is later revealed to be the name of Barton 's own mother . In the play , " The Kid " ( a representation of Barton himself ) refers to his home " six flights up " – the same floor where Barton resides at the Hotel Earle . Moreover , the characters ' writing processes in Barton Fink reflect important differences between the culture of entertainment production in New York 's Broadway district and Hollywood . 
 = = = Broadway and Hollywood = = = 
 Although Barton speaks frequently about his desire to help create " a new , living theater , of and about and for the common man " , he does not recognize that such a theater has already been created : the movies . In fact , he disdains this authentically popular form . On the other hand , the world of Broadway theatre in Barton Fink is a place of high culture , where the creator believes most fully that his work embodies his own values . Although he pretends to disdain his own success , Barton believes he has achieved a great victory with Bare Ruined Choirs . He seeks praise ; when his agent Garland asks if he 's seen the glowing review in the Herald , Barton says " No " , even though his producer had just read it to him . Barton feels close to the theatre , confident that it can help him create work that honors " the common man " . The men and women who funded the production – " those people " , as Barton calls them – demonstrate that Broadway is just as concerned with profit as Hollywood ; but its intimacy and smaller scale allow the author to feel that his work has real value . 
 Barton does not believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity . In the film , Los Angeles is a world of false fronts and phony people . This is evident in an early line of the screenplay ( filmed , but not included in the theatrical release ) ; while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures ' offer , his agent tells him : " I 'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath " . Later , as Barton tries to explain why he 's staying at the Earle , studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence , recognizing that Barton wants a place that is " less Hollywood " . The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine . Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the " New York Cafe " , a sign of Hollywood 's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast . Lipnick 's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade . Although he begins by telling Barton : " The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures " , in the penultimate scene he insists : " If your opinion mattered , then I guess I 'd resign and let you run the studio . It doesn 't , and you won 't , and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum " . 
 Deception in Barton Fink is emblematic of Hollywood 's focus on low culture , its relentless desire to efficiently produce formulaic entertainment for the sole purpose of economic gain . Capitol Pictures assigns Barton to write a wrestling picture with superstar Wallace Beery in the leading role . Although Lipnick declares otherwise , Geisler assures Barton that " it 's just a B picture " . Audrey tries to help the struggling writer by telling him : " Look , it 's really just a formula . You don 't have to type your soul into it " . This formula is made clear by Lipnick , who asks Barton in their first meeting whether the main character should have a love interest or take care of an orphaned child . Barton shows his iconoclasm by answering : " Both , maybe ? " In the end , his inability to conform to the studio 's norms destroys Barton . 
 A similar depiction of Hollywood appears in Nathanael West 's novel The Day of the Locust ( 1939 ) , which many critics see as an important precursor to Barton Fink . Set in a run @-@ down apartment complex , the book describes a painter reduced to decorating movie sets . It portrays Hollywood as crass and exploitative , devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit . In both West 's novel and Barton Fink , protagonists suffer under the oppressive industrial machine of the movie studio . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 The film contains further self @-@ referential material , as a film about a writer having difficulty writing ( written by the Coen brothers while they were having difficulty writing Miller 's Crossing ) . Barton is trapped between his own desire to create meaningful art and Capitol Pictures ' need to use its standard conventions to earn profits . Audrey 's advice about following the formula would have saved Barton , but he does not heed it . However , when he puts the mysterious package on his writing desk ( which might have contained her head ) , she might have been helping him posthumously , in other ways . The movie itself toys with standard screenplay formulas . As with Mayhew 's scripts , Barton Fink contains a " good wrestler " ( Barton , it seems ) and a " bad wrestler " ( Charlie ) who " confront " each other at the end . But in typical Coen fashion , the lines of good and evil are blurred , and the supposed hero in fact reveals himself to be deaf to the pleadings of his " common man " neighbor . By blurring the lines between reality and surreal experience , the film subverts the " simple morality tales " and " road maps " offered to Barton as easy paths for the writer to follow . 
 However , the filmmakers point out that Barton Fink is not meant to represent the Coens themselves . " Our life in Hollywood has been particularly easy " , they once said . " The film isn 't a personal comment " . Still , universal themes of the creative process are explored throughout the movie . During the picnic scene , for example , Mayhew asks Barton : " Ain 't <unk> ' peace ? " Barton pauses , then says : " No , I 've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain . " Such exchanges led critic William Rodney Allen to call Barton Fink " an autobiography of the life of the Coens ' minds , not of literal fact " . Allen 's comment is itself a reference to the phrase " life of the mind " , used repeatedly in the movie in wildly differing contexts . 
 = = = Fascism = = = 
 Several of the film 's elements , including the setting at the start of World War II , have led some critics to highlight parallels to the rise of fascism at the time . For example , the detectives who visit Barton at the Hotel Earle are named " <unk> " and " Deutsch " – Italian and German names , evocative of the regimes of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler . Their contempt for Barton is clear : " Fink . That 's a Jewish name , isn 't it ? ... I didn 't think this dump was restricted . " Later , just before killing his last victim , Charlie says : " Heil Hitler " . Jack Lipnick hails originally from the Belarusian capital city Minsk , which was occupied from 1941 by the Nazis , following Operation Barbarossa . 
 " [ I ] t 's not forcing the issue to suggest that the Holocaust hovers over Barton Fink " , writes biographer Ronald Bergan . Others see a more specific message in the film , particularly Barton 's obliviousness to Charlie 's homicidal tendencies . Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended to create an allegory for the rise of Nazism . " They paint Fink as an ineffectual and impotent left @-@ wing intellectual , who sells out while telling himself he is doing the right thing , who thinks he understands the ' common man ' but does not understand that , for many common men , fascism had a seductive appeal " . However , he goes on to say : " It would be a mistake to insist too much on this aspect of the movie .... " 
 Other critics are more demanding . M. Keith Booker writes : 
 Fink 's failure to " listen " seems intended to tell us that many leftist intellectuals like him were too busy pursuing their own selfish interests to effectively oppose the rise of fascism , a point that is historically entirely inaccurate ... That the Coens would choose to level a charge of irresponsibility against the only group in America that actively sought to oppose the rise of fascism is itself highly irresponsible and shows a complete ignorance of ( or perhaps lack of interest in ) historical reality . Such ignorance and apathy , of course , are typical of postmodern film .... 
 For their part , the Coens deny any intention of presenting an allegorical message . They chose the detectives ' names deliberately , but " we just wanted them to be representative of the Axis world powers at the time . It just seemed kind of amusing . It 's a tease . All that stuff with Charlie – the " Heil Hitler ! " business – sure , it 's all there , but it 's kind of a tease . " In 2001 , Joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis : " That 's how they 've been trained to watch movies . In Barton Fink , we may have encouraged it – like teasing animals at the zoo . The movie is intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing " . 
 = = = Slavery = = = 
 Although subdued in dialogue and imagery , the theme of slavery appears several times in the movie . Mayhew 's crooning of the spiritual tune " Old Black Joe " depicts him as enslaved to the movie studio , not unlike the song 's narrator who pines for " my friends from the cotton fields away " . One brief shot of the door to Mayhew 's workspace shows the title of the movie he is supposedly writing : Slave Ship . This is a reference to a 1937 movie written by Mayhew 's inspiration William Faulkner and starring Wallace Beery , for whom Barton is composing a script in the movie .
