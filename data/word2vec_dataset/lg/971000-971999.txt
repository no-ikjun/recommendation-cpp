 = Queen Victoria = 
 Victoria ( Alexandrina Victoria ; 24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901 ) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death . From 1 May 1876 , she had the additional title of Empress of India . 
 Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of King George III . Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820 , and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German @-@ born mother Princess Victoria of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld . She inherited the throne aged 18 , after her father 's three elder brothers had all died , leaving no surviving legitimate children . The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy , in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . Privately , Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality . 
 Victoria married her first cousin , Prince Albert of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , in 1840 . Their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent , tying them together and earning her the sobriquet " the grandmother of Europe " . After Albert 's death in 1861 , Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances . As a result of her seclusion , republicanism temporarily gained strength , but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered . Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration . 
 Her reign of 63 years and seven months is known as the Victorian era . It was a period of industrial , cultural , political , scientific , and military change within the United Kingdom , and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire . She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover . Her son and successor , Edward VII , belonged to the House of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , the line of his father . 
 = = Birth and family = = 
 Victoria 's father was Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom , George III . Until 1817 , Edward 's niece , Princess Charlotte of Wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of George III . Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld , a widowed German princess with two children — Carl ( 1804 – 1856 ) and Feodora ( 1807 – 1872 ) — by her first marriage to the Prince of Leiningen . Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte 's widower . The Duke and Duchess of Kent 's only child , Victoria , was born at 4 @.@ 15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London . 
 Victoria was christened privately by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Charles Manners @-@ Sutton , on 24 June 1819 in the Cupola Room at Kensington Palace . She was baptised Alexandrina , after one of her godparents , Emperor Alexander I of Russia , and Victoria after her mother . Additional names proposed by her parents — Georgina ( or Georgiana ) , Charlotte , and Augusta — were dropped on the instructions of the Duke 's elder brother , the Prince Regent ( later George IV ) . 
 At birth , Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after her father and his three older brothers : the Prince Regent , the Duke of York , and the Duke of Clarence ( later William IV ) . The Prince Regent and the Duke of York were estranged from their wives , who were both past child @-@ bearing age , so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children . The Dukes of Kent and Clarence married on the same day 12 months before Victoria 's birth , but both of Clarence 's daughters ( born in 1819 and 1820 respectively ) died as infants . Victoria 's grandfather and father died in 1820 , within a week of each other , and the Duke of York died in 1827 . On the death of her uncle George IV in 1830 , Victoria became heiress presumptive to her next surviving uncle , William IV . The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor . King William distrusted the Duchess 's capacity to be regent , and in 1836 declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria 's 18th birthday , so that a regency could be avoided . 
 = = Heiress presumptive = = 
 Victoria later described her childhood as " rather melancholy " . Her mother was extremely protective , and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so @-@ called " Kensington System " , an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller , Sir John Conroy , who was rumoured to be the Duchess 's lover . The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable ( including most of her father 's family ) , and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them . The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William 's bastard children , and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety . Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night , studied with private tutors to a regular timetable , and spent her play @-@ hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel , Dash . Her lessons included French , German , Italian , and Latin , but she spoke only English at home . 
 In 1830 , the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills , stopping at towns and great country houses along the way . Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832 , 1833 , 1834 and 1835 . To the King 's annoyance , Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops . William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heiress presumptive . Victoria disliked the trips ; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill , and there was little time for her to rest . She objected on the grounds of the King 's disapproval , but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy , and forced Victoria to continue the tours . At Ramsgate in October 1835 , Victoria contracted a severe fever , which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence . While Victoria was ill , Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary . As a teenager , Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff . Once queen , she banned him from her presence , but he remained in her mother 's household . 
 By 1836 , the Duchess 's brother , Leopold , who had been King of the Belgians since 1831 , hoped to marry his niece to his nephew , Prince Albert of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . Leopold , Victoria 's mother , and Albert 's father ( Ernest I , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha ) were siblings . Leopold arranged for Victoria 's mother to invite her Coburg relatives to visit her in May 1836 , with the purpose of introducing Victoria to Albert . William IV , however , disapproved of any match with the Coburgs , and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander of the Netherlands , second son of the Prince of Orange . Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes . According to her diary , she enjoyed Albert 's company from the beginning . After the visit she wrote , " [ Albert ] is extremely handsome ; his hair is about the same colour as mine ; his eyes are large and blue , and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth ; but the charm of his countenance is his expression , which is most delightful . " Alexander , on the other hand , was " very plain " . 
 Victoria wrote to her uncle Leopold , whom Victoria considered her " best and kindest adviser " , to thank him " for the prospect of great happiness you have contributed to give me , in the person of dear Albert ... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy . He is so sensible , so kind , and so good , and so amiable too . He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see . " However at 17 , Victoria , though interested in Albert , was not yet ready to marry . The parties did not undertake a formal engagement , but assumed that the match would take place in due time . 
 = = Early reign = = 
 Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837 , and a regency was avoided . On 20 June 1837 , William IV died at the age of 71 , and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom . In her diary she wrote , " I was awoke at 6 o 'clock by Mamma , who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me . I got out of bed and went into my sitting @-@ room ( only in my dressing gown ) and alone , and saw them . Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle , the King , was no more , and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning , and consequently that I am Queen . " Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria , but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again . 
 Since 1714 , Britain had shared a monarch with Hanover in Germany , but under Salic law women were excluded from the Hanoverian succession . While Victoria inherited all the British dominions , Hanover passed instead to her father 's younger brother , her unpopular uncle the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale , who became King Ernest Augustus I of Hanover . He was her heir presumptive until she married and had a child . 
 At the time of her accession , the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne , who at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced Queen , who relied on him for advice . Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was " passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one " , and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure . Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey . Over 400 @,@ 000 visitors came to London for the celebrations . She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £ 385 @,@ 000 per year . Financially prudent , she paid off her father 's debts . 
 At the start of her reign Victoria was popular , but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother 's ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting , Lady Flora Hastings , developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out @-@ of @-@ wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy . Victoria believed the rumours . She hated Conroy , and despised " that odious Lady Flora " , because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System . At first , Lady Flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination , until in mid @-@ February she eventually agreed , and was found to be a virgin . Conroy , the Hastings family and the opposition Tories organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora . When Lady Flora died in July , the post @-@ mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen . At public appearances , Victoria was hissed and jeered as " Mrs. Melbourne " . 
 In 1839 , Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories ( both of whom Victoria detested ) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica . The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . The Queen commissioned a Tory , Sir Robert Peel , to form a new ministry . At the time , it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household , who were usually his political allies and their spouses . Many of the Queen 's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs , and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories . In what became known as the bedchamber crisis , Victoria , advised by Melbourne , objected to their removal . Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen , and consequently resigned his commission , allowing Melbourne to return to office . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 Though queen , as an unmarried young woman Victoria was required by social convention to live with her mother , despite their differences over the Kensington System and her mother 's continued reliance on Conroy . Her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in Buckingham Palace , and Victoria often refused to see her . When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother 's close proximity promised " torment for many years " , Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage , which Victoria called a " <unk> [ sic ] alternative " . She showed interest in Albert 's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband , but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock . 
 Victoria continued to praise Albert following his second visit in October 1839 . Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839 , just five days after he had arrived at Windsor . They were married on 10 February 1840 , in the Chapel Royal of St James 's Palace , London . Victoria was besotted . She spent the evening after their wedding lying down with a headache , but wrote ecstatically in her diary : 
 I NEVER , NEVER spent such an evening ! ! ! MY <unk> <unk> <unk> Albert ... his excessive love & affection gave me feelings of heavenly love & happiness I never could have hoped to have felt before ! He clasped me in his arms , & we kissed each other again & again ! His beauty , his sweetness & gentleness – really how can I ever be thankful enough to have such a Husband ! ... to be called by names of tenderness , I have never yet heard used to me before – was bliss beyond belief ! Oh ! This was the happiest day of my life ! 
 Albert became an important political adviser as well as the Queen 's companion , replacing Lord Melbourne as the dominant , influential figure in the first half of her life . Victoria 's mother was evicted from the palace , to <unk> House in Belgrave Square . After the death of Princess Augusta in 1840 , Victoria 's mother was given both Clarence and Frogmore Houses . Through Albert 's mediation , relations between mother and daughter slowly improved . 
 During Victoria 's first pregnancy in 1840 , in the first few months of the marriage , 18 @-@ year @-@ old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother . Oxford fired twice , but either both bullets missed or , as he later claimed , the guns had no shot . He was tried for high treason and found guilty , but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity . In the immediate aftermath of the attack , Victoria 's popularity soared , mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis . Her daughter , also named Victoria , was born on 21 November 1840 . The Queen hated being pregnant , viewed breast @-@ feeding with disgust , and thought newborn babies were ugly . Nevertheless , over the following seventeen years , she and Albert had a further eight children : Albert Edward , Prince of Wales ( b . 1841 ) , Alice ( b . 1843 ) , Alfred ( b . 1844 ) , Helena ( b . 1846 ) , Louise ( b . 1848 ) , Arthur ( b . 1850 ) , Leopold ( b . 1853 ) and Beatrice ( b . 1857 ) . 
 Victoria 's household was largely run by her childhood governess , Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover . Lehzen had been a formative influence on Victoria , and had supported her against the Kensington System . Albert , however , thought Lehzen was incompetent , and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter 's health . After a furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue , Lehzen was pensioned off , and Victoria 's close relationship with her ended . 
 = = 1842 – 1860 = = 
 On 29 May 1842 , Victoria was riding in a carriage along The Mall , London , when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire ; he escaped . The following day , Victoria drove the same route , though faster and with a greater escort , in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act . As expected , Francis shot at her , but he was seized by plain @-@ clothes policemen , and convicted of high treason . On 3 July , two days after Francis 's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life , John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen , but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge . Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840 . Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail . In a similar attack in 1849 , unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder @-@ filled pistol at Victoria 's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill , London . In 1850 , the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex @-@ army officer , Robert Pate . As Victoria was riding in a carriage , Pate struck her with his cane , crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead . Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years ' transportation . 
 Melbourne 's support in the House of Commons weakened through the early years of Victoria 's reign , and in the 1841 general election the Whigs were defeated . Peel became prime minister , and the ladies of the bedchamber most associated with the Whigs were replaced . 
 In 1845 , Ireland was hit by a potato blight . In the next four years over a million Irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the Great Famine . In Ireland , Victoria was labelled " The Famine Queen " . She personally donated £ 2 @,@ 000 to the British Relief Association , more than any other individual famine relief donor , and also supported the Maynooth Grant to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland , despite Protestant opposition . The story that she donated only £ 5 in aid to the Irish , and on the same day gave the same amount to Battersea Dogs Home , was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century . 
 By 1846 , Peel 's ministry faced a crisis involving the repeal of the Corn Laws . Many Tories — by then known also as Conservatives — were opposed to the repeal , but Peel , some Tories ( the " Peelites " ) , most Whigs and Victoria supported it . Peel resigned in 1846 , after the repeal narrowly passed , and was replaced by Lord John Russell . 
 Internationally , Victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain . She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans , who were related by marriage through the Coburgs . In 1843 and 1845 , she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at château d <unk> in Normandy ; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 . When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844 , he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign . Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848 , and fled to exile in England . At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848 , Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House , a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped . Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support , and the scare died down without any major disturbances . Victoria 's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success , but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism . 
 Russell 's ministry , though Whig , was not favoured by the Queen . She found particularly offensive the Foreign Secretary , Lord Palmerston , who often acted without consulting the Cabinet , the Prime Minister , or the Queen . Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge , but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative , despite her repeated remonstrances . It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government 's approval of President Louis @-@ Napoleon Bonaparte 's coup in France without consulting the Prime Minister . The following year , President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III , by which time Russell 's administration had been replaced by a short @-@ lived minority government led by Lord Derby . 
 In 1853 , Victoria gave birth to her eighth child , Leopold , with the aid of the new anaesthetic , chloroform . Victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child , Beatrice , despite opposition from members of the clergy , who considered it against biblical teaching , and members of the medical profession , who thought it dangerous . Victoria may have suffered from post @-@ natal depression after many of her pregnancies . Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self @-@ control . For example , about a month after Leopold 's birth Albert complained in a letter to Victoria about her " continuance of hysterics " over a " miserable trifle " . 
 In early 1855 , the government of Lord Aberdeen , who had replaced Derby , fell amidst recriminations over the poor management of British troops in the Crimean War . Victoria approached both Derby and Russell to form a ministry , but neither had sufficient support , and Victoria was forced to appoint Palmerston as prime minister . 
 Napoleon III , since the Crimean War Britain 's closest ally , visited London in April 1855 , and from 17 to 28 August the same year Victoria and Albert returned the visit . Napoleon III met the couple at Dunkirk and accompanied them to Paris . They visited the Exposition Universelle ( a successor to Albert 's 1851 brainchild the Great Exhibition ) and Napoleon I 's tomb at Les Invalides ( to which his remains had only been returned in 1840 ) , and were guests of honour at a 1 @,@ 200 @-@ guest ball at the Palace of Versailles . 
 On 14 January 1858 , an Italian refugee from Britain called Orsini attempted to assassinate Napoleon III with a bomb made in England . The ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government , and Palmerston resigned . Derby was reinstated as prime minister . Victoria and Albert attended the opening of a new basin at the French military port of Cherbourg on 5 August 1858 , in an attempt by Napoleon III to reassure Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere . On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the Royal Navy in comparison to the French one . Derby 's ministry did not last long , and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office . 
 Eleven days after Orsini 's assassination attempt in France , Victoria 's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London . They had been betrothed since September 1855 , when Princess Victoria was 14 years old ; the marriage was delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17 . The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son @-@ in @-@ law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state . Victoria felt " sick at heart " to see her daughter leave England for Germany ; " It really makes me shudder " , she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters , " when I look round to all your sweet , happy , unconscious sisters , and think I must give them up too – one by one . " Almost exactly a year later , Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen 's first grandchild , Wilhelm , who would become the last German Kaiser . 
 = = Widowhood = = 
 In March 1861 , Victoria 's mother died , with Victoria at her side . Through reading her mother 's papers , Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply ; she was heart @-@ broken , and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for " wickedly " estranging her from her mother . To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief , Albert took on most of her duties , despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble . In August , Victoria and Albert visited their son , the Prince of Wales , who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin , and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney . In November , Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland . Appalled , Albert travelled to Cambridge , where his son was studying , to confront him . By the beginning of December , Albert was very unwell . He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner , and died on 14 December 1861 . Victoria was devastated . She blamed her husband 's death on worry over the Prince of Wales 's philandering . He had been " killed by that dreadful business " , she said . She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life . She avoided public appearances , and rarely set foot in London in the following years . Her seclusion earned her the nickname " widow of Windsor " . 
 Victoria 's self @-@ imposed isolation from the public diminished the popularity of the monarchy , and encouraged the growth of the republican movement . She did undertake her official government duties , yet chose to remain secluded in her royal residences — Windsor Castle , Osborne House , and the private estate in Scotland that she and Albert had acquired in 1847 , Balmoral Castle . In March 1864 , a protester stuck a notice on the railings of Buckingham Palace that announced " these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant 's declining business " . Her uncle Leopold wrote to her advising her to appear in public . She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage . 
 Through the 1860s , Victoria relied increasingly on a manservant from Scotland , John Brown . Slanderous rumours of a romantic connection and even a secret marriage appeared in print , and the Queen was referred to as " Mrs. Brown " . The story of their relationship was the subject of the 1997 movie Mrs. Brown . A painting by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer depicting the Queen with Brown was exhibited at the Royal Academy , and Victoria published a book , Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands , which featured Brown prominently and in which the Queen praised him highly . 
 Palmerston died in 1865 , and after a brief ministry led by Russell , Derby returned to power . In 1866 , Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert 's death . The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men , though she was not in favour of votes for women . Derby resigned in 1868 , to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli , who charmed Victoria . " Everyone likes flattery , " he said , " and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel . " With the phrase " we authors , Ma 'am " , he complimented her . Disraeli 's ministry only lasted a matter of months , and at the end of the year his Liberal rival , William Ewart Gladstone , was appointed prime minister . Victoria found Gladstone 's demeanour far less appealing ; he spoke to her , she is thought to have complained , as though she were " a public meeting rather than a woman " . 
 In 1870 , republican sentiment in Britain , fed by the Queen 's seclusion , was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic . A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria 's removal , and Radical MPs spoke against her . In August and September 1871 , she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm , which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray . In late November 1871 , at the height of the republican movement , the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever , the disease that was believed to have killed his father , and Victoria was fearful her son would die . As the tenth anniversary of her husband 's death approached , her son 's condition grew no better , and Victoria 's distress continued . To general rejoicing , he pulled through . Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul 's Cathedral on 27 February 1872 , and republican feeling subsided . 
 On the last day of February 1872 , two days after the thanksgiving service , 17 @-@ year @-@ old Arthur O 'Connor ( great @-@ nephew of Irish MP Feargus O 'Connor ) waved an unloaded pistol at Victoria 's open carriage just after she had arrived at Buckingham Palace . Brown , who was attending the Queen , grabbed him and O 'Connor was later sentenced to 12 months ' imprisonment . As a result of the incident , Victoria 's popularity recovered further . 
 = = Empress of India = = 
 After the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the British East India Company , which had ruled much of India , was dissolved , and Britain 's possessions and protectorates on the Indian subcontinent were formally incorporated into the British Empire . The Queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict , and condemned atrocities on both sides . She wrote of " her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war " , and insisted , urged on by Albert , that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state " should breathe feelings of generosity , benevolence and religious toleration " . At her behest , a reference threatening the " undermining of native religions and customs " was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom . 
 In the 1874 general election , Disraeli was returned to power . He passed the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 , which removed Catholic rituals from the Anglican liturgy and which Victoria strongly supported . She preferred short , simple services , and personally considered herself more aligned with the presbyterian Church of Scotland than the episcopal Church of England . He also pushed the Royal Titles Act 1876 through Parliament , so that Victoria took the title " Empress of India " from 1 May 1876 . The new title was proclaimed at the Delhi Durbar of 1 January 1877 . 
 On 14 December 1878 , the anniversary of Albert 's death , Victoria 's second daughter Alice , who had married Louis of Hesse , died of diphtheria in Darmstadt . Victoria noted the coincidence of the dates as " almost incredible and most mysterious " . In May 1879 , she became a great @-@ grandmother ( on the birth of Princess Feodora of Saxe @-@ Meiningen ) and passed her " poor old 60th birthday " . She felt " aged " by " the loss of my beloved child " . 
 Between April 1877 and February 1878 , she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the Russo @-@ Turkish War , but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin . Disraeli 's expansionist foreign policy , which Victoria endorsed , led to conflicts such as the Anglo @-@ Zulu War and the Second Anglo @-@ Afghan War . " If we are to maintain our position as a first @-@ rate Power " , she wrote , " we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars , somewhere or other , <unk> . " Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign , protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers : " It is not in our custom to annexe countries " , she said , " unless we are obliged & forced to do so . " To Victoria 's dismay , Disraeli lost the 1880 general election , and Gladstone returned as prime minister . When Disraeli died the following year , she was blinded by " fast falling tears " , and erected a memorial tablet " placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend , Victoria R.I. " 
 = = Later years = = 
 On 2 March 1882 , Roderick Maclean , a disgruntled poet apparently offended by Victoria 's refusal to accept one of his poems , shot at the Queen as her carriage left Windsor railway station . Two schoolboys from Eton College struck him with their umbrellas , until he was hustled away by a policeman . Victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity , but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was " worth being shot at — to see how much one is loved " . 
 On 17 March 1883 , she fell down some stairs at Windsor , which left her lame until July ; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter . Brown died 10 days after her accident , and to the consternation of her private secretary , Sir Henry Ponsonby , Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown . Ponsonby and Randall Davidson , Dean of Windsor , who had both seen early drafts , advised Victoria against publication , on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair . The manuscript was destroyed . In early 1884 , Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands , a sequel to her earlier book , which she dedicated to her " devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown " . On the day after the first anniversary of Brown 's death , Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son , Leopold , had died in Cannes . He was " the dearest of my dear sons " , she lamented . The following month , Victoria 's youngest child , Beatrice , met and fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg at the wedding of Victoria 's granddaughter Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine to Henry 's brother Prince Louis of Battenberg . Beatrice and Henry planned to marry , but Victoria opposed the match at first , wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion . After a year , she was won around to the marriage by Henry and Beatrice 's promise to remain living with and attending her . 
 Victoria was pleased when Gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated . She thought his government was " the worst I have ever had " , and blamed him for the death of General Gordon at Khartoum . Gladstone was replaced by Lord Salisbury . Salisbury 's government only lasted a few months , however , and Victoria was forced to recall Gladstone , whom she referred to as a " half crazy & really in many ways ridiculous old man " . Gladstone attempted to pass a bill granting Ireland home rule , but to Victoria 's glee it was defeated . In the ensuing election , Gladstone 's party lost to Salisbury 's and the government switched hands again . 
 = = = Golden Jubilee = = = 
 In 1887 , the British Empire celebrated Victoria 's Golden Jubilee . Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited . The following day , she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey . By this time , Victoria was once again extremely popular . Two days later on 23 June , she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters , one of whom was Abdul Karim . He was soon promoted to " Munshi " : teaching her Hindustani , and acting as a clerk . Her family and retainers were appalled , and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League , and biasing the Queen against the Hindus . Equerry Frederick Ponsonby ( the son of Sir Henry ) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage , and reported to Lord Elgin , Viceroy of India , " the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do . " Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice . Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with a pension on her death . 
 Victoria 's eldest daughter became Empress consort of Germany in 1888 , but she was widowed within the year , and Victoria 's grandchild Wilhelm became German Emperor as Wilhelm II . Under Wilhelm , Victoria and Albert 's hopes of a liberal Germany were not fulfilled . He believed in autocracy . Victoria thought he had " little heart or <unk> [ tact ] – and ... his conscience & intelligence have been completely <unk> [ sic ] " . 
 Gladstone returned to power after the 1892 general election ; he was 82 years old . Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP Henry Labouchere to the Cabinet , so Gladstone agreed not to appoint him . In 1894 , Gladstone retired and , without consulting the outgoing prime minister , Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister . His government was weak , and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him . Salisbury remained prime minister for the remainder of Victoria 's reign . 
 = = = Diamond Jubilee = = = 
 On 23 September 1896 , Victoria surpassed her grandfather George III as the longest @-@ reigning monarch in English , Scottish , and British history . The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897 , to coincide with her Diamond Jubilee , which was made a festival of the British Empire at the suggestion of Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain . The prime ministers of all the self @-@ governing dominions were invited to London for the festivities . 
 The Queen 's Diamond Jubilee procession on 22 June 1897 followed a route six miles long through London and included troops from all over the empire . The procession paused for an open @-@ air service of thanksgiving held outside St Paul 's Cathedral , throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage , to avoid her having to climb the steps to enter the building . The celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78 @-@ year @-@ old Queen . 
 Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays . In 1889 , during a stay in Biarritz , she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit . By April 1900 , the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable . Instead , the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861 , in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war . In July , her second son Alfred ( " <unk> " ) died ; " Oh , God ! My poor darling <unk> gone too " , she wrote in her journal . " It is a horrible year , nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another . " 
 = = = Death and succession = = = 
 Following a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood , Victoria spent the Christmas of 1900 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight . Rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame , and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts . Through early January , she felt " weak and unwell " , and by mid @-@ January she was " drowsy ... dazed , [ and ] confused " . She died on Tuesday , 22 January 1901 , at half past six in the evening , at the age of 81 . Her son and successor King Edward VII , and her eldest grandson , Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany , were at her deathbed . Her favourite pet Pomeranian , Turi , was laid upon her deathbed as a last request . 
 In 1897 , Victoria had written instructions for her funeral , which was to be military as befitting a soldier 's daughter and the head of the army , and white instead of black . On 25 January , Edward VII , the Kaiser and Prince Arthur , Duke of Connaught , helped lift her body into the coffin . She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil . An array of mementos commemorating her extended family , friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her , at her request , by her doctor and dressers . One of Albert 's dressing gowns was placed by her side , with a plaster cast of his hand , while a lock of John Brown 's hair , along with a picture of him , was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers . Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown 's mother , given to her by Brown in 1883 . Her funeral was held on Saturday , 2 February , in St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , and after two days of lying @-@ in @-@ state , she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park . 
 With a reign of 63 years , seven months and two days , Victoria was the longest @-@ reigning British monarch and the longest @-@ reigning queen regnant in world history until her great @-@ great @-@ granddaughter Elizabeth II surpassed her on 9 September 2015 . She was the last monarch of Britain from the House of Hanover . Her son and successor Edward VII belonged to her husband 's House of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 According to one of her biographers , Giles St Aubyn , Victoria wrote an average of 2 @,@ 500 words a day during her adult life . From July 1832 until just before her death , she kept a detailed journal , which eventually encompassed 122 volumes . After Victoria 's death , her youngest daughter , Princess Beatrice , was appointed her literary executor . Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria 's accession onwards , and burned the originals in the process . Despite this destruction , much of the diaries still exist . In addition to Beatrice 's edited copy , Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them . Part of Victoria 's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson , Hector Bolitho , George Earle Buckle , Lord Esher , Roger Fulford , and Richard Hough among others . 
 Victoria was physically unprepossessing — she was stout , dowdy and no more than five feet tall — but she succeeded in projecting a grand image . She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood , but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s , when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure . Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public . Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available , such as Lytton Strachey 's Queen Victoria of 1921 , are now considered out of date . The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham @-@ Smith , in 1964 and 1972 respectively , are still widely admired . They , and others , conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional , obstinate , honest , and straight @-@ talking . 
 Through Victoria 's reign , the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in Britain continued . Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords and the monarch . In 1867 , Walter Bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained " the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn " . As Victoria 's monarchy became more symbolic than political , it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values , in contrast to the sexual , financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy . The concept of the " family monarchy " , with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify , was solidified . 
 Victoria 's links with Europe 's royal families earned her the nickname " the grandmother of Europe " . Victoria and Albert had 42 grandchildren , of whom 34 survived to adulthood . Their descendants include Elizabeth II , Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , Harald V of Norway , Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden , Margrethe II of Denmark , and Felipe VI of Spain . 
 Victoria 's youngest son , Leopold , was affected by the blood @-@ clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters , Alice and Beatrice , were carriers . Royal <unk> descended from Victoria included her great @-@ grandsons , Tsarevich Alexei of Russia , Alfonso , Prince of Asturias , and Infante Gonzalo of Spain . The presence of the disease in Victoria 's descendants , but not in her ancestors , led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac . There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria 's mother , and as male carriers always suffer the disease , even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill . It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria 's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers . Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases . 
 Around the world , places and memorials are dedicated to her , especially in the Commonwealth nations . Places named after her include the capital of the Seychelles , Africa 's largest lake , Victoria Falls , the capital of Gozo and a line of fortifications in Malta , the capitals of British Columbia ( Victoria ) and Saskatchewan ( Regina ) , and two Australian states ( Victoria and Queensland ) . 
 The Victoria Cross was introduced in 1856 to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War , and it remains the highest British , Canadian , Australian , and New Zealand award for bravery . Victoria Day is a Canadian statutory holiday and a local public holiday in parts of Scotland celebrated on the last Monday before or on 24 May ( Queen Victoria 's birthday ) .

 " I 'll See You in Court " is the tenth episode of the third season from the TV comedy series Married ... with Children . The episode follows the Bundys ' attempts ( at Marcy Rhoades 's suggestion ) to improve their love life by having marital relations in a different setting . While staying at the Hop @-@ On @-@ Inn , the Bundys discover a secretly recorded video tape of the Rhoades having sex . Despite this , the Bundys decide to have sex and end up having themselves recorded as well . The two families then proceed to sue the establishment for violation of their privacy . 
 Conflict erupted between the show 's producers and the airing network over the episode 's content , which prevented the episode from being aired for well over a decade , far past Married ... with Children 's initial television run . Even when first shown on American television in 2002 , four lines were removed from the broadcast , despite it having already run uncut in other countries . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After writing to a televised sex @-@ help program , Peggy decides that the best way to rekindle her relationship with Al is to have sex in a different location . Upon Marcy 's recommendation , Peggy and Al go to the Hop @-@ On @-@ Inn and discover a videotape waiting for them in their room . After watching some of the tape , the Bundys realize that the couple having sex on the video is Steve and Marcy . Although Al is disgusted , the action turns Peggy on and the couple has sex . 
 Peggy and Al return home and show the tape to Steve and Marcy , who are embarrassed by the film , much to the delight of the Bundys . The Rhoades express their dismay that they were secretly recorded , but Steve points out that the Bundys may have been videotaped as well . Marcy and Al are upset by this violation of their privacy and propose physical violence against the owners of the motel . Steve and Peg , on the other hand , want to take action against the Hop @-@ On @-@ Inn and make money from the incident . 
 Peggy convinces Al to sue the motel with her and the Rhoades . Steve , not wanting a lawyer to take any of the million dollars he expects to win from the case , decides to act as one for the two families . The case begins with Steve presenting a lengthy opening statement , during which the stenographer and the judge fall asleep . Next , Steve shows the subpoenaed sex tapes from the motel , despite objections from his wife . After a few hours , the tape runs out and the courtroom applauds Steve and Marcy 's romp . Next , Steve shows Peggy and Al 's tape , which ends after a few seconds . 
 After the plaintiff rests , the defense lawyer calls Marcy , Al , and Peggy to the stand . She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions , hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there . Her tactic with the Bundys is to try to prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape . In the end , the Rhoades are awarded $ 10 @,@ 000 but the Bundys receive nothing , because the jury does not believe that sex occurred . After everyone exits the courtroom , Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge 's bench , unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera . 
 = = Production and controversy = = 
 The episode was written by Jeanne Baruch and Jeanne Romano , both newcomers to Married ... with Children . Directed by Gerry Cohen , the show was taped on January 6 , 1989 , with a planned airing date of February 19 of the same year . The censors of the Fox Broadcasting Company , however , objected to many of the lines in the show . It was not the first time that Fox censors had struggled with the content in Married ... with Children . Earlier in the season , producers and writers Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt had to fight with the censors to air " The Camping Show " , an episode where the Bundys and the Rhodes are trapped in a cabin in the wilderness as all three women have their periods at the same time . It was originally intended to be shown in November 1988 , but its airing was delayed while the network wrangled with the subject matter . The episode aired on December 11 , 1988 , but the producers were forced to change the title from " A Period Piece " to " The Camping Show " , despite the fact that the title itself does not appear onscreen and is not mentioned during the program . 
 The censors ended up pulling " I 'll See You in Court " , preventing it from airing in the United States during the series ' original run . Terry <unk> , a woman from Bloomfield Hills , Michigan , had launched a letter @-@ writing campaign against the program after viewing the Season 3 episode " Her Cups <unk> Over " in January 1989 . Offended by the episode 's content , she urged advertisers to boycott the show , several of whom did or pledged to more carefully screen the episodes for which they provided advertising . The campaign garnered more media attention than she had expected and the advertisers ' more careful scrutiny of the individual episodes that they supported was a significant factor that led to the pulling of " I 'll See You in Court " . Contributing to this was that the overall topic , sex , was not seen as a topic to be vocally and openly discussed on television . 
 In an interview with Playboy magazine , Moye claimed that the producers dubbed the episode " The Lost Episode " both because it never aired and because they felt that they lost control of the project . A typical episode of Married ... with Children contained two or three censor notes denoting content that was " too graphic " or " over the edge . " , whereas " I 'll See You in Court " contained a total of 15 . After arguing with the censors and conceding all but four of the notes , Fox still refused to air the episode . Moye claims that the final total of 13 changes was unacceptable because " [ t ] he integrity of the show was shot to hell . " 
 The episode did , however , premiere in other parts of the world in 1990 . On June 18 , 2002 , the FX network broadcast the episode for the first time on American television . The episode , however , was still not shown in its entirety , as the network cut four lines , less than one minute , during the scene where the two families decide on what to do about the videotapes : 
 Although the episode has aired in Australia ( although initially in a later than normal time ) , New Zealand , Europe , and Canada unedited , the above omission means that the show has never been broadcast in the United States in its entirety . The total time between when the episode was taped and when it premiered in the United States was 13 years , 5 months , and 12 days .

The Wolverines beat the Spartans , 38 @-@ 20 , and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries . After the game , Coach Bo Schembechler said : " I wondered what a kid like that would do if he ran as much as the guy on the West Coast ( Marcus Allen ) . I didn 't plan on this , but he proved he can do it . Butch is going to be our all @-@ time leading ground gainer . There isn 't any way they 're going to stop him now . And so be it .

He won the MVP award despite the lack of sleep , and after the game Woolfolk called the game his " greatest thrill in football . " Commenting on the MVP trophy , Woolfolk said : " If I could , I 'd break this trophy into 95 pieces and hand it out to all the guys on the squad . " After winning his second MVP trophy in 1981 's Bluebonnet Bowl , Woolfolk said : " I might look back in later years and notice that , but right now all I can think about is that I 've worn a Michigan uniform for the last time .

 During his four years at Michigan , Woolfolk had what one reporter described as " a strange love @-@ hate relationship " with Coach Bo Schembechler . Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a " tough coach , " and it was " not easy at all " playing for him . Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk 's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them , resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once . But Schembechler said Woolfolk " came of age " in the November 1980 Ohio State game . After Woolfolk 's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory , Bo complimented Woolfolk 's powerful performance , noting : " Butch can be a real load . " By the 1981 season , Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk , saying : " Today , I can say without reservation , that I 'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country . " Woolfolk , too , concluded in the end that Schembechler was " key " to his success : " He kept after me . He kept saying I was getting too fancy . He kept saying , ' You 're a big back , a fast back , and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them . ' "

 While at Michigan , Woolfolk was also the 1980 Big Ten Conference track champion in the outdoor 200 meter and indoor 300 meter events .

 = = = New York Giants = = = 
 Woolfolk was drafted by the Giants in the first round of the 1982 NFL Draft . Woolfolk , who had graduated from high school in New Jersey and was a Giants fan , recalled watching the draft at his apartment in Ann Arbor : " When there were only four or five choices left before the Giants picked , I was hoping I 'd last . " 
 In 1982 , Woolfolk was named the NFC 's Offensive Rookie of the Year , after appearing in all nine games of the strike @-@ shortened NFL season , in which he rushed for 439 yards , caught 23 passes for 224 yards , and scored four touchdowns . In a December 1982 game against the Oilers , Woolfolk scored his first two NFL touchdowns , one rushing and one receiving , to help the Giants win , 17 – 14 . With the Giants trailing and less than two minutes remaining in the game , Woolfolk scored on a 40 – yard gain after making a leaping , one @-@ handed catch . The next day , The New York Times published an article headlined , " The Catch By Woolfolk . " The article concluded that with Woolfolk and Rob Carpenter , the Giants " have their best backfield combination since the glory years of Frank Gifford and Alex Webster a quarter of a century ago . " Over the course of the season his 1 @,@ 091 all @-@ purpose yards was third to only James Brooks ( 1 @,@ 383 ) and Marcus Allen ( 1 @,@ 098 ) . 
 In 1983 , Bill Parcells ' first year as head coach , Woolfolk gained 1 @,@ 225 yards from scrimmage for the Giants ( 857 yards rushing and 368 yards receiving ) -- more yards than any Giants running back in the previous ten years . He also set the NFL record for most rushing attempts in a game with 43 carries ( for 159 yards ) on November 20 , 1983 . Woolfolk gained 115 yards on 26 carries in the first half alone and said after the game : " I 'm not as tired as I thought I would be when somebody told me how many carries I had . " Ironically , Woolfolk 's 43 @-@ carry record was broken in 1988 by Jamie Morris , the same player who also broke Woolfolk 's career rushing record at the University of Michigan . 
 In 1984 , Woolfolk was relegated to back @-@ up status as Joe Morris took over the starting job at tailback midway through the season . The 1984 Giants made the playoffs , but Woolfolk did not touch the ball . In March 1985 , the Giants traded Woolfolk to the Oilers . In reporting on the trade , The New York Times said : " The mystery of Butch Woolfolk , who in his three seasons with the Giants went from star running back to <unk> may be solved next fall , but not with Giants . " Woolfolk said at the time he was " not bitter " about the trade , and Coach Bill Parcells said : " Maybe a new place will be good for Butch . I don 't think he was satisfied with what transpired last year . "

 Playing for the Oilers during the 1985 NFL season , Woolfolk was fifth in the conference with 80 receptions for 814 yards . He also rushed for 392 yards and had 1 @,@ 206 yards from scrimmage .

With the Oilers , Mike Rozier was the leading rusher and Drew Hill was the leading receiver , but Woolfolk led the team 's running backs in receiving yards in both 1985 and 1986 . In 1986 , he switched from tailback to fullback , but he only played in 10 games due to a fractured and dislocated shoulder in the second half of the season . The Oilers drafted Alonzo Highsmith with the third selection overall in the 1987 NFL Draft after trading up in the draft because their top three running backs Rozier , Ray Wallace and Woolfolk had finished the season on injured reserve . At Houston , Woolfolk was reunited with former Michigan teammate Stan Edwards . The sons of both Woolfolk and Edwards ( Braylon Edwards ) would later follow in their fathers ' footsteps by playing at Michigan .

In 1992 , as co @-@ owner of New Choice Builders , Woolfolk began building affordable single @-@ family housing in Houston 's revitalized communities . In 1994 , Woolfolk worked with Home Ownership Partners , Inc . , to build affordable housing for residents of Fort Bend County , Texas , a suburban county outside of Houston .

Starting in approximately 1995 , Woolfolk worked for Intrepid Holdings , Inc. in Houston . At Intrepid , he developed residential lots for several large builders including US Home , Gateway Homes , Texas Colonial , and KB Home . 
 In June 2007 , Forward Edge , Inc. announced that Woolfolk had joined the company as its new business developer . The company stated at the time that Woolfolk would help the company 's development and implementation of steroid testing for Texas high school athletes . At the time , Woolfolk said : " There 's a lot more to this than just passing a law . Kids are using steroids and they are doing so at dangerous levels . ... I 've been there . I 've watched it . Once you 've watched it , you have more of a commitment to get the kids off of the steroids . It 's not just a business for me . It 's a passion of mine .

 Super Mario World ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Sūpā Mario Wārudo ) , subtitled Super Mario Bros. 4 ( <unk> , Sūpā Mario Burazāzu <unk> ) for its original Japanese release , is a 1990 platform video game developed and published by Nintendo as a pack @-@ in launch title for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) . Development was handled by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development , led by Shigeru Miyamoto , who produced the game . It also features 2D graphics with linear transformations . 
 The game centers on the quest of Mario and Luigi to save Dinosaur Land from Bowser , the series ' antagonist . The two brothers must travel across seven worlds to restore order to Dinosaur Land . It built on the gameplay of previous Mario games , introducing new power @-@ ups that augment character abilities , and established conventions that were carried over to future games in the series . Super Mario World marks the first appearance of Yoshi , Mario 's dinosaur sidekick and riding mount . 
 Super Mario World was a critical and commercial success , selling over 20 million copies worldwide , and is considered by many critics to be one of the best games ever made . It has been re @-@ released four times , first as part of a combo with Super Mario All @-@ Stars on the SNES in 1993 . Secondly , it was released on the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario Advance 2 ( <unk> , Sūpā Mario Adobansu Tsū ) in 2001 and outside Japan as Super Mario World : Super Mario Advance 2 in 2002 with modified gameplay . The third re @-@ release was for the Wii 's Virtual Console in Japan in 2006 and in North America and PAL regions in 2007 ; there were no changes from the original SNES version . It was also released for the Wii U Virtual Console , which integrated Off @-@ TV Play and Miiverse features to the game , as well as on the New Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Super Mario World is a two @-@ dimensional platform game in which the player controls the on @-@ screen protagonist ( either Mario or Luigi ) from a third @-@ person perspective . The game shares similar gameplay mechanics with previous titles in the series — Super Mario Bros. , Super Mario Bros. 2 , and Super Mario Bros. 3 — but introduces several new elements . In addition to the running and jumping moves found in past games , the player can float with the aid of special items and execute new types of jumps such as the spin jump . 
 The player navigates through the game via two game screens : an overworld map and a sidescrolling playfield . The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world 's entrance to a castle . Paths connect to action panels , fortresses , ghost houses and other map icons , and allow players to take different routes to reach the world 's goal . Moving the on @-@ screen character to an action panel or fortress will allow access to that level 's playfield . The majority of the game takes place in these levels , populated with obstacles and enemies , with the player traversing the stage by running , jumping , and dodging or defeating enemies . The player is given a certain amount of lives , which are lost when Mario is attacked by an enemy while small , falls into a pit or lava , or runs out of time . If all lives are lost at any point in the game , the " Game Over " screen will appear , in which the player can continue from the last level played by selecting " Continue " . Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat ; each of the seven worlds feature fortresses controlled by one of the Koopalings , and the player also battles Bowser in his castle in the seventh world . In addition to special items from previous games like the " Super Mushroom " and " Fire Flower " , new power @-@ ups are introduced that provide the player with new gameplay options . In addition , the " Spin Attack " jump is initiated with the " A " button . The spin attack allows Mario or Luigi to break blocks beneath him . 
 The new suit in the game is the cape feather , which gives Mario a cape and allows him to fly . This suit is also similar to the Tanooki Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3 in terms of gameplay mechanics but with a few alterations : the player can now hold the B button to fly when Mario is able to do so , and can glide using the cape as a sail . However , the Super Leaf , Tanooki Suit , Frog Suit , and Hammer Suit power @-@ ups from Super Mario Bros. 3 did not return . The game also introduced the ability to " store " an extra power @-@ up in a box located at the top center of the screen . For example , if Super Mario obtains a Fire Flower or Cape Feather or picks up another Super Mushroom , a Mushroom is stored in the box . If Cape Mario finds a Fire Flower , a Cape Feather will be stored in the box . The power @-@ up can be released by pressing the Select button or will automatically deploy if Mario is hit by an enemy . 
 The game introduces Yoshi , a dinosaur companion whom Mario can ride and who is able to eat most enemies . If Yoshi attempts to eat a Koopa or its shell , he will hold it in his mouth for a period of time before swallowing it ; Yoshi can also spit out the shell , which will behave as if kicked by Mario . Yoshi gains special abilities while holding a colored shell in his mouth : a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly , a yellow shell causes Yoshi to emit dust clouds that kill nearby enemies , and a red shell allows Yoshi to produce three fireballs . Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities , while green shells produce none . The default Yoshi is green , but the game also contains blue , yellow , and red Yoshis ; the player can obtain each Yoshi by finding its egg in Star World and feeding enemies to it until it matures . When holding any Koopa shell in its mouth , a Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its own color , in addition to that of the shell . 
 Super Mario World includes a multiplayer option which allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels ; the first player controls Mario , while the other controls Luigi . Although Mario and Luigi must generally navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game , the player can beat the game much faster by using the Star Road routes . In addition , there are a number of levels that have hidden exits , so Mario can navigate Bowser 's castle in several ways . Furthermore , the exploration of these secret stages can lead to other stages , such as Special World . Completion of Special World permanently alters some sprites and the overworld map 's color scheme .

 After saving the Mushroom Kingdom in Super Mario Bros. 3 , brothers Mario and Luigi agree to take a vacation to a place called Dinosaur Land , where there are many types of dinosaurs . However , while resting on the beach , Princess Toadstool disappears . When Mario and Luigi wake up they try to find her and , after hours of searching , come across a giant egg in the forest . It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi , who then tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopas . Mario and Luigi soon realize that it must be the evil King Bowser and his Koopalings . 
 Mario , Luigi and Yoshi set out to save Princess Toadstool and Yoshi 's dinosaur friends , exploring Dinosaur Land for Bowser and his Koopalings . To aid him , Yoshi gives Mario a cape as they begin their journey . Mario and Luigi continue to follow Bowser , defeating the Koopalings in the process , and save all of Yoshi 's dinosaur friends . They eventually make it to Bowser 's castle , where they fight him in a final battle . They defeat Bowser and save the Princess , restoring peace to Dinosaur Land .

 The game was directed by Takashi Tezuka and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto , the creator of Mario and The Legend of Zelda , with <unk> Hino as the graphics designer . Development was handled by Nintendo EAD , headed by Miyamoto . It took three years to develop the game with a team of sixteen people . However , Miyamoto stated that he felt that the game was incomplete and that development was rushed toward the end , voicing hope that with time the games for the system would allow for more emotion and story . 
 Miyamoto stated that he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since Super Mario Bros. ; however , Nintendo engineers could not fit the companion into the limitations of the Nintendo Entertainment System . He said that " we were finally able to get Yoshi off the drawing boards with the SNES " . Yoshi came in one size and four colors , with different powers and huge appetites . Super Mario World arrived in 1991 alongside the Super NES in North America .

In this version , Luigi has his own sprite ( in the original , Luigi 's sprite was simply a palette swap of the Mario sprite ) , while the rest remained the same . In 1995 , two companies known as Hummer Team and JY Company ported the Super Famicom version of Super Mario World to the Famicom in China with no license . Super Mario World was one of the first games to be announced for the Wii 's Virtual Console . It was released in Japan on December 2 , 2006 , in the United States on February 5 , 2007 , and in the Europe on February 9 , 2007 .

 Between 2001 and 2002 , Super Mario World was ported to the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario World : Super Mario Advance 2 . Some levels were minimally changed , but the most noticeable alteration was making the game for one player only instead of two . However , Luigi was still usable , but this time as an alternate character ; he could jump higher than Mario , but he ran slightly slower . Mario or Luigi could be selected by pressing the GBA shoulder buttons on the map screen . They were also given voices , which were done by Charles Martinet . Luigi 's sprites were changed once again with his appearance closer to the original Super Mario Advance game , which was based on Super Mario Bros. 2 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Koji Kondo composed the music used in Super Mario World , using only an electronic keyboard . The entirety of the music heard in the game , with the exception of the music played in the title screen , credits , maps , and fighting Bowser , is a variation on the same melody . The melody , played in F major is heard normally on the standard overworld levels . It is slowed down and made to echo in caverns , whereas it moves in a slow , wave @-@ like fashion , a slow ( in 3 / 4 or waltz time ) in underwater levels ( a recurring musical tradition in underwater levels played in Super Mario games ) ; in the athletic theme , it is played quickly and energetically to suit the more risky and lively nature of a level taking place in the air . The castle theme is a symphonic variation of the melody in F minor , then C minor , giving the song an overall ominous tone . 
 The Super Mario Bros. theme can be heard in the Special Zone if the player leaves the overworld screen open for a few minutes . When riding on Yoshi , the soundtrack of any level is accompanied by bongo drums , a sound design element that was carried over into Super Mario Sunshine , as well as New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Super Mario Galaxy 2 some 18 years later . 
 The soundtrack for Super Mario World 's overworld and castle levels are present in the animated series and in later Super Mario games .

Olga 's relationship with her mother , Empress Marie , the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark , was strained and distant from childhood . In contrast , she and her father were close . He died when she was 12 , and her brother Nicholas became emperor . 
 In 1901 , she married Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg , who was privately believed by family and friends to be homosexual . Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated , and Peter at first refused Olga 's request for a divorce . The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916 . The following month Olga married cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky , with whom she had fallen in love several years before . During the First World War , the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse at the front and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry . At the downfall of the Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917 , she fled to the Crimea with her husband and children , where they lived under the threat of assassination . Her brother and his family were shot by revolutionaries . 
 Olga escaped revolutionary Russia with her second husband and their two sons in February 1920 . They joined her mother , the Dowager Empress , in Denmark . In exile , Olga acted as companion and secretary to her mother , and was often sought out by Romanov impostors who claimed to be her dead relatives . She met Anna Anderson , the best @-@ known impostor , in Berlin in 1925 . After the Dowager Empress 's death in 1928 , Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in Ballerup , near Copenhagen . She led a simple life : raising her two sons , working on the farm and painting . During her lifetime , she painted over 2 @,@ 000 works of art , which provided extra income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported . 
 In 1948 , feeling threatened by Joseph Stalin 's regime , Olga emigrated with her immediate family to a farm in Ontario , Canada . With advancing age , Olga and her husband moved to a bungalow near Cooksville , Ontario . Colonel Kulikovsky died there in 1958 . Two years later , as her health deteriorated , Olga moved with devoted friends to a small apartment in East Toronto . She died aged 78 , seven months after her older sister , Xenia . At the end of her life and afterwards , Olga was widely labeled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia .

 Olga was the youngest daughter of Tsar Alexander III and his consort , Marie Feodorovna , formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark . She was born in the purple , i.e. during her father 's reign , on 13 June 1882 in the Peterhof Palace , west of central Saint Petersburg . Her birth was announced by a traditional 101 @-@ gun salute from the ramparts of the Peter and Paul Fortress , and similar salutes throughout the Russian Empire . Her mother , advised by her sister , Alexandra , Princess of Wales , placed Olga in the care of an English nanny , Elizabeth Franklin . 
 The Russian imperial family was a frequent target for assassins , so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) west of Saint Petersburg . Olga and her siblings , however , were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle . Conditions in the nursery were modest , even Spartan . They slept on hard camp beds , rose at dawn , washed in cold water , and ate a simple porridge for breakfast . 
 Olga left Gatchina for the first time in the early fall of 1888 when the imperial family visited the Caucasus . On 29 October , their return train approached the small town of <unk> at speed . Olga 's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining @-@ car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails . The carriage was torn open ; the heavy iron roof caved in , and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off . The Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof , and held it up with " a Herculean effort " so that the others could escape . There were 21 fatalities . Empress Marie helped tend the wounded , and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes . An official investigation found that the crash was an accident , but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line . 
 The Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught at home by private tutors . Subjects included history , geography , Russian , English and French , as well as drawing and dancing . Physical activities such as equestrianism were taught at an early age , and they became expert riders . The family was deeply religious . Although Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance , Lent was strictly observed — meat , dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided . Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof and with Olga 's grandparents in Denmark . 
 Empress Marie was reserved and formal with Olga as a child , and their relationship remained a difficult one . However , Olga , her father , and the youngest of her brothers , Michael , had a close relationship . Together , the three frequently went on hikes within the Gatchina forests , where the Tsar taught Olga and Michael woodsmanship . Olga said of her father : 
 My father was everything to me . Immersed in work as he was , he always spared that daily half @-@ hour . ... once my father showed me a very old album full of most exciting pen and ink sketches of an imaginary city called <unk> , inhabited by <unk> [ pug dogs ] . He showed it to me in secret , and I was thrilled to have him share his own childhood secrets with me . 
 During 1894 Olga 's father became increasingly ill , and the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled . On 13 November 1894 , he died at the age of 49 . The emotional impact on Olga , aged only 12 , was traumatic , and her eldest brother , the new Tsar Nicholas II , was propelled into a role for which in Olga 's later opinion he was ill @-@ prepared . 
 = = Court life = = 
 Olga was due to enter society in the summer of 1899 , but after the death of her brother George at the age of 27 , her first official public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900 . She hated the experience , and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres , " I felt as though I were an animal in a cage — exhibited to the public for the first time . " From 1901 , Olga was appointed honorary Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army . The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813 , and wore a distinctive brown <unk> . 
 By 1900 Olga , age 18 , was being escorted to the theatre and opera by a distant cousin , Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg , a member of the Russian branch of the House of Oldenburg . He was 14 years her senior and known for his passion for literature and gambling . Peter asked for Olga 's hand in marriage the following year , a proposal that took the Grand Duchess completely by surprise : " I was so taken aback that all I could say was ' thank you ' , " she later explained . 
 Their engagement , announced in May 1901 , was unexpected by family and friends , as Peter had shown no prior interest in women , and members of society assumed he was homosexual . At the age of 19 , on 9 August 1901 , Olga married 33 @-@ year @-@ old Peter . After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the Field of Mars . Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears , while her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning . Their marriage remained unconsummated , and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother . Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother , the Dowager Empress , or avoid marriage into a foreign court . The couple initially lived with her in laws Alexander Petrovich and Eugénie <unk> of Oldenburg . It was not an harmonious arrangement as Peter 's parents , both well known for their philanthropic work , berated their only son for his laziness . Eugénie , a close friend of the Dowager Empress , showered her daughter @-@ in @-@ law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had been a present to Joséphine de Beauharnais from Napoleon , but Olga took a dislike towards her mother @-@ in @-@ law . A few weeks after the wedding , Olga and her husband traveled to Biarritz , France , from where they sailed to Sorrento , Italy , on a yacht loaned to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain . 
 On their return to Russia , they settled into a 200 @-@ room palace ( the former <unk> mansion ) at 46 Sergievskaya Street ( today Tchaikovsky Street ) , Saint Petersburg . The palace , a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister , now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry . Olga and Peter had separate bedrooms at opposite ends of the building , and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio . Unhappy in her marriage , she fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair , forcing her to wear a wig . It took two years for her hair to regrow . 
 Near the Oldenburg 's estate , Ramon in Voronezh province , Olga had her own villa , called " Olgino " after the local town . She subsidized the village school out of her own pocket , and established a hospital . Her daughter @-@ in @-@ law later wrote , " She tried to help every needy person as far as her strengths and means would permit . " At the hospital , she learned basic medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor . She exemplified her strong Orthodox faith by creating religious icons , which she distributed to the charitable endeavours she supported . At Ramon Olga and Peter enjoyed walking through the nearby woods and hunted wolves together . He was kind and considerate towards her , but she longed for love , a normal marriage and children . 
 In April 1903 , she was introduced to a Blue Cuirassier Guards officer Nikolai Kulikovsky by her brother Michael during a royal military review at Pavlovsk Palace . Olga and Kulikovsky began to see each other , and exchanged letters regularly . The same year , at the age of 22 , she confronted her husband and asked for a divorce , which he refused with the qualification that he might reconsider after seven years . Nevertheless , Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an aide @-@ de @-@ camp , and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya Street . The relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public , but gossip about their romance spread through society . 
 From 1904 to 1906 , Duke Peter was appointed to a military post in Tsarskoye Selo , a complex of palaces just south of Saint Petersburg . In Tsarskoye Selo , the Grand Duchess grew close to her brother Nicholas and his family , who lived at the Alexander Palace near her own residence . Olga prized her connection to the Tsar 's four daughters . From 1906 to 1914 , Olga took her nieces to parties and engagements in Saint Petersburg , without their parents , every weekend throughout the winter . She especially took a liking to the youngest of Nicholas 's daughters , her god @-@ daughter Anastasia , whom she called <unk> ( " little one " ) . Through her brother and sister @-@ in @-@ law , Olga met Rasputin , a self @-@ styled holy man who purported to have healing powers . Although she made no public criticisms of Rasputin 's association with the imperial family , she was unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him . As Olga grew close to her brother 's family , her relationship with her other surviving brother , Michael , deteriorated . To her and Nicholas 's horror , Michael eloped with his mistress , a twice @-@ divorced commoner , and communication between Michael and the rest of the family was essentially cut off . 
 Public unrest over the Russo @-@ Japanese War and demands for political reform increased in the early years of the twentieth century . At Epiphany 1905 , a band of revolutionaries fired live rounds at the Winter Palace from the Peter and Paul Fortress . Olga and the Dowager Empress were showered with glass splinters from a smashed window , but were unharmed . Three weeks later , on " Bloody Sunday " , at least 92 people were killed by Cossack troops during a demonstration , and a month later Olga 's uncle , Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia , was assassinated . Uprisings occurred throughout the country , and parts of the navy mutinied . Olga supported the appointment of the liberal Pyotr Stolypin as prime minister , and he embarked on a programme of gradual reform , but in 1911 he was assassinated . The public unrest , Michael 's elopement , and Olga 's sham marriage placed her under strain , and in 1912 , while visiting England with her mother , she suffered a nervous breakdown . Tsarina Alexandra was also unwell with fatigue , concerned by the poor health of her hemophiliac son , Alexei . Olga stood in for the Tsarina at public events , and accompanied her brother on a tour of the interior , while the Tsarina remained at home . 
 = = War and revolution = = 
 On 1 August 1914 , just before the start of World War I , Olga 's regiment , the Akhtyrsky Hussars , appeared at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at <unk> Selo . Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars , who were stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia . With the Grand Duchess 's prior medical knowledge from the village of Olgino , she started work as a nurse at an under @-@ staffed Red Cross hospital in Rovno , near to where her own regiment was stationed . During the war , she came under heavy Austrian fire while attending the regiment at the front . Nurses rarely worked so close to the frontlines and consequently she was awarded the Order of St. George by General Mannerheim , who later became President of Finland . As the Russians lost ground to the Central Powers , Olga 's hospital was moved eastwards to Kiev , and Michael returned to Russia from exile abroad . 
 In 1916 , Tsar Nicholas II officially annulled the marriage between Duke Peter Alexandrovich and the Grand Duchess , allowing her to marry Colonel Kulikovsky . The service was performed on 16 November 1916 in the <unk> @-@ <unk> Church on <unk> ( Three Saints Street ) in Kiev . The only guests were the Dowager Empress , Olga 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Grand Duke Alexander , four officers of the Akhtyrsky Regiment , and two of Olga 's fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev . 
 During the war , internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew . After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917 , many members of the Romanov dynasty , including Nicholas and his immediate family , were detained under house arrest . In search of safety , the Dowager Empress , Grand Duke Alexander , and Grand Duchess Olga traveled to the Crimea by special train , where they were joined by Olga 's sister Grand Duchess Xenia . They lived at Alexander 's estate , Ay @-@ Todor , about 12 miles ( 19 km ) from Yalta , where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces . On 12 August 1917 , her first child and son , Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during their virtual imprisonment . He was named after Tikhon of <unk> , the Saint venerated near the Grand Duchess 's estate at Olgino . Although Tikhon was the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another , neither he nor his younger brother Guri received any title as his father was a commoner . 
 The Romanovs isolated in the Crimea knew little of the fate of the Tsar and his family . Nicholas , Alexandra , and their children , were originally held at their official residence , the Alexander Palace , but the Provisional government under Alexander Kerensky relocated them to Tobolsk , Siberia . In February 1918 , most of the imperial family at Ay @-@ Todor was moved to another estate at <unk> , where Grand Dukes Nicholas and Peter were already under house arrest . Olga and her husband were left at Ay @-@ Todor . The entire Romanov family in the Crimea was condemned to death by the Yalta revolutionary council , but the executions were delayed by political rivalry between the Yalta and Sevastopol Soviets . By March 1918 , the Central Power of Germany had advanced on the Crimea , and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones . In November 1918 , the German forces were informed that their nation had lost the war , and they evacuated homewards . Allied forces took over the Crimean ports , in support of the loyalist White Army , which temporarily allowed the surviving members of the Romanov family time to escape abroad . The Dowager Empress and , at her insistence , most of her family and friends were evacuated by the British warship HMS Marlborough . Nicholas II , however , had already been shot dead and the family assumed , correctly , that his wife and children had also been killed . Unknown to her , Olga 's childhood confidant and brother Michael , Nicholas II 's supposed successor , had been assassinated near Perm on 13 June 1918 . 
 Olga and her husband refused to leave Russia , and decided to move to the Caucasus , which the White Army had cleared of revolutionary Bolsheviks . An imperial bodyguard , <unk> <unk> , guided them to his hometown , the large Cossack village of <unk> . In a rented five @-@ room farmhouse there , Olga gave birth to her second son , Guri Nikolaevich , on 23 April 1919 . He was named after a friend of hers , Guri <unk> , who was killed while serving in the Akhtyrsky Regiment during World War I. In November 1919 , the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia . Just ahead of revolutionary troops , they escaped to Novorossiysk , and took refuge in the residence of the Danish consul , Thomas Schytte , who informed them of the Dowager Empress 's safe arrival in Denmark . After a brief stay with the consul , the family were shipped to a refugee camp on the island of <unk> in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul , Turkey , where Olga , her husband and children shared three rooms with eleven other adults . After two weeks , they were evacuated to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes where she was visited by Regent Alexander <unk> , later King Alexander I of Yugoslavia . Alexander offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home , but Olga was summoned to Denmark by her mother . On Good Friday 1920 , Olga and her family arrived in Copenhagen . They lived with the Dowager Empress , at first at the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvidøre , where Olga acted as her mother 's secretary and companion . It was a difficult arrangement at times . The Dowager Empress insisted on having Olga at her beck and call and found Olga 's young sons too boisterous . Having never reconciled with the idea of her daughter 's marriage to a commoner , she was cold towards Kulikovsky , rarely allowing him in her presence . At formal functions , Olga was expected to accompany her mother alone . 
 = = Anna Anderson = = 
 In 1925 , Olga and Colonel Kulikovsky traveled to Berlin to meet Anna Anderson , who claimed to be Olga 's niece , Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia . Anderson had attempted suicide in Berlin in 1920 , which Olga later called " probably the only indisputable fact in the whole story " . Anderson claimed that with the help of a man named Tchaikovsky she had escaped from revolutionary Russia via Bucharest , where she had given birth to his child . Olga thought the story " palpably false " , since Anderson made no attempt to approach Queen Marie of Romania , during her entire alleged time in Bucharest . Olga said : 
 If Mrs. Anderson had indeed been Anastasia , Queen Marie would have recognized her on the spot . ... Marie would never have been shocked at anything , and a niece of mine would have known it . ... There is not one tittle of genuine evidence in the story . The woman keeps away from the one relative who would have been the first to recognize her , understand her desperate plight , and sympathize with her . 
 Anderson stated she was in Berlin to inform Princess Irene of Prussia ( sister of Tsarina Alexandra and cousin of Tsar Nicholas II ) of her survival . Olga commented , " [ Princess Irene ] was one of the most <unk> women in her generation . My niece would have known that her condition would have indeed have shocked [ her ] . " 
 Olga met Anderson , who was being treated for tuberculosis , at a nursing home . Of the visit Olga later said : 
 My beloved Anastasia was fifteen when I saw her for the last time in the summer of 1916 . She would have been twenty @-@ four in 1925 . I thought Mrs. Anderson looked much older than that . Of course , one had to make allowances for a very long illness ... All the same , my niece 's features could not possibly have altered out of all recognition . The nose , the mouth , the eyes were all different . ... As soon as I sat down by that bed in the Mommsen Nursing Home , I knew I was looking at a stranger . ... I had left Denmark with something of a hope in my heart . I left Berlin with all hope extinguished . 
 In addition , Olga said she was dismayed that Anderson spoke only German and showed no sign of knowing either English or Russian , while Anastasia spoke both those languages fluently and was ignorant of German . Nevertheless , Olga remained sympathetic towards Anderson , perhaps because she thought that she was ill rather than deliberately deceitful . Olga later explained : 
 ... she did not strike me as an out @-@ and @-@ out impostor . Her <unk> warred against it . A cunning impostor would have done all she could to ingratiate herself ... But Mrs. Anderson 's manner would have put anyone off . My own conviction is that it all started with some unscrupulous people who hoped they might lay their hands on at least a share of the fabulous and utterly non @-@ existent Romanov fortune ... I had a feeling she was ' briefed , ' as it were , but far from perfectly . The mistakes she made could not all be attributed to lapses of memory . For instance , she had a scar on one of her fingers and she kept telling everybody that it had been crushed because of a footman shutting the door of a landau too quickly . And at once I remembered the real incident . It was Marie , her elder sister , who got her hand hurt rather badly , and it did not happen in a carriage but on board the imperial train . Obviously someone , having heard something of the incident , had passed a garbled version of it to Mrs. Anderson . 
 Conceivably , Olga was initially either open to the possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind . Anderson 's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador , Herluf Zahle , at the end of October 1925 : " My feeling is that she is not the one she believes — but one can 't say she is not as a fact " . However , within a month she had made up her mind . She wrote to a friend , " There is no resemblance , and she is undoubtedly not A. " Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters , which were used by Anderson 's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia . Olga later said she sent the gift and letters " out of pity " , and called the claims " a complete fabrication " . When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper , Anderson 's supporters , Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin , claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram , which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony . She told her official biographer , " I never received any such telegram . " The supposed telegram was never produced by Anderson 's supporters , and it has never been found among any of the papers relating to the case . Xenia said , 
 [ Anderson 's supporters ] told the most terrible lies about my sister and me ... I was supposed to have sent Olga a telegram saying , ' On no account recognize Anastasia . ' That was a fantasy . I never sent any telegrams , or gave my sister any advice about her visit to Berlin . We were all apprehensive about the wisdom of her going , but only because we feared it would be used for propaganda purposes by the claimant 's supporters . ... My sister Olga felt sorry for that poor woman . She was kind to her , and because of her kindness of heart , her opinions and motives have been misrepresented .

 The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvidøre . Her estate was sold and Olga purchased Knudsminde , a farm in Ballerup about 15 miles ( 24 km ) from Copenhagen , with her portion of the proceeds . They kept horses , in which Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested , along with Jersey cows , pigs , chickens , geese , dogs and cats . For transport they had a small car and a sledge . <unk> and Guri ( age thirteen and eleven , respectively when they moved to Knudsminde ) grew up on the farm . Olga ran the household with the help of her elderly , faithful lady 's maid Emilia Tenso ( " Mimka " ) , who had come along with her from Russia . The Grand Duchess lived with simplicity working in the fields , doing household chores and painting . 
 The farm became a center for the Russian monarchist community in Denmark and many Russian emigrants visited . Olga maintained a high level of correspondence with the Russian émigré community and former members of the imperial army . On 2 February 1935 in the Russian Orthodox Church in Copenhagen , she and her husband were godparents , with her cousin Prince Gustav of Denmark , to Aleksander Schalburg , son of Russian @-@ born Danish army officer Christian Frederik von Schalburg . In the 1930s , the family took annual holidays at <unk> Castle , Sweden , with Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and his wife , Louise . Olga began to sell her own paintings , of Russian and Danish scenes , with exhibition auctions in Copenhagen , London , Paris , and Berlin . Some of the proceeds were donated to the charities she supported . 
 Neutral Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940 , and was occupied for the remainder of World War II . Food shortages , communication restrictions , and transportation closures followed . As Olga 's sons , Tikhon and Guri , served as officers in the Danish Army , they were interned as prisoners of war , but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months . Tikhon was imprisoned for a further month in 1943 after being arrested on charges of espionage . Other Russian émigrés , keen to fight against the Soviets , enlisted in the German forces . Despite her sons ' internment and her mother 's Danish origins , Olga was implicated in her compatriots ' collusion with German forces , as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism . On 4 May 1945 , German forces in Denmark surrendered to the British . When economic and social conditions for Russian exiles failed to improve , General Pyotr Krasnov wrote to the Grand Duchess , detailing the wretched conditions affecting Russian immigrants in Denmark . She in turn asked Prince Axel of Denmark to help them , but her request was refused . 
 With the end of World War II , Soviet troops occupied the easternmost part of Denmark , and the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the Soviet government . The surviving Romanovs in Denmark grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt , and Olga decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada . 
 = = Emigration to Canada = = 
 In May 1948 , the Kulikovskys traveled to London by Danish troopship . They were housed in a grace and favour apartment at Hampton Court Palace while arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural immigrants . On 2 June 1948 , Olga , Kulikovsky , Tikhon and his Danish @-@ born wife <unk> , Guli and his Danish @-@ born wife Ruth , Guli and Ruth 's two children , Xenia and Leonid , and Olga 's devoted companion and former maid Emilia Tenso ( " Mimka " ) departed Liverpool on board the Empress of Canada . After a rough crossing , the ship docked at Halifax , Nova Scotia . The family proceeded to Toronto , where they lived until they purchased a 200 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) farm in Halton County , Ontario , near <unk> . 
 By 1952 , the farm had become a burden to Olga and her husband . They were both elderly ; their sons had moved away ; labor was hard to come by ; the Colonel suffered increasing ill @-@ health , and some of Olga 's remaining jewelry was stolen . The farm was sold , and Olga , her husband and her former maid , Mimka , moved to a smaller five @-@ room house at 2130 Camilla Road , Cooksville , Ontario , a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga . Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid , and Olga nursed her until Mimka 's death on 24 January 1954 . 
 Neighbors and visitors to the region , including foreign and royal dignitaries , took interest in Olga , and visited her small home , which was also a magnet for Romanov impostors whom Olga and her family considered a menace . Welcome visitors included Princess Marina , Duchess of Kent , in 1954 , and Louis Mountbatten and his wife Edwina , in August 1959 . In June 1959 , Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited Toronto and invited the Grand Duchess for lunch on board the Royal Yacht , Britannia . 
 By 1958 , Olga 's husband was virtually paralyzed , and Olga sold some of her remaining jewelry in an attempt to raise funds . Following her husband 's death in 1958 , she became increasingly infirm until hospitalized in April 1960 at Toronto General Hospital . She was not informed or was not aware that her elder sister , Xenia , died in London that month . Unable to care for herself , Olga went to stay with Russian émigré friends , Konstantin and <unk> <unk> , in an apartment above a beauty salon at 716 Gerrard Street East , Toronto . She slipped into a coma on 21 November 1960 , and died on 24 November at the age of 78 . 
 She was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery , Toronto , on 30 November 1960 , after a funeral service at Christ the Saviour Cathedral , Toronto . Officers of the Akhtyrsky Hussars and the Blue Cuirassiers stood guard in the small Russian church , which overflowed with mourners . Although she lived simply , bought cheap clothes , and did her own shopping and gardening , her estate was valued at more than 200 @,@ 000 Canadian dollars ( about 1 @.@ 5 million Canadian dollars as of 2013 ) and was mostly held as stock and bonds . Her material possessions were appraised at 350 Canadian dollars in total , which biographer Patricia Phenix considered an underestimate . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Olga began drawing and painting at a young age . She told her official biographer Ian Vorres : 
 Even during my geography and arithmetic lessons , I was allowed to sit with a pencil in my hand . I could listen much better when I was drawing corn or wild flowers . 
 She painted throughout her life , on paper , canvas and ceramic , and her output is estimated at over 2 @,@ 000 pieces . Her usual medium was scenery and landscape , but she also painted portraits and still lifes . Vorres wrote , 
 Her paintings , vivid and sensitive , are immersed in the subdued light of her beloved Russia . Besides her numerous landscapes and flower pictures that reveal her inherent love for nature , she often also dwells on scenes from simple daily life ... executed with a sensitive eye for composition , expression and detail . Her work exudes peace , serenity and a spirit of love that mirror her own character , in total contrast to the suffering she experienced through most of her life . 
 Her daughter @-@ in @-@ law wrote , 
 Being a deeply religious person , the Grand Duchess perceived the beauty of nature as being divinely inspired creation . Prayer and attending church provided her with the strength not only to overcome the new difficulties befallen her , but also to continue with her drawing . These feelings of gratefulness to God pervaded not only the icons created by the Grand Duchess , but also her portraits and still life paintings . 
 Her paintings were a profitable source of income . According to her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , Olga preferred to exhibit in Denmark to avoid the commercialism of the North American market . The Russian Relief Programme , which was founded by Tikhon and his third wife Olga in honour of the Grand Duchess , exhibited a selection of her work at the residence of the Russian ambassador in Washington in 2001 , in Moscow in 2002 , in Ekaterinburg in 2004 , in Saint Petersburg and Moscow in 2005 , in Tyumen and <unk> in 2006 , at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow and Saint Michael 's Castle in Saint Petersburg in 2007 , and at the Vladimir <unk> Museum in Vladivostok in 2013 . Pieces by Olga are included in the collections of Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , King Harald of Norway , and private collections in North America and Europe . Ballerup Museum in <unk> , Denmark , has around 100 of her works .

She had a range of 6 @,@ 200 nmi ( 11 @,@ 500 km ; 7 @,@ 100 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) while on the surface and 73 – 94 nmi ( 135 – 174 km ; 84 – 108 mi ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) while submerged . U @-@ 30 had five torpedo tubes , ( four in the bow , one in the stern ) . She could also carry a total of eleven 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 in ) torpedoes or 22 TMA mines or 33 TMB mines and had a 8 @.@ 8 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) C35 / L45 deck gun ( with 220 rounds ) . She was equipped with one 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) C 30 anti @-@ aircraft gun . After being commissioned and deployed , U @-@ 30 was stationed in the German port city of Wilhelmshaven .

 During her career U @-@ 30 was involved in eight war patrols and sank 16 merchant ships , totalling 86 @,@ 165 gross register tons ( GRT ) and one auxiliary warship of 325 GRT . U @-@ 30 also damaged one ship of 5 @,@ 642 GRT and damaged the British battleship HMS Barham . All of these attacks took place under the command of Kptlt . Fritz @-@ Julius Lemp . 
 = = = First patrol and the sinking of Athenia = = = 
 U @-@ 30 went to sea on 22 August 1939 , before World War II began . Her active service career began on 3 September 1939 , just 12 days after leaving Wilhelmshaven and only 10 hours after Great Britain declared war on Germany , she sank the 13 @,@ 581 ton passenger ship SS Athenia about 200 nmi ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) west of the Hebrides while she was en route from Liverpool to Montreal in Canada . The Athenia was the first ship sunk in World War II ; out of 1 @,@ 400 passengers , 112 of them , including 28 neutral Americans , died . After sinking Athenia , U @-@ 30 went on to sink two more vessels , <unk> and the SS Fanad Head . 
 Following the attack , the German Ministry of Propaganda checked incoming reports from both London and the German Naval High command . Having been told by Kriegsmarine that there was not a single U @-@ boat in the vicinity of Athenia on the day of her sinking , the Propaganda Ministry promptly denied all allegations that any German U @-@ boat had sunk Athenia . They claimed instead that the British had torpedoed their own vessel in an attempt to bring the United States into the war on the side of the Allies . 
 In order to calm @-@ down any American response to the sinking of Athenia , Joachim von Ribbentrop , the German Foreign Minister , arranged a meeting between Grand Admiral Erich Raeder and the American naval attaché on 16 September 1939 . During the meeting , Raeder assured the attaché that he had received reports from every German submarine at sea and " as a result of which it was definitely established that Athenia had not been sunk by a German U @-@ boat " . Raeder then asked the attaché to inform the American government . However , not every submarine had returned to port and all U @-@ boats maintained radio silence while at sea . 
 Once U @-@ 30 docked on 27 September , Admiral Karl Dönitz met Lemp while he was disembarking from the U @-@ boat . Dönitz later said that Lemp looked " very unhappy " and that he told the Admiral that he was in fact responsible for the sinking of Athenia . Lemp had mistaken Athenia for an armed merchant cruiser , which he claimed was zig @-@ zagging . Dönitz subsequently received orders that Athenia affair was to be kept a " total secret " , the High Command of the Navy ( OKM ) were not to court @-@ martial Lemp as they considered his actions in good @-@ faith , and that any other political explanations about the sinking of Athenia were to be handled by the OKM who would deny any allegations that a German U @-@ boat had sunk the vessel . In order to keep the sinking of Athenia a secret , Dönitz had U @-@ 30 's log altered in order to erase any evidence . It was not until the Nuremberg trials in 1946 that the truth about the fate of the liner was brought forth publicly by the Germans . 
 = = = Second patrol = = = 
 As a result of the investigation undertaken by the German General Staff following the sinking of Athenia , U @-@ 30 remained in port until 9 December 1939 when she was finally allowed to put to sea again for her second war patrol . It lasted only six days , during which time she travelled up to the southern coast of ( then neutral ) Norway before returning to Wilhelmshaven on 14 December 1939 . During the voyage U @-@ 30 did not encounter any enemy vessels , consequently she returned to port without any claims . 
 = = = Third patrol = = = 
 U @-@ 30 's third patrol was much more successful . Having left Wilhelmshaven on 23 December 1939 , she journeyed into the North Sea . She then circumnavigated the British Isles and travelled along the southern coast of Ireland . It was near to the west coast of Scotland that U @-@ 30 sank her first enemy vessel during her third patrol , the 325 ton anti @-@ submarine trawler HMS Barbara Robertson , on 28 December . That same day , she hit a much bigger target , the British battleship HMS Barham . Following the sinking of Barbara Robertson , U @-@ 30 fired a torpedo at the battleship and damaged her , killing four crew members . U @-@ 30 's next three victims were sunk by mines laid by the U @-@ boat : El Oso , sunk on 11 January ; Gracia , damaged on 16 January and <unk> , sunk on 17 January . Meanwhile , U @-@ 30 returned to her home port of Wilhelmshaven on 17 January 1940 .

 The fourth patrol that U @-@ 30 undertook began on 11 March 1940 when she left Wilhelmshaven for the west coast of Norway in preparation for the invasion of that country . For a period of 20 days , she traveled northeast along the Norwegian coast in search of any Allied convoys , she did not find any and returned to Wilhelmshaven on 30 March 1940 . 
 = = = Fifth patrol = = = 
 Like her fourth patrol , U @-@ 30 's fifth patrol ended without any losses . She put to sea on 3 April 1940 to support the German invasion of Norway and Denmark ( codenamed Operation <unk> ) . For 32 days , U @-@ 30 travelled up the west coast of Norway . She then headed southwest to Scotland in order to intercept British warships that were heading north to defend Norway . She failed to encounter any vessels , however , and returned to Wilhelmshaven , arriving there on 4 May . 
 = = = Sixth patrol = = = 
 U @-@ 30 's sixth patrol was the first time in which she had sunk any enemy ships since her third patrol . Having left Wilhelmshaven on 8 June 1940 , she once again entered the North Sea in an attempt to sink any Allied ships in the area . For 32 days , U @-@ 30 circumnavigated the British Isles and sank five enemy ships in the Bay of Biscay . The first vessel to be attacked was the 4 @,@ 876 ton British merchantman , <unk> which was sunk on 20 June 1940 . Two days later , the 3 @,@ 999 ton Norwegian vessel Randsfjord was sunk . On 28 June , the British ship <unk> was torpedoed , followed by <unk> on 1 July and the Egyptian <unk> <unk> on 6 July . Following these attacks , U @-@ 30 headed back to port . Instead of returning to Wilhelmshaven , however , U @-@ 30 put in at Lorient , in France , which had been captured after the fall of that country . In doing so , she became the first German U @-@ boat to enter the port . 
 = = = Later patrols and retirement = = = 
 U @-@ 30 began her first patrol operating from Lorient and her seventh overall on 13 July 1940 . During a period of 12 days , she traveled as far south as Portugal and sank the 712 ton British ship <unk> on the 21st . Three days later , on 24 July , U @-@ 30 returned to Lorient , having experienced a malfunction in one of her engines . It then became clear that the boat was suffering a number of mechanical difficulties and as a result it was decided that she would need to be used sparingly . For her next patrol it was decided that she would leave from Lorient , but would return to Germany . 
 The eighth and last war patrol that U @-@ 30 was to undertake , began on 5 August 1940 when she left Lorient for the North Atlantic . In 26 days , she travelled north of the British Isles , into the North Sea and entered the German port city of Kiel on 30 August 1940 . During that time , she sank the Swedish vessel Canton on 9 August and the British steam merchantman Clan Macphee on 16 August 1940 . Both of these attacks took place off the west coast of neutral Ireland . After these successes , however , U @-@ 30 once again experienced engine trouble and was forced to end her patrol early , returning to Germany . Before she arrived , Lemp received word that he had been awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for the boat 's previous war patrols . 
 Following her eighth patrol , U @-@ 30 was retired from front @-@ line service on 15 September 1940 and was assigned to training flotillas in the Baltic for the rest of the war . After her retirement , many of U @-@ 30 's experienced crew members , including Lemp , were transferred to U @-@ 110 . In the last months of the war , U @-@ 30 was used as a range boat ( gunnery platform ) before being scuttled by her crew on 4 May 1945 at Flensburg in <unk> Bay , in order to avoid surrendering the boat to the Allies as part of Operation Regenbogen .

 = Spathularia flavida = 
 Spathularia flavida , commonly known as the yellow earth tongue , the yellow fan , or the fairy fan , is an ascomycete fungus found in coniferous forests of Asia , Europe and North America . It produces a small , fan- or spoon @-@ shaped fruit body with a flat , wavy or lobed cream to yellow colored " head " raised on a white to cream stalk . The height is usually approximately 2 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) , and up to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) . The fungus fruits on the ground in mosses , forest duff or humus , and fruit bodies may occur singly , in large groups , or in fairy rings . The spores produced by the fungus are needle @-@ like , and up to 95 micrometers long . Several varieties have been described that differ largely in their microscopic characteristics . S. flavida has been described by authorities variously as inedible , of unknown edibility , or edible but tough . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The species was first described in 1774 by the German botanist Jacob Christian Schäffer . Schaeffer gave it the binomial <unk> clavata , and called it Der <unk> <unk> ( " the club @-@ shaped wrinkled sponge " ) in the vernacular . In 1794 , Christian Hendrik Persoon published Spathularia flavida as a nomen novum ( new replacement name ) , as Schaeffer 's published name was not legitimate . Elias Fries sanctioned this name in the first edition of his Systema Mycologicum ( 1821 ) . According to the taxonomical database MycoBank , additional synonyms include Boletus <unk> as defined by August Johann Georg Karl Batsch in 1783 , and Spathularia clavata published by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1889 . In a 1955 publication , American mycologist Edwin Butterworth Mains considered Charles Horton Peck 's 1903 <unk> flavida to be the same species as S. flavida . 
 The mushroom is commonly known as the " yellow earth tongue " , " yellow fan " , of " fairy fan " . Samuel Gray called it the " yellowish spatula @-@ stool " in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British plants . The specific epithet flavida is Latin for " blonde " or " golden yellow " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fan- or spoon @-@ shaped fruit bodies of S. flavida may be up to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) high , although a range between 2 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) is more typical . Occasionally , fruit bodies are produced with the " head " split into two separate lobes . The color is light to strong yellow , the flattened fertile area at times paler ; the color tends to deepen with the age of the fruit body . The fertile area ( the region that produces spores ) is often irregularly wrinkled and sometimes notched at apex , and is up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) wide ; it tapers down the length of either side of the stem ( i.e. , <unk> ) from a half to a third of the total stem length . The division between the head and the stem is sharply defined . The stem is hollow , smooth ( glabrous ) , and has a white to yellowish mycelium at its base . The flesh of the fruit body is whitish , but becomes yellowish @-@ brown when dry . 
 The edibility of Spathularia flavida is variously described as untested , unknown , or " edible , but rather tough " . The small size would likely discourage table use . The odor and taste are not distinctive . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 In mass , the spores appear yellowish @-@ brown , especially when they are dry . Viewed under the microscope , they appear hyaline ( translucent ) . The spores are variable in size , but typically in the range of 30 – 95 by 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 µm . They may be non @-@ or several septate , slender and pointed ( acicular ) , and have an outer wall with a gelatinous layer . The asci ( the spore @-@ bearing structures ) are club @-@ shaped , with dimensions of 85 – 125 by 8 – 12 µm . The asci do not have a covering lid known as an operculum . The paraphyses ( sterile cells found in the hymenium ) are filamentous , and hyaline ( translucent ) ; some are ring @-@ shaped ( circinate ) . 
 = = = Variants = = = 
 Mains described a number of varieties of S. flavida based largely on differences in the shapes and sizes of their spores . All varieties were described from collections made in the United States . 
 S. flavida var. flavida 
 In the typical variety , spores range in size from 40 – 62 µm ( although a smaller range of 45 – 56 µm is most typical ) by 2 – 2 @.@ 5 µm ; the paraphyses are either slightly branched above or not at all , and are curved to circinate at their apices . 
 S. flavida var. <unk> 
 In this variety , the paraphyses are more curved to circinate and twisted at the apices , and often form a dense intertwined layer above the asci . 
 S. flavida var. <unk> 
 The spores are smaller than the typical variety , usually 39 – 42 by 1 @.@ 5 – 2 µm ; the paraphyses are irregularly branched on the upper portion . Fruit bodies in this variety are club @-@ shaped and flattened compared to the typical tongue @-@ shape of the typical variety . 
 S. flavida var. <unk> 
 This variety , common in Michigan , has spores that are 32 – 40 by 2 µm . 
 S. flavida var. <unk> 
 Variety <unk> is known from the Pacific Northwest . It has spores that are 55 – 75 by 2 – 2 @.@ 5 µm , and paraphyses that are similar to the typical variety . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Spathularia flavida may be distinguished from the velvet @-@ foot fairy fan ( <unk> velutipes ) by differences in the stem : S. velutipes is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and yellowish . The fuzziness is a result of a thin layer of intertwined hyphae that cover the stem , which project short hyphae outward from the surface . The closely related species S. <unk> has an ochre color , spores that measure 60 – 80 by 1 @.@ 5 – 2 µm , and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts . <unk> <unk> is roughly similar in appearance to S. flavida , but lacks a sharply differentiated , spoon @-@ shaped head , has a stem lighter in color than the head , and microscopically , has much smaller oval to elliptical spores that measure 5 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 5 by 3 – 4 µm . Another yellowish earth @-@ tongue fungus , <unk> rufum , has a well @-@ defined oval to spoon @-@ shaped head , and <unk> to spindle @-@ shaped spores that are 18 – 38 by 4 – 6 µm . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 The fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups on forest duff or humus under conifers , summer and fall , and may grow in rings or arcs . Thought to be a saprobic species ( that is , obtaining nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter ) , it has also been found on rotten wood . The fungus is able to protect itself from <unk> by the springtail <unk> <unk> , a common mushroom feeder , by releasing repellent odorous compounds when it is injured . 
 A cosmopolitan and widespread species , S. flavida is common in temperate regions such as the Pacific Northwest region of North America , extending north to Alaska ; it is , however , unknown in Mexico . In Europe , it has been collected from Britain , Germany , Spain , Austria , Belgium , Scandinavia , and Italy ; in Asia , it has been reported from India Japan , and Turkey . Spathularia flavida is considered a protected species in Slovakia . One field guide says of this species , " that one is apt to see [ it ] while down on the ground looking for something else . " 
 = River Parrett = 
 The River Parrett flows through the counties of Dorset and Somerset in South West England , from its source in the Thorney Mills springs in the hills around Chedington in Dorset . Flowing northwest through Somerset and the Somerset Levels to its mouth at Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea , into the Bridgwater Bay nature reserve on the Bristol Channel , the Parrett and its tributaries drain an area of 660 square miles ( 1 @,@ 700 km2 ) – about 50 per cent of Somerset 's land area , with a population of 300 @,@ 000 . 
 The Parrett 's main tributaries include the Rivers Tone , Isle , and Yeo , and the River Cary via the King 's Sedgemoor Drain . The 37 @-@ mile ( 60 km ) long river is tidal for 19 miles ( 31 km ) up to Oath . The fall of the river between Langport and Bridgwater is only 1 foot per mile ( 0 @.@ 2 m / km ) , so it is prone to frequent flooding in winter and during high tides . Many approaches have been tried since at least the medieval period to reduce the incidence and effect of floods and to drain the surrounding fields . 
 In Anglo @-@ Saxon times the river formed a boundary between Wessex and Dumnonia . It later served the Port of Bridgwater , and enabled cargoes to be transported inland . The arrival of the railways led to a decline in commercial shipping , and the only working docks are at Dunball . Man 's influence on the river has left a legacy of bridges and industrial artefacts . The Parrett along with its connected waterways and network of drains supports an ecosystem that includes several rare species of flora and fauna . The River Parrett Trail has been established along the banks of the river . 
 = = Course = = 
 The River Parrett is 37 miles ( 60 km ) long , flowing roughly south to north from Dorset through Somerset . Its source is in the Thorney Mills springs in the hills around Chedington , 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 km ) from that of the River Axe , in nearby Beaminster , which runs in the opposite direction to the English Channel at <unk> in Devon . The two rivers give their names to Parrett and Axe Parish Council . 
 From its source , the Parrett runs north through South Perrott and under the Salisbury to Exeter railway line before passing to the west of North Perrott and Haselbury Plucknett . It then runs through fields between <unk> to the west and West Chinnock and Chiselborough to the east . Passing under the A303 road to the east of South Petherton , the river flows between East Lambrook and Bower Hinton west of Martock and then towards Kingsbury Episcopi , through Thorney and Muchelney , passing the remains of Muchelney Abbey before entering Langport , which is about 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of Chiselborough . Below Thorney Bridge the river 's banks have been raised to mitigate flooding . 
 The Parrett then flows northwest for approximately another 10 miles ( 16 km ) to Bridgwater through the Somerset Levels past Aller , close to the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) . The sluice gate ( formerly a lock built in the late 1830s ) at the deserted medieval village of Oath marks the river 's tidal limit . The river then crosses Southlake Moor . The next major landmark along the river 's course is Burrow Mump , an ancient earthwork owned by the National Trust . The river then arrives in Burrowbridge , where the old pumping station building was once a museum . Flowing north , it passes Langmead and Weston Level SSSI , and on past the land @-@ drainage pumping station at Westonzoyland . 
 Further downstream the river passes the village of Huntworth before flowing under the M5 motorway at <unk> . As it enters Bridgwater it passes under Somerset and Hamp Bridges , and past Bridgwater Castle , which had a tidal moat up to 65 feet ( 20 m ) wide in places , fed by water from the river . From Bridgwater to the sea is approximately 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) . The King 's Sedgemoor Drain empties into the River Parrett next to the wharf at Dunball ; it enters via a clyce ( or clyse ) , which is a local word for a sluice . The clyce has been moved about 0 @.@ 3 miles ( 500 m ) downstream from its original position and now obstructs the entrance to the small harbour next to the wharf . 
 The course of the river below Bridgwater is now somewhat straighter than in former times . The village of Combwich lies adjacent to a channel in the river known as " Combwich Reach " ; from here the Parrett flows to the Bristol Channel past the Steart Peninsula . Cartographic evidence indicates that in the early 18th century the peninsula was longer than at present . A " neck " started to form in the peninsula , and by 1802 the tip had broken off to form Stert Island . <unk> Island also broke away but has rejoined the peninsula . Much of the peninsula 's northern end eroded away or now exists as " islands " visible at low tide within an intertidal area of mud known as the Stert Flats . 
 The mouth at Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea is a nature reserve where the river flows into Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel . In addition to the rivers Parrett , Brue and Washford , several of the man @-@ made drainage ditches , including the River Huntspill from the Somerset Levels , and the Cannington Brook from the " Pawlett Hams " , also discharge into the bay . 
 = = = Flow and tidal bore = = = 
 The Parrett has only one gauging station , at Chiselborough , fairly close to the source . It measures flow from the first 29 square miles ( 75 km2 ) of the drainage basin , or about 4 @.@ 3 per cent of the total . The mean flow measured by the Environment Agency at Chiselborough was 42 cubic feet per second ( 1 @.@ 19 m3 / s ) , with a peak of 6 @,@ 100 cubic feet per second ( 173 m3 / s ) on 30 May 1979 and a minimum of 2 @.@ 5 cubic feet per second ( 0 @.@ 07 m3 / s ) over a seven @-@ day period in August 1976 . Tributaries of the Parrett with gauging stations include the Yeo , Isle , Cary , and Tone . 
 The lower Parrett has a fall of only 1 foot per mile ( 0 @.@ 2 m / km ) between Langport and Bridgwater . To the northeast of the River Parrett 's mouth , the Bristol Channel becomes the Severn Estuary , which has a tidal range of 14 metres ( 46 ft ) . The rate and direction of flow of the Parrett is therefore dependent on the state of the tide on the River Severn . In common with the lower reaches of the River Severn , the Parrett experiences a tidal bore . Certain combinations of the tides funnel the rising water into a wave that travels upstream at about 6 miles per hour ( 10 km / h ) , against the river 's current . 
 = = = Hydrology and water quality = = = 
 Near the source at Chiselborough the typical level range for the depth of the river is 0 @.@ 05 metres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) to 0 @.@ 63 metres ( 2 ft 1 in ) but has reached a maximum of 2 @.@ 93 metres ( 9 ft 7 in ) . The mean flow rate is 1 @.@ 196 cubic metres per second ( 42 @.@ 2 cu ft / s ) . By the time it reaches <unk> Bridge the normal level range is 0 @.@ 23 metres ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) to 0 @.@ 97 metres ( 3 ft 2 in ) and a highest reading of 3 @.@ 84 metres ( 12 @.@ 6 ft ) . At West Quay in Bridgwater where the river is tidal the highest astronomical tide level is 8 @.@ 63 metres ( 28 @.@ 3 ft ) above ordnance datum ( AOD ) . 
 For the purpose of water quality measurement the river is divided into five water body areas by the Environment Agency . Both the area from the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and the area from Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality . The area from Lopen Brook to the River Isle , around Martock and South Petherton , is rated good for chemical quality , poor for ecological quality and poor overall . From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney , chemical quality is rated good , and ecology is rated moderate . The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality , as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay . 
 = = History = = 
 The origin of the name Parrett is unclear , but several derivations from the Celtic languages used in Wales have been suggested . Priestley @-@ Evans suggests , " Parrett has been said to be a form of the Welsh pared , a partition , and that it was the name which the Welsh people of Somerset and Devon gave to that river because it was at one time the dividing line between themselves and the Saxons " . Another spelling , <unk> , is also translated as partition . Another explanation from Welsh , <unk> , meaning the sweet or delicious river , has also been suggested . An alternative explanation , based on Old English , is a derivation from <unk> or <unk> from <unk> , meaning four and the Old Cornish Rit meaning flow , which in this case would relate to the four flows or streams : the Tone , Yeo , Isle and Parrett . This is based on the explanation given in Ekwall 's 1928 book English River Names . Whichever derivation is correct , the name Parrett and its spelling variations have been in use since the Anglo @-@ Saxon era , as evidenced by the addition of -tun onto river names as seen in the local towns North Petherton and South Petherton . The spelling <unk> and <unk> are also mentioned in connection with the Parrett . The Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names states only that the name is a ' pre @-@ English river @-@ name of obscure origin ' . 
 = = = Landscape = = = 
 The River Parrett , the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary are believed to have been used for riverine bulk transportation of people and supplies in Somerset under Roman and later Anglo @-@ Saxon and Norman occupation . Roman Somerset , which lasted for over 250 years until around the beginning of the 5th century , had various settlements , including Bath ( Aquae Sulis ) , Ilchester ( <unk> ) and lead mines at Charterhouse ; and four roads surrounding the Somerset Levels . There is evidence of two Roman ports on the Parrett . The port at Combwich , on the west bank , was ill @-@ recorded before its destruction by quarrying and erosion . The other at Crandon Bridge on the east bank near where the current King 's Sedgemoor Drain enters the Parrett , was in use between the first and the fourth centuries . Evidence of an extensive site with storehouses was found in the mid @-@ 1970s , during motorway construction works . The Crandon Bridge site may have been linked by a probable Roman road over the Polden Hills to the Fosse Way , at Ilchester . Ilchester , the largest Roman town in Somerset , was a port with large granaries , sited where the Fosse Way crossed the Ilchester Yeo by means of a paved ford . The Yeo was navigable by small craft all the way to the Parrett allowing military supplies to be brought by boat directly to Ilchester ; however , disembarkation at Crandon Bridge and use of the Polden Hills roadway allowed more rapid movement to Ilchester . The Yeo may already have been straightened and canalised before Roman occupation . 
 The Parrett was established as the border between the Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdom of Wessex and the Brythonic kingdom of Dumnonia in 658 , following the <unk> ' defeat at the Battle of Peonnum that year . This natural border endured for almost a century until further fighting between the Anglo @-@ Saxons and Britons in the mid @-@ 8th century , when the border shifted west to its current location between the modern ceremonial counties of Somerset and Devon . It is thought a ford , usable only at low tide , crossed the river near its mouth , between Combwich and Pawlett ( east bank ) . This crossing , at the western end of the Polden Hills , was known since Roman times and lay on the route of a Saxon herepath . It was here , or in the immediate vicinity , that Hubba , the Danish raider , was defeated and killed by Odda in 878 . In the Domesday Book Combwich was known as <unk> , which means " the settlement by the water " , from the Old English <unk> and <unk> . The ford was later replaced by a ferry , one of which was in operation from at least the 13th century . In the 15th century the ferry was regarded as part of the King 's Highway , and both passengers and cattle were carried in the 16th and 17th centuries . Records of the joint Manorial ownership and costs of the ferry exist for 1589 and 1810 . The White House Inn , a licensed victualler and part @-@ owner of the ferry , traded on the Pawlett bank from 1655 to 1897 ; the building was retained as a farm dwelling for another 20 years . The Combwich river crossing , which was a main route until the 18th century , fell out of use due to turnpike trusts improving what were to become the A38 and A39 roads , and traffic went via Bridgwater ; the former inn was demolished c . 1930 . 
 After the departure of the Romans , the low @-@ lying Somerset Levels appear to have been abandoned , as the archaeological record shows that they were flooded and the former Roman landscape covered with a thick layer of alluvial deposits . Recovery of the levels involved both the construction of sea walls and the containment of the Parrett . Celtic Christianity came to the remoter areas of the Somerset Levels , making use of " island " sites . Glastonbury Abbey , possibly founded in the 7th century ( or earlier ) , was nearby and had undertaken extensive water management to enable it to bring materials by boat to Glastonbury , albeit not via the Parrett . Muchelney Abbey , founded in the mid @-@ 8th century , was sited at the confluence of the Parrett and its tributaries , the rivers Isle and Yeo ; and Athelney Abbey lay on another tributary , the River Tone . These three abbeys together with the Bishop of Bath and Wells were major landowners with fishing and riparian rights , often conflicting , on these rivers . They gained financially from improvements to land and waterways due to the resulting greater fertility of their lands and the increased rents that they were able to charge their tenants . 
 Continuing land reclamation and control of the Parrett was a long @-@ running cycle of neglect followed by improvement . Work was carried out on the upper River Parrett basin in the Middle Ages by Glastonbury Abbey . Abbot Michael 's survey of 1234 showed 722 acres ( 292 ha ) of meadow recovered around the " island " of Sowy ; from the accounts in the Abbey 's rent books , this had increased to 972 acres ( 393 ha ) by 1240 . Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed in the 13th century by building a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett . These included Southlake Wall , Burrow Wall and Lake Wall . The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel , joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence . After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century , much of the former abbey lands came under the control of the Crown , particularly King 's Sedgemoor , which had been wholly owned by Glastonbury Abbey , with Henry VI 's Courts of Sewers made responsible for maintaining existing drainage and various Commissions made responsible for land improvements . Further reclamation work was carried out over the next 500 years . In 1597 , 50 acres ( 20 ha ) of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary ; a few years later 140 acres ( 57 ha ) near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments ; three further reclamations , totalling 110 acres ( 45 ha ) , were undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660 . Kings James I , Charles I , and Charles II continued to improve King 's Sedgemoor . 
 Attempts were also made to improve navigation on the lower river . Between 1677 and 1678 , Sir John Moulton cut a new channel at " Vikings Creek " on the Horsey Levels to remove a large meander ; the old river bed soon silted up , providing 120 acres ( 49 ha ) of new land . A further scheme was proposed in 1723 to improve navigation , shorten the journey time for boats , and recover land by obtaining an Act of Parliament to make an artificial cut across the Steart Peninsula . Eventually , after much debate , the cut was not made due to lack of land owner support and concerns over costs and risks . The English Civil War put a stop to most reclamation work ; however , in 1764 a clyse was built at Dunball to contain tidal influences on a run @-@ off stream near King 's Sedgemoor . Extensive land recovery was undertaken in the Somerset Levels by land owners between 1770 and the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , as part of a general scheme of agricultural improvements , including improvements to the Brue Valley and to King 's Sedgemoor . The latter involved the connection of various drainage schemes into a new hand @-@ dug channel connected to the clyse at Dunball – the King 's Sedgemoor Drain . Further drainage improvements were needed in the 19th century , which involved the use of mechanical pumping engines , originally steam powered but later powered by electricity . In January 1940 , further improvements were funded by the Ministry of Supply , during the Second World War , as " Priority War Work " during the construction of Royal Ordnance Factory ( ROF ) Bridgwater . This involved doubling the width of the King 's Sedgemoor Drain at its western end and the excavation of the River Huntspill . In the longer @-@ term this provided a drain for the Brue valley , but in war @-@ time the scheme provided a guaranteed daily supply of 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 20 @,@ 000 m3 ) of water for the ROF . 
 The town of Bridgwater , from <unk> ( place at ) the bridge held by Walter of Douai , or alternatively " <unk> " from Old English brycg meaning gang plank between ships , or from Old Norse <unk> meaning quay , was founded as a new borough about 1200 ; it had a castle and a market and became a port in its own right . It was the major port for Somerset which , around the Quantocks , the Brendon Hills and the Tone valley , was mainly agricultural , producing arable crops and vegetables to supply the new industrial towns . Combwich was the traditional River Parrett pilots ' harbour from at least the 14th century . It also served as a port for the export of local produce and , from the 15th century , the import of timber . Until the late 1930s , when the creek silted up , coastal shipping served Combwich 's local brick and coal yard . 
 In the medieval era the river was used to transport Hamstone from the quarry at Ham Hill for the construction of churches throughout the county . Later , in the 19th century , coal from south Wales , for heating , Bath bricks , bricks and tiles would be carried . Brick making , which had been carried out intermittently in Bridgwater from the 17th century , by the late 18th century had expanded into an industry based on permanent brickyards in the Bridgwater area adjacent to the Parrett . The brick and tile industry made use of the local alluvial clays and the Parrett 's coastal trade , using ketches mostly based at Bridgwater to transport their products , which were heavy and bulky , and to bring in coal to heat the kilns . The 19th century industrial revolution opened up mass markets leading to further expansion of the industry , particularly beginning in 1850 when the duty ( tax ) on bricks was abolished . Brick and tile works , making use of river transport , were opened in the 1840s and 1850s south of Bridgwater at North Petherton and <unk> , in Bridgwater itself , and downstream at Chilton Trinity , Combwich , Puriton and Pawlett . Numerous brickworks were also opened elsewhere in Somerset , but many of them used the railways to transport their products ; some 264 sites are listed in the Somerset Industrial Archaeological Society 's Gazetteer of sites . Silt was also dredged from the river over a 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) stretch between Somerset Bridge and Castle Fields , Bridgwater , to make Bath bricks , an early abrasive cleaning material patented in 1827 . 
 = = = Port of Bridgwater = = = 
 Bridgwater was part of the Port of Bristol until the Port of Bridgwater was created in 1348 , covering 80 miles ( 130 km ) of the Somerset coast line , from the Devon border to the mouth of the River Axe . Under an 1845 Act of Parliament the Port of Bridgwater extends from Brean Down to Hinkley Point in Bridgwater Bay , and includes parts of the River Parrett ( to Bridgwater ) , River Brue and the River Axe . 
 Historically , the main port on the river was at Bridgwater , where a span crossed the river from 1200 AD onwards . Quays were built at Bridgwater in 1424 , with another quay , the Langport slip , being built in 1488 upstream of the Town Bridge . A custom house was sited at Bridgwater , on West Quay , and a dry dock , launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay . Bridgwater built some 167 ships , the last one being the Irene launched in 1907 . 
 The river was navigable , with care , to Bridgwater Town Bridge by 400 @-@ to @-@ 500 @-@ tonne ( 390 @-@ to @-@ 490 @-@ long @-@ ton ) vessels . By trans @-@ shipping goods into barges at the Town Bridge , the Parrett was navigable as far as Langport and ( via the River Yeo ) to Ilchester . After 1827 , it was also possible to transport goods to Taunton via the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal at Huntworth . A floating harbour , known as the " docks " , was constructed between 1837 – 1841 , and the canal was extended through Bridgwater to the floating <unk> & Lawrence 2005 , pp. 157 – 158 The dock area contained flour mills , timber yards and chandlers . 
 Shipping to Bridgwater expanded with the construction of the docks , which opened on 25 March 1841 , and reached a peak in the 19th century between 1880 and 1885 , with an average of 3 @,@ 600 ships per year entering the port . Peak tonnage occurred in 1857 , with 142 vessels totaling 17 @,@ 800 tonnes ( 17 @,@ 500 long tons ) . In the short term , the opening of the docks increased the profitability of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal , which carried 81 @,@ 650 tonnes ( 80 @,@ 360 long tons ) of cargo in 1840 . This peaked in 1847 at 88 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 87 @,@ 000 long tons ) of cargo ; however , by the mid @-@ 1850s the canal was bankrupt due to competition from the railways . 
 Combwich Pill , a small creek near the mouth of the river , had been used for shipping since the 14th century . From the 1830s , with the development of the brick and tile industry in the Combwich area , the wharf was used by two local brickyards to import coal and export tiles to Wales and parts of Gloucestershire . This traffic ceased in the 1930s ; in the late 1950s the wharf was taken over and upgraded by the Central Electricity Generating Board ( CEGB ) to bring in heavy materials for the Hinkley Point nuclear power stations . Construction of Hinkley Point A nuclear power station was ordered in 1957 , with a scheduled completion date of 1960 , but was not completed until 1965 . This was followed by Hinkley Point B nuclear power station , which began operation in 1976 . It is proposed to use the wharf again for the construction of Hinkley Point C. 
 Dunball wharf was built in 1844 by Bridgwater coal merchants , and was linked to the Bristol and Exeter Railway by a rail track which crossed the A38 . The link was built in 1876 , also by coal merchants , and was originally operated as a horse @-@ drawn tramway . In 1875 , the local landowner built The Dunball Steam Pottery & Brick & Tile Works adjacent to the wharf . 
 The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal , which had been bought out by the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1866 and later passed into the control of the Great Western Railway had , by the beginning of the First World War , fallen into disrepair due to lack of trade . This trade , particularly the Wales @-@ Somerset traffic after the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1886 , had been lost to the railways ; the canal continued to be used as a source of water . In the mid @-@ 1950s , the Port of Bridgwater was importing some 80 @,@ 050 to 106 @,@ 800 tonnes ( 78 @,@ 790 to 105 @,@ 110 long tons ) of cargo , mainly sand and coal by tonnage , followed by timber and flour . It was also exporting some 7 @,@ 300 tonnes ( 7 @,@ 200 long tons ) of bricks and tiles . By then , Bridgwater 's brick and tile industry was in terminal decline . In the 1960s , British Rail , the owner of the docks , which were limited by the size of its locks to boats of maximum size 180 by 31 feet ( 54 @.@ 9 by 9 @.@ 4 m ) , decided that they were commercially non @-@ viable . British Railways offered to sell the docks to any buyer ; however , there were no takers , so the docks were closed to river traffic . 
 Although ships no longer dock in the town of Bridgwater , 90 @,@ 213 tonnes ( 99 @,@ 443 short tons ) of cargo were handled within the port authority 's area in 2006 , most of which was stone products via the wharf at Dunball . It is no longer linked to the railway system . The link was removed in the 1960s as part of the railway closures following the Beeching Report . Dunball railway station , which had opened in 1873 , was closed to both passengers and goods in 1964 . All traces of the station , other than " Station Road " , have been removed . The wharf is now used for landing stone products , mainly marine sand and gravels dredged in the Bristol Channel . Marine sand and gravel accounted for 55 @,@ 754 tonnes ( 61 @,@ 458 short tons ) of the total tonnage of 90 @,@ 213 tonnes ( 88 @,@ 788 long tons ) using the Port facilities in 2006 , with salt products accounting for 21 @,@ 170 tonnes ( 20 @,@ 840 long tons ) in the same year , while the roll @-@ on roll @-@ off berth at Combwich is used occasionally for the transfer of heavy goods for the two existing Hinkley Point nuclear power stations . With the possible future construction of the two Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations by EDF Energy , it is proposed that Combwich wharf be employed to transfer heavy goods to the sites . Combwich Pill is the only site where recreational moorings are available in the estuary . 
 Sedgemoor District Council acts as the Competent Harbour Authority for the port , and has provided pilotage services for all boats over 98 feet ( 30 m ) using the river since 1998 , when it took over the service from Trinity House . Pilotage is important because of the constant changes in the navigable channel resulting from the large tidal range , which can exceed 39 feet ( 11 @.@ 9 m ) on spring tides . Most commercial shipping travels upriver as far as Dunball wharf , which handles bulk cargoes . 
 = = = Parrett Navigation = = = 
 The Parrett Navigation was a series of improvements to the river to allow increased boat traffic between Burrowbridge and Thorney . The work , done in the 1830s and 1840s , was made mostly obsolete by the coming of railways in 1853 , though some aspects survive to this day . 
 = = = = Background = = = = 
 Trade on the river upstream of Bridgwater had developed during the 18th century , with 20 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 22 @-@ short @-@ ton ) barges operating between Bridgwater and Langport , while smaller barges carrying 6 to 7 long tons ( 6 @.@ 1 to 7 @.@ 1 t ) operated on the upper reaches between Langport and Thorney , and along the River Yeo to Long Load Bridge and Ilchester . The channel below the junction with the River Tone had been improved as a result of Acts of Parliament passed in 1699 and 1707 , " for making and keeping the River Tone navigable from Bridgewater to Taunton " , and a third act with a similar purpose was passed in 1804 . Traffic on the higher reaches was hindered by shoals in the river and by the Great Bow Bridge at Langport , which consisted on nine small arches , none of them big enough for navigation . All cargoes heading upstream had to be off @-@ loaded from the bigger barges , carried to the other side of the bridge , and reloaded into the smaller barges . Traffic above Langport was sporadic , as the water levels were often inadequate , forcing boats to wait several days for the right conditions before proceeding . 
 The abortive <unk> and Langport Navigation scheme had sought to avoid the Great Bow Bridge by making the <unk> Rhine navigable , rebuilding Little Bow Bridge in the centre of Langport , and making a new cut to Bicknell 's Bridge . Seven locks , each with a small rise , were planned , but the scheme foundered in 1797 due to financial difficulties . After the cessation of hostilities with France at the beginning of the 19th century , there was renewed interest in canal building in Somerset ; the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was authorised in 1824 , the Glastonbury Canal in 1827 , and the Chard Canal in 1834 . 
 When the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was opened in 1827 , it joined the Parrett by a lock at Huntworth , where a basin was constructed , but in 1841 the canal was extended to the new floating harbour in Bridgwater , and the Huntworth link was filled in . The canal and river were not re @-@ connected at this point when the canal was restored , because the tidal Parrett , at Huntworth , is a salt water river laden with silt whereas the canal contains fresh water . Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal , but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh , as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for Bridgwater 's population . 
 = = = = Construction = = = = 
 With the prospect of the Chard Canal in particular damaging trade on the Parrett , four traders from Langport including Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot , who together operated a river freight business , commissioned the engineer Joseph Jones to carry out a survey for the Parrett Navigation which was then put before Parliament . It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence . Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton <unk> Drain by culverts , siphons , and sluices , and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836 . 
 The Parrett Navigation Act allowed the proprietors , of whom 25 were named , to raise £ 10 @,@ 500 in shares and £ 3 @,@ 300 by mortgage , with which to make improvements to the river from Burrow Bridge to Langport , to reconstruct the restrictive bridge at Langport , and to continue the improvements as far as Thorney . The River Isle , which joined the Parrett at Muchelney , was to be improved for its first mile , and then the Westport Canal was to be constructed from there to Westport . Locks were planned at Stanmoor , Langport , and Muchelney , with a half @-@ lock at Thorney . An extra lock was added at Oath , when tests revealed that the depth of water would not meet that specified in the Act without it . Costs were considerably higher than expected , and a second Act of Parliament was obtained in 1839 , to allow an extra £ 20 @,@ 000 to be raised . The lock at Oath has since been replaced by a sluice gate to control flooding . 
 The section below Langport opened on 28 October 1839 ; the section to Thorney and the Westport Canal were completed in August 1840 . The Langport Bridge was not finished until March 1841 ; of the £ 3 @,@ 749 cost of construction , £ 500 came from the Langport Corporation and the rest was raised by a bridge toll operated from March 1841 until January 1843 . The total cost of the works was £ 38 @,@ 876 , and no dividends were paid until 1853 , as all profits were used to repay the loans which had been taken out . There are no records of traffic , but it has been estimated at 60 @,@ 000 to 70 @,@ 000 long tons ( 61 @,@ 000 to 71 @,@ 000 t ) per year , based on the toll receipts and the knowledge that the Stuckey and Bagehot boats carried about three quarters of the total tonnage . 
 = = = = Decline = = = = 
 The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened in late 1853 , and the effects on the Parrett Navigation were immediate . Despite petitions from users of the Westport Canal to keep their section open for navigation , the Commissioners opted to abandon the entire navigation ; however , the Westport Canal was maintained for drain purposes only . Some boats continued to use the river to reach Langport and beyond until the early years of the 20th century . There is still a public right of navigation as far as Oath Lock , but very few private boats use the river , largely due to the fierce tides in the estuary and a lack of moorings along its route . 
 = = Bridges and structures = = 
 Much of the history of the river is defined by its bridges , which are described from here mouth to source . The Drove Bridge , which marks the current extent of the Port of Bridgwater , is the nearest to the mouth and the newest road bridge to cross the river . With a span of 184 feet ( 56 m ) , the bridge was constructed as part of the Bridgwater Northern Distributor road scheme ( 1992 ) , and provides a navigable channel which is 66 feet ( 20 m ) wide with 8 @.@ 2 feet ( 2 @.@ 5 m ) headroom at normal spring high tides . Upstream of this is the retractable or Telescopic Bridge , built in 1871 to the design of Sir Francis Fox , the engineer for the Bristol and Exeter Railway . It carried a broad gauge ( later standard gauge ) railway siding over the river to the docks , and was movable , to allow boats to proceed up river . An 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) section of railway track to the east of the bridge could be moved sideways , so that the main 127 @-@ foot ( 39 m ) girders could be retracted , creating a navigable channel which was 78 feet ( 24 m ) wide . It was manually operated for the first eight months , and then powered by a steam engine , reverting to manual operation in 1913 , when the steam engine failed . The bridge was last opened in 1953 , and the traverser section was demolished in 1974 , but public outcry at this resulted in the bridge being listed as a Scheduled monument , and the rest of the bridge was kept . It was later used as a road crossing , until the construction of the Chandos road bridge alongside it , and is now only used by pedestrians . Parts of the steam engine were moved to Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum in 1977 . 
 The next bridge is the Town Bridge . There has been a bridge here since the 13th century , when Bridgwater was granted a charter by King John . The present bridge was designed by R. C. Else and G. B. Laffan , and the 75 @-@ foot ( 23 m ) cast iron structure was completed in 1883 . It replaced an earlier iron bridge , which was completed in 1797 and was the first cast iron bridge to be built in Somerset . The stone abutments of that bridge were reused for the later bridge , which was the only road crossing of the river in Bridgwater until 1958 . Above the bridge there were two shoals , called The Coals and The Stones , which were a hazard to barge traffic on the river , and bargees had to navigate the river at high tide , when there was enough water to carry them over these obstructions . In March 1958 a new reinforced concrete road bridge , the Blake Bridge , was opened as part of a bypass to take traffic away from the centre of Bridgwater . It now carries the A38 and A39 roads . At the southern edge of Bridgwater is a bridge which carries the Bristol and Exeter Railway across the River Parrett . Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed a brick bridge , known as the Somerset Bridge , with a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) span but a rise of just 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . Work started in 1838 and was completed in 1841 . Brunel left the centring scaffold in place , as the foundations were still settling , but had to remove it in 1843 to reopen the river for navigation . Brunel demolished the brick arch and replaced it with a timber arch within six months without interrupting the traffic on the railway . This was in turn replaced in 1904 by a steel girder bridge . Slightly further east is a modern concrete bridge which carries the M5 motorway over both the river and the railway line . It was started in 1971 and opened in 1973 . 
 Before 1826 , the bridge at Burrowbridge , just below the junction with the River Tone , consisted of three arches , each only a little wider than the barges that used the river . They restricted the flow of water in times of flood and made navigation difficult . The bridge was highlighted in a report made by William Armstrong in 1824 , as a factor which would prevent the River Tone Navigation competing with the new Bridgwater and Taunton Canal , then being built . An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1824 by the Turnpike Commissioners , authorising the construction of a new bridge and the removal of the old . A design for a 70 @-@ foot ( 21 m ) single @-@ span bridge in cast iron was dropped because of the cost of cast iron at the time , and instead a stone bridge was built , which was completed in 1826 . This is the longest single span masonry road bridge in the county , and was also the last toll bridge in Somerset until it was " freed " in 1946 . It now carries the A361 road . Just below the bridge there was a shoal of rocks and stones , which was also mentioned in Armstrong 's report , but no action was taken to remove it . Except at spring tides , Burrowbridge was the normal upper limit for barges riding the incoming tide . Above here , horses were used to pull the boats , either towards Langport or along the River Tone towards Taunton . 
 Stanmoor lock was constructed above the junction with the River Tone , but all traces of it have gone . Next to the pedestrian bridge at <unk> four living willow cones , which were woven in 1997 by Clare Wilks , have now rooted and sprouted . Oath lock no longer functions as a lock , but the sluice is used to regulate the river levels . Below Langport , the river is crossed by a lattice girder bridge , carrying the Taunton to Westbury railway line , which approaches the crossing on multi @-@ arched viaducts . This is followed by the derelict remains of the Langport lock and sluice . 
 At Langport , the Great Bow Bridge , which now carries the <unk> , is a three @-@ arched bridge , constructed under the terms of the Parrett Navigation Act of 1836 . Completed in 1841 at a cost of £ 3 @,@ 749 , it replaced the previous medieval bridge , with its nine tiny arches , all too small to allow navigation . A bridge at this site was first mentioned in 1220 . The medieval bridge consisted of a total of 31 arches , of which nine crossed the river , and 19 of the original arches were located by ground @-@ penetrating radar in 1987 , buried beneath the road which runs from Great Bow Bridge to Little Bow Bridge . The Warehouse in Langport was built in the late 18th century of English bond red brick , with Flemish bond extensions . It has clay plain tile roofs with hipped ends . It was built by the Parrett Navigation Company , a trading company owned by Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot , on the banks of the River . When the river became unnavigable , the building was no longer needed , and it was eventually abandoned . The Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development , which became the <unk> Trust , purchased the site , designated as a brown field site , in February 2003 , and worked with Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust , English Heritage and local councils to redevelop it into a craft , heritage learning and small business centre , with the surrounding land being used for an eco @-@ friendly housing development . It is a grade II listed building . 
 The newest bridge across the Parrett is <unk> Bridge , a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge . It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail . The next bridge upstream is Bicknell 's bridge , which was formerly known as <unk> bridge , which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney . It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830 . At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river , and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney ( or silent ) Mill and a lock . The mill , with an iron overshot wheel , was built to grind corn in 1823 . Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at <unk> west of Martock , where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group . Carey 's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey 's Mill , which originally occupied the site . It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works , founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill , which included a foundry , with a prominent chimney , ropewalk , workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages . The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper 's cottage still exist . Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton @-@ sub @-@ Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington . 
 = = Flood prevention = = 
 The waters of the Severn Estuary , which are heavily laden with silt , flow into the lower reaches of the Parrett and the Tone on each tide . This silt can rapidly gather on the banks of the rivers , reducing the capacity and performance of the channel , and increasing the risk of flooding of surrounding land . 
 The river is a highland carrier , as it is embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows . Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally , and drainage schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water . The pumping station at Westonzoyland was built in 1830 , the first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels . It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland , <unk> and Othery , and the success of the drainage system led to the formation of Internal drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations . 
 The pump at Westonzoyland originally comprised a beam engine and scoop wheel , which is similar to a water wheel , except that it is driven round by the engine and lifts water up to a higher level . After 25 years , there were problems pumping the water away as the land surface had dropped as it dried out . A better method was sought , and in 1861 a replacement pump was installed . The engine was built by Easton and Amos of London , to a design patented in 1858 by Charles Amos . It is a twin cylinder , vertical condensing engine , driving a centrifugal pump . A similar engine was on display at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was shown to be able to lift 100 tons of water per minute ( 1 @,@ 700 L / s ) , to a height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . The Westonzoyland pump lifts water from the rhyne ( pronounced " reen " ) into the River Parrett . The pump operated until 1951 , when a new diesel @-@ powered pumping station , capable of pumping 35 tons per minute ( 600 L / s ) at any state of the tide , was built beside the old one . The pumping station is now an Industrial Heritage museum of steam powered machinery and land drainage , and houses most of the equipment from the disused Burrowbridge pumping station . 
 The Somerset River Authority was established in the 1960s , and later became part of Wessex Water . Tidal models were used to explore the effects of any improvements to the river , and the likelihood of adverse consequences , i.e. flooding and subsequent silting . Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett , King 's Sedgemoor Drain , and River Brue systems , to try to ensure that the agricultural land benefited from a potable water supply in the <unk> from the Quantock Hills to the coastline . 
 Various measures including sluice gates , known locally as " clyce " , have been deployed to try and control flooding . Completed in 1972 , the Sowy River is a 7 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) embanked channel which starts at Monks <unk> clyce below Langport , and carries excess water from the river to the Kings Sedgemoor Drain , from where it flows to the estuary by gravity , rejoining the Parrett near Dunball wharf . Construction of the channel , together with improvements to the Kings Sedgemoor Drain and the rebuilding of the clyce at Dunball , to create a fresh water seal which prevents salt water entering the drain from the river , cost £ 1 @.@ 4 million . The scheme has resulted in less flooding on Aller Moor . 
 In the 1970s a study was commissioned by Wessex Water to investigate the likely effects of constructing a tide @-@ excluding barrier , aimed at stopping the silt , just upriver of Dunball Wharf on the hydraulic , sedimentary and pollutant regime of the estuary . Results showed that a site further upriver could be viable . 
 The area around the estuary , known as Parrett Reach , around the Steart Peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium . As a result , the Environment Agency produced the <unk> to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study in 2002 , to examine options for the future . In July 2010 the Environment Agency presented plans to convert the peninsula into wetland habitat ; if the proposed scheme goes ahead , it will be the largest wetland habitat creation scheme in England . 
 Following summer floods of 1997 and the prolonged flooding of 1999 @-@ 2000 the Parrett Catchment Project was formed , partly funded by the European Union Regional Development Fund , by 30 organisations , including British Waterways , Campaign to Protect Rural England , Countryside Agency , Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , Environment Agency , Kings Sedgemoor and Cary Vale Internal Drainage Board ( now part of Parrett Internal Drainage Board ) , Levels and Moors Partnership , National Farmers Union , Sedgemoor , Somerset County Council , South Somerset District Council , Taunton Deane and Wessex Water . They aim to tackle twelve areas , which , when combined , will make a significant contribution to reducing the adverse effects of flooding . These include the conversion of arable land , adoption of the Sustainable Drainage Systems ( <unk> ) approach to controlling rainwater runoff from developed areas , dredging , raising riverbanks and improving pumping facilities . Further studies of the possible beneficial effects of woodland in reducing flooding have also been undertaken . 
 During the winter flooding of 2013 – 14 on the Somerset Levels the River Parrett overflowed at new year , during the rain and storms from Storm Dirk , with many residents asking for the Environment Agency to resume river dredging . On 24 January 2014 , in light of the continued flooded extent of the Somerset Moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the winter storms of 2013 – 14 in the United Kingdom , both Somerset County Council and Sedgemoor District Council declared a major incident , as defined under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 . At this time , with 17 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 900 ha ) of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of Thorney was abandoned and Muchelney was cut off by flood waters for almost a month . Northmoor Green , which is more commonly known as Moorland , was also severely affected . By the end of January , 17 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 900 ha ) of agricultural land , including North Moor , Curry and Hay Moors and Greylake , had been under water for over a month . Bridgwater was partly flooded on 10 February 2014 , when with 20 @,@ 000 sandbags ready to be deployed . Over 600 houses were flooded , and both flooding and groundwater disrupted services including trains on the Bristol to Exeter Line between Bridgwater and Taunton . 
 As a result of the extensive flooding , earlier proposals for a tidal barrage across the Parrett were reviewed , and new proposals were suggested to construct the barrage at an estimated cost of between £ 26 @,@ 000 and £ 100 @,@ 000 . Further planning and construction could take up to ten years . The Inland Waterways Association has suggested that the barrage should include a lock to enable boats to travel to Bridgwater and potentially to reopen the link to the harbour and the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Close to the source of the river the underlying geology is a thin layer of Fuller 's earth clay over Yeovil Sands . The resulting light soil made the area important for the production of flax and for market gardening in the past . 
 Burrow Mump , an ancient earthwork owned by the National Trust , is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl , standing at a strategic point where the River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett . It probably served as a natural outwork to the defended royal island of Athelney at the end of the 9th century . 
 The Levels and Moors are a largely flat area in which there are some slightly raised parts , called " burtles " as well as higher ridges and hills . It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of permanent grass , surrounded by ditches lined with willow trees . Access to the Levels and Moors is by " droves " , i.e. green lanes . The Levels are a coastal sand and clay barrier about 20 feet ( 6 m ) above mean sea level ( roughly west of the M5 motorway ) whereas the inland Moors can be 20 feet ( 6 m ) below peak tides and have large areas of peat . The geology of the area is that of two basins mainly surrounded by hills , the runoff from which forms rivers that originally meandered across the plain but have now been controlled by embanking and <unk> . The area is prone to winter floods of fresh water and occasional salt water inundations , the worst of which in recorded history was the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 , which resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2 @,@ 000 or more people , with houses and villages swept away , an estimated 200 square miles ( 520 km2 ) of farmland inundated and livestock destroyed . A further severe flood occurred in 1872 – 1873 when over 107 square miles ( 277 km2 ) were under water from October to March . 
 The extraction of peat from the Moors is known to have taken place during Roman times , and has been an ongoing practice since the levels were first drained . The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting . This led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed . The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk ; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1 – 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 8 m ) over 100 years . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The river flows through several areas of ecological interest and supports a variety of rare and endangered species . 
 From January until May , the Parrett provides a source of European eels ( Anguilla anguilla ) and young elvers , which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them . A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King 's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species ; cameras have shown 10 @,@ 000 eels migrating upstream in a single night . The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett . 
 To the north of the river bank northwest of Langport are the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) . Aller and Beer Woods is a Somerset Wildlife Trust reserve . It consists of large blocks of semi @-@ natural ancient woodland along the west @-@ facing slope of Aller Hill , overlooking King 's Sedgemoor . The reserve is about 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias limestone . Prior to the 20th century it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional coppice woodland , and it provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland . The woodland is a variant of the calcareous ash / wych elm stand @-@ type , with pedunculate oak ( Quercus robur ) , and ash ( Fraxinus excelsior ) the dominant canopy trees throughout , and with scattered concentrations of wych elm ( Ulmus glabra ) . Ancient woodland indicators include small @-@ leaved lime ( Tilia cordata ) , and wild service tree ( Sorbus <unk> ) , both of which are locally common . Plants of particular interest include bird 's nest orchid ( Neottia nidus @-@ avis ) , greater butterfly orchid ( Platanthera <unk> ) and the very rare Red Data Book species purple <unk> ( Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum ) . Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset . The central area contains a sward dominated by sheep 's fescue ( Festuca <unk> ) in combination with yellow oat @-@ grass ( Trisetum flavescens ) and quaking @-@ grass ( Briza media ) . Salad burnet ( Sanguisorba minor ) forms a major component of the sward with the two nationally rare species rough marsh @-@ mallow ( Althaea hirsuta ) and nit @-@ grass ( <unk> <unk> ) , also present . 
 Southlake Moor is another SSSI , which forms part of an extensive grazing marsh and ditch system . When conditions in the River Parrett are suitable , the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river 's floodbank . Some 96 species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor , including the greater water @-@ parsnip ( Sium latifolium ) . When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl ; up to 22 @,@ 000 wigeon ( Anas penelope ) , 250 Bewick 's swan ( Cygnus bewickii ) and good numbers of pochard ( Aythya ferina ) , teal ( Anas crecca ) and tufted duck ( Aythya fuligula ) . Signs of European otters ( Lutra lutra ) are regularly seen on the muddy banks of the River Parrett . The ditches on the east side of the site are populated by palmate newts ( Triturus helveticus ) . 
 Langmead and Weston Level is nationally important for its species @-@ rich neutral grassland and the invertebrate community found in the ditches and rhynes . The terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates recorded on the site include four nationally rare species : the great silver diving beetle ( Hydrophilus piceus ) , the soldier fly Odontomyia ornata , which is now called the ornate brigadier , and two other flies , <unk> scutellata and <unk> <unk> . 
 The Parrett then flows through the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve , which contains a rich biodiversity of national and international importance . It supports a vast variety of plant species , including common plants such as marsh marigold ( Caltha palustris ) , meadowsweet ( <unk> ulmaria ) and ragged robin ( <unk> flos @-@ <unk> ) . The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick ’ s swan ( Cygnus columbianus bewickii ) , Eurasian curlew ( Numenius arquata ) , common redshank ( Tringa <unk> ) , skylark ( Alauda arvensis ) , common snipe ( Gallinago gallinago ) , common teal ( Anas crecca ) , Eurasian wigeon ( Anas penelope ) and whimbrel ( Numenius phaeopus ) , as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier ( Circus <unk> ) and peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus ) . A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects , particularly the hairy click beetle ( <unk> filiformis ) , which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett , and other insects , including the lesser silver water beetle ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> , Hydrophilus piceus , Odontomyia angulata , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . In addition , the area supports an important European otter ( Lutra lutra ) population . 282 American mink ( Mustela vison ) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms , which is encouraging water voles ( Arvicola amphibius ) to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10 years . The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( twelve of them also Special Protection Areas ) , the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves , the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about 86 @,@ 000 acres ( 348 km2 ) , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve , Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve , and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments . In addition , some 72 @,@ 000 acres ( 290 km2 ) of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area , while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential . Despite this , there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors . 
 On the outskirts of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes the Screech Owl local nature reserve where flooded clay pits provide a roost for thousands of common starlings ( Sturnus vulgaris ) each winter . The mouth of the river is where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel . It consists of large areas of mudflats , saltmarsh , sandflats and shingle ridges , some of which are vegetated . It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989 , and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention . The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan .

 The 47 @-@ mile ( 76 km ) River Parrett Trail is a long @-@ distance footpath following the Parrett from its source to the sea . The river passes many landmarks and places of interest including : Burrow Hill Cider Farm , Muchelney Abbey , West Sedgemoor ( a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) , the Blake Museum , Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum , the site of the Battle of Sedgemoor , and finally discharges into Bridgwater Bay ( another SSSI ) . The Langport and River Parrett Visitor Centre located at Langport details local life , history and wildlife . 
 Since 2000 , attempts have been made to clarify the legal status and organisational responsibilities for the maintenance of the river and explore issues involving the sustainability and safe use of the waterway for a public trip boat and recreational craft . The work has identified economic and social benefits from the development of the Parrett navigation .

 = All Saints ' Church , Runcorn = 
 All Saints ' Church is the parish church of Runcorn , Cheshire , England , sited on the south bank of the River Mersey overlooking Runcorn Gap . There is a tradition that the first church on the site was founded by Ethelfleda in 915 . That was replaced , probably in about 1250 , by a medieval church that was altered and extended in the 14th and 15th centuries . By the 19th century the building 's structure had deteriorated and become dangerous , and it was replaced by a new church , built between 1847 and 1849 to the designs of Anthony Salvin . 
 The church is built in local sandstone and is in Early English style with a tall steeple at the southwest corner . Some of the furniture in the church was moved from the previous building , as were some of the memorials , the majority which are to members of the Brooke family from nearby Norton Priory . 
 All Saints is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester , arranging services on Sundays and home groups during the week , in addition to weddings and funerals , and running a community project . The church is designated as a Grade II * listed building . 
 = = History = = 
 A church has stood on the site of the present structure for centuries . There is a tradition that the first church was founded in 915 by Ethelfleda when she built a castle nearby . Dedicated to St Bertelin , it was probably a simple structure of wood and thatch . Runcorn is not mentioned in the Domesday Book , but there is evidence that Nigel , the first baron of Halton ( died 1080 ) , conferred the church with a priest " in the days of the Conqueror " . A medieval church was subsequently built on the site , during the 19th @-@ century demolition of which Norman capitals were found in the masonry of its tower . Judging by its Early English style of architecture , the local historian H. F. Starkey estimates that the medieval church was probably built in about 1250 . The chancel was rebuilt in the 14th century with Decorated tracery in the east window . During the same century an embattled tower was built at the west end of the church , and this was either rebuilt or increased in size in the following century . A major item of the church furniture was a pre @-@ Reformation rood screen . It was destroyed when the church was rebuilt in the 19th century , although a few fragments were used in the construction of the present choir stalls . The nave of the church measured 52 feet ( 16 m ) by 40 feet ( 12 m ) and the tower was 57 feet ( 17 m ) high . At some time the dedication of the church was changed from St Bertelin to St Bartholomew , and later to All Saints . 
 By the 18th century the south aisle was in a serious state of decay , and in 1740 it was rebuilt in brick . In 1801 a commission reported that the church " was too small to conveniently contain the inhabitants of the parish " . It was extended by enlarging the south aisle and by adding galleries to it and to the west end . The former Gothic windows were replaced by round @-@ headed windows . During the first half of the 19th century there was increasing concern about the fabric of the church . The tower was becoming dangerous , and the vestry gave orders " that the bells were not to be rung " . In 1817 it was recommended that the height of the tower should be reduced . The south wall of the chancel was leaning and only kept in position by its roof . The south aisle , built only 15 years before , was sinking , and gaps were appearing around the windows . It was concluded that the church should be demolished and replaced . Some temporary repairs were carried out but there was insufficient money available to rebuild the church at that time . In July 1843 it was reported that the church was in a " very dangerous condition " , and calls were made for " necessary repairs to be made forthwith " . By December of that year architectural reports had been obtained from the architectural firm of Scott and Moffatt , and from Anthony Salvin , both of which concluded that the church was beyond repair . In September 1846 the last sermon was preached from the medieval church , and by November contracts for building a new church were completed . 
 The new church was designed by Salvin . Its foundation stone was laid at Easter 1847 by Richard Brooke , the eldest son of Sir Richard Brooke of Norton Priory , and the church was consecrated by Dr John Graham , Bishop of Chester on 11 January 1849 . The church , which provided seating for 1 @,@ 600 people , cost £ 8 @,@ 052 to build , met by public subscriptions and by the parish rate . The major donors were Miss <unk> , the largest land owner in the town , Sir Richard Brooke , the dean and chapter of Christ Church , Oxford , and the Earl of Ellesmere . The stained glass in the chancel windows was donated by Sir Richard Brooke . A clock was installed in the tower in 1851 , and three new lancet windows were added to the chancel in 1900 . In 1910 a papal bull issued by Pope Boniface IX was found in the churchyard that referred to the dissolution of Norton Priory . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The church is built of Runcorn sandstone with a slate roof , and is in Early English style . Its plan consists of a nave of five bays with north and south aisles and a clerestory , a chancel that is lower and narrower than the nave , and a steeple at the southwest corner . The steeple consists of a square tower with an octagonal spire rising to 161 feet ( 49 m ) . The steeple has corner buttresses , large louvred lancets at the bell @-@ stage , and two tiers of <unk> springing from the base of the tower and from the broach . At the corners of the nave and the chancel are buttresses that rise up as <unk> . On the gables of the chancel and the nave are cross finials and pinnacles . There is an organ chamber at the east end of the north aisle , and a war memorial chapel at the east end of the south aisle . The windows along the clerestory are round with inset quatrefoils ; all the other windows are lancets . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The five @-@ bay arcades are carried on square columns with angled corners and have foliated capitals . The chancel is paved with Minton encaustic tiles . The marble reredos dates from 1888 , and the alabaster altar rails from 1900 ; both were donated by the daughter of Rev John Barclay , a former vicar of the church who died in 1866 . Mural tablets , some of which were moved from the old church , commemorate members of the Brooke family and previous vicars of the parish . Also brought from the old church was " a curiously designed table said to have been used as a communion table " , two sanctuary chairs ( one in Jacobean style ) , and a chest . In addition , a royal coat of arms of George III , and a benefaction board dating from about 1700 were moved from the old church . The oldest memorial is to two women described as " both good wives " who died in 1672 . The next in age is a large tablet to the memory of Thomas Brooke , who died in 1737 . Two memorials are by John Bacon ; one to Sir Richard Brooke ( died 1792 ) features a <unk> unveiling an urn and the second , to another Sir Richard Brooke ( died 1796 ) , shows a female figure by an urn . The memorial to Thomas Brooke ( died 1820 ) is by B. F. Hardenburg of London . A memorial to another Sir Richard Brooke ( died 1865 ) is a brass in the form of a cross . In the nave are a number of Georgian tablets including one to John Bankes ( died 1817 ) , by T. <unk> . The Rev John Barclay has a memorial by Williams and Clay of Warrington containing his portrait in relief . The stained glass in the chancel includes two windows with depictions of the Annunciation and the Resurrection . In the south aisle is a memorial to J. R. Hughes , who died at sea in 1874 ; " he is shown in the water wearing nothing but mutton @-@ chop whiskers and a crown proffered by an angel " . The three @-@ manual organ was installed in 1908 and carries a plate saying it was " assisted by Andrew Carnegie " . There is a ring of eight bells cast in 1851 by Charles and George Mears , the tenor weighing 153 @-@ 3 @-@ 15 in <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ lbs or around 800 kg , having a diameter of 39 inches ( 0 @.@ 99 m ) and tuned to the note E.

 The church is an active parish church in the diocese of Chester , the archdeaconry of Chester , and the deanery of Frodsham . Its benefice is combined with that of Holy Trinity , Runcorn to form the benefice of Runcorn All Saints with Holy Trinity . The patron of the church is Christ Church , Oxford . All Saints serves the Old Town area of Runcorn , and arranges services on Sundays , together with baptisms , thanksgivings , weddings and funerals . The church also runs a community project known as Open Door . In addition it organises home groups during the week . 
 = Music of the Drakengard series = 
 The music for the Drakengard series , known as Drag @-@ On Dragoon ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> on <unk> , commonly abbreviated as DOD ) in Japan , has been handled by multiple composers since the release of the original game in 2004 . Drakengard 's composers were Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara , Drakengard 2 was handled by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki , and Drakengard 3 was composed for by Keiichi Okabe , the composer for series spin @-@ off Nier . Sano remained as a sound director for the second game , and his music was used as a reference for the third . Multiple albums have been released for the music of the series : Drag @-@ On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1 and Vol.2 were released on October and November 2004 , while a two @-@ disc re @-@ release titled Drag @-@ On Dragoon Original Soundtrack was released in April 2011 . The Drag @-@ On Dragoon 2 Original Soundtrack was released on July 20 , 2005 . A promotional disc with two tracks from the soundtrack was released in the same year . The official soundtrack for the third game , Drag @-@ On Dragoon 3 Original Soundtrack , was released January 21 , 2014 . An compilation of chiptune remixes of the previous games and Nier , Drag @-@ On Dragoon Chips Music , was released on December 19 , 2013 as part of the Drag @-@ On Dragoon 10 Anniversary Box . 
 The series has also received theme songs from multiple Japanese pop artists , all of which have been released as singles . A re @-@ orchestration of Mika Nakashima 's single " Hitori " was used as the theme for Drakengard 2 , incorporating elements from the game . Two theme songs were written for Drakengard 3 : " Kuroi Uta " and " This Silence is Mine " . The former was sung by Eir Aoi , a fan of the series , and written by Nier writer Kikuchi Hana . The latter was specially written and sung by Onitsuka Chihiro , who created the song around the themes and characters of the game . Both songs were composed by Okabe . All three singles have been in the top 40 best @-@ selling singles in the Japanese Oricon music charts . 
 The soundtracks have received mixed to positive reviews from both dedicated video game music outlets and video game critics . The first game was noted for its disturbing style , which both drew criticism for repetitiveness and praise for suiting the game 's atmosphere . It has been generally cited as an experimental soundtrack . The second game 's soundtrack received a more positive reception , with the general opinion being that it was a more traditional and consequently more comfortable soundtrack . The third game 's soundtrack also received fairly positive comments , mainly praising its quality , although critiques were made concerning its variety . The chiptune compilation was generally liked , except for its exclusivity to the special release . The singles have also received praise . 
 = = Creation and influence = = 
 The music of the first game in the Drakengard series was composed by Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara . In creating the score , they sampled excerpts from pieces of classical music ( selected by Aihara ) , then rearranged , remixed and layered them in various ways . Their main objective was to create music that emulated the game 's hack @-@ and @-@ slash gameplay , as well as the dark story and general narrative theme of " madness " . The music was intended to be " experimental " and " expressionistic " rather than " commercial " . After being composed , all the tracks were performed by a full orchestra . The team who worked on the music also worked on the Tekken series , and they sought to emulate the music of Northern Europe . One of the soundtracks that inspired Sano and Aihara in their work was the score for The Exorcist . The theme song , " Exhausted " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , was composed by Sano , written by the game 's scenario writer Sawako Natori and sung by Eriko Hatsune . 
 Drakengard 2 's soundtrack was composed by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki , with supervision by Sano , who acted as sound director . Due to widespread criticisms of his work on the first game , Sano was asked by the game 's producer , Takamasa Shiba , to bring in outside help for the second game 's soundtrack , which upset Sano to a degree . Shiba wanted a composer less linked to video games to compose the music : Matsumoto was brought in because of his work on the non @-@ video @-@ game J @-@ pop songs " Yuki no Hana " and " Tsuki no Shizuku " . Because of the size of the project , Matsumoto in turn brought in his friend Yoshiki to help . The soundtrack was designed a fusion of J @-@ pop and video game music , and to evoke the emotions of the various characters and the feeling of battle . The theme song for the game 's English release was " Growing Wings " , a localized version of the first game 's theme song sung by Kari Wahlgren . 
 The third game 's music was composed by Keiichi Okabe , who also created the score for Nier , a spin @-@ off game of the series . While writing the music , Okabe felt he needed to match Sano 's work on Drakengard , rather than copy it , and so felt that there was no need to " rehash " the original music despite the potential merits . He commented that the musical creation was " a tough production , but for this game , there 's part of it I 'm doing that I 've never experienced before . " At director Taro Yoko 's request , Okabe worked on separating the style of the music from that of Nier : he did this by including both soft , gentle tunes similar to Nier and more intense tracks . The two styles were also inspired by the game 's world theme of " the sense of contrast " . One musical piece , " Exhausted 3 " , is a re @-@ orchestration of Drakengard 's theme song , intended by Okabe as a nod to earlier installments while staying true to Yoko 's wishes .

The soundtrack was re @-@ released on April 20 , 2011 as a two @-@ disc set under the title Drag @-@ On Dragoon Original Soundtrack . The re @-@ release reached # 57 in the Japanese Oricon music charts and remained in the charts for two weeks . 
 The individual albums received a mixed response from critics . The reviewer for RPGFan was weakly positive about the first album , calling it " extremely experimental " and stating that people needed to be open @-@ minded while listening , while also citing it as better than the soundtrack for Xenosaga Episode I : Der Wille zur Macht . The reviewer echoed most of these sentiments for the second album , while also stating that it contained the better musical pieces from the game of the two albums . Luc Nadeau of Game Music Online , who reviewed all three releases of the soundtrack , was mixed to positive in his opinions . He generally liked the music , but noted , like the RPGFan reviewer , that it was highly experimental and would not be to everyone 's taste . He also cited his preference for the 2011 two @-@ disc re @-@ release over the original albums . Reviewing the re @-@ release , Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version called it " one of the most experimental and disturbing soundtracks I 've heard in a while " . He praised the soundtrack despite not finding it memorable , and commented that he found it more appealing when he knew some of the plot details that were censored in the game 's western release . 
 Reviewers of the game itself also noted the soundtrack . Greg Kasavin of GameSpot mentioned it as the most distinctive aspect of the game , stating that it was " the most nerve @-@ racking and most intense aspect of [ Drakengard ] " . Adam Jarvis of VideoGamer.com was also positive , calling the soundtrack " haunting " and saying that it " helps create a suitably dark atmosphere " . IGN 's Jeremy Dunham was both impressed by the atmosphere of the tracks and critical of multiple instances of grueling repetition , summing the music up as " disappointing " .

 Unlike Drakengard , Drakengard 2 has only had one soundtrack album released . Drag @-@ On Dragoon 2 Original Soundtrack was released on July 20 , 2005 under the catalog number <unk> @-@ 1628 . It consists of 22 tracks lasting 1 : 13 : 03 . It contains the tracks used during gameplay and not those used during cutscenes , but does include the game 's theme song , " Hitori " , which was also released as a separate single . Two tracks from the game were released as a promotional CD for the game , both as a limited giveaway and part of press kits . It included concept art , interviews , and trailers . 
 The album has received very positive reviews . Chris Greening of Game Music Online praised the shift to a more classical style and the general intensity of multiple tracks , ending the review by applauding Yoshiki 's hard work . Mike Wilson , writing for RPGFan , echoed many of these sentiments despite thinking that there were too few tracks on the album , giving the soundtrack ten out of ten . Both reviewers stated that it was an easier listening experience than the soundtrack for the first Drag @-@ on Dragoon game . Game @-@ OST 's Simon Smith also praised it , calling the soundtrack " a complete attack on the senses as an entire orchestra and full sized choir rampage as much power and tension on you as possible . " 
 Outside soundtrack reviews , opinions from reviews of the game itself have also been positive . IGN 's Ed Lewis called the music " appropriately dramatic " , though stated it was often drowned out by the ambient noise and voice acting . GameSpot 's Greg Mueller called the music " varied and interesting " , while stating that the vocal theme was " sappy , but it 's used sparingly enough , so it doesn 't get terribly annoying " . The GameTrailers reviewer cited the score as " top @-@ notch " , referring to it as one of the few well @-@ done aspects of the game .

The game 's two theme songs were released both as part of the soundtrack and as singles . 
 Christopher Huynh of Game Music Online generally praised the soundtrack 's quality , but felt there was too little variety . RPGFan 's Patrick Gann was generally positive , although he had little commentary on individual tracks , and recommended the album to people who had enjoyed the soundtrack of Nier . The album reached # 18 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for four weeks . 
 Reviewers of the game have also praised the soundtrack . USGamer 's Kat Bailey was fairly positive about it despite not finding it very memorable , calling it " aggressively anime , mixing piano riffs with the odd bit of J @-@ Pop for emphasis " . Chris Carter of Destructoid called the music " stupendous , and one of the best JRPG soundtracks I 've heard in a long while . " Andrew Barker , writing an analysis of the game for RPGFan , called the music " the backbone " of Drakengard 3 . He also cited the music as being " universally praised " by critics .

 In addition to the soundtrack albums , a single compilation of music from across the series has been produced . Drag @-@ On Dragoon Chips Music was released on December 19 , 2013 under the catalog number <unk> @-@ <unk> . The release consists of a selection of tracks from Drakengard ( Sano , Aihara ) , Drakengard 2 ( Aoi , Matsumoto ) and Nier ( Okabe ) remixed as chiptunes . Also included is a version of " Exhausted " by Sano for the piano , used as background music for Drakengard 3 's Japanese website . The compilation was exclusively released as part of the Drag @-@ On Dragoon 10th Anniversary Box , featuring a copy of Drakengard 3 and multiple books and artwork relating to the series . The music was accompanied by images representative of scenes from the game where the selected music plays . 
 The compilation received mixed to positive opinions from music reviewers . Patrick Gann of RPGFan was generally positive about the remixes , especially those of tracks from Nier . Game Music Online 's Christopher Huynh was a little less enthusiastic , saying that there were " some pieces working better than others but none that should be considered bad . " His main complaint was that there was little creativity in the remixes . Both reviewers were pleased with the piano remix of " Exhausted " , and both criticized its exclusivity to the special bundle .

 " Hitori " ( <unk> , Alone ) is the theme song for the Japanese version of Drakengard 2 . It was sung by Mika Nakashima , composed by Ryoki Matsumoto , and written by Satomi . Nakashima also worked as a producer for the soundtrack . The song , originally released as part of Nakashima 's third album Music , was based on a previous composition for Star Ocean : The Second Story . The song was written as a musical followup to " Yuki no Hana " , and the lyrics were written to include thematic connections to the game 's story . 
 The single was released by Sony Music Entertainment Japan on June 16 , 2005 , containing four versions of the song . It reached # 15 in the Oricon charts upon release and remained in the charts for six weeks . Opinions on the song have been generally positive . In his review of the soundtrack , Game @-@ OST 's Simon Smith called it " a soft jazz song with sultry smooth vocals and a nice tune " , and praised it despite it not becoming one of his favorites . Mike Wilson , writing for RPGFan , referred to it as " possibly the most beautiful vocal I 've ever heard in a video game . " Chris Greening of Game Music Online called it " a strong rival to every single pop ballad released from Square Enix , proving rich yet accessible . "

 " Kuroi Uta " ( <unk> , Black Song ) is one of the two theme songs for Drakengard 3 . It was sung by Eir Aoi , composed by Drakengard 3 composer Keichi Okabe and written by Kikuchi Hana , one of the original scenario writers for Nier . Aoi , a singer native to Hokkaido , was chosen by Okabe to perform the song due to her outspoken admiration of the Drakengard series . 
 Eir Aoi 's fifth single , " Kuroi Uta " was originally released on November 13 , 2013 as the final track on the single disc " Sirius " . The single reached # 21 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for fourteen weeks . 
 = = = " This Silence is Mine " = = = 
 " This Silence Is Mine " , the game 's second theme song , was specially written and sung by Onitsuka Chihiro . It was composed by Okabe . Okabe asked Chihiro to help with the song because he felt she would be the perfect singer to project the world and themes of Drakengard 3 . The intention was to make the song emotionally intense , but at the same time " cold " and " empty " . While writing the song , Chihiro was inspired by Zero 's presentation within the game . The original draft of the song was created in around five minutes , and Chihiro had to sing the song five times before Okabe was satisfied with her performance . The song debuted in the game 's trailer at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show . 
 The single was released on a CD along with a version of her following single " Anata to Science " ( <unk> , You and Science ) . The single reached 36th place in the Oricon charts . Huynh was positive about the song in his review of the soundtrack , saying that Chihiro " [ brought ] her best , delivering an emotional track with a powerful buildup to a dizzying climax . " Gann was also positive , saying Chihiro 's singing style fitted the tone of both game and series , calling the delivery " superb " . He also called Okabe 's production of the song " very smart " . 
 = Lauren Zizes = 
 Lauren Zizes / <unk> / is a recurring fictional character from the Fox musical comedy @-@ drama series , Glee . The character is portrayed by actress Ashley Fink , and has appeared in Glee since the season one episode " Wheels " , first broadcast on November 11 , 2009 . Lauren was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy , Brad Falchuk , and Ian Brennan . She is a member of New Directions , the glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima , Ohio , where the show is set . Her storylines have seen her interact with other members of the glee club and form a relationship with Noah Puckerman ( Mark Salling ) . Lauren is also the president of the AV club , and a member of the school 's wrestling team . She joins the glee club in the show 's second season , putting her in close contact with some of the shows main characters . 
 Following the character 's significantly expanded role in the second season , Fink 's portrayal has received predominantly positive reviews . Rosie O 'Donnell criticized the character , saying that Fink was unattractive and therefore a bad representation of fat people , but later apologized for these remarks . Lauren made her solo musical debut in the second season , performing The Waitresses ' " I Know What Boys Like " in the episode " Comeback " . The song was well received by critics , and was released as a single , available for download ; it was subsequently included on the EP released in September 2011 through the Target chain , Glee : The Music , Dance Party . Although Lauren also appears in ensemble musical performances , Fink is not credited as a vocalist on the series ' soundtrack albums . Lauren 's role was reduced in the beginning of the third season , and she made a final , non @-@ speaking appearance in the third episode , " Asian F " . After this , it was confirmed she would appear once again in Glee and doing so in the fourth season 's episode " Sadie Hawkins " , which premiered on 24 January 2013 . After this , she made numerous appearances in flashbacks before appearing one final time in the series finale , " Dreams Come True " , during the performance of OneRepublic 's " I Lived " by the glee club 's alumni . 
 = = Storylines = = 
 Throughout the first season of Glee , Lauren makes numerous guest appearances . She is a member of the McKinley High wrestling team , as well as president of the AV club . She first appears in the episode " Wheels " , where she unsuccessfully tries out for a spot on the cheerleading team . She reappears in " Hell @-@ O " , when cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester assembles a group of unpopular , lonely students , whom she dubs the " Old Maid 's Club " . Lauren later helps glee club co @-@ captain Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) to rig hidden microphones in the choir room to prove that the rest of the glee club are not pulling their weight in rehearsals . She is later seen as the leader of a group of goths who idolize Twilight character Edward Cullen . 
 Lauren 's role becomes more prominent in the second season . Glee club member Puck ( Mark Salling ) asks her to join New Directions so they will have enough members to qualify for a show choir competition . Lauren accepts , on the condition that she gets seven minutes in heaven with him , though it is later revealed that she became bored with Puck 's kissing style after three minutes . In the Valentine 's Day @-@ themed episode " Silly Love Song " , Puck reveals that he has fallen in love with Lauren , and serenades her with Queen 's " Fat Bottomed Girls " . She finds his song choice insulting and stands him up on a pre @-@ Valentine 's date , but eventually agrees to spend Valentine 's Day with him as friends . Lauren makes her solo debut in the following episode , where she performs a rendition of " I Know What Boys Like . " Puck helps her , by advising her to picture the other members in their underwear , which she does in her timid @-@ turned @-@ confident performance . In the episode , " Sexy " , Lauren enlists Puck to make a sex tape with her , as she believes the publicity will make her a star , but they give up the idea when they learn it would constitute child pornography , as both are underage . 
 In " Born This Way " , Lauren reveals to Puck that she 'd been a child beauty queen , " Miss Tiara Toddler " , before she gained weight and became ineligible ; Puck tells her he will run a campaign for her to become prom queen , and be her king . When Quinn , who is prom queen frontrunner , sees Lauren putting up posters for her own candidacy , she confronts Lauren , and the ensuing encounter is heated . Lauren decides to dig up dirt on Quinn as a campaign tactic , and aided by Puck , discovers that Quinn used to be overweight and unpopular before slimming down and transferring to McKinley ; Lauren then plasters the school with pictures of the old Quinn , humiliating her . But the tactic backfires , making Quinn more popular , and hurting Lauren 's candidacy . Lauren apologizes to Quinn , Quinn says she respects Lauren , and the two reach an understanding . Neither Lauren nor Puck win the race for prom queen and king , but they remain a couple ; they fly with the rest of New Directions to the nationals competition in New York City , where the glee club comes in twelfth out of fifty teams . This defeat leads Lauren to quit the glee club at the beginning of the third season and break up with Puck .

 = = = Casting and creation = = = 
 Lauren is portrayed by actress Ashley Fink . She made routine guest appearances throughout the first season , and became a member of the McKinley High glee club in the episode " Special Education " . Upon receiving the script in which Lauren joins the club , Fink initially reacted with disbelief . She commented , " I didn 't quite believe it at first , I thought I was getting Punk 'd . " She said that being cast in Glee makes her feel like " the luckiest girl in the world " . Fink 's favorite element of Glee is how series creator Ryan Murphy manages to take the underdogs and make them shine . She said , " In life , there 's so much diversity , and it 's not necessarily represented on television . I think Glee is one of the few shows that actually displays the diversity and it ’ s just so inspirational . " When asked about her casting process , Fink said : 
 I auditioned for the pilot and they brought me in a bunch , which was exciting for me because they kept bringing me in . Eventually I got the Lauren Zizes part ! They had me sing for the pilot and it was very on the fly because Glee works very quickly . The first episode I appeared in I was the wrestler and I was trying out for cheerleading . Then they asked me to come out and sing for Ryan Murphy and the director and I sang and they were like , " Okay , great ! " We shot it and then I just kept coming back . 
 Fink does not know how long her character will be featured on Glee . When asked about what she likes about her character , Fink said : " I think what I love about Lauren is she 's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different . I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me . It 's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she 's unapologetic and she 's confident and she 's making Puck work for it and she 's not just looking for a roll in the hay . I think that they are very sweet together , there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there . What I appreciate about Lauren is that she 's like I don 't need to give it to you , you 're going to work for it , and I think that 's a great message to send to young girls . I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that 's kind of after her . " Kevin Fallon , a writer for The Atlantic , reacted favorably to the casting of Fink : " Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions . First there were Darren Criss — who 's exploded with popularity — and Chord Overstreet . Now there 's Ashley Fink 's Lauren . And while the tough @-@ only @-@ on @-@ the @-@ outside Lauren can deliciously out @-@ sass Santana Lopez , it 's her straight @-@ talking that really has me sold . " 
 = = = Characterization = = = 
 In her first episode , it is revealed that Lauren is a member of William McKinley High 's wrestling team . TV Squad has said that " Lauren can deliver a zinger with the bite of Sue Sylvester and the humor of our beloved Brittany Pierce . " Seth <unk> of TV.com expressed his dissatisfaction with her attitude : " Zizes isn 't just a heavy , supremely confident girl . She 's also extremely violent . She ’ s on the wrestling team , speaks regularly of injuring Puck , and , in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez , proved she was a lot more than just bark . And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous ' sake , right ? That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line ? There ’ s a word for people who do things like that in the real world : It 's ' asshole ' . " He went on to add : " Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups ( well , by Bust Magazine ) as a new kind of plus @-@ sized heroine — an obese female role model who for once doesn 't hate herself . On the contrary , she thinks she 's the bee 's knees . When ' Puck serenaded her with Queen 's " Fat @-@ Bottomed Girls , " she rebuffed him , saying , ' I look like America looks , and just like America , I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing ' . " 
 Journalist James Poniewozik of Time magazine commented of the episode " Silly Love Songs " : " It was the kind of twist Glee can sell , partly because of the way the characters are established ( in retrospect , you can see how a really strong woman who rejects him is a turn @-@ on for Puck ) and because of how well its cast ( Ashley Fink has been killing it as Lauren , and sells her confidence and abrasiveness in a way that makes her a person , not an engineered positive @-@ body @-@ image model ) . And while Glee sometimes stretches to pick on @-@ the @-@ nose song choices , " Fat Bottomed Girls " was just a perfect choice and performance — not just on topic but actually in Puck 's musical wheelhouse . " 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 Over the course of Glee 's second season , Lauren forms a relationship with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman . As the season progresses , Lauren and Puck 's relationship continues to grow stronger . Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled " Special Education " . After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club , members of the football team lock him in a port @-@ a @-@ potty . After being discovered by Lauren , he convinces her to join New Directions , despite her belief that show choir is stupid . Ashley Fink said of their relationship : " I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we 're all kind of along for the ride . I know what you mean , but I wouldn 't count us out just yet on that front . We all have to laugh at ourselves but it 's going somewhere . Ultimately , it comes down to whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren . I think there 's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren . I think he 's a badass , she 's a badass . I don 't know , I think they 're funny together . There 's something about the two of them together that I like , so I hope it 's not outside the realm of possibility . " 
 Television critics have responded positively to the pairing . Robert Canning of IGN said of the episode " Silly Love Songs " : " The absolute best part of " Silly Love Songs " was Puckerman 's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes . Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role , delivering great one @-@ liners with ease . She was equally strong in this , the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more . Heck , it was nice to even see her smile a few times . The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they 've been given bigger parts . The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs , but just as much heart . Puck singing Queen 's " Fat Bottomed Girls , " induced a chuckle at first , then some toe tapping . But it was Lauren 's reaction that truly made the moment : ' That 's the first song you 've sung to me and it made me feel like crap . ' I can 't decide if I want to root for this couple , but I certainly know I 'm going to be rooting for Lauren . " Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented : " For me , the episode 's highlight was the very sweet , funny courtship between Puck and Lauren . This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self @-@ professed bad boy , even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “ bad ” at all . But it ’ s always fun to watch Salling sing , and it ’ s always fun to watch him be smitten . Fink ends up being a good match for him , chemistry @-@ wise , as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren . The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings . " In the following episode , VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck " a lot less assured " than before , but Entertainment Weekly 's Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes " as endearing as they are unrealistic " , and E ! Online 's Jenna Mullins wrote that " the ice around [ her ] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 Lauren has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . Canning praised Fink 's performance in the episode " Silly Love Songs " , as well as Lauren 's dialog . Lisa Respers France of CNN commented that she is beginning to really like Lauren , noting : " for me Lauren represents how Ryan Murphy is able to take the concept of the outcast , flip it on its ear and shove it back in our faces with a side order of fabulousness . " Reiter felt that in " Comeback " , new characters Lauren and Sam " managed to shine " . 
 Rosie O 'Donnell reacted negatively to Fink 's casting and first solo musical performance . In an interview with Access Hollywood , she deemed her rendition of " I Know What Boys Like " underwhelming , and stated that it failed to meet her expectations . She called Lauren " so unlikable , " and questioned why the producers had not cast a " pretty heavy girl " . Fink brushed off O 'Donnell 's comments . O 'Donnell later apologized , and said , " Oh , Ashley – I love your swagger – your acting – your face – your heart – as a famous fat person – I am often asked about the issue … I love the story line – I love the show – and if in any way something I said hurt you – I apologize MORE . You are so talented , and I can 't wait to hear you belt it … as I know you can — the often misquoted Rosie . " Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life , who commented : " I 've loved her character and how they 've developed her and she 's just become a source of great comedy – is that because she 's full @-@ figured ? No . Is it because her character is well @-@ written ? Yes . It ’ s kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do . " 
 Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called Lauren 's performance of " I Know What Boys Like " the highlight of " Comeback " . Gonzalez was less than enthused . She graded it " C − " , after " deductions " , and said the only reason it started with a " C " was due to it being interspersed with shots of the cast in their underwear . Patrick Burns of The Atlantic was also unimpressed , and questioned Lauren 's spot in the glee club , commenting " her brazen character never ceases to please , but it 's just not believable that she would join the glee club if she cannot sing .

 = Henri L 'Estrange = 
 Henri L 'Estrange , known as the Australian Blondin , was an Australian successful <unk> and accident prone aeronautical balloonist . Modelling himself on the famous French wire @-@ walker Charles Blondin , L 'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s , culminating in three walks across Sydney 's Middle Harbour in 1877 . He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour . L 'Estrange was an early balloonist , and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful , one ending in Australia 's first emergency parachute descent , and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage , personal injury and a human stampede . He tried to return to his original career of tightrope walking but , with new forms of entertainment , humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators , he found success elusive . Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy , Victoria in 1894 . 
 = = Early performances = = 
 Henri L 'Estrange was born about 1842 in Fitzroy , a suburb of Melbourne . Little is known of his early years , family or private life . He first came to public attention in 1873 as a member of a Melbourne performance group , the Royal Comet Variety Troupe , a gymnastic , dancing and comedic vocal combination with Miss Lulu L 'Estrange and Monsieur Julian . As part of this troupe , L 'Estrange performed in Melbourne and Tasmania throughout 1873 and 1874 , with Henri and Lulu performing together on the tightrope . In 1876 , L 'Estrange performed solo for the first time in Melbourne , and quickly gained a reputation as a fearless performer . 
 Tightrope walking had grown in popularity in Australia through the 1860s , following reports reaching the Australian Colonies of the exploits of the great French walker , Charles Blondin , who crossed Niagara Falls in 1859 . By the mid @-@ 1860s , Australian wire walkers ( <unk> ) were modelling themselves on Blondin , copying his techniques , with several even calling themselves " the Australian Blondin " . The popularity of the name surged after the original Blondin visited Australia in 1874 , performing his highwire act in Brisbane , Sydney and Melbourne . By the mid @-@ 1880s , there were at least five " <unk> " performing regularly in Sydney and elsewhere . 
 L 'Estrange began using the moniker " the Australian Blondin " from early 1876 . Arriving in Sydney from Melbourne , L 'Estrange erected a large canvas enclosure in the Domain and began a regular series of performances on the tightrope , copying the location and stunts of the real Blondin who had performed there in August 1874 . His opening night on 26 January 1877 attracted a reported crowd of between two and three thousand people . Newspaper reports commented that his performance was so like that of the original Blondin that people could be forgiven for thinking they had seen the world @-@ renowned rope @-@ walker . With his rope suspended 40 feet ( 12 metres ) above the ground , L 'Estrange walked backwards and forwards , walked in armour , walked covered in a sack , used and sat on a chair , cooked and rode a bicycle , all on the rope . His show also included a fireworks display for the public 's entertainment . 
 L 'Estrange performed in the Domain from January through to April 1877 , but not without incident . On 7 February 1877 , as L 'Estrange neared the end of his wire act , sparks from the fireworks going off around him fell into the nearby store of gunpowder and fireworks , igniting them . The store 's shed was demolished , a surrounding fence knocked down , part of L 'Estrange 's performance tent caught fire , and two young boys were injured . 
 = = Sydney Harbour crossing = = 
 In late March 1877 , advertisements began to appear in the Sydney newspapers for L 'Estrange 's proposed harbour crossing . The first public performance was set for Saturday 31 March , with L 'Estrange having organised 21 steamers to convey spectators from Circular Quay to a special landing stage close to his performance area . L 'Estrange advised those wishing to see his performance to travel on his steamers as they were the only ones with permission to land passengers . This , of course this did not stop other entrepreneurs and captains from carrying spectators of their own . Whilst the event was profitable L 'Estrange considered that the majority of viewers were non @-@ paying " dead @-@ heads " . 
 Prior to the public performance , L 'Estrange undertook the crossing for a select audience including members of the press . That crossing was a success , and was well reviewed in the papers , no doubt adding to the crowd 's anticipation for the Saturday show . Sadly , bad weather postponed the performance , which did not go ahead until 14 April . 
 At 1 o 'clock on Saturday 14 April , the steamers began leaving Circular Quay , conveying 8 @,@ 000 of an estimated 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong crowd to Middle Harbour – a large crowd considering the alternative attractions that day of Sydney Royal Easter Show ( known then simply as " the Exhibition " ) and horse racing . The remainder were reported to be walking from St Leonards , with a toll being collected along the way . Spectators clambered up the sides of the bay for vantage points , while hundreds more stayed on board steamboats , yachts and in row boats below . The rope was strung across the entrance to Willoughby Bay , from Folly Point to the head of the bay , a reported length of 1 @,@ 420 feet ( 430 m ) , 340 feet ( 100 m ) above the waters below . The distance meant that two ropes were required , spliced together in the centre , to reach the other side , with 16 stays fixed to the shore and into the harbour to steady the structure . 
 Everything being ready , precisely at 4 o 'clock L 'Estrange come out of his tent on the eastern shore , dressed in a dark tunic and a red cap and turban . Without hesitation or delay he stepped onto the narrow rope , and , with his heavy balancing @-@ pole , at once set out on his journey across the lofty pathway . As has been before stated , the rope is stretched across the harbour at a great altitude , the width apparently being three hundred yards . At the western end it is higher than at the eastern , and as the weight of the rope causes a dip in the centre , the western end is at a considerable incline . Starting off amidst the cheers of the spectators , L 'Estrange walked fearlessly at the rate of eighty steps to a minute across the rope , until he reached a spliced part near the centre , some twenty feet in length , which he passed more deliberately . Then he stood on his right foot , with his left resting against his right leg . This feat being safely accomplished , he dropped onto his knee , and afterwards sat down and waived [ sic ] his handkerchief to the crowd of spectator . Next he lay on his back along the rope . Resuming the sitting posture , he took out a small telescope and for a moment or two surveyed the onlookers , who warmly applauded his performances . Raising the balancing pole , he lifted one foot onto the rope , then the other , and continued his walk . He took a few steps backward and then proceeded up the inclined part of the rope steadily to the western shore , at the slower speed of about sixty steps a minute , the rope swaying considerably as he went . The remaining part of the distance was safely traversed , the last few steps being walked more quickly : and the intrepid performer stepped on terra firma amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the spectators , the inspiring strains of the bands of music , and the shrill whistling of the steamers . 
 The successful crossing was greeted with enthusiastic cheers , the tunes of the Young Australian Band , the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey 's International Show Band , who had all come to entertain the crowds , and the shrilling of the steamers ' whistles . L 'Estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat to greet the crowds , although many had already rushed the steamers to leave , resulting in a few being jostled into the harbour . 
 While the Illustrated Sydney News proclaimed it a truly wonderful feat , performed with the greatest coolness and consummate ability , not all of Sydney 's press were so enthusiastic . The Sydney Mail questioned the worth of such a performance beyond the profits made , commenting that it was , " ... a mystery to many minds why such large concourses of people should gather together to witness a spectacle which has so little intrinsic merit . There is nothing about it to charm the taste or delight the fancy . " 
 Despite the criticism , L 'Estrange performed at least once more at Middle Harbour , although crowds were down to a few hundred , requiring only four steamers to transport them . The same night he was guest of honour at a testimonial dinner held at the Victoria Theatre where The Young Australian Band played " The Blondin March " , a piece composed specially by their conductor Mr J. Devlin . He was presented with a large gold star , engraved with a scene of his latest triumph , the date of his public performance . Measuring 3 inches ( 76 mm ) across , it was centred with a 1 ½ carat diamond and suspended by a blue ribbon to a clasp featuring the Australian coat of arms in silver . An illuminated address and a bag of sovereigns , collected from his admirers , were also given . L 'Estrange thereafter took his show on the road , going first to Brisbane in May 1877 , and reportedly afterwards to Singapore , England and America . 
 = = Ballooning = = 
 In April 1878 , L 'Estrange reappeared on the Australian scene with a new performance – gas ballooning . The first balloon ascent in Australia had been made in Melbourne in 1853 , with Sydney following five years later in December 1858 . The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public , and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s . No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd 's keen interest , as mishaps were not uncommon . 
 L 'Estrange came to Sydney with his balloon in November 1878 , accompanied by reports of successful flights already made in India . In a confident appraisal of L 'Estrange 's new venture , the Sydney Morning Herald wrote : 
 [ L 'Estrange 's ] balloon has been fitted with the newest applications , amongst others a parachute , which in the event of anything going wrong , would prevent the too rapid descent of the aerial voyager . Another novelty is the fixing of bags of sand round the mesh which covers the balloon , the principle of which is that by emptying these , and so lessening the weight , the balloon will ascend . The process is chiefly intended to be an easy method of avoiding buildings ... He is perfectly confident that he will prove successful in travelling amongst the regions of the clouds , and , if so it will prove an agreeable variety after the many failures we have had . 
 In a letter to the Sydney City Council , L 'Estrange sought permission for the use of the Exhibition grounds in Prince Alfred Park , behind Sydney Central Station for his first attempt . L 'Estrange struggled to fill the balloon through the afternoon of 17 November 1878 , with gas supplied by the Australian Gas Light Company . By 5pm , the crowd was getting restless and L 'Estrange decided to attempt liftoff , despite the balloon not being fully inflated . To lighten the load he removed the car in which he was to sit and instead sat in a loop of rope . The balloon managed only to drag him across the park before clearing the <unk> and landing on a railway truck in the yards of Sydney 's Central railway station next to the park . L 'Estrange blamed the failure on having been supplied with " dense " gas and a filling pipe that was too narrow and leaky . 
 L 'Estrange wrote to the Council again , this time asking for permission to use Belmore Park for a second attempt . Much like his first attempt , the second ended in failure . Once again the balloon took much of the day to fill , with the lift going ahead at 5 pm on the afternoon of 7 December 1878 . The first attempt dragged him approximately 100 yards ( 91 m ) through the crowd . Returning to the start point , L 'Estrange tried again , shooting up into the air approximately 50 feet ( 15 m ) and sailing away towards the south , before descending again and being dragged across the park . The crowd feared the balloon would crash but once more it lifted , up and over the roof of Carters ' Barracks . L 'Estrange , realising that the balloon was not going to lift higher , threw out the anchor , which caught in the spouting of a building and threw the balloon into the drying yard of the Benevolent Asylum , where it caught in the washing lines and wires and was practically destroyed . Still , L 'Estrange 's place in Sydney hearts had been established and a well @-@ attended benefit was held at the Theatre Royal on 19 December 1878 . 
 L 'Estrange survived an even more disastrous attempt in Melbourne less than six months later at the grounds of the Agricultural Society in a balloon named Aurora . Having been supplied with a much higher quality gas from the Metropolitan Gas Company he miscalculated the speed at which the balloon would ascend . Having floated much higher than originally anticipated the balloon greatly expanded and a weak seam in the calico fabric suddenly burst . L 'Estrange had the presence of mind to deploy the silk parachute which slowed the rate of descent . His landing was softened by a tree and although severely shaken , L 'Estrange was uninjured . The whole journey took nine minutes . The " catastrophe " was widely reported with the story appearing in local newspapers in Adelaide , Canberra , Sydney and Brisbane within the week . This was the first emergency descent by parachute in Australia , predating the Caterpillar Club by over 50 years . 
 Despite these setbacks , L 'Estrange persisted , returning to Sydney in August 1880 to prepare for another attempt . Success finally came with a flight on 25 September 1880 from Cook Park , Northwards over the Garden Palace and Sydney harbour to Manly . 
 = = = Final balloon flight = = = 
 Buoyed by his achievement , L 'Estrange set himself a second flight day in March 1881 . With his reputation already well known in Sydney , and a successful flight on record , a crowd of over 10 @,@ 000 turned up in the Outer Domain . 
 As a result of high atmospheric pressure and heavy dew weighing down the balloon , inflation took longer than anticipated , and the crowd grew restless . The officer representing the company supplying the gas also refused to provide a new supply . L 'Estrange was presented with what was described as a " Hobson 's choice " , " ... either to abandon the attempt and risking being seriously maltreated by the mob , or proceed <unk> without the car , accepting the attendant [ risks ] of such an aerial voyage . " He chose the latter and the lift commenced at 9 @.@ 30 pm with L 'Estrange sitting in a loop of rope much like his attempt three years previously . At first all seemed well , as the balloon lifted above the heads of the crowd , hovering for a moment before first heading over Hyde Park . He described the rest of his voyage in a letter to a friend : 
 I then got into a westerly current that took me out to sea , on which I determined to come down to mother earth without delay , but picture to yourself my horror when I found the escape valve would not act . I tried with all the strength of the one hand I had to spare to move it , for with the other I had to hold myself in the loop of rope , but all to no purpose , it would not budge an inch . In sheer desperation I took the valve rope in both hands , and it opened with a bang ; but in the effort I had lost my seat in the loop , falling about six feet , and there I was dangling in mid air , clutching the valve rope , the gas rushing out of the balloon as though she had burst ... 
 Managing to right himself , he became faint from the escaping gas and lashed himself to the ropes to prevent a fall . Realising the attempt was now a danger to himself and the balloon , L 'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down . However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were too short . 
 L 'Estrange 's balloon descended rapidly over the rooftops of Woolloomooloo , slamming into a house near the corner of Palmer Street and Robinson Lane . L 'Estrange managed to disentangle himself and fell first onto a chimney then a shed 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) below . He scrambled down from the rooftops to a waiting mob , who whisked him away to Robinson 's hotel on the William Street corner and would not let him leave . At the crash site , during an attempt to free the balloon , the escaping gas was ignited when the resident of the house opened a window to see what the commotion was and the gas came into contact with the open flame of the room 's chandelier . The resulting fireball destroyed the balloon , burnt a number of bystanders and was bright enough to " ... cast a brief but vivid illumination over the entire suburb " . A panicked crush developed as groups tried to both flee from and rush towards the brief , but extremely bright , conflagration while those further away at the launch site assumed L 'Estrange had been killed . Several people were injured in the crush or burned by the fire with one lady reportedly being blinded . 
 Although a Masonic benefit was held in his honour to try to recoup some of his financial losses , the fiasco spelt the end of L 'Estrange 's aeronautical career . 
 = = Return to tightrope walking = = 
 In a change of direction in March 1882 , L 'Estrange applied to the Sydney City Council to establish a juvenile pleasure gardens at the Paddington Reservoir . The fun park was to have a variety of rides , a maze , merry @-@ go @-@ round and a donkey racecourse . L 'Estrange proposed the park to be free entry with all monies being made via the sale of refreshments on site . While he was given permission , the park does not appear ever to have opened . 
 Following the disastrous balloon attempt and the failed pleasure grounds , L 'Estrange decided to return to what he knew best , tightrope walking . In April 1881 L 'Estrange , given top billing as " the hero of Middle Harbour " , performed at the Garden Palace on the high @-@ rope as part of the Juvenile Fete , with other acrobats , contortionists and actors . With proof of the continuing popularity of the rope act , he decided to return to his greatest triumph ; the spectacular crossing of the harbour in 1877 which had still not been repeated . On 23 December 1882 , L 'Estrange advised the public that he would cross the harbour once more , this time riding a bicycle across Banbury Bay , close to the site of his original success . 
 As with his previous crossings , steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay , although this time only four were needed , while another 600 – 700 people made their own way to the site . The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December , but delays meant L 'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm . Although the length of rope was over 182 metres , it was only just over nine metres above the water . The stay wires were held in boats on either side , with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady . L 'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre , where , with the rope swinging to and fro , he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead , realising he was losing his balance , he was forced to leap from the rope and fell into the water below . Although he was unhurt , it was another knock to his reputation . A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend . Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L 'Estrange 's rope had been mysteriously cut , and he cancelled the performance . The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd , who had paid for tickets on the steamers , felt they had been scammed . 
 = = Late career = = 
 With his reputation in tatters after the balloon crash and the attempted second harbour crossing , L 'Estrange slowly slipped out of the public eye . In December 1883 he was reported as performing again on the highwire at the Parramatta Industrial Juvenile exhibition . While his act attracted favourable publicity , " his efforts were not received with the amount of enthusiasm they certainly deserved " . 
 In April 1885 a benefit was held for L 'Estrange , again at the Masonic Lodge , like the one held after his balloon misadventure . It was advertised that the benefit , under the patronage of the Mayor and Aldermen of Sydney , and with Bill Beach , world champion sculler in attendance , was prompted because L 'Estrange had " lately met with a severe accident " . The nature of the accident is unknown , but it is speculated to have been a fall from his tightrope , explaining the end of his performances . 
 His apparent decline in popularity may have been as much a reflection of the public 's changing taste for entertainment as it was a comment on his act . By the time L 'Estrange returned to Sydney to attempt his second harbour crossing in 1882 , the city was awash with Blondin imitators performing increasingly dangerous , and probably illegal , feats . At least five were performing in Sydney from 1880 under variations of the title from the " Young Blondin " ( Alfred Row ) to the " Blondin Brothers " ( Alexander and Collins ) , the " Great Australian Blondin " ( James Alexander ) , the " original Australian Blondin " ( Collins ) , the " Great Australian Blondin " ( Signor <unk> ) , the " Female Australian Blondin " ( <unk> ) and another " Australian Blondin " ( Charles Jackson ) . 
 In 1886 L 'Estrange again applied to the Sydney City Council for permission to establish an amusement ride called " The Rocker " in Belmore Park . The Rocker consisted of a boat which , propelled by horsepower , gave the impression of being at sea . Permission was granted but like his juvenile pleasure grounds , there is no evidence that it was ever erected . After this , L 'Estrange slipped from view in Sydney . In 1894 Edwin L 'Estrange " who a few years ago acquired some celebrity as the Australian Blondin " appeared in court in Fitzroy , Victoria having been knocked down and run over by a horse and buggy being driven by a commercial traveller . The driver was fined and L 'Estrange 's injuries are not recorded .

 " Sparks Fly " is a country pop song with a length of four minutes and 22 seconds . The song , written solely by Swift , is in the key of D minor with Swift 's vocals spanning two octaves , from F3 to C5 . Johnathan Keefe claimed that " the a capella " Drop everything now " exclamation simply commands attention , with the desperation in Swift ’ s call @-@ to @-@ action answering the common criticisms that her work is sexless and chaste . " Bobby Peacock stated that " I wouldn 't mind if the banjo from the 2007 version were left in , but its omission is hardly make @-@ or @-@ break . Perhaps my biggest problem is that the song 's chorus undermines itself in the second half – it starts out emphatic and anthemic as usual , but there 's just no " oomph " on the hook . It almost feels as if she 's trailing off mid @-@ sentence . " Blake Boldt of Engine 145 stated " " Sparks Fly " centers around a simple but effective hook — " I see sparks fly whenever you smile " — that further cements Swift ’ s reputation as one the <unk> songwriters in popular music . " Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country commented on the chorus of the song stating , " Though Swift implies that this particular crush is a " bad idea , " she still insists that they should try to make it work in the chorus : " Drop everything now , meet me in the pouring rain / Kiss me on the sidewalk , take away the pain / ‘ Cause I see sparks fly / Whenever you smile , " she sings insistently . " 
 According to Swift , the song is about " falling for someone who you maybe shouldn 't fall for , but you can 't stop yourself because there 's such a connection and chemistry . "

 " Sparks Fly " received positive reviews from music critics . Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift 's vocals on " Sparks Fly " , commenting that her voice in such an upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer . Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it " dopamine @-@ infused , hair @-@ whipping stuff " . Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song " the purest iteration of Swift ’ s template and repertoire " , also saying that it " could turn things around for Swift , as it ’ s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting . " He concluded by stating that the song " proves how evocative those turns @-@ of @-@ phrase can be in the right context . To that end , “ Sparks Fly ” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single , and it ’ s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right . " Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets " a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little burnout at radio . Her songs drop like rocks once they peak , and she 's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts . While I don 't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another ' You Belong with Me ' -level hit , I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen . " Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift , saying " Her infusion of individual lines with urgency ( “ Drop everything now , ” she insists ) and earnestness ( “ Take away the pain , ” she pleads ) are a tribute to her talent , not so much as a distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator . Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning . Should I stay or should I go now ? , she wonders , <unk> [ sic ] away the hours before he calls her again . " Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is " just another one of those so @-@ Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100 % Taylor Swift . " Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn 't to " hot on " the song and compared the song to Swift 's earlier works , " Fearless " , " Hey Stephen " , and " Forever and Always " , and stated that Swift " puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I 'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song . " Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift 's song , " Long Live " .

 = Jack Stewart ( ice hockey ) = 
 John Sherratt " Black Jack " Stewart ( May 6 , 1917 – May 25 , 1983 ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played 12 National Hockey League ( NHL ) seasons for the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks . He won two Stanley Cup championships with the Red Wings and was named to the post @-@ season NHL All @-@ Star Team on five occasions : three times on the first team and twice on the second . Stewart also played in the first four NHL All @-@ Star Games . After completing his NHL career as captain of the Black Hawks , he went on to coach numerous teams at various levels of hockey . 
 Stewart was regarded as the hardest hitting defenceman of his time , a reputation that earned him his nickname . His style of play routinely resulted in injuries and scars ; he defied expectations by returning to the game after suffering a ruptured disc in his back and later a fractured skull . He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1964 , and is also honoured by the Manitoba Hockey and Sports Halls of Fame . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Stewart played junior hockey with the Portage Terriers of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League in 1935 – 36 and 1936 – 37 , where he was discovered by a Winnipeg businessman who suggested that James Norris , owner of the Detroit Red Wings , sign him . He was sent to play his first season of professional hockey for the team 's minor league affiliate , the Pittsburgh Hornets of the International @-@ American Hockey League ( IAHL ) . He recorded one assist in 48 games in the 1937 – 38 season . 
 Partway through his second season with the Hornets , the Red Wings recalled Stewart as part of a bid to shake up their team which had been struggling . He appeared in 32 games in his NHL rookie season of 1938 – 39 , and immediately established himself as a physical presence . He played in all 48 games for Detroit in 1939 – 40 ; his lone goal on the campaign was the first of his career . Stewart and the Red Wings reached the Stanley Cup final in both 1941 and 1942 , but lost to the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs , respectively . In his fifth season , 1942 – 43 , Stewart was named to the NHL First All @-@ Star Team on defence and helped lead the Red Wings to the NHL regular season title . Reaching the final for the third consecutive season , Detroit defeated Boston to win the Stanley Cup . Stewart scored one goal , added two assists and had 35 penalty minutes in ten playoff games . 
 Stewart 's NHL career was interrupted by the Second World War in 1943 . He remained in Canada , serving as a Leading Aircraftman in the Royal Canadian Air Force and playing hockey for the Montreal RCAF and Winnipeg RCAF teams between 1943 and 1945 . Upon his return to the NHL , Stewart was paired up with Bill Quackenbush on the Red Wings defence . He went on to earn four additional all @-@ star selections : he was named to the second team in 1945 – 46 and 1946 – 47 , and to the first team again in 1947 – 48 and 1948 – 49 . Additionally , he played in the first four National Hockey League All @-@ Star Games , held between 1947 and 1950 . Not known for his offence , Stewart never scored more than five goals in a season , and his career high of 19 points was set in 1947 – 48 . He won his second Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in 1950 as they defeated the New York Rangers in double overtime of the deciding seventh game . 
 Following the championship , the Red Wings dealt Stewart to the Chicago Black Hawks as part of a nine @-@ player trade that was , at the time , the largest in NHL history . Stewart , Harry Lumley , Al Dewsbury , Pete <unk> and Don Morrison were sent to Chicago in exchange for Metro <unk> , Bob <unk> , Gaye Stewart and Jim Henry . The Black Hawks named Stewart team captain and assistant coach almost immediately . 
 Stewart missed the majority of the 1950 – 51 NHL season and his career was believed over after he suffered a serious spinal injury in a December 14 , 1950 , game against the Toronto Maple Leafs . Doctors diagnosed his injury as a ruptured disc and urged him to retire . He was told following the injury that he was lucky he could still walk without a cane and not to risk further damage on the ice . Instead , Stewart had the disc removed and after completing what Black Hawks ' team doctors described as a " most remarkable " recovery , he opted to continue his career and signed with Chicago for the 1951 – 52 season . 
 Early in the season , Stewart suffered a minor skull fracture after colliding with teammate Clare Martin , an injury that forced him out of the lineup for several weeks . Stewart spent two weeks in hospital , after which he announced his retirement , but he again shocked observers by returning to the ice . However , by mid February 1952 , his injuries led Stewart to ask the Black Hawks for his release so that he could seek a minor league coaching position . 
 = = Coaching career = = 
 Stewart was considered as coach of the New Westminster Royals of the Pacific Coast Hockey League , but chose to take the reins of the senior A Chatham Maroons in the Ontario Hockey Association . He served as a player @-@ coach , appearing in 45 games for the Maroons in 1952 – 53 , where he scored two goals and 29 points while accumulating 129 penalty minutes . Stewart played the final games of his career in 1953 – 54 , finishing with eight assists in 21 games . 
 The following seasons saw Stewart move between several teams as head coach . He left the Maroons to guide the Kitchener @-@ Waterloo Dutchmen in 1955 – 56 , then the Windsor Bulldogs for two seasons between 1957 and 1959 . At one point in 1957 , he was rumoured to become the next coach of the Chicago Black Hawks , a job that went instead to Rudy <unk> . Stewart moved into the professional ranks in 1961 , taking over as the coach of Chicago 's Eastern Professional Hockey League affiliate , the Sault Thunderbirds . One year later , Stewart moved to the Pittsburgh Hornets , an American Hockey League affiliate of the Detroit Red Wings . After winning only 16 games in 1962 – 63 , Stewart retired after he was dismissed by the Hornets .

 During his career , Stewart was regarded as one of the hardest <unk> in the National Hockey League . He also carried the heaviest stick in the league , explaining that " I don 't use it for scoring . I use it for breaking arms " . Stewart was known for his large grin when hitting opponents ; teammate Ted Lindsay noted " when he had that smile , it was time for the opposition to look out " . He led the league with 73 penalty minutes in 1945 – 46 , and in the late 1940s , his rivalry with Milt Schmidt of the Boston Bruins was so intense that their physical interactions occasionally overshadowed the games themselves . 
 Stewart hated his nickname of " Black Jack " , as he believed it made him out to be a dirty player . Hockey Hall of Fame defenceman King Clancy agreed he was not dirty , but stated he was the " roughest son of a gun you 'd ever want to meet . " Stewart 's style of play resulted in numerous injuries ; he had dozens of scars and required over 200 stitches to close various cuts during his career . At one point he played a full season with a broken hand . 
 On the ice , Stewart showed good judgment as a defenceman and rarely took himself out of position to throw a hit . His coach in Detroit , Jack Adams , called Stewart " one of the best blueliners in the game " , and claimed he was the best defenceman in Red Wings history . Regarded as a good skater , he was able to clear the puck out of his zone and rarely turned it over to the other team . Clare Martin said he was a " defensive defenceman " and that he " didn 't carry the puck too much ... His job was defence and everybody in the league knew it . " 
 A charter member of the Detroit Red Wings Hall of Fame in 1944 , Stewart was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1964 . He is also an honoured member of the Michigan Sports , Manitoba Hockey and Sports Halls of Fame . He was named to the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame 's First All @-@ Century Team in 2000 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Stewart was born May 6 , 1917 , in Pilot Mound , Manitoba , where he learned to play hockey on the community 's outdoor rinks . He had three sisters . In the off @-@ seasons , he returned to his family farm , work which was said to have given him the strength he displayed in the NHL . An avid sportsman , Stewart was an active curler during his playing career , and played softball in the summer . Though he was regarded on the ice as one of toughest players in the game , he was also quiet . He was known as " Silent Jack " by his teammates , allowing his actions to speak for him .
