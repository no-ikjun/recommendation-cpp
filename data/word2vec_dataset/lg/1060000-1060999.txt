 After the 1968 presidential election , George Romney was named the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the administration of the newly elected President Nixon . Lenore was not enthusiastic about leaving Michigan to return to Washington after five decades away , but said , " Any wife wants to be with her husband wherever he is , whether state or federal government , just so he can develop his creative ideas . " By then , the couple had 12 grandchildren . 
 For the 1970 U.S. Senate election from Michigan , state Republicans were looking for someone to run against Democrat Philip Hart , a two @-@ term incumbent . Hart was heavily favored to win re @-@ election , but Republicans thought he might be vulnerable on ideological grounds ( for being too liberal ) and owing to an anti @-@ war protest arrest involving his wife . George Romney 's name was mentioned as a possible candidate . Indeed , Nixon , who never had good relations with Romney either personally or on policy grounds , had by then decided he wanted Romney out of his administration but did not want to fire him , and hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the Senate race . However , George came up with the idea of Lenore running , and sprung it on Lenore and the children at the end of 1969 . Lenore 's name began being mentioned by other Republicans , even though she professed not to want to run unless no other candidate could be found . U.S. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford from Michigan thought she could unite the state party 's different factions , but Governor William Milliken , who had succeeded George and was not eager to see more Romneys in power , opposed the notion . And while Lenore had achieved a good reputation for campaigning on her husband 's behalf , there were some who suspected that her Senate candidacy was just a stalking horse for keeping George 's options open . Such sentiments were exacerbated when George did not completely rule himself out of a possible race . 
 The state party had a system wherein there would be a series of meetings of its 355 leaders in order to declare a " consensus " candidate that the party would support in any primary election . During the initial February 21 , 1970 , meeting , Lenore Romney faced opposition from liberal U.S. Representative Donald W. Riegle , Jr. and conservative State Senator Robert J. Huber . The meeting became contentious , and with Milliken helping to block her , in three ballots she was unable to reach the three @-@ fourths majority needed for the consensus nod . On February 23 , she formally entered the contest for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat . George successfully pressured Milliken to endorse her , but gained bad publicity when The Detroit News exposed his actions . At the next party meeting , on March 7 , she won 92 percent of the leaders and gained the consensus candidate position , and talk of George running ended . 
 Riegle did not continue his run , but Huber did . In the ensuing primary contest , Romney 's effort emphasized her gender , saying as a campaign theme , " Never before has the voice and understanding of a concerned woman been more needed . " Billboards featuring her face were everywhere , captioned only as " Lenore " and omitting any reference to political party . She was still photogenic , but so thin that she was sometimes described as " frail " or " <unk> " , and her husband sometimes worried about her weight . She issued a half @-@ hour campaign film that featured endorsements from many national and state party leaders as well as from celebrities Bob Hope and Art Linkletter , and showcased her family role and her concern for disadvantaged people . Huber , in contrast , emphasized his edge in political experience , derided her " motherly concern " , and criticized the " bossism " that he said was trying to force another Romney into statewide office . 
 Regarding the Vietnam War , Romney called for the withdrawal of all American troops by the end of 1971 , and characterized the war as " disastrous " . She was troubled by the ongoing Cambodian Incursion and said that if elected she would vote to cut off its funds if Nixon did not abide by his pledge to withdraw from there by the end of the month . On other issues , she sometimes took overly broad stances that appeared to come down on multiple sides . The conservative wing of the party , which had never trusted her husband , had the same reaction to her . The largely male press corps tended to deal with her in a paternalistic way , and she was often identified as " Mrs. George Romney " in stories and photo captions . Initially heavily favored over Huber , her campaign failed to gain momentum and polls showed a close race ; in response , she shifted her ads to focus more on her stands on issues . In the August 4 , 1970 , primary , Lenore Romney won a narrow victory , with 52 percent of the vote compared to Huber 's 48 percent . 
 In the general election , with lost prestige , a divided party , and with her campaign resources partly drained by the primary fight , Romney was behind incumbent Democrat Hart from the beginning . Romney issued position papers and emphasized the themes of dealing with crime and social permissiveness ; she also advocated a national healthcare plan and increased attention to environmental damage caused by industry . She never made any personal attacks against Hart . The only woman running for the U.S. Senate that year , she was a tireless campaigner , traveling around the state in a chartered Cessna and making as many as twelve stops a day . Nevertheless , the perception grew that she did not have any vision for what she would do as a senator and was only in the race because she was George Romney 's wife . In response , she said at one point , " I 'm not a stand @-@ in or a substitute for anyone " . Her campaign material continued to just refer to " Lenore " . She also was negatively impacted , in both the primary and general election , by fallout from her husband 's effort as HUD Secretary to enforce housing integration in Warren , Michigan . Consistently far ahead in polls , Hart staged a low @-@ key campaign with few public appearances ; he mostly ignored her and sometimes acted condescendingly towards her in private . 
 The Romney children campaigned for her , including Mitt , who took student leave to work as a driver and advance man at schools and county fairs during the summer . Together , Lenore and Mitt visited all 83 Michigan counties . George was in Washington most of the time and did not publicly campaign for her until the campaign 's final day . 
 In the November 3 , 1970 , general election , Hart handily won a third term with 67 percent of the vote to her 33 percent . Romney made an unusual election @-@ night visit to congratulate Hart in person , and in saying " I hope all good things will be his , " gave what the victor termed " the most graceful and really moving concession speech I 've ever heard . " 
 The campaign and loss left Lenore in emotional pain . In her election night remarks she had said , " I thought [ running as a woman ] would be an asset . It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman . " She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine , describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women . She wrote that , " In factories , I encountered men in small groups , laughing , shouting , ' Get in the kitchen . George needs you there . What do you know about politics ? ' " To a friend she wrote , " [ I had no idea ] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep . " She told one of her children that she wished she had not run , and concluded that " It 's the most humiliating thing I know of to run for office . " 
 = = Later years = = 
 Following the campaign , Lenore Romney returned to Washington and to being a cabinet wife . George , who had also long been interested in volunteerism , had helped found the National Center for Voluntary Action in 1970 , and Lenore was made a member of its executive committee . By late 1971 , she assumed some of First Lady Pat Nixon 's role as a public advocate for volunteerism , visiting regional volunteer centers with other cabinet and administration wives . She was on the board of the National Conference of Christians and Jews , serving as brotherhood chair during 1970 – 1971 and as vice chair in 1972 . She was also a main force behind the Urban Service Corps , which sought to apply volunteer efforts to the problems of large cities . She worked with the National Women 's Political Caucus to promote the electoral candidacies of women . She gave some speeches at colleges , and came out as explicitly pro @-@ life on the issue of abortion , after having previously been ambivalent about it . 
 In the 1972 U.S. presidential election , Lenore Romney worked in the women 's surrogate program for the Committee for the Re @-@ Election of the President . Nevertheless , her husband 's relationship with Nixon and the administration became even worse and , in August 1972 , she wrote a fruitless letter to presidential aide John Ehrlichman urging a change in the " low regard " and poor treatment that the administration showed him . 
 After George Romney left the administration and politics in January 1973 , Lenore continued with volunteerism , as vice president of the National Center for Voluntary Action . In 1974 , she became a commentator on the WJR radio show Point of View . Subsequently she receded from the public political eye , but still remained active . She gave speeches to various local religious and civic organizations in the Midwest , focusing on her faith , the potential of " people power " , and the role of women . 
 At age 85 , Lenore Romney emerged to give interviews during her son Mitt 's 1994 campaign for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts . She contrasted Mitt to his opponent , long @-@ time incumbent Senator Ted Kennedy ; while Kennedy had been much in the news for his drinking and sexual escapades , Lenore noted that Mitt and wife Ann Romney had waited until marriage to have sex . Mitt lost the race to Kennedy . 
 On July 26 , 1995 , George Romney died of a heart attack at the age of 88 while he was exercising on his treadmill at the couple 's home in Bloomfield Hills ; he was discovered by Lenore ( after she went looking for him , not having found her rose for the day ) , but it was too late to save him . They had been married for 64 years , and the press noted the strength of that marriage . 
 Lenore 's health declined during her final years . But she was still doing fairly well when , at the age of 89 , she suffered a stroke at her Bloomfield Hills home . She died several days later at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak , Michigan , on July 7 , 1998 . Besides her four children , she was survived by 24 grandchildren and 41 great @-@ grandchildren . She is interred in Fairview Cemetery in Brighton , Michigan , in the same family plot as her husband . 
 Following her death , many state political figures paid tribute to her , including Governor John Engler and his wife Michelle , who called her " Michigan 's rose " , and Lieutenant Governor Connie <unk> , who characterized her as a " beloved role model for our state " .

 In 1969 , Lenore Romney received the Woman of the Year Award from Brigham Young University . She was named one of the National Top Ten Women News Makers for 1970 . She was given the Salvation Army 's Humanitarian Award , Michigan State University 's Distinguished Citizen Award , and also received recognition from Hadassah and the International Platform Association . 
 For many years beginning in 1987 , the successor organizations to the National Center for Voluntary Action ( VOLUNTEER : The National Center , National Volunteer Center , Points of Light Foundation , and Points of Light Foundation & the National Network of Volunteer Centers ) have given out an annual Lenore and George W. Romney Citizen Volunteer Award ( later retitled the George and Lenore Romney Citizen Volunteer Award ) . 
 Lenore Romney was awarded six honorary degrees . She received an <unk> from Hillsdale College in 1964 , from Hope College in 1967 , and from Gwynedd – Mercy College in 1971 .

 = Magnum XL @-@ 200 = 
 Magnum XL @-@ 200 , colloquially known as simply Magnum , is a steel roller coaster built by Arrow Dynamics at Cedar Point in Sandusky , Ohio . When built in 1989 , it was the tallest , fastest , and steepest complete @-@ circuit roller coaster in the world as well as the first hypercoaster – a roller coaster that exceeds 200 feet ( 61 m ) in height . Some have credited Magnum with starting a period in the industry known as the roller coaster wars , in which amusement parks competed with one another at a rapid pace to build the next tallest and fastest roller coaster . More than 40 million people had ridden Magnum as of 2009 . 
 Magnum XL @-@ 200 held the title of tallest roller coaster in the world until 1994 when Pepsi Max Big One opened at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the United Kingdom . Amusement Today presented Magnum with its " Best Steel Roller Coaster " Golden Ticket Award for three consecutive years in a row from 1998 to 2000 . As of 2014 , it was ranked thirteenth in the world by the same publication . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s , Cedar Point had grown into a successful collection of roller coasters and other smaller rides on the shores of Lake Erie . Dick Kinzel took over as president and CEO of Cedar Fair , the company that operates the park , in 1986 . In 1988 , Kinzel saw a report on CNN about the opening of a new coaster in Japan called Bandit at <unk> that emphasized height and speed but had no inversions . Kinzel wanted to introduce a similar coaster that emphasized steep drops and negative g @-@ forces over inversions and spins , which were common at the time . It had been 10 years since the last major addition , Gemini , was introduced . Cedar Point asked for proposals from TOGO , Dinn Corporation , Intamin and Arrow Dynamics to build a roller coaster without inversions or over @-@ the @-@ shoulder restraints . They chose Arrow , which proposed a 187 feet ( 57 m ) -tall coaster . That got Cedar Point 's management interested in breaking the 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) barrier , partly because of the publicity to be gained from building the first roller coaster to do so . The name Magnum XL @-@ 200 was chosen because Magnum , P.I. was popular at the time and Cedar Point 's management wanted to incorporate the height into the name . The original proposal was to cost $ 7 @.@ 5 million , but was raised to $ 8 million after the height was extended to 200 feet ( 61 m ) . 
 = = = Opening = = = 
 Magnum XL @-@ 200 was announced on August 16 , 1988 , and construction began shortly thereafter . Following its completion in 1989 , Kinzel was one of the first people to ride the coaster , boarding the train after one test cycle . It officially opened to the public on May 6 , 1989 as the world 's tallest , fastest and steepest complete @-@ circuit roller coaster . It was measured for the Guinness Book of World Records on June 2 . Cedar Point set a record attendance in 1989 , due in part to the introduction of the Magnum . 
 Magnum was awarded the ACE Roller Coaster Landmark award on June 21 , 2004 . Magnum has been repainted once in its history . The original track color was scarlet red , but the park started painting Magnum Molly orange in 2005 . The job was completed in 2006 . Cedar Point celebrated Magnum 's 20th anniversary on opening day in 2009 with a ceremony and an appearance by Ron Toomer , its designer . A new entrance sign was also introduced . 
 Magnum XL @-@ 200 has been the target of false rumors since 1998 claiming the structure was sinking due to unstable ground . The rumors supposedly started as an April Fools Day joke in an Ohio newspaper , but quickly spread via the Internet . Cedar Point quickly denounced such rumors .

 The queue is in a shaded area surrounded by trees and shrubs , and is filled with posters listing facts about the ride . Music from the 1980s is typically played in the queue area , true to the decade in which the ride debuted . There is a DJ booth next to the queue , but it is no longer in use . The Fast Lane entrance is near the exit of the ride ; it joins the regular line near the bottom of the stairs leading to the station . The queue used to have a staffed refreshment stand where people waiting in line could buy soft drinks . At some point in the mid 1990s this stand was removed and replaced with vending machines as seen in the queue entrance photo .

 Magnum XL @-@ 200 is classified as a hypercoaster and an out and back roller coaster . After the train departs the station , it travels west over the walkway leading to Soak City and Challenge Park . It then makes a 90 @-@ degree turn to the right and begins the 205 @-@ foot ( 62 m ) climb to the top of the lift hill . It drops 194 @.@ 7 feet ( 59 @.@ 3 m ) at a 60 @-@ degree angle , reaching a top speed of 72 miles per hour ( 116 km / h ) . The train then ascends a 157 @-@ foot ( 48 m ) hill , curving to the left into the first tunnel . Coming out of the tunnel , the train ascends a third , 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) -tall hill . After the third hill , it enters a " pretzel " turn @-@ around ( a set of trim brakes can be found in the first curve of the turn @-@ around because there is no mid @-@ course brake run ) where it curves to the left toward the beach and then left again into another tunnel . From the turn @-@ around to the station , there are seven " bunny hops " and two tunnels . After the last tunnel , the train turns left and goes back over the walkway to Soak City and Challenge Park . It then turns right and enters the brake run . One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes .

 Magnum XL @-@ 200 has three white @-@ and @-@ black trains . Each train has red , black or blue striping at the front . Each train has six cars ; riders are arranged two @-@ across in three rows for a total of 36 riders per train . Magnum was the first coaster in which Arrow Dynamics used its Hypercoaster trains , which were subsequently installed on dozens of other new rides . Riders are secured by a single lap bar and a seat belt . 
 When Magnum XL @-@ 200 opened , it used pads similar to those still in use on Gemini . Shortly after its debut , however , these up @-@ stop plates were replaced with more traditional up @-@ stop wheels that keep the train from flying off its rails .

 Magnum XL @-@ 200 's steel track is 5 @,@ 106 feet ( 1 @,@ 556 m ) in length , and its main hill is approximately 205 feet ( 62 m ) high . Magnum XL @-@ 200 originally had a scarlet red track with silver supports . The track was repainted Molly orange in 2005 , but the supports remained silver . The track consists of a tubular steel spine connected by struts to tubular steel running rails . When it opened , a steel out and back roller coaster without any loops was unheard of . Magnum is not a smooth @-@ riding roller coaster , partly because its pieces were welded together , unassisted by computer design . The track sections range from 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) to 200 feet ( 61 m ) and 157 support columns were used .

The ride reopened the next day and park spokesman Robin Innes said the accident was caused by rain : " We think it was just caused by excessive moisture on the tracks due to the heavy rain storms we had in the morning " he said .

 Mathieu Valbuena ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 28 September 1984 ) is a French international footballer who plays for Ligue 1 club Lyon and the France national team . He plays as an attacking midfielder and a winger and is known for his pace , technical ability , and tenacious style of play . He is described by his former coach at Libourne Saint @-@ Seurin Didier Tholot as " an explosive player who is capable of quickly taking two opponents out of the game to create space , above all due to his dribbling skills . " Due to his small stature , Valbuena is nicknamed le petit <unk> , which translates to " the small bike " . This is a play on Valbuena 's size and the fact that Marseille 's home ground is called the Stade Vélodrome . 
 Valbuena began his career at professional club Bordeaux . He was let go from the club after two seasons and subsequently joined amateur club Langon @-@ Castets in the fifth division of French football . In 2004 , Valbuena joined Libourne Saint @-@ Seurin in the Championnat National , the third level of French football . The midfielder had a good 2005 – 06 season with the club and signed with Ligue 1 club Marseille , prior to the 2006 – 07 season . With Marseille , Valbuena played in the UEFA Champions League for the first time and , in the 2009 – 10 season , was part of the team that won the league and league cup double , as well as the Trophée des champions . 
 Valbuena is a French international and made his debut with the team in May 2010 in a friendly match against Costa Rica . He scored his first international goal in the same match and was named to the team to participate in the 2010 FIFA World Cup as a result . Valbuena appeared in only one of the three matches France contested at the World Cup . In November 2010 , he scored his second career international goal against England at Wembley Stadium .

 Valbuena began his football career at hometown club ES Blanquefort . He developed an interest in the sport of football through his paternal heritage as he often attended matches at the Camp Nou in Barcelona during school holidays as a youth . At the age of nine , his football career was put on hold after he received over 50 stitches in one of his legs following a swimming accident . After the injury healed , Valbuena returned to football and quickly impressed club coaches . In 1998 , he was given a Best Player award at a local youth tournament played at the Camp des Loges , the training center of professional club Paris Saint @-@ Germain . In 2001 , Valbuena was recruited by professional club FC Girondins de Bordeaux . 
 Valbuena spent two years playing on the club 's under @-@ 18 team playing alongside the likes of Rio Mavuba and Marouane Chamakh . Valbuena appeared in only three matches with the reserve team before being released from the club after failing to impress Jean @-@ Louis Garcia , the reserve team manager . It has been commonly stated that Valbuena was let go by the club due to his small size ; however , former club player and trainer Philippe Lucas explained that Valbuena was let go because he struggled to " transform his game from that of a young player to that of a professional " and that " his game needed to be faster and he needed to avoid confrontations " . 
 = = = Amateur career = = = 
 After being let go by Bordeaux , Valbuena put his ambitions of becoming a professional player on hold , and was recommended by Garcia to play for amateur club Langan @-@ Castets in the Championnat de France amateur 2 , the fifth division of French football . Unlike at Bordeaux where he trained numerous times a week , Valbuena only trained three times a week with Langon @-@ Castets and , due to the club 's amateur status , worked as a sports shop salesman when he was not playing football . In his only season at the club , he impressed with his technical ability and was subsequently recruited by Championnat National club Libourne Saint @-@ Seurin who had scouted the player eight times while he was at Langon @-@ Castets . 
 While at Libourne Saint @-@ Seurin , Valbuena 's play went through an upgrade . In his first season at the club , he struggled for meaningful minutes under coach André <unk> , playing in 20 league matches and scoring two goals . <unk> was fired mid @-@ season and was replaced by Didier Tholot . The club ultimately finished the season in 13th place in the league . In the next season , manager Tholot took immediate notice of Valbuena . Tholot described Valbuena as " the architect of the team " and sought to build the team around him . As a result , Valbuena 's playing time improved dramatically . He played in 31 league matches and scored nine goals , all of which came in victories . Valbuena earned rave reviews for his performances , but still suffered criticism on occasion due to " wanting to do everything " as stated by Tholot . On 12 August 2005 , he scored his first goal of the season in a 2 – 0 win over Moulins . Two weeks later , Valbuena scored a double in a 3 – 1 victory away to Cherbourg . One low @-@ point during the season came on 9 September 2005 in Libourne 's 2 – 1 defeat to <unk> Ajaccio when Valbuena received his first @-@ ever red card . The loss was the team 's first of the season and Valbuena was suspended for three matches . Valbuena returned to the team on 7 October in a 1 – 0 loss to Bayonne . 
 In November 2005 , Valbuena returned to his early season form after scoring four goals over the course of three matches . He scored his first goal of the month on 5 November in a 2 – 1 win at home against Nîmes . Two weeks later , Valbuena scored against Angers in another win and , in the following week , scored both goals in a 2 – 0 win over Pau . As a result of his performances , Valbuena was linked to several clubs in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 , most notably Saint @-@ Étienne and Auxerre , in December . The midfielder , however , denied the approaches stating his desire to help Libourne achieve promotion to the second division . Valbuena went scoreless through the winter months , but remained a fixture in the starting eleven as the club remained in contention for promotion to Ligue 2 . On 29 April 2006 , with Libourne in a battle for the final promotion spot , Valbuena scored another double , this time against Toulon in another shutout victory . Libourne went unbeaten in its final four matches , which resulted in the club finishing in third place , thus achieving promotion to Ligue 2 for the first time in its history since the local clubs of Libourne and Saint @-@ Seurin agreed to merge in 1998 . For his efforts that season , Valbuena was named the league 's Player of the Year , which led to heightened interest from several professional clubs in Ligue 2 and Ligue 1 .

 On 9 June 2006 , Valbuena signed his first professional contract after agreeing to a transfer to Olympique de Marseille . He signed a three @-@ year deal with the club and was assigned the number 28 shirt by manager Eric Gerets . Valbuena made his professional debut for the club on 15 July 2006 in the team 's third round match against Ukrainian club Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup . He subsequently struggled to meet the demands of training and suffered an ankle injury in the pre @-@ season period , which resulted in the player missing the start of the 2006 – 07 season . Valbuena made his league debut on 19 November 2006 in a league match against Valenciennes appearing as a substitute in the team 's 1 – 0 victory . He appeared as a substitute for the majority of the season and even spent some time playing on the club 's reserve team in the fifth division . On 19 May 2007 , Valbuena scored his first professional goal in a 2 – 1 victory over Saint @-@ Étienne . The game @-@ winning goal allowed the club to maintain control of second place , which merited Marseille a spot in the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the 2003 – 04 season . 
 Following the departure of Franck Ribéry to German club Bayern Munich ahead of the 2007 – 08 season , Valbuena was inserted as his replacement . It is during this season the midfielder acquired the nickname le petit <unk> ( the small bike ) , which is a play on Valbuena 's size and his parent club 's stadium , the Stade Vélodrome . Valbuena started the season off healthy under Gerets and featured primarily as a substitute , but by late August 2007 , had become a starter forming partnerships in the midfield with Samir Nasri , Lorik Cana , and Benoît Cheyrou . Valbuena made his UEFA Champions League debut on 18 September 2007 against Turkish club Beşiktaş appearing as a substitute in a 2 – 0 win . In the team 's next group stage match against English club Liverpool at Anfield , Valbuena scored the only goal in a 1 – 0 victory . The victory over Liverpool was the first time a French club had ever won at Anfield . Later that month , Valbuena signed a contract extension with Marseille , committing himself to the club until June 2012 . 
 In the league , Valbuena appeared in 29 matches and scored three goals . The first two goals came in the club 's 6 – 1 win over Caen on 26 January 2008 . The first goal Valbuena scored in the match was voted the Goal of the Year by the Ligue de Football Professionnel and was scored from almost 40 metres ( 44 yd ) out . On 9 March , Valbuena , for the second straight season , scored the game @-@ winning goal in a win over Saint @-@ Étienne . Due to his promising performances , Marseille awarded him another contract extension in April 2008 , which added an extra year to his contract . 
 In the 2008 – 09 season , Valbuena became a regular starter and appeared in 31 league matches . He scored three goals ; two in victories over Auxerre and Le Havre and one in a loss to Paris Saint @-@ Germain . After the season , Gerets , an admirer of Valbuena , was let go and Didier Deschamps was named as his replacement . In June 2009 , Deschamps declared that Valbuena was not in his tactical plans and sought to place the midfielder on the transfer market . Club president Pape Diouf and several members of the board disagreed with Deschamps sentiments stating that Valbuena was " un @-@ transferable " . The indecision over Valbuena 's future resulted in the player being linked to English clubs Aston Villa , Arsenal , and Liverpool . Valbuena 's future was ultimately settled following the closure of the transfer window when he wasn 't sold . As a result , he was relegated to the bench for the first half of the season under Deschamps and the tumultuous relationship reached its zenith in December when the two had a face @-@ to @-@ face meeting , which resulted in Valbuena declaring he wanted to leave the club in the January 2010 transfer window to find regular football . 
 On 17 October , Valbuena scored his first goal in his first league start of the season away to Nancy . In February 2010 , Valbuena returned to the starting lineup and remained a starter for the rest of the season . He was an important part of the team that won the league and league cup double . In the Coupe de la Ligue , Valbuena scored the game @-@ winning goal in the semi @-@ finals against Lille . In the final , he scored the second goal in a 3 – 1 victory over his former club Bordeaux . The Coupe de la Ligue title was Marseille 's first major honour since winning the UEFA Champions League in 1993 . In April 2010 , Valbuena scored goals in three straight matches , all wins , against Nice , Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer , and Saint @-@ Étienne . The victories helped Marseille maintain its first @-@ place position and Valbuena was praised by Deschamps . Marseille ultimately won the league after defeating Rennes on 5 May 2010 .

 In the 2010 – 11 season , Valbuena was inserted as a starter by Deschamps for the start of the campaign despite the arrivals of wingers Loïc Rémy and André Ayew . Valbuena was also hampered by the constant media inquiries about what happened at the 2010 FIFA World Cup , on which he has refused to comment , stating " I was a neophyte in the France team , I will not allow myself to discuss the events " and that he was " trying to forget " the incident . Valbuena scored his first goal of the season on 12 September 2010 in a 2 – 2 draw with Monaco . On 23 November , he scored the opening goal in the team 's 3 – 0 win over Russian club FC Spartak Moscow in the Champions League . The victory resulted in Marseille qualifying for the knockout portion of the competition for the first time since 2000 . Four days later , Valbuena scored the third goal in the team 's 4 – 0 win over Montpellier . On 22 January , Valbuena suffered a medial ligament sprain in his left knee as a result of a tackle from Ayew during a training session . He was , initially , ruled out for up to six weeks , but returned to training ahead of the team 's Champions League match against English club Manchester United on 22 February . Valbuena made his return to the team in the second leg at Old Trafford appearing as a second @-@ half substitute . Marseille were defeated 2 – 1 away , which resulted in the club losing on aggregate by the same scoreline . 
 After appearing as a substitute in two consecutive league matches after returning from injury , Valbuena made his first start in a 2 – 1 win over Le Classique rivals Paris Saint @-@ Germain . On 23 April 2011 , he made his second consecutive start in the final of the Coupe de la Ligue . Marseille won the match defeating Montpellier 1 – 0 to claim its second straight league cup title . On 1 May , Valbuena scored the team 's lone goal in its 1 – 1 draw with Auxerre . He finished the campaign by appearing in the team 's final five matches as Marseille finished runner @-@ up to Lille in the league . 
 Valbuena got off to a quick start in the team 's 2011 – 12 campaign . He opened the campaign by assisting on a Loïc Rémy goal in the opening match of the season against Sochaux . The following week , he assisted on both goals in a 2 – 2 draw with Auxerre . On 28 August , Valbuena scored both of Marseille 's goal in a 3 – 2 defeat away to Lille . The following month , he manufactured another statistical output after assisting on both of Rémy 's goals in a 2 – 0 win over Evian . In the club 's Champions League campaign , Valbuena failed to chart statistically in the team 's first five group stage matches . On 6 December , in the team 's final group stage match against German club Borussia Dortmund , Valbuena scored the match @-@ winning goal after appearing as a substitute 14 minutes prior . The goal , described by UEFA as " an unstoppable shot " , allowed Marseille progression to the UEFA Champions League knockout phase . In the team 's final two December league matches prior to the winter break against Lorient and Nancy , Valbuena scored a goal and assisted on another in each match ; Marseille won both matches . He finished the fall season with nine assists , a tally that currently leads the league . 
 Following his departure to Dynamo Moscow , Olympique de Marseille honoured Valbuena by retiring his number 28 shirt on 5 August 2014 . 
 = = = Dynamo Moscow = = = 
 On 2 August 2014 , Valbuena signed a three @-@ year contract with Dynamo Moscow in a reported £ 6 million transfer .

 Valbuena did not receive any call @-@ ups to any of the France national youth football teams . However , following his impressive performances with Marseille , he was awarded a call up to the senior team by coach Raymond Domenech for the team 's matches against England and Mali in March 2008 . However , he picked up an injury and was forced to miss out . 
 Valbuena 's next call @-@ up was over two years later in May 2010 , when he was named to the 30 @-@ man preliminary list by Domenech to play in the 2010 FIFA World Cup . Valbuena 's call up was considered surprising by the media and the player himself , despite Valbuena playing well with his parent club who won the league and league cup double in the 2009 – 10 season . Many journalists in the French media compared Valbuena 's call @-@ up to the team with Franck Ribéry 's call @-@ up four years previously , as the two players share similarities in playing style and their circumstances at the time of their respective call @-@ ups . Valbuena was later named to the 23 @-@ man team to compete in the competition . He made his national team debut on 26 May 2010 in a friendly match against Costa Rica appearing as a substitute in the second half . After 16 minutes on the field , Valbuena scored the game @-@ winning goal in the team 's 2 – 1 victory . At the World Cup , Valbuena made his debut in the competition in the team 's 2 – 0 loss to Mexico appearing as a substitute on 17 June . It was his only appearance in the competition . During the competition , the players went on strike in protest over the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka from the team , which resulted in all 23 players on the team being suspended for its friendly match in August 2010 . 
 After missing the match against Norway due to new manager Laurent Blanc 's imposed suspension , Valbuena made his return to the team in a 1 – 0 defeat to Belarus in UEFA Euro 2012 qualification . The midfielder subsequently appeared in every match under Blanc in 2010 , excluding the match against Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 2010 . Valbuena capped his return to the national team by scoring against England in a friendly at Wembley Stadium on 17 November 2010 . 
 Valbuena was included in France 's UEFA Euro 2012 squad but did not make an appearance during the competition . Under new coach Didier Deschamps , Valbuena played in all ten of the team 's matches during 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification , scoring once against Georgia . 
 On 13 May 2014 , Valbuena was named in France 's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup .

 Valbuena is described by his former coach at Libourne Saint @-@ Seurin Didier Tholot as " an explosive player who is capable of quickly taking two opponents out of the game to create space , above all due to his dribbling skills . " He has been deployed as a wide midfielder or winger since his arrival to the Bordeaux training center in 2001 often playing on the right side of midfield in former Bordeaux manager Elie <unk> 's preferred 4 – 3 – 3 formation . After leaving Bordeaux , Valbuena was primarily deployed in the playmaker position as an attacking midfielder at Langon Castets and Libourne Saint @-@ Seurin . While at these clubs , he developed a penchant for attempting to do everything as stated by both his former club coaches Tholot and Jean @-@ Pierre <unk> , the latter being his manager at Langon Castets . 
 While at the amateur clubs , Valbuena also honed his quickness , technical ability , and developed his tenacious style of play which contributed to his positive work @-@ rate defensively . <unk> once stated that " he had never worked with such a young person so technically brilliant " in his coaching career .

 " Blood Ties " is the three @-@ episode sixth season premiere of the American police drama television series Homicide : Life on the Street . The episodes constitute the 78th , 79th and 80th overall episodes of the series . They originally aired on NBC on October 17 , October 24 and October 31 , 1997 , respectively . 
 The teleplays were written by Anya Epstein and David Simon , based on a story by Tom Fontana , Julie Martin and James Yoshimura . Directed by Alan Taylor , Nick Gomez and Mark Pellington , " Blood Ties " marked the first appearances of Peter Gerety , Jon Seda and Callie Thorne as regular cast members , replacing outgoing cast members Melissa Leo and Max Perlich . Guest appearances were made by James Earl Jones , Jeffrey Wright , Lynne Thigpen and Mekhi Phifer . 
 The three episodes were tied together by the story of a murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson , played by Jones . Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate the Wilson family out of respect for their success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore , which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within the police department . The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on racism and classism , even when they come from the best of intentions . 
 " Blood Ties " included several additional subplots , including murder attempts made against police officers in retaliation for the fatal police shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney in the fifth season . The second episode involves a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late @-@ season baseball game . In the third episode , police investigate the execution @-@ style slaying of a police informant . According to Nielsen ratings the first episode of " Blood Ties " was viewed by 7 @.@ 94 million households , the second by 6 @.@ 86 million households and the third by 6 @.@ 27 million households . The episodes received generally positive reviews .

 Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) and Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) return to the homicide unit after a rotation in robbery , only to find the highest murder clearance rate in five years . A delighted Gee ( Yaphet Kotto ) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty ( Peter Gerety ) and , particularly , Laura Ballard ( Callie Thorne ) . Lewis ( Clark Johnson ) asks Gee for a different partner , but dodges questions about problems with his old partner Kellerman ( Reed Diamond ) ; Gee assigns him to Falsone ( Jon Seda ) , one of the newer detectives , and Kellerman is partnered with Munch ( Richard Belzer ) . That evening , Gee attends a black @-@ tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson ( James Earl Jones ) , a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist . In that same hotel , a woman is found beaten to death in the men 's bathroom , and Pembleton and Bayliss are called to investigate . Felix and his wife Regina ( Lynne Thigpen ) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre , a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers . The Wilsons leave after only brief interviews , and Pembleton becomes agitated when Bayliss asks whether Pembleton went easy on them because of his respect for Wilson 's contributions to the African American community . 
 Meanwhile , a motorcyclist fires shots at the moving car of Lewis and Falsone ; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes . Almost immediately afterward , Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate the shooting death of a woman on a nearby street . At the scene they find Stivers ( Toni Lewis ) , who was speaking to the woman when she was shot ; police later conclude Stivers was the real target . While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel , somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm . Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives who were involved in the previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney . Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney 's death , which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis ; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly . 
 After questioning several of Mahoney 's former associates , drug supplier Wilkie Collins ( Robert F. Chew ) is pressured into telling Lewis and Falsone the shooter was Mahoney 's nephew , Junior Bunk ( Mekhi Phifer ) . They arrest Junior Bunk and find the matching gun , a Desert Eagle pistol prompting Bunk to admit he shot at the police to " send a message " from his mother , Georgia Rae Mahoney ( <unk> Goodman ) , over the death of her brother , Luther . Georgia is arrested trying to flee in a jet to the Cayman Islands , where she used to handle Luther 's drug money . Meanwhile , following Brierre 's autopsy , Cox ( Michelle Forbes ) finds somebody had consensual sex with the victim before her death . Pembleton and Bayliss learn from Felix Wilson 's daughter Thea ( Ellen Bethea ) that Brierre had a vicious and abusive ex @-@ boyfriend named Kaja . Pembleton and Gee declare Kaja the primary suspect , despite protests from Ballard that the lead is thin and that they have not properly questioned Felix Wilson . The episode ends with an imprisoned Georgia Rae Mahoney stating Kellerman will hear from her soon . 
 = = = Part two = = = 
 Two days after Brierre 's death , the detectives have made little progress on their lead about Kaja , the victim 's abusive ex @-@ boyfriend . Ballard and Gharty suggest they look more closely at Felix Wilson and his son , Hal ( Jeffrey Wright ) , because Brierre had sex before her death and knew few men socially besides them . Pembleton and Gee , who are both very respectful of Felix Wilson 's contributions to the African American community , dismiss the suggestion ; Gee refuses to even ask the Wilsons to submit a blood and hair sample . The next day 's Baltimore Sun runs a story about the investigation into Kaja , which Pembleton believes was leaked to the press by Gee in order to distance the Wilsons from the crime . Ballard and Gharty question Hal , who denies having sex with Brierre after tough questions from Gharty . After the interview , Gharty tells Ballard that Pembleton and Gee are obstructing the investigation to protect a rich and respected black family . 
 During their investigation , Pembleton and Bayliss learn Kaja has been in a Haitian prison for four months , eliminating him as a lead . Gee announces the Baltimore Sun is running a story that Kaja has been cleared as a suspect , leaked from the police . Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story , while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going easy on Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man . The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides . Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him . When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs a blood test from him and his son , Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the night of the murder , but said he does not kill her . Later , a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated as a suspect , much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty . The detectives are interrupted by Wilson 's attorney , who says the family will not submit to a blood and hair test without a court order . 
 Meanwhile , Munch and Kellerman investigate a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late @-@ season baseball game , leaving 48 @,@ 000 possible suspects . The Long Island man , presumably a Yankees fan , is found beaten to death on the stairs of the stadium , and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized . After several fruitless interviews , Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell ( Brian <unk> ) , a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim . Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees . He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch the rest of the game . Back at the police department , Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting . Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman 's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning . 
 = = = Part three = = = 
 The Baltimore Sun runs a front @-@ page story accusing the homicide unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race . Under pressure form his superiors , Gee demands they solve the murder immediately . Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary ( Ami Brabson ) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson get in the way of the investigation ; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation . After searching the Wilson house , the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre . Pembleton questions Felix and Hal , who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court . Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters , which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre . Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known , which Hal said he does not believe . Felix demands the truth from Hal , who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father . 
 When Pembleton begins to read Hal his rights , Felix stops him and refuses to let him arrest his son . Later , prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers ( Željko Ivanek ) says because the confession is inadmissible , they have no evidence to arrest Hal , and he refuses to issue an arrest warrant against a member of a prominent family without a solid case . The Wilsons decide to move to San Diego , and Felix tells Pembleton he will do everything he can to continue protecting his son . Pembleton and Ballard make a reluctant peace and , although Pembleton remains cold with her , he admits he was wrong about the Wilsons and that Ballard 's instincts about the case were correct . Gee tells Pembleton he too let his personal feelings cloud his judgment , and the two agree they will bring Hal back to Baltimore when they get enough evidence against him . 
 Meanwhile , Lewis and Falsone investigate the execution @-@ style shootings of Wilkie Collins and his wife , presumably in retaliation for Collins cooperating with police in the investigation and incarceration of Georgia Rae Mahoney , Luther 's sister . They find Collins ' young son Jack ( Marc John Jefferies ) hiding in a closet at the house , but he is too terrified to answer any of their questions . Falsone takes the Jack to a park , where they bond over their mutual love of cars , and Falsone teaches him how to <unk> a vehicle . More comfortable with the police , Jack tells Falsone that a man identifying himself as Robert on Collins ' answering machine has the same voice as the killer . A disturbed Stivers recognizes the voice as belonging to Detective Robert Castleman ( Lance Lewman ) . After Jack identifies Castleman in a lineup , Lewis and Falsone confront him with the evidence during questioning , pressuring Castleman to confess to the murder . Castleman said Georgia Rae Mahoney blackmailed him into killing Collins by threatening to reveal Castleman had been on Luther Mahoney 's payroll .

 The story from " Blood Ties " was conceived by executive director Tom Fontana , and supervising producers James Yoshimura and Julie Martin . The first and third episode teleplays were written by producer Anya Epstein , with the second penned by producer David Simon . The three episodes were each directed by Alan Taylor , Nick Gomez and Mark Pellington , respectively . " Blood Ties " originally premiered in October 1997 , about one month later than originally planned , which angered fans of the show . The delay is indicated by the regular @-@ season baseball game prominently featured in the second episode of the arc , despite the fact that the 1997 Baltimore Orioles season ended in September . 
 " Blood Ties " featured the first appearances of Peter Gerety , Jon Seda and Callie Thorne as regular cast members on Homicide : Life on the Street . Thorne portrayed Laura Ballard , a former Seattle homicide unit detective , marking the character 's first appearance in the series . Gerety and Seda each previously played their respective characters in guest appearances on the show ; Seda 's character Paul Falsone first appeared in the two @-@ part fifth @-@ season finale . Stuart Gharty , Gerety 's character , is described as a transplant from the department 's internal affairs department . Executive producer Tom Fontana said he thought the new cast additions would create drama and tension between the characters : " It 's stimulating to add new people , because you 're not feeling like you 're writing or acting the same scene for the thousandth time , and I think all three of them are very different than any other characters we 've had on the show . " 
 During her audition for the show , Thorne read the lines from the Pembleton character in a previous episode . She said of her audition , " I said , ' So what do you want me to do ? Do you want me to be a female Pembleton ? ' And they were like , ' Well we don 't want to say that but that 's sort of the idea . " Thorne said the producers were looking for " a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men " and that they incorporated elements of Thorne 's own personality into the character , such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts . Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast , but upon starting , " I was very aware of the fact that it 's predominantly men , and I have no problem saying that as a small , dark woman I was terrified . I thought I was going to be put through the ringer . " Gerety , when asked about his experience joining the show , said only , " It 's interesting . It 's really interesting . " 
 The new regular characters replaced outgoing cast members Melissa Leo and Max Perlich , who did not return for the sixth season . In the episode , Leo 's character Kay Howard was said to be working full @-@ time with the department 's fugitive unit ; actress Leo reportedly left the show so she could devote more time to her family . Perlich was allegedly fired from the series , and within the episode his character J. H. Brodie was said to have left police work after a documentary he filmed was aired on PBS and won an Emmy Award . Commentators said the Emmy mention , and a joke by Munch that " they give those things to anybody " , were references to the show 's failure to secure a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series during its first five seasons . Armando Benítez and Scott Erickson , then pitchers with the Baltimore Orioles , make cameo appearances as themselves in the second " Blood Ties " episode . 
 The Wilson murder is a " red ball " , a police case involving an innocent victim , widely known suspects or a combination of the two . Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media , the public and high @-@ ranking police brass , and often result in additional detectives being added to the case . Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives . Julie Martin , one of the show 's writers and supervising producers , said " Blood Ties " marked a deliberate change in the series , focusing on darker story lines that are " a little messier and unresolved " and more interpersonal relationships : " The show 's been on for six seasons , and it absolutely has to change . We can 't keep doing the same show . " Media outlets noted that " Blood Ties " included more action @-@ oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport . Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him : " I don 't want us to have a style every week that we feel we have to conform to . ... I want people not to know what to expect when they tune in every week . We 're not formulaic . " 
 The New York Yankees baseball team refused to give Homicide : Life on the Street permission to use the Yankees logo in the episode , which Fontana said angered the writers and inspired them to portray Yankees fans in a particularly negative light . Fontana , a New York native himself , was later apologetic about this portrayal and said , " I kept telling the guys they were being a little harsh on the Yankees " . The names " Stringfield " and " Doherty " can be seen under Ballard 's case list on the white board . The names were purposely inserted as an inside joke to Homicide fans as a reference to online rumors that cast member Melissa Leo was to be replaced by actors Shannon Doherty or Sherry Stringfield . The false rumors were actually leaked by Tom Fontana himself to keep fans guessing . 
 " Blood Ties " and the rest of the sixth season episodes were included in the six @-@ DVD box @-@ set Homicide : Life on the Street : The Complete Season 6 , which was released by A & E Home Video on January 25 , 2005 for $ 99 @.@ 95 . 
 = = Themes = = 
 In portraying black members of the police department ignoring legitimate evidence to protect a prominent member of Baltimore 's African American community , " Blood Ties " touches simultaneously on themes of police misconduct and racism , however inadvertent , from the characters of Pembleton and Gee . Because the episode involves discrimination among black characters , " Blood Ties " has been described as an example of " reverse racism " , even though the majority of Baltimore 's population is black . The episode also includes elements of classism , since Pembleton and Gee treat Felix Wilson differently than they would another black suspect based on his financial success and charitable contributions to the city and African American community . 
 Most of these themes are most overtly addressed during a climatic argument between Pembleton , Ballard and Gharty in the " Blood Ties " arc 's second episode . When Ballard and Gharty suggest questioning Felix and Hal Wilson because the murder victim had sex the night she was killed , Pembleton accuses them of reverting to old stereotypes about black male sexuality , namely " that black men can 't control themselves when it comes to blue shoes and tight pants " . When Gharty describes Baltimore as a black @-@ run town that protects its own , Pembleton points out similar practices were carried out in Baltimore history by the Italian Americans and Irish Americans when they primarily controlled the city ; in particular , Pembleton says , " How many favors have been called in in the name of the Knights of Columbus or the St. Michael 's Society , huh ? " 
 Roger Wilkins , a history professor at George Mason University who studies race in the United States , said " Blood Ties " provided " insightful , wonderful explorations on the complexities of many levels of race . " He also said the show " really does understand how we 're all caught in this culture , and we 're all struggling with it . And we all bring to this jagged enterprise the limited understanding of where we came from and who we are . Being fully alive requires us to struggle with these realities . That 's what the show does . " In his journal article about the portrayal of African American men in Homicide : Life on the Street , documentary historian Thomas A. <unk> said the presentation of light @-@ skinned black villains like Luther Mahoney and dark @-@ skinned actors like the one played by James Earl Jones in " Blood Ties " , " dispels the notion that black skin color is uniform or determinative with regard to character " . Some media outlets described the Watson subplot as a racial spin on the 1996 murder of six @-@ year @-@ old child beauty pageant queen JonBenét Ramsey , although Tom Fontana said any similarities were not intended .

 " Blood Ties " received generally positive reviews . Baltimore Sun television critic David Zurawik described it as " one of the most serious , frank and compelling discussions of race in any medium " since an episode of NYPD Blue from 1995 , in which actor Dennis Franz used the word " nigger " . Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press described " Blood Ties " as " explosive ( and ) riveting " , and wrote , " The smart , darkly humorous writing on Homicide is as strong as ever . So are the performances of a superb ensemble of actors . " R.D. Heldenfels of the Akron Beacon Journal praised the episodes and called them " a complicated rumination on race and class " . David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode had an unpredictability that helped maintain the show 's vitality , and said of the first two episodes , " Except for one moment in tonight 's opener , I was on the edge of my seat for the entire two hours ; at that moment , a surprise shooting shocked me right onto my feet . " Newsday writer Verne Gay described " Blood Ties " as " brilliant drama " and " a superb piece of work ( that ) appears to be a novel variation on reverse discrimination " . Regarding the first of the three episodes , Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark said Seda and Thorne had " solid first impressions " and that the episode arc " has all the makings of another killer story line " . Virginia Rohan of The Record of Bergen County , New Jersey , called the episode " gripping " and " another strong start for a terrific series " . 
 Tony Norman of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette praised the episode , which he said " has wandered into the heart of Dostoyevsky territory with its storylines " . He particularly praised the episode for going outside its normal conventions by portraying lead characters like Pembleton and Gee as being so reluctant to do the right thing . Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News gave the episode four out of five stars ; he particularly praised the performances of Thorne and Gerety , and said the show did an impressive job of introducing the new cast members . Michael Storey of Arkansas Democrat @-@ Gazette said " Blood Ties " lived up to the high standards he said the show had set for itself . Ron Miller of Fort Worth Star @-@ Telegram praised " Blood Ties " , although he said he does not always enjoy Homicide : Life on the Street . He said the episode " starts fast and gets better and more intense by the minute " , and described the climactic argument in the second episode as " the most turbulent internal dispute we 've ever seen among the detectives " . Rocky Mountain News writer Dusty Saunders praised the main story @-@ line and said the subplots were well juxtaposed into the episode . He also said " Blood Ties " could serve as a good introduction to the series for new viewers . Alan Sepinwall , television critic for The Star @-@ Ledger , criticized the addition of " silly " action @-@ oriented scenes the traditionally more intelligent show , but praised " Blood Ties " and the addition of the new cast members . Sepinwall particularly praised the acting of Andre Braugher : " Pitted against a powerhouse like James Earl Jones , he not only holds his own , but at times is so dramatically forceful that the former voice of Darth Vader sounds intimidated . " Not all reviews of " Blood Ties " were positive . Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post said the series benefited from the new characters , but that the episode " asks viewers to believe rather too strongly in the inherent racism of certain characters we 've come to know as heroes in seasons past " . Ostrow also thought Pembleton 's clashes with the new detectives was predictable .

According to Lee , the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images . It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith , due to the band 's denial of being a Christian band . During an interview , Lee explained : " My little sister was really getting into these , I don 't want to offend anyone , but like really fake , cheesy , slutty female cracker @-@ box idols , and it really pissed me off . She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old . So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song . " She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding , " At this point , everybody knows that Britney is fake . The song is not about Britney Spears ; it 's about a lot of people in this industry . It 's so fake , the whole Hollywood thing . ' Look at how perfect I am ! ' Nobody looks like that . It 's all fake and it 's really hurting a lot of girls ' and women 's self images . Where are all the normal people ? " .

" However , the release of " Imaginary " was scrapped and " Everybody 's Fool " was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4 , 2004 , while a maxi single was released on April 28 , 2004 .

 Johnny Loftus of Allmusic classified " Everybody 's Fool " as a nu metal song . Adrien Begrand of PopMatters concluded that the song " take [ s ] things to a more over @-@ the @-@ top , theatrical level . " Scott Juba of The Trades rated the song with A , and wrote : " As far as the band 's single , ' Everybody 's Fool ' , is concerned , it is a song about the stinging betrayal of deception and the refusal to become blinded by deceit any longer . There is a defiance in Lee 's voice that gives the track a bold edge , and the song 's heavy drums and soaring guitars further enhance the strong sound . The band surely has another chart topping hit on their hands . " Simon <unk> of ABC Online gave the song 3 out of 5 stars calling it " a cold , sad and angry song that I would only like to listen to without it being repeated again . " Joe D 'Angelo of MTV News wrote that " rolling acoustic guitar and billowing synthesizers pave the way for the harsh power chords that open the song " adding that Lee 's voice was " disembodied " in the opening lines " Perfect by nature / Icons of self @-@ indulgence / Just what we all need / More lies about a world that / Never was and never will be . " 
 The song peaked at number 36 on Billboard 's Alternative Songs chart on May 8 , 2004 .

 The accompanying music video for " Everybody 's Fool " was directed by Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles , California in mid @-@ April 2004 . Talking about the filming and the development of the video , Lee said : " There 's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up . It 's the slow @-@ mo scene where I take off the helmet and <unk> my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me . It 's so hilarious , it 's ridiculous . [ ... ] It 's a really different thing for us to do because it 's not performance at all . Everybody was laughing at me the whole time . I was just like , ' Please don 't laugh at me . Just give me five minutes so I can do this . ' " Lee added that the message of the video is in the name of the products her character is advertising , each of which are called " Lies " because according to her " [ ... the ] whole life is a lie . Every smile , that 's a lie . " 
 Lee conceptualized the video around the lyrics to the song : " It 's kind of about exposing that it 's fake . And the video 's more along the lines of exposing the real behind @-@ the @-@ scenes [ lives ] of some of these people . It 's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed , selfish misery behind it . [ ... ] It 's like beating a dead horse at this point , but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out . But I still think it 's relevant . " Joe D 'Angelo of MTV News wrote that " fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before . Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb , the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager , a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon . " Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called " Lies " . The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee 's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle . 
 Before the music begins , Lee appears with blond hair , a baby @-@ blue blouse and a long white skirt and emerges from the kitchen holding a fresh @-@ from @-@ the @-@ oven frozen pizza , in a TV commercial . She presents the pizza to her family and , as the camera zooms in for a close @-@ up , the brand name on the pizza box is visible and it is called Lies . " There is nothing better than a good lie , " Lee says cheerily , through a smile . Scenes of Lee in her hotel room follow as she removes her makeup . Those scenes are followed by Lee with " luxurious auburn tresses and dangling diamond earrings " as she plays a glamorous spokesmodel who violently scribbles and scratches out her picture in magazines after the photo shoot has finished . She also portrays a motorcycle girl in a commercial who drinks a soft drink called " Lies " that affords its drinker the opportunity to " Be somebody . " 
 In a Japanese commercial , she plays a Barbie @-@ like doll with pink hair . Each scene ends with Lee crying . During the bridge , two girls in an elevator are seen laughing at the model 's appearance , stating that she looks much older than they thought she was . Next scene , she is shown in a bathtub singing the song to herself . Another segment shows her breaking a mirror with her bare hand , which starts to bleed uncontrollably .

 = Hurricane Emily ( 1987 ) = 
 Hurricane Emily was the only major hurricane to develop during the below @-@ average 1987 Atlantic hurricane season . Forming out of a tropical disturbance that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 20 , the storm quickly attained hurricane status before undergoing rapid intensification . On September 22 , the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 958 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 29 inHg ) . The storm weakened slightly to Category 2 status before making landfall in the Dominican Republic . After weakening to a tropical storm , Emily rapidly tracked northeastward through the Atlantic Ocean , undergoing a second phase of rapid intensification before passing directly over Bermuda on September 25 . The following day the final public advisory from the National Hurricane Center was issued on the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . 
 Hurricane Emily brought heavy rains and strong winds in the Windward Islands on September 21 , leaving numerous homes damaged and severe losses in the banana industry . Losses throughout the islands amounted to $ 291 @,@ 000 . In the Dominican Republic , despite the storm 's high intensity , relatively moderate damage occurred . Three people were killed by the storm and damages amounted to $ 30 million . Unexpected intensification of the storm led to severe impact in Bermuda . The storm caused $ 50 million in damages and injured 16 people . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Emily originated out of a tropical disturbance , associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) , that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 13 . Tracking westward at a low latitude , the system fluctuated in organization , with the development and weakening of deep convection and weak outflow for several days . By September 18 , the disturbance entered a region where there was sinking air , an inhibiting factor of tropical cyclone development . Two days later , the system separated from the ITCZ and quickly developed into a tropical depression , the twelfth of the season , while located about 605 miles ( 975 kilometers ) southeast of Barbados . 
 Gradual intensification took place throughout September 20 , attaining the status of tropical storm by 1800 UTC and received the name Emily . The storm tracked in a general west @-@ northwest direction around the edge of a strong subtropical ridge . By 1200 UTC on September 21 , the center of Emily passed directly over St. Vincent with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Situated underneath an anticyclone , rapid intensification took place as the storm quickly tracked towards Hispaniola . In the 24 @-@ hour span between 1800 UTC on September 21 and 1800 UTC on September 22 , the central barometric pressure of the storm dropped 44 mbar ( hPa ) to 958 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 29 inHg ) and winds increased to 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) , equivalent to a high @-@ end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . At the time of peak intensity , the hurricane hunters recorded flight @-@ level winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) and unofficial pressure of 949 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 02 inHg ) . 
 Slight weakening took place late on September 22 and early on September 23 as the hurricane neared landfall . Around 0300 UTC , the eye of Emily tracked onshore between Barahona and Bani , Dominican Republic as a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . Within 12 hours of landfall , the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and had emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Haiti with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . The storm significantly slowed while tracking through the eastern Bahamas as a quasi @-@ stationary frontal system influenced Emily . Moving generally towards the north , the center of circulation passed very close to Inagua and Mayaguana on September 24 . 
 By midday on September 24 , the system became embedded within the mid @-@ latitude westerlies and rapidly accelerated towards the northeast . The National Hurricane Center anticipated that Emily would undergo an extratropical transition within 24 hours at this point as they forecast it to merge with the frontal system to the northeast . However , the storm unexpectedly underwent a second phase of rapid intensification on September 25 , at one point reaching the rate of explosive intensification with the central pressure decreasing at 2 @.@ 5 mbar per hour . By 0600 UTC , Emily had re @-@ attained hurricane intensity and at 1145 UTC , the center passed directly over Bermuda with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Soon after , the storm reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 974 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 76 inHg ) . 
 Hurricane Emily continued tracking northeast throughout September 25 into the following day with increasing speed . By late on September 25 , the forward motion of the storm had reached 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . The storm now began to undergo an extratropical transition with forward speed peaking at 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , the third highest forward motion ever recorded in a tropical cyclone . Interacting with a baroclinic zone , the hurricane completed its transition at 1800 UTC on September 26 , resulting in the issuance of the final advisory on the storm . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 As Tropical Storm Emily quickly approached the Windward Islands on September 21 , a tropical storm warning was issued for Grenada , Barbados , St. Vincent and St. Lucia . A tropical storm watch was also declared for Martinique . As the storm tracked through the islands , all watches and warnings were discontinued later that day . Early on September 22 , a hurricane warning was issued for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic and southern Haiti , including the southwestern peninsula . Upon attaining major hurricane status , a hurricane warning was declared for northern Haiti as the storm was anticipated to maintain hurricane intensity through landfall . Later that day , a hurricane watch was issued for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands . This watch was later upgraded to a warning as the storm was expected to regain intensity over the Bahamas . 
 Following the anticipation of a more westerly track on September 23 , a hurricane watch was issued for the northwestern Bahamas , later superseded by a warning , and a hurricane warning was declared for eastern Cuba . Early on September 24 , all watches and warnings for the Caribbean Islands , including the Bahamas , were discontinued as Emily moved out over the Atlantic Ocean . On September 25 , a special advisory was issued for Bermuda as tropical storm @-@ force winds were likely to impact the island . Following the unexpected intensification , another special advisory was issued stating that hurricane @-@ force winds would impact the island during the day on September 25 . This advisory was discontinued following the storms ' passage later that day . 
 Throughout the Windward Islands , schools and businesses were closed ahead of the storm . In the Dominican Republic , roughly 6 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from Santo Domingo ahead of the storm . Although the storm never tracked towards Florida , state officials advised residents to prepare for the storm . Officials were in the " awareness stage " of hurricane preparation as they were discussing the possibility of impact from Emily . In the Turks and Caicos , residents were evacuated from low @-@ lying areas to shelters throughout the islands . 
 On September 25 , the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued its first information bulletin ever related to a tropical cyclone as Emily was moving into Canadian offshore waters . The agency was created less than a month earlier , and warned for the potential of heavy rainfall and strong winds in the ocean southeast of Newfoundland . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 Tracking through the Lesser Antilles as a tropical storm , Emily brought heavy rains to several islands . In Barbados , high winds caused widespread roof damage and downed trees and power lines ; losses on the island reached $ 100 @,@ 000 . On St. Vincent , the banana industry sustained severe losses , with roughly 70 % of the crop destroyed . Schools throughout the island were closed prior and during the storm . Up to of 3 in ( 76 mm ) of rain fell within six hours on the island , causing flooding that forced eight families to evacuate their homes . Damage on the island amounted to $ 191 @,@ 000 , mainly from landslides . The outer bands of Emily produced moderate rainfall across portions of southwest Puerto Rico , peaking at 4 @.@ 63 in ( 118 mm ) . 
 In the Dominican Republic , Emily 's heavy rains caused widespread mudslides , killing two people . Another person was killed after stepping on a downed power line . An estimated 5 @,@ 000 people were left homeless in the aftermath of the storm . Upwards of 4 @.@ 59 in ( 117 mm ) of rain fell during the storm in the Dominican Republic . The farming industry was impacted particularly hard , with $ 30 million in losses occurring . Following the storm , hundreds of volunteers in the Dominican Republic assisted evacuees in shelters and helped officials clean up the affected areas . The Red Cross was also deployed to the region to assist those left homeless by the storm . In all , Emily caused $ 80 @.@ 3 million in damage and killed three people . 
 Although Emily passed over Haiti , it produced little damage and no loss of life . The lack of fatalities was linked to the amount of forest remaining over the mountains of the country , estimated at 25 % of their original size , compared to the 1 @.@ 4 % remaining in 2004 . In the Bahamas , Emily produced winds up to 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) along with rainfall up to 1 @.@ 35 in ( 34 mm ) . 
 Since the storm was not expected to be strong when it passed Bermuda , islanders were caught off guard by the 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) winds . Cars and boats were affected the most , though some houses experienced severe damage during the storm 's passage as well . Hurricane Emily caused $ 50 million in damage to the island , though no one was killed . About 230 buildings lost their roofs and 16 people were injured due to winds gusting in excess of 112 mph ( 180 km / h ) . The local airport was shut down as a large portion of its roof was blown off during the storm . Several cars and boats were flipped by the storm and a cruise ship carrying 700 people slipped from its moorings . Before the storm 's landfall , officials in Bermuda cut power to roughly 90 % of the island to protect the power grid . There were also unconfirmed reports of tornadoes associated with the storm .

 Leelah Alcorn ( November 15 , 1997 – December 28 , 2014 ) was an American transgender girl whose suicide attracted international attention . Alcorn had posted a suicide note to her Tumblr blog , writing about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination , abuse and lack of support for transgender people . 
 Assigned male at birth and given the name Joshua Ryan Alcorn , she was raised in a conservative Christian household in Ohio . At age 14 , she came out as transgender to her parents , Carla and Doug Alcorn , who refused to accept her female gender identity . When she was 16 , they denied her request to undergo transition treatment , instead sending her to Christian @-@ based conversion therapy with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth . After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates , her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media . In her suicide note , Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings . She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the Interstate 71 highway . 
 Alcorn arranged for her suicide note to be posted online several hours after her death , and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media . LGBT rights activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth , while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom . Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of " Leelah 's Law " , a ban on conversion therapy in the U.S. , which received a supportive response from U.S. President Barack Obama . Within a year , the city of Cincinnati had criminalised conversion therapy . Alcorn 's parents were criticized for <unk> Leelah in comments that they made to the media , while LGBT rights activist Dan Savage blamed them for their child 's death and social media users subjected them to online harassment . They defended their refusal to accept their child 's identity and their use of conversion therapy by reference to their Christian beliefs .

 Assigned male at birth , Alcorn was given the name Joshua Ryan Alcorn . She eventually rejected this forename , and in her suicide note signed herself " ( Leelah ) Josh Alcorn " . She was one of several children . Describing herself as being raised in a conservative Christian environment , she and her family attended the Northeast Church of Christ in Cincinnati , and had been featured in a profile of that church published in a 2011 article in The Christian Chronicle . 
 According to her suicide note , Alcorn had felt " like a girl trapped in a boy 's body " since she was four , and came to identify as a transgender girl from the age of fourteen , when she became aware of the term . According to her note , she immediately informed her mother , who reacted " extremely negatively " by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male , so she could never be a woman . She stated that this made her hate herself , and that she developed a form of depression . Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists , but there " only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help . " Aged sixteen , she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment , but was denied permission : " I felt hopeless , that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life . On my 16th birthday , when I didn 't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning , I cried myself to sleep . " 
 Alcorn publicly revealed her attraction to males when she was sixteen , as she believed that identifying as a gay male at that point would be a stepping stone to coming out as transgender at a later date . According to a childhood friend , Alcorn received a positive reception from many at school , although her parents were appalled . In Alcorn 's words , " They felt like I was attacking their image , and that I was an embarrassment to them . They wanted me to be their perfect little straight Christian boy , and that 's obviously not what I wanted . " They removed her from Kings High School , and enrolled her as an eleventh grader at an online school , Ohio Virtual Academy . According to Alcorn , her parents cut her off from the outside world for five months as they denied her access to social media and many forms of communication . She described this as a significant contributing factor towards her suicide . At the end of the school year , they returned her phone to her and allowed her to regain contact with her friends , although by this time – according to Alcorn – her relationship with many of them had become strained and she continued to feel isolated . 
 Two months prior to her death , Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit , asking users whether the treatment perpetrated by her parents was considered child abuse . There , she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her , " they always talked to me in a very derogatory tone " and " would say things like ' You 'll never be a real girl ' or ' What 're you going to do , fuck boys ? ' or ' God 's going to send you straight to hell ' . These all made me feel awful about myself , I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn 't deserve to be alive . " Further , she explained , " I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male , but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents . " On Reddit , Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti @-@ depressant Prozac . In concluding her post , she wrote , " Please help me , I don 't know what I should do and I can 't take much more of this . " 
 Alcorn 's computer was recovered near the site of her suicide . It contained conversations showing that she had planned to jump off the bridge that overlooks Interstate 71 days before the incident , but then contacted a crisis hotline and , as told to a friend , " basically cried my eyes out for a couple of hours talking to a lady there " .

 Prior to her death on December 28 , 2014 , Alcorn had scheduled for her suicide note to be automatically posted on her Tumblr account at <unk> In the note , she stated her intention to end her life , commenting : 
 I have decided I 've had enough . I 'm never going to transition successfully , even when I move out . I 'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound . I 'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me . I 'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me . I 'm never going to find a man who loves me . I 'm never going to be happy . Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself . There 's no winning . There 's no way out . I 'm sad enough already , I don 't need my life to get any worse . People say " it gets better " but that isn 't true in my case . It gets worse . Each day I get worse . That 's the gist of it , that 's why I feel like killing myself . Sorry if that 's not a good enough reason for you , it 's good enough for me . 
 She expressed her wish that all of her possessions and money be donated to a transgender advocacy charity , and called for issues surrounding gender identity to be taught in schools . The note ended with the statement : " My death needs to mean something . My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year . I want someone to look at that number and say " that 's fucked up " and fix it . Fix society . Please . " A second post appeared shortly after ; titled " Sorry " , it featured an apology to her close friends and siblings for the trauma that her suicide would put them through , but also contained a message to her parents : " Fuck you . You can 't just control other people like that . That 's messed up . " An additional , handwritten suicide note reading " I 've had enough " was found on her bed , but then thrown away by Alcorn 's mother after police made a copy . 
 In the early morning of December 28 , police informed news sources that she had been walking southbound on Interstate 71 near Union Township when she was struck by a semi @-@ trailer just before 2 : 30 am near the South Lebanon exit . She died at the scene . It is believed that Alcorn walked three to four miles from her parents ' house in nearby Kings Mills , Ohio , before being struck . The highway was closed for more than an hour after the incident . An investigation was launched by the Ohio State Highway Patrol , while Alcorn 's body was transported to the Montgomery County coroner , where an autopsy was scheduled . The truck driver was uninjured in the incident and was not charged with any criminal offence by police . 
 Within 48 hours of the posting of her suicide note , it had attracted 82 @,@ 272 views , and by the morning of December 31 it had been reposted on Tumblr 200 @,@ 000 times . The Boston Globe described it as a " passionate post " . The suicide note was later deleted after Alcorn 's parents asked for it to be removed , and the blog was made inaccessible to the public . According to the family minister , the Alcorn family decided to hold the funeral privately after receiving threats . Alcorn 's body was reportedly cremated . The Ohio State Patrol completed their investigation into Alcorn 's death on April 30 , 2015 , officially ruling it a suicide .

 On December 28 at 2 : 56 p.m. , Alcorn 's mother , Carla Wood Alcorn , posted a public message on the social media website Facebook , stating : " My sweet 16 @-@ year @-@ old son , Joshua Ryan Alcorn , went home to Heaven this morning . He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck . Thank you for the messages and kindness and concern you have sent our way . Please continue to keep us in your prayers . " Carla Alcorn 's post was subsequently deleted , and her Facebook account was made private . The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the Kings Local School District . In that statement , staff from Alcorn 's former school , Kings High School , declared that " Joshua Alcorn was a sweet , talented , tender @-@ hearted 17 @-@ year @-@ old " , adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident . A moment of silence was held in Alcorn 's memory before a Kings High basketball game on December 30 . 
 Some of Alcorn 's sympathizers publicly criticized the teen 's mother , Carla Alcorn , for <unk> her daughter in the Facebook post announcing Leelah 's death . Some individuals — termed " the Internet 's self @-@ appointed vigilantes " in The Washington Post — subsequently <unk> and harassed Carla via her Facebook account " in revenge " for Leelah 's death . On Twitter , American gay rights activist Dan Savage argued that Alcorn 's parents should be prosecuted for their role in bringing about their daughter 's death , commenting that through their actions they " threw her in front of that truck " . He cited the successful prosecution of <unk> Ravi following the suicide of Tyler Clementi as a legal precedent for such an action . He added that legal action should also be brought against the conversion therapists who had counselled Leelah , and suggested that the <unk> should lose custody of their other children . 
 Carla Alcorn responded to such criticism in an interview with CNN , stating " we loved him unconditionally . We loved him no matter what . I loved my son . People need to know that I loved him . He was a good kid , a good boy . " Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery , Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name " Leelah " , before reiterating her refusal to accept her child 's transgender status , adding " We don 't support that , religiously . " She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a " horrible person " , but defended her actions in dealing with her child , stating that she had banned Leelah 's internet access to prevent her accessing " inappropriate " things . In an email to Cincinnati @-@ based channel <unk> @-@ TV , Leelah 's father Doug Alcorn wrote , " We love our son , Joshua , very much and are devastated by his death . We have no desire to enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him . We wish to grieve in private . We harbor no ill will towards anyone ... I simply do not wish our words to be used against us . " 
 Writing for Salon , Mary Elizabeth Williams commented that " it would be cruel and inaccurate to suggest that Carla Alcorn did not love her child " , but added that Carla 's statement that she " loved him unconditionally " revealed " a tragic lack of understanding of the word ' unconditionally , ' even in death . " People magazine quoted Johanna Olson , Medical Director for the Center of Trans Youth Health and Development at Children 's Hospital Los Angeles , as stating that " Did Leelah 's parents love her ? Yes , I 'm sure they did . Did they support her ? No , they didn 't . And that 's a tragedy . " Mara <unk> , the Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality , was quoted in The Independent as stating that the blaming of Alcorn 's parents was unhelpful , adding , " Despite the great cultural and policy advances transgender people have made , there is still a lot of disrespect , discrimination and violence aimed at us . And being a child or a teenager of any kind today is very difficult . "

 The day after Alcorn 's suicide note was published online , Chris Seelbach , the first openly gay councilman on Cincinnati City Council , shared it as part of a Facebook message in which he stated that her death showed how hard it was to be transgender in the U.S. His post was shared over 4 @,@ 700 times and raised increased public awareness of the incident . By December 30 , Alcorn 's death had attracted worldwide attention . News outlets across the world had picked up the story , and the hashtag # <unk> had topped Twitter . According to British newspaper The Independent , the incident " triggered widespread anguish and raised a debate about the rights of transgender people " , while the U.S.-based Boston Globe stated that it " served as a flashpoint for transgender progress in 2014 " . 
 On January 1 , 2015 , the Cincinnati @-@ based LGBT rights group Support Marriage Equality Ohio hosted a vigil for Alcorn outside Kings High School . A candlelight vigil in Goodale Park , Columbus was held on January 2 by a group called Stand Up 4 Leelah . A further vigil was organized by both The Diverse City Youth Chorus in partnership with the Cincinnati chapter of the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center for January 10 . The vigil location at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center was moved to the Woodward Theater , to make way for a larger setting . The venue was attended by nearly 600 supporters . 
 A January 3 vigil was scheduled for Trafalgar Square in London ; an organizer was quoted as saying that " [ Alcorn 's ] death was a political death . When a member of our community is brutalised at the hands of oppression we must all fight back " . Those who spoke at the event included politician Sarah Brown and novelist and poet Roz Kaveney . Marches were carried out in honor of Alcorn in both Northwest , Washington , D.C. and Queen Street , Auckland on January 10 . The same day , a candlelight vigil was held in New York City 's Columbus Circle . A memorial protest against conversion therapy and in memory of Alcorn took place in Lynchburg , Virginia on January 24 , 2015 . 
 Among the transgender celebrities who publicly responded to the incident were Janet Mock , <unk> Pejić , and Laverne Cox , while the musician Ray Toro released a song , " For The Lost And Brave " , in dedication to Alcorn . Jill Soloway , the writer of television show Transparent , dedicated her Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series to Alcorn . During Diane Sawyer 's interview with Caitlyn Jenner ( then Bruce ) , which confirmed Jenner 's transgender identity , Alcorn was mentioned by name and the message " Fix society . Please " was broadcast . 
 The Ohio Department of Transportation put up signs on the interchange of Interstate 71 South and Ohio State Route 48 in Warren County , where Alcorn died , to show that a group adopted that part of the road in memory of Alcorn . 
 Carolyn Washburn , editor of the Ohio newspaper The Cincinnati Enquirer , stated that the incident " raises important issues we hope will prompt conversations in families throughout our region . " Washburn had also received letters that derided the newspaper 's use of Alcorn 's chosen name in covering her death . When contacted by The Cincinnati Enquirer , Shane Morgan , the founder and chair of transgender advocate group <unk> , stated that while 2014 witnessed gains for the trans rights movement , Alcorn 's death illustrated how " trans people are still being victimized and still being disrespected " , highlighting the high rate of transgender people who had been murdered that year . Since the incident , <unk> received letters from parents of transgender children describing how Leelah 's death had affected them . Morgan stated that while he understood the anger directed toward Leelah 's parents , " there 's no excuse for threats to the family . " 
 Allison <unk> , executive director of the Transgender Human Rights Institute , informed The Independent that Leelah 's case was " not unique " ; the newspaper highlighted research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that LGBT youth are about twice as likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual , cisgender teenagers . Newsweek similarly placed Alcorn 's suicide within its wider context of transphobic discrimination , highlighting that the Youth Suicide Prevention Program reports that over 50 % of transgender youths attempt suicide before the age of 20 , and that the National Coalition of Anti @-@ Violence Programs recently published a report indicating that 72 % of LGBT homicide victims in 2013 were transgender women . 
 = = = Leelah 's Law = = = 
 A Facebook group called " Justice for Leelah Alcorn " was established , while a petition calling for " Leelah 's Law " , a ban on conversion therapy in the United States , was created by the Transgender Human Rights Institute to raise awareness of the psychologically harmful effects of such practices ; by January 24 it had 330 @,@ 009 signatures , and was named the fastest growing <unk> petition of 2014 . A second appeal demanding the enactment of " Leelah 's Law " was posted to the We the People section of <unk> on January 3 , 2015 which garnered more than 100 @,@ 000 signatures as of January 30 . In response to the petition President Barack Obama called for the banning of conversion therapy for minors . Under the Twitter hashtag # <unk> , many transgender people posted encouraging tweets for their younger counterparts , while other hashtags , such as # <unk> , and the term " Rest in Power " , also circulated on Twitter . A <unk> petition was set up calling for Leelah 's chosen name to be included on her gravestone , which gained over 80 @,@ 000 signatures . On January 6 , Adam Hoover of Marriage Equality Ohio remarked that , since the request of having Alcorn 's chosen name on her gravestone seemed " like a slim possibility " , they would be raising money for a permanent memorial arranged as a bench , tree and commemorative plaque . In April 2015 , President Obama responded to the petition seeking to ban conversion therapy inspired by Alcorn 's death with a pledge to advocate for such a ban . 
 In December 2015 , Cincinnati became the second U.S. city after Washington D.C. to ban the practice of conversion therapy outright ; council member Chris Seelbach cited Alcorn 's suicide as an influence in the decision , stating that " She challenged us to make her death matter , and we 're doing just that . " 
 = Philadelphia municipal election , 1951 = 
 Philadelphia 's municipal election of November 6 , 1951 was the first held under the city 's new charter , which had been approved by the voters the previous April . The positions contested included those of mayor , district attorney , all seventeen city council seats , among other offices . There was also a referendum on whether to consolidate the city and county governments . <unk> , the Democrats took majorities of over 100 @,@ 000 votes , breaking a 67 @-@ year Republican hold on city government . Joseph S. Clark , Jr. and Richardson Dilworth , two of the main movers for the charter reform , were elected mayor and district attorney , respectively . The Democrats also took fourteen of seventeen city council seats , and city @-@ county consolidation passed by a wide margin . The election marked the beginning of Democratic dominance of Philadelphia city politics , which continues today . 
 = = Mayor = = 
 The incumbent Republican mayor , Bernard Samuel , did not run for re @-@ election , leaving an open seat to be contested by the Republican nominee , Daniel A. Poling , and the Democrat , Joseph S. Clark , Jr . Clark was a lawyer and United States Army officer who had served in World War II . Raised in a Republican family , he switched his party affiliation to the Democrats in 1928 . After several unsuccessful attempts at public office in Philadelphia , he served as a Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania . Clark was known as a reformer , having been elected city controller two years earlier in 1949 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the city . In those two years , Clark probed various inefficiencies , graft , and theft in the Samuel administration and reported his findings to the voters . Many of those accused of crimes were convicted , and nine committed suicide . Clark continued his push for reform by urging adoption of a new city charter , which was approved by referendum in April 1951 . He campaigned for mayor with the promise of a " clean sweep of City Hall " . 
 The Republican nominee , Poling was a Baptist preacher , which GOP leaders hoped would help deflect the corruption charges leveled against the machine . Poling had worked for various charitable organizations and managed the Christian Herald . His son , Clark V. Poling , was one of the Four Chaplains lost aboard the SS Dorchester in World War II , and Poling served as pastor at the chapel erected in their memory . 
 The election was a landslide for Clark , as he won by more than 120 @,@ 000 votes . With 58 % of the vote , the Democrats had gained nearly 215 @,@ 000 votes from the last election , in which they had been defeated . As the vote tally became apparent , he told reporters that it was a " great victory for the thinking people of Philadelphia and it ends a long hard fight . " 
 = = District Attorney = = 
 As in the mayor 's race , the contest for district attorney pitted a Democratic reformer , Richardson Dilworth , against a representative of the Republican machine , Michael A. Foley . Dilworth , like Clark , was a former Republican who had been advocating reform for several years . He had run for mayor unsuccessfully in 1947 , with Clark as his campaign manager . In 1949 , he was elected City Treasurer . Democratic party leaders had intended Dilworth to be their candidate for mayor again in 1951 , but when Clark announced his candidacy , Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead . Foley , a local attorney , had no success against the Democratic wave . Dilworth won by almost as large a margin as his running mate , taking just shy of 58 % of the vote . He told reporters that the victory had a " sobering effect , " and that " the bigger the victory , the bigger the responsibility . " 
 = = City Council = = 
 Under the new charter , Philadelphians elected a seventeen @-@ member city council in 1951 , with ten members representing districts of the city , and the remaining seven being elected at @-@ large . For the at @-@ large seats , each political party could nominate five candidates , and voters could only vote for five , with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats , leaving two for the minority party . The Democrats ' citywide triumph continued into the city council races , as they took nine of ten districts and five of seven at @-@ large seats . 
 Constance Dallas , the first woman to win election to City Council , was elected in a close vote in the 8th district ( covering Chestnut Hill , Germantown , and Roxborough ) over incumbent councilman Robert S. Hamilton . In the 1st district , which took in South Philadelphia , attorney Thomas I. Guerin defeated Dominic J. <unk> . In the 2nd , the Republicans ' lone district victory came as electrician William M. Phillips bested Louis Vignola , a labor union official . In the 3rd district , made up of the southern half of West Philadelphia , incumbent Harry <unk> defeated another incumbent from the old city council , George <unk> , who had held office since 1936 . In the 4th , which covered the northern half of West Philadelphia , state representative Samuel Rose defeated incumbent James G. Clark . 
 In the city 's 5th district in North Philadelphia , another incumbent , Eugene J. Sullivan , was defeated by Raymond Pace Alexander , a local attorney and civil rights leader . In the 6th district , covering Kensington and Frankford , plumbers ' union official Michael J. <unk> won over William J. <unk> . In the 7th , James Hugh Joseph Tate defeated Joseph A. Ferko , a local Mummers string band leader . Insurance broker Charles M. Finley defeated incumbent councilman William A. Kelley in the 9th district , which covered Oak Lane , Olney , and Logan . In Northeast Philadelphia 's 10th district , incumbent Clarence K. Crossan , who had held office since 1925 , went down to defeat against real estate broker John F. Byrne , Sr. 
 In the at large races , the all five Democrats were elected , including city party chairman James A. Finnegan , former registration commissioner Victor E. Moore , Charter Commission secretary Lewis M. Stevens , attorney ( and future district attorney of Philadelphia ) Victor H. Blanc , and magistrate Paul D <unk> . The Republican slate ran more than 100 @,@ 000 votes behind the Democrats , with incumbent councilman Louis Schwartz and state senator John W. Lord , Jr. narrowly edging out assistant district attorney John B. <unk> , labor leader Colbert C. McClain , and clergyman Irwin W. Underhill for the two minority party slots on the council . 
 = = Other offices , referendum , and aftermath = = 
 The Democrats ' success continued down the ballot . They elected a county sheriff , William M. Lennox ; clerk of courts , Joseph A. Scanlon ; and recorder of deeds , Marshall L. Shepard . In the race for county commissioners , each party nominates two candidates and the top three are elected : here , too , the Democrats triumphed , electing both Maurice C. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry . The Republican spot on the county commission went to Walter I. Davidson . The Democrats also took eight of the fourteen magisterial district judge positions ( a local court , the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court ) . 
 A statewide referendum on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate the city and county governments in Philadelphia . In 1854 , all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city , but many county offices still existed , duplicating the efforts of city officials . Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum , but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved . 
 The 1951 election was the final blow to Philadelphia 's once @-@ dominant Republican machine . Since that time , the Democratic party has dominated the city 's politics , with no other party electing a mayor or a majority of the city council in the intervening years . 
 = Flavian dynasty = 
 The Flavian dynasty was a Roman imperial dynasty , which ruled the Roman Empire between 69 CE and 96 CE , encompassing the reigns of Vespasian ( 69 – 79 ) , and his two sons Titus ( 79 – 81 ) and Domitian ( 81 – 96 ) . The Flavians rose to power during the civil war of 69 , known as the Year of the Four Emperors . After Galba and Otho died in quick succession , Vitellius became emperor in mid 69 . His claim to the throne was quickly challenged by legions stationed in the Eastern provinces , who declared their commander Vespasian emperor in his place . The Second Battle of Bedriacum tilted the balance decisively in favour of the Flavian forces , who entered Rome on December 20 . The following day , the Roman Senate officially declared Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire , thus commencing the Flavian dynasty . Although the dynasty proved to be short @-@ lived , several significant historic , economic and military events took place during their reign . 
 The reign of Titus was struck by multiple natural disasters , the most severe of which was the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 . The surrounding cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were completely buried under ash and lava . One year later , Rome was struck by fire and a plague . On the military front , the Flavian dynasty witnessed the siege and destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 , following the failed Jewish rebellion of 66 . Substantial conquests were made in Great Britain under command of Gnaeus Julius Agricola between 77 and 83 , while Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against King Decebalus in the war against the Dacians . In addition , the Empire strengthened its border defenses by expanding the fortifications along the Limes Germanicus . 
 The Flavians initiated economic and cultural reforms . Under Vespasian , new taxes were devised to restore the Empire 's finances , while Domitian revalued the Roman coinage by increasing its silver content . A massive building programme was enacted to celebrate the ascent of the Flavian dynasty , leaving multiple enduring landmarks in the city of Rome , the most spectacular of which was the Flavian Amphitheatre , better known as the Colosseum . 
 Flavian rule came to an end on September 18 , 96 , when Domitian was assassinated . He was succeeded by the longtime Flavian supporter and advisor Marcus Cocceius Nerva , who founded the long @-@ lived Nerva – Antonine dynasty .

 = = = Family history = = = 
 Decades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome , which was gradually replaced in prominence by a new Italian nobility during the early part of the 1st century CE . One such family were the Flavians , or gens Flavia , which rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations , acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty . Vespasian 's grandfather , Titus Flavius Petro , had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar 's civil war . His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC . Nevertheless , Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla , whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro 's son Titus Flavius Sabinus I. Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia ( modern Switzerland ) ) . By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied himself to the more prestigious patrician gens Vespasia , ensuring the elevation of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to the senatorial rank . 
 Around 38 CE , Vespasian married Domitilla the Elder , the daughter of an equestrian from <unk> . They had two sons , Titus Flavius Vespasianus ( born in 39 ) and Titus Flavius Domitianus ( born in 51 ) , and a daughter , Domitilla ( born in 45 ) . Domitilla the Elder died before Vespasian became emperor . Thereafter his mistress <unk> was his wife in all but name until she died in 74 . The political career of Vespasian included the offices of quaestor , aedile and praetor , and culminated with a consulship in 51 , the year Domitian was born . As a military commander , he gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 . Nevertheless , ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian 's upbringing , even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors Caligula ( 37 – 41 ) and Nero ( 54 – 68 ) . Modern history has refuted these claims , suggesting these stories were later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a propaganda campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty , and maximize achievements under Emperor Claudius ( 41 – 54 ) and his son Britannicus . By all appearances , imperial favour for the Flavians was high throughout the 40s and 60s . While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus , Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career . Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s , he returned to public office under Nero , serving as proconsul of the Africa province in 63 , and accompanying the emperor during an official tour of Greece in 66 . 
 From c . 57 to 59 , Titus was a military tribune in Germania , and later served in Britannia . His first wife , Arrecina Tertulla , died two years after their marriage , in 65 . Titus then took a new wife of a more distinguished family , Marcia Furnilla . However , Marcia 's family was closely linked to the opposition to Emperor Nero . Her uncle Barea Soranus and his daughter Servilia were among those who were killed after the failed Pisonian conspiracy of 65 . Some modern historians theorize that Titus divorced his wife because of her family 's connection to the conspiracy . He never remarried . Titus appears to have had multiple daughters , at least one of them by Marcia Furnilla . The only one known to have survived to adulthood was Julia Flavia , perhaps Titus 's child by Arrecina , whose mother was also named Julia . During this period Titus also practiced law and attained the rank of quaestor . 
 In 66 , the Jews of the Judaea Province revolted against the Roman Empire . Cestius Gallus , the legate of Syria , was forced to retreat from Jerusalem and defeated at the battle of Beth @-@ Horon . The pro @-@ Roman king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled the city to the Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans . Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion , who was dispatched to the region at once with the fifth and tenth legions . He was later joined by Titus at Ptolemais , bringing with him the fifteenth legion . With a strength of 60 @,@ 000 professional soldiers , the Romans quickly swept across the Galilee , and by 68 marched on Jerusalem .

 On 9 June 68 , amidst growing opposition of the Senate and the army , Nero committed suicide , and with him the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty came to an end . Chaos ensued , leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors , during which the four most influential generals in the Roman Empire — Galba , Otho , Vitellius and Vespasian — successively vied for the imperial power . News of Nero 's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of Jerusalem . Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba , then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis ( modern Spain ) , as Emperor of Rome . Rather than continue his campaign , Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor . Before reaching Italy however , Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho , the governor of Lusitania ( modern Portugal ) . At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt , and prepared to march on Rome , intent on overthrowing Otho . Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other , Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea . 
 Otho and Vitellius realised the potential threat posed by the Flavian faction . With four legions at his disposal , Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80 @,@ 000 soldiers . His position in Judaea further granted him the advantage of being nearest to the vital province of Egypt , which controlled the grain supply to Rome . His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II , as city prefect , commanded the entire city garrison of Rome . Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high , but as long as Galba and Otho remained in power , Vespasian refused to take action . When Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum however , the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69 . Vespasian accepted , and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus , the governor of Syria , against Vitellius . A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus , while Vespasian himself travelled to Alexandria , leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion . 
 In Rome meanwhile , Domitian was placed under house arrest by Vitellius , as a safeguard against future Flavian aggression . Support for the old emperor was waning however , as more legions throughout the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian . On 24 October 69 the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian clashed at the Second Battle of Bedriacum , which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius . In despair , he attempted to negotiate a surrender . Terms of peace , including a voluntary abdication , were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II , but the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard — the imperial bodyguard — considered such a resignation disgraceful , and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty . On the morning of 18 December , the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the Temple of Concord , but at the last minute retraced his steps to the imperial palace . In the confusion , the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus ' house , proclaiming Vespasian Emperor , but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus , who was forced to retreat to the Capitoline Hill . During the night , he was joined by his relatives , including Domitian . The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome , but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day . On 19 December , <unk> burst onto the Capitol , and in the resulting skirmish , Sabinus was captured and executed . Domitian himself managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of Isis , and spent the night in safety with one of his father 's supporters . By the afternoon of 20 December Vitellius was dead , his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions . With nothing more to be feared from the enemy , Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces ; he was universally saluted by the title of Caesar , and the mass of troops conducted him to his father 's house . The following day , 21 December , the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire . 
 Although the war had officially ended , a state of anarchy and lawlessness pervaded in the first days following the demise of Vitellius . Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 , who headed an interim government with Domitian as the representative of the Flavian family in the Senate . Upon receiving the tidings of his rival 's defeat and death at Alexandria , the new Emperor at once forwarded supplies of urgently needed grain to Rome , along with an edict or a declaration of policy , in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the laws of Nero , especially those relating to treason . In early 70 , Vespasian was still in Egypt however , continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing . By the end 70 , he finally returned to Rome , and was properly installed as Emperor . 
 = = The Flavian dynasty = = 
 = = = Vespasian ( 69 – 79 ) = = = 
 Little factual information survives about Vespasian 's government during the ten years he was Emperor . Vespasian spent his first year as a ruler in Egypt , during which the administration of the empire was given to Mucianus , aided by Vespasian 's son Domitian . Modern historians believe that Vespasian remained there in order to consolidate support from the Egyptians . In mid @-@ 70 , Vespasian first came to Rome and immediately embarked on a widespread propaganda campaign to consolidate his power and promote the new dynasty . His reign is best known for financial reforms following the demise of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty , such as the institution of the tax on urinals , and the numerous military campaigns fought during the 70s . The most significant of these was the First Jewish @-@ Roman War , which ended in the destruction of the city of Jerusalem by Titus . In addition , Vespasian faced several uprisings in Egypt , Gaul and Germania , and reportedly survived several conspiracies against him . Vespasian helped rebuild Rome after the civil war , adding a temple to peace and beginning construction of the Flavian Amphitheatre , better known as the Colosseum . Vespasian died of natural causes on June 23 , 79 , and was immediately succeeded by his eldest son Titus . The ancient historians that lived through the period such as Tacitus , Suetonius , Josephus and Pliny the Elder speak well of Vespasian while condemning the emperors that came before him . 
 = = = Titus ( 79 – 81 ) = = = 
 Despite initial concerns over his character , Titus ruled to great acclaim following the death of Vespasian on June 23 , 79 and was considered a good emperor by Suetonius and other contemporary historians . In this role he is best known for his public building program in Rome , and completing the construction of the Colosseum in 80 , but also for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters , the Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 , and the fire of Rome of 80 . Titus continued his father 's efforts to promote the Flavian dynasty . He revived practice of the imperial cult , deified his father , and laid foundations for what would later become the Temple of Vespasian and Titus , which was finished by Domitian . After barely two years in office , Titus unexpectedly died of a fever on September 13 , 81 , and was deified by the Roman Senate . 
 = = = Domitian ( 81 – 96 ) = = = 
 Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard the day after Titus ' death , commencing a reign which lasted more than fifteen years — longer than any man who had governed Rome since Tiberius . Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage , expanded the border defenses of the Empire , and initiated a massive building programme to restore the damaged city of Rome . In Britain , Gnaeus Julius Agricola expanded the Roman Empire as far as modern day Scotland , but in Dacia , Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory in the war against the Dacians . On September 18 , 96 , Domitian was assassinated by court officials , and with him the Flavian dynasty came to an end . The same day , he was succeeded by his friend and advisor Nerva , who founded the long @-@ lasting Nervan @-@ Antonian dynasty . Domitian 's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate , with which he had a notoriously difficult relationship throughout his reign . Senatorial authors such as Tacitus , Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories after his death , propagating the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant . Modern history has rejected these views , instead characterising Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat , whose cultural , economic and political programme provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century . His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive , but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian 's . 
 = = Administration = = 
 = = = Government = = = 
 Since the fall of the Republic , the authority of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi @-@ monarchical system of government established by Augustus , known as the Principate . The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime , while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic . Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy , and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor 's status as a de facto monarch . The civil war of 69 had made it abundantly clear that real power in the Empire lay with control over the army . By the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Rome , any hope of restoring the Republic had long dissipated . 
 The Flavian approach to government was one of both implicit and explicit exclusion . When Vespasian returned to Rome in mid @-@ 70 , he immediately embarked on a series of efforts to consolidate his power and prevent future revolts . He offered gifts to the military and dismissed or punished those soldiers loyal to Vitellius . He also restructured the Senatorial and Equestrian orders , removing his enemies and adding his allies . Executive control was largely distributed among members of his family . Non @-@ Flavians were virtually excluded from important public offices , even those who had been among Vespasian 's earliest supporters during the civil war . Mucianus slowly disappears from the historical records during this time , and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77 . That it was Vespasian 's intention to found a long @-@ lasting dynasty to govern the Roman Empire was most evident in the powers he conferred upon his eldest son Titus . Titus shared tribunician power with his father , received seven consulships , the censorship , and perhaps most remarkably , was given command of the Praetorian Guard . Because Titus effectively acted as co @-@ emperor with his father , no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred during his brief reign from 79 until 81 . 
 Domitian 's approach to government was less subtle than his father and brother . Once Emperor , he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be . By moving the centre of power to the imperial court , Domitian openly rendered the Senate 's powers obsolete . He became personally involved in all branches of the administration : edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law , while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced . Nevertheless , Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion . Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non @-@ Flavians from public office , Domitian rarely favoured his own family members in the distribution of strategic posts , admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship , and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy . 
 = = = Financial reforms = = = 
 One of Vespasian 's first acts as Emperor was to enforce a tax reform to restore the Empire 's depleted treasury . After Vespasian arrived in Rome in mid @-@ 70 , Mucianus continued to press Vespasian to collect as many taxes as possible , renewing old ones and instituted new ones . Mucianus and Vespasian increased the tribute of the provinces , and kept a watchful eye upon the treasury officials . The Latin proverb " <unk> non <unk> " ( " Money does not smell " ) may have been created when he had introduced a urine tax on public toilets . 
 Upon his accession , Domitian revalued the Roman coinage to the standard of Augustus , increasing the silver content of the denarius by 12 % . An imminent crisis in 85 however forced a devaluation to the <unk> standard of 65 , but this was still higher than the level which Vespasian and Titus had maintained during their reign , and Domitian 's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years . Coin types from this era display a highly consistent degree of quality , including meticulous attention to Domitian 's titulature , and exceptionally refined artwork on the reverse portraits . 
 Jones estimates Domitian 's annual income at more than 1 @,@ 200 million sestertii , of which over one third would presumably have been spent at maintaining the Roman army . The other major area of expenditure encompassed the vast reconstruction programme carried out on the city of Rome itself . 
 = = Challenges = = 
 = = = Military activity = = = 
 The most significant military campaign undertaken during the Flavian period , was the siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 by Titus . The destruction of the city was the culmination of the Roman campaign in <unk> following the Jewish uprising of 66 . The Second Temple was completely demolished , after which Titus 's soldiers proclaimed him imperator in honor of the victory . Jerusalem was sacked and much of the population killed or dispersed . Josephus claims that 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 people were killed during the siege , of which a majority were Jewish . 97 @,@ 000 were captured and enslaved , including Simon Bar Giora and John of <unk> . Many fled to areas around the Mediterranean . Titus reportedly refused to accept a wreath of victory , as there is " no merit in vanquishing people forsaken by their own God " . Upon his return to Rome in 71 , Titus was awarded a triumph . Accompanied by Vespasian and Domitian , he rode into the city , enthusiastically saluted by the Roman populace and preceded by a lavish parade containing treasures and captives from the war . Josephus describes a procession with large amounts of gold and silver carried along the route , followed by elaborate re @-@ enactments of the war , Jewish prisoners , and finally the treasures taken from the Temple of Jerusalem , including the Menorah and the Torah . Leaders of the resistance were executed in the Forum , after which the procession closed with religious sacrifices at the Temple of Jupiter . The triumphal Arch of Titus , which stands at one entrance to the Forum , memorializes the victory of Titus . 
 The conquest of Britain continued under command of Gnaeus Julius Agricola , who expanded the Roman Empire as far as Caledonia , or modern day Scotland , between 77 and 84 . In 82 Agricola crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then . He fortified the coast facing Ireland , and Tacitus recalls that his father @-@ in @-@ law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries . He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest . This conquest never happened , but some historians believe that the crossing referred to was in fact a small @-@ scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland . The following year Agricola raised a fleet and pushed beyond the Forth into Caledonia . To aid the advance , an expansive legionary fortress was constructed at Inchtuthil . In the summer of 84 , Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians , led by Calgacus , at the Battle of Mons Graupius . Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the <unk> , two thirds of their army managed to escape and hide in the Scottish marshes and Highlands , ultimately preventing Agricola from bringing the entire British island under his control . 
 The military campaigns undertaken during Domitian 's reign were usually defensive in nature , as the Emperor rejected the idea of expansionist warfare . His most significant military contribution was the development of the Limes Germanicus , which encompassed a vast network of roads , forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire . Nevertheless , several important wars were fought in Gaul , against the Chatti , and across the Danube frontier against the Suebi , the Sarmatians , and the Dacians . Led by King Decebalus , the Dacians invaded the province of Moesia around 84 or 85 , wreaking considerable havoc and killing the Moesian governor <unk> Sabinus . Domitian immediately launched a counteroffensive , which resulted in the destruction of a legion during an ill @-@ fated expedition into Dacia . Their commander Cornelius Fuscus was killed , and the battle standard of the Praetorian Guard lost . In 87 , the Romans invaded Dacia once more , this time under command of <unk> Julianus , and finally managed to defeat Decebalus late in 88 , at the same site where Fuscus had previously been killed . An attack on Dacia 's capital canceled however when a crisis arose on the German frontier , forcing Domitian to sign a peace treaty with Decebalus which was severely criticized by contemporary authors . For the remainder of Domitian 's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful client kingdom , but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses , and continued to defy Rome . It was not until the reign of Trajan , in 106 , that a decisive victory against Decebalus was procured . Again , the Roman army sustained heavy losses , but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and , importantly , annexed the gold and silver mines of Dacia . 
 = = = Natural disasters = = = 
 Although his administration was marked by a relative absence of major military or political conflicts , Titus faced a number of major disasters during his brief reign . On August 24 , 79 , barely two months after his accession , Mount Vesuvius erupted , resulting in the almost complete destruction of life and property in the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples . The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and lava , killing thousands of citizens . Titus appointed two ex @-@ consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort , while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano . Additionally , he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year . The city was lost for nearly 1700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748 . Since then , its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city at the height of the Roman Empire , frozen at the moment it was buried on August 24 , 79 . The Forum , the baths , many houses , and some out @-@ of @-@ town villas like the Villa of the Mysteries remain surprisingly well preserved . Today , it is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Italy and a UNESCO World Heritage Site . On @-@ going excavations reveal new insights into the Roman history and culture . 
 During Titus ' second visit to the disaster area , a fire struck Rome which lasted for three days . Although the extent of the damage was not as disastrous as during the Great Fire of 64 , crucially sparing the many districts of insulae , Cassius Dio records a long list of important public buildings that were destroyed , including Agrippa 's Pantheon , the Temple of Jupiter , the <unk> , parts of Pompey 's Theatre and the Saepta Julia among others . Once again , Titus personally compensated for the damaged regions . According to Suetonius , a plague similarly struck during the fire . The nature of the disease , however , or the death toll are unknown . 
 = = = Conspiracies = = = 
 Suetonius claims that Vespasian was continuously met with conspiracies against him . Only one conspiracy is known specifically . In 78 or 79 , <unk> Marcellus and Aulus Caecina Alienus attempted to incite the Praetorian Guard to mutiny against Vespasian , but the conspiracy was thwarted by Titus . According to the historian John Crook however , the alleged conspiracy was in fact a calculated plot by the Flavian faction to remove members of the opposition tied to Mucianus , with the mutinous address found on Caecina 's body a forgery by Titus . When faced with real conspiracies however , Vespasian and Titus treated their enemies with lenience . " I will not kill a dog that barks at me , " were words expressing the temper of Vespasian , while Titus once demonstrated his generosity as Emperor by inviting men who were suspected of aspiring to the throne to dinner , rewarding them with gifts and allowing them to be seated next to him at the games . 
 Domitian appears to have met with several conspiracies during his reign , one of which led to his eventual assassination in 96 . The first significant revolt arose on 1 January 89 , when the governor of Germania Superior , Lucius Antonius Saturninus , and his two legions at Mainz , Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI <unk> , rebelled against the Roman Empire with the aid of the Chatti . The precise cause for the rebellion is uncertain , although it appears to have been planned well in advance . The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian 's military strategies , such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack , his recent retreat from Britain , and finally the disgraceful policy of appeasement towards Decebalus . At any rate , the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus ' province , and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces . The governor of Germania Inferior , Lappius Maximus , moved to the region at once , assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia , Titus Flavius Norbanus . From Spain , Trajan was summoned , whilst Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard . By a stroke of luck , a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus ' aid . Within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion was crushed , and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished . The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum , while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded . 
 Both Tacitus and Suetonius speak of escalating persecutions toward the end of Domitian 's reign , identifying a point of sharp increase around 93 , or sometime after the failed revolt of Saturninus in 89 . At least twenty senatorial opponents were executed , including Domitia Longina 's former husband Lucius Aelius Lamia and three of Domitian 's own family members , Titus Flavius Sabinus IV , Titus Flavius Clemens and Marcus Arrecinus Clemens . Some of these men were executed as early as 83 or 85 however , lending little credit to Tacitus ' notion of a " reign of terror " late in Domitian 's reign . According to Suetonius , some were convicted for corruption or treason , others on trivial charges , which Domitian justified through his suspicion . 
 = = Flavian culture = = 
 = = = Propaganda = = = 
 Since the reign of Tiberius , the rulers of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty had legitimized their power through adopted @-@ line descent from Augustus and Julius Caesar . Vespasian could no longer claim such a relation however . Therefore , a massive propaganda campaign was initiated to justify Flavian rule as having been predetermined through divine providence . As early as 70 , rumours circulated of Vespasian healing the sick and raising the dead in Egypt . At the same time , Flavian propaganda emphasised Vespasian 's role as a bringer of peace following the crisis of 69 . Nearly one @-@ third of all coins minted in Rome under Vespasian celebrated military victory or peace , while the word vindex was removed from coins as to not remind the public of rebellious Vindex . Construction projects bore inscriptions praising Vespasian and condemning previous emperors , and a Temple of Peace was constructed in the forum . 
 The Flavians also controlled public opinion through literature . Vespasian approved histories written under his reign , assuring biases against him were removed , while also giving financial rewards to contemporary writers . The ancient historians that lived through the period such as Tacitus , Suetonius , Josephus and Pliny the Elder speak suspiciously well of Vespasian while condemning the emperors that came before him . Tacitus admits that his status was elevated by Vespasian , Josephus identifies Vespasian as a patron and savior , and Pliny dedicated his Natural Histories to Vespasian , Titus . Those that spoke against Vespasian were punished . A number of stoic philosophers were accused of corrupting students with inappropriate teachings and were expelled from Rome . Helvidius Priscus , a pro @-@ republic philosopher , was executed for his teachings . 
 Titus and Domitian also revived the practice of the imperial cult , which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian . Significantly , Domitian 's first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus . Upon their deaths , his infant son , and niece Julia Flavia , were likewise enrolled among the gods . To foster the worship of the imperial family , Domitian erected a dynastic mausoleum on the site of Vespasian 's former house on the Quirinal , and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus , a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother . To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family , he ordered the construction of the Templum <unk> and the Templum Fortuna Redux , and completed the Arch of Titus . In order to further justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule , Domitian also emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter , most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The Flavian dynasty is perhaps best known for its vast construction programme on the city of Rome , intended to restore the capital from the damage it had suffered during the Great Fire of 64 , and the civil war of 69 . Vespasian added the temple of Peace and the temple to the <unk> Claudius . In 75 a colossal statue of Apollo , begun under Nero as a statue of himself , was finished on Vespasian 's orders , and he also dedicated a stage of the theater of Marcellus . Construction of the Flavian Amphitheatre , presently better known as the Colosseum ( probably after the nearby statue ) , was begun in 70 under Vespasian and finally completed in 80 under Titus . In addition to providing spectacular entertainments to the Roman populace , the building was also conceived as a gigantic triumphal monument to commemorate the military achievements of the Flavians during the Jewish wars . Adjacent to the amphitheatre , within the precinct of Nero 's Golden House , Titus also ordered the construction of a new public bath @-@ house , which was to bear his name . Construction of this building was hastily finished to coincide with the completion of the Flavian Amphitheatre . 
 The bulk of the Flavian construction projects was carried out during the reign of Domitian , who spent lavishly to restore and embellish the city of Rome . Much more than a renovation project however , Domitian 's building programme was intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire wide cultural renaissance . Around fifty structures were erected , restored or completed , a number second only to the amount erected under Augustus . Among the most important new structures were an <unk> , a Stadium , and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill , known as the Flavian Palace , which was designed by Domitian 's master architect <unk> . The most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill , which was said to have been covered with a gilded roof . Among those he completed were the Temple of Vespasian and Titus , the Arch of Titus , and the Colosseum , to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area . 
 = = = Entertainment = = = 
 Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games , and realised its importance to appease the citizens of Rome . In the newly constructed Colosseum , the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments . The Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and were said to be extremely elaborate , including gladiatorial combat , fights between wild animals ( elephants and cranes ) , mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded , horse races and chariot races . During the games , wooden balls were dropped into the audience , inscribed with various prizes ( clothing , gold , or even slaves ) , which could then be traded for the designated item . 
 An estimated 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives , or <unk> , throughout Domitian 's reign . In addition , he also revived the practice of public banquets , which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under Nero , while he invested large sums on entertainment and games . In 86 , he founded the Capitoline Games , a quadrennial contest comprising athletic displays , chariot races , and competitions for oratory , music and acting . Domitian himself supported the travels of competitors from the whole Empire and attributed the prizes . Innovations were also introduced into the regular gladiatorial games , such as naval contests , night @-@ time battles , and female and dwarf gladiator fights . Finally , he added two new factions , Gold and Purple , to chariot races , besides the regular White , Red , Green and Blue teams . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Flavians , although a relatively short @-@ lived dynasty , helped restore stability to an empire on its knees . Although all three have been criticised , especially based on their more centralised style of rule , they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century . However , their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate , and a conclusive move away from princeps , or first citizen , and toward imperator , or emperor . 
 Little factual information survives about Vespasian 's government during the ten years he was emperor , his reign is best known for financial reforms following the demise of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty . Vespasian was noted for his mildness and for loyalty to the people . For example , much money was spent on public works and the restoration and beautification of Rome : a new forum , the Temple of Peace , the public baths and the Colosseum . 
 Titus 's record among ancient historians stands as one of the most exemplary of any emperor . All the surviving accounts from this period , many of them written by his own contemporaries such as Suetonius <unk> , Cassius Dio , Pliny the Elder , present a highly favourable view towards Titus . His character has especially prospered in comparison with that of his brother Domitian . In contrast to the ideal portrayal of Titus in Roman histories , in Jewish memory " Titus the Wicked " is remembered as an evil oppressor and destroyer of the Temple . For example , one legend in the Babylonian Talmud describes Titus as having had sex with a whore on a Torah scroll inside the Temple during its destruction . 
 Although contemporary historians vilified Domitian after his death , his administration provided the foundation for the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE , and the culmination of the ' Pax Romana ' . His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive , but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian 's . Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century , the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96 , in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian .

 Theodore Komnenos Doukas Palaiologos Synadenos ( Greek : Θεόδωρος Κομνηνός Δούκας Παλαιολόγος <unk> , ca . 1277 – ca . 1346 ) , usually simply Theodore Synadenos , was a Byzantine magnate , senior official and military leader of the early 14th century , who played an important role in the civil wars of the period . The scion of a noble lineage , he became one of the first and most prominent supporters of Andronikos III Palaiologos in his struggle against his grandfather Andronikos II . Synadenos held various provincial governorships during Andronikos III 's reign , including Epirus and Thessalonica . After the outbreak of the civil war of 1341 – 1347 , he tried to surrender Thessalonica to his old friend John Kantakouzenos , but was driven from the city by the Zealots of Thessalonica . Forced to join Kantakouzenos 's enemies , he was initially honoured with the high rank of protovestiarios but soon placed under house arrest in Constantinople , where he died impoverished in 1345 or 1346 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Theodore Synadenos was a son of the megas stratopedarches John Synadenos and Theodora Palaiologina , the niece of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos ( r . 1259 – 1282 ) , and hence a member of the Byzantine Empire 's highest aristocracy . He had a probably older brother also named John , and at least one sister , Euphrosyne . Little is known about his early life : he was born circa 1277 , apparently at Bizye on the Black Sea coast of Thrace , where he had a palatial residence , extensive estates and many friends and relatives . 
 = = = Under Andronikos III = = = 
 Synadenos enters the historical record in 1321 , when he held the lowly title of domestikos <unk> trapezes ( steward of the imperial table ) , and is recorded as a close friend to his cousin , the junior emperor Michael IX Palaiologos . After Michael 's death , Synadenos became one of the earliest and most important adherents of Michael IX 's son , the young Andronikos III ( r . 1328 – 1341 ) . Andronikos had been disinherited by the old emperor , Andronikos II ( r . 1282 – 1328 ) , after Michael 's death . Along with the fellow aristocrats John Kantakouzenos and Syrgiannes Palaiologos , Theodore formed the leading " triumvirate " of the younger Andronikos 's supporters , to which the " new man " Alexios Apokaukos attached himself as a junior member . The old emperor , distrusting Synadenos ' loyalty , named him governor of Prilep , on the border with Serbia . Instead of departing for his assignment , on the night of Easter ( 19 – 20 April 1321 ) , Synadenos , along with the younger Andronikos and Kantakouzenos , escaped Constantinople to begin an armed uprising against Andronikos II . 
 In the first round of the civil war between grandfather and grandson , Andronikos III was successful in getting recognition for himself as junior emperor , with Thrace as his personal appanage . Throughout the conflict , Synadenos was among the most radical and uncompromising supporters of the younger Andronikos , favouring the eventual deposition of Andronikos II . During the course of the war , Synadenos defeated loyalist forces under Constantine Asen , and in the final round of the civil war , in 1327 – 28 , he served as governor in Thrace . As more and more localities , including the Empire 's second @-@ most important city , Thessalonica , switched over to Andronikos III 's camp , Synadenos along with Kantakouzenos urged Andronikos III to march on Constantinople and depose his grandfather outright . On the night of 13 May 1328 , the three men led their army through a gate after bribing its guard , taking possession of the imperial capital without resistance . Andronikos II was forced to resign the throne and retire to a monastery , with his grandson succeeding him as sole emperor . For his services , Synadenos was promoted to protostrator sometime during the civil war , perhaps as early as 1321 . 
 After the war , Theodore Synadenos was rewarded by being made governor of Constantinople , Apokaukos became head of the imperial secretariat , Kantakouzenos remained Andronikos III 's principal advisor as megas domestikos , and Syrgiannes was named governor of Thessalonica . Around 1330 , Synadenos was sent as governor to Mesembria , while in 1336 , after Andronikos III and John Kantakouzenos annexed Epirus , he became its governor . In late 1338 , however , a revolt broke out in Epirus in favour of Nikephoros II Orsini , the last descendant of the Epirote ruling dynasty . Synadenos was taken captive in the capital , Arta by the rebels , and remained a prisoner until 1340 , when Andronikos III and Kantakouzenos campaigned against the rebels and recovered the region . John Angelos , a relative of Kantakouzenos , was installed as the new governor , while Synadenos was moved to the governorship of Thessalonica . 
 = = = Renewed civil war and death = = = 
 In June 1341 , Andronikos III died suddenly , and a power struggle developed between Kantakouzenos , who initially assumed the powers of regency over Andronikos 's underage son John V Palaiologos , and a powerful faction around the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas , the Empress @-@ dowager Anna of Savoy and Alexios Apokaukos on the other . The dispute soon developed in outright conflict when the Patriarch , the Empress , and Apokaukos replaced Kantakouzenos as regent and imprisoned his family and supporters . In response , Kantakouzenos proclaimed himself emperor at Didymoteichon in October . The news of Kantakouzenos 's proclamation sparked a wave of popular resistance across Macedonia and Thrace . The common people , impoverished by an exploitative and over @-@ powerful aristocracy , viewed Kantakouzenos as a representative of the hated aristocrats and rallied behind the legitimate Palaiologos line and one by one , the cities were seized in the name of the Constantinopolitan regency . Thessalonica at first remained tranquil , and Synadenos contacted his old friend Kantakouzenos with the intention of surrendering the city to him . Such a move might well prove decisive , as possession of Thessalonica would enable Kantakouzenos to control Macedonia , Thessaly and Epirus , and in March 1342 , he set out from Didymoteichon with his army in the direction of the city . Before he arrived there , however , Synadenos was overthrown and driven from the city by a rebellion led by a radical popular faction , the Zealots . Apokaukos with a fleet came to reinforce the new regime , and one of his sons was installed as its new governor . 
 Driven from Thessalonica , with Kantakouzenos 's cause seemingly in ruins — he was soon forced to seek refuge in the court of the Serbian king , Stefan <unk> — and with his family back in Constantinople in the regency 's hands , Synadenos made terms with Apokaukos . He was rewarded with the high rank of protovestiarios , but soon after placed under virtual house arrest in Constantinople . There he died , deprived of his court rank and considerable wealth , in late 1345 or early 1346 . A year later , in February 1347 , Kantakouzenos entered Constantinople as the victor of the civil war , which had left the Byzantine state in ruins : its human and military resources exhausted , over half of its territory lost , bankrupt and indebted to foreigners , with a war @-@ weary and unenthusiastic populace .

 = Archaea = 
 The Archaea ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ar @-@ KEE @-@ ə or ar @-@ KAY @-@ ə ; singular archaeon ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single @-@ celled microorganisms . These microbes are prokaryotes , meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane @-@ bound organelles in their cells . 
 Archaea were initially classified as bacteria , receiving the name archaebacteria ( in the Archaebacteria kingdom ) , but this classification is outdated . Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains of life , Bacteria and Eukaryota . The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla . Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment . 
 Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape , although a few archaea have very strange shapes , such as the flat and square @-@ shaped cells of <unk> <unk> . Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria , archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes , notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation . Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique , such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes , such as <unk> . Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes : these range from organic compounds , such as sugars , to ammonia , metal ions or even hydrogen gas . Salt @-@ tolerant archaea ( the Haloarchaea ) use sunlight as an energy source , and other species of archaea fix carbon ; however , unlike plants and cyanobacteria , no known species of archaea does both . Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission , fragmentation , or budding ; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes , no known species forms spores . 
 Archaea were initially viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments , such as hot springs and salt lakes , but they have since been found in a broad range of habitats , including soils , oceans , marshlands and the human colon , oral cavity , and skin . Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans , and the archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet . Archaea are a major part of Earth 's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle . No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known , but they are often mutualists or commensals . One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts , where their vast numbers aid digestion . <unk> are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment , and enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents are exploited in biotechnology . 
 = = Classification = = 
 = = = New domain = = = 
 For much of the 20th century , prokaryotes were regarded as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry , morphology and metabolism . For example , microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls , their shapes , and the substances they consume . In 1965 , Linus Pauling and Emile <unk> proposed instead using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other . This approach , known as phylogenetics , is the main method used today . 
 Archaea were first classified as a separate group of prokaryotes in 1977 by Carl Woese and George E. Fox in phylogenetic trees based on the sequences of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) genes . These two groups were originally named the Archaebacteria and Eubacteria and treated as kingdoms or subkingdoms , which Woese and Fox termed <unk> . Woese argued that this group of prokaryotes is a fundamentally different sort of life . To emphasize this difference , Woese later proposed a new natural system of organisms with three separate Domains : the Eukarya , the Bacteria and the Archaea , in what is now known as " The <unk> Revolution " . 
 The word archaea comes from the Ancient Greek <unk> , meaning " ancient things " , as the first representatives of the domain Archaea were methanogens and it was assumed that their metabolism reflected Earth 's primitive atmosphere and the organism 's antiquity . For a long time , archaea were seen as extremophiles that only exist in extreme habitats such as hot springs and salt lakes . However , as new habitats were studied , more organisms were discovered . Extreme halophilic and hyperthermophilic microbes were also included in the Archaea . By the end of the 20th century , archaea had been identified in non @-@ extreme environments as well . Today , they are known to be a large and diverse group of organisms that are widely distributed in nature and are common in all habitats . This new appreciation of the importance and ubiquity of archaea came from using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) to detect prokaryotes from environmental samples ( such as water or soil ) by multiplying their ribosomal genes . This allows the detection and identification of organisms that have not been cultured in the laboratory . 
 = = = Current classification = = = 
 The classification of archaea , and of prokaryotes in general , is a rapidly moving and contentious field . Current classification systems aim to organize archaea into groups of organisms that share structural features and common ancestors . These classifications rely heavily on the use of the sequence of ribosomal RNA genes to reveal relationships between organisms ( molecular phylogenetics ) . Most of the <unk> and well @-@ investigated species of archaea are members of two main phyla , the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota . Other groups have been tentatively created . For example , the peculiar species Nanoarchaeum equitans , which was discovered in 2003 , has been given its own phylum , the <unk> . A new phylum <unk> has also been proposed . It contains a small group of unusual thermophilic species that shares features of both of the main phyla , but is most closely related to the Crenarchaeota . Other recently detected species of archaea are only distantly related to any of these groups , such as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic <unk> ( ARMAN ) , which were discovered in 2006 and are some of the smallest organisms known . 
 A superphylum - <unk> - has been proposed that includes the <unk> , <unk> , Crenarchaeota , and <unk> . This superphylum may be related to the origin of eukaryotes . 
 = = = = Concept of species = = = = 
 The classification of archaea into species is also controversial . Biology defines a species as a group of related organisms . The familiar exclusive breeding criterion ( organisms that can breed with each other but not with others ) is of no help here because archaea reproduce asexually . 
 Archaea show high levels of horizontal gene transfer between lineages . Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species @-@ like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to / from cells with less @-@ related genomes , as in the genus Ferroplasma . On the other hand , studies in <unk> found significant genetic transfer to / from less @-@ related populations , limiting the criterion 's applicability . A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning . 
 Current knowledge on genetic diversity is fragmentary and the total number of archaeal species cannot be estimated with any accuracy . Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23 , of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly . Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence , indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains obscure . The Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar implications for characterization . 
 = = Origin and evolution = = 
 The age of the Earth is about 4 @.@ 54 billion years old . Scientific evidence suggests that life began on Earth at least 3 @.@ 5 billion years ago . The earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite found to be biogenic in 3 @.@ 7 billion @-@ year @-@ old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3 @.@ 48 billion @-@ year @-@ old sandstone discovered in Western Australia . More recently , in 2015 , " remains of biotic life " were found in 4 @.@ 1 billion @-@ year @-@ old rocks in Western Australia . An unrelated researcher , S. Blair Hedges , wrote in an email about the study saying , " If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe . " 
 Although probable prokaryotic cell fossils date to almost 3 @.@ 5 billion years ago , most prokaryotes do not have distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot be used to identify them as archaea . Instead , chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms . Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2 @.@ 7 billion years ago ; such data have since been questioned . Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland . The oldest such traces come from the <unk> district , which include Earth 's oldest known sediments , formed 3 @.@ 8 billion years ago . The archaeal lineage may be the most ancient that exists on Earth . 
 Woese argued that the bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes represent separate lines of descent that diverged early on from an ancestral colony of organisms . One possibility is that this occurred before the evolution of cells , when the lack of a typical cell membrane allowed unrestricted lateral gene transfer , and that the common ancestors of the three domains arose by fixation of specific subsets of genes . It is possible that the last common ancestor of the bacteria and archaea was a <unk> , which raises the possibility that lower temperatures are " extreme environments " in archaeal terms , and organisms that live in cooler environments appeared only later . Since the Archaea and Bacteria are no more related to each other than they are to eukaryotes , the term prokaryote 's only surviving meaning is " not a eukaryote " , limiting its value . 
 = = = Comparison to other domains = = = 
 The following table compares some major characteristics of the three domains , to illustrate their similarities and differences . Many of these characteristics are also discussed below . 
 Archaea were split off as a third domain because of the large differences in their ribosomal RNA structure . The particular RNA molecule sequenced , known as 16s rRNA , is present in all organisms and always has the same vital function , the production of proteins . Because this function is so central to life , organisms with mutations of its 16s rRNA are unlikely to survive , leading to great stability in the structure of this nucleotide over many generations . 16s rRNA is also large enough to retain organism @-@ specific information , but small enough to be sequenced in a manageable amount of time . In 1977 , Carl Woese , a microbiologist studying the genetic sequencing of organisms , developed a new sequencing method that involved splitting the RNA into fragments that could be sorted and compared to other fragments from other organisms . The more similar the patterns between species were , the more closely related the organisms . 
 Woese used his new rRNA comparison method to categorize and contrast different organisms . He sequenced a variety of different species and happened upon a group of methanogens that had vastly different patterns than any known prokaryotes or eukaryotes . These methanogens were much more similar to each other than they were to other organisms sequenced , leading Woese to propose the new domain of Archaea . One of the interesting results of his experiments was that the Archaea were more similar to eukaryotes than prokaryotes , even though they were more similar to prokaryotes in structure . This led to the conclusion that Archaea and Eukarya shared a more recent common ancestor than Eukarya and Bacteria in general . The development of the nucleus occurred after the split between Bacteria and this common ancestor . Although Archaea are prokaryotic , they are more closely related to Eukarya and thus cannot be placed within either the Bacteria or Eukarya domains . 
 One property unique to Archaea is the abundant use of ether @-@ linked lipids in their cell membranes . Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya , which may be a contributing factor to the ability of many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes , such as extreme heat and salinity . Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of <unk> ( the metabolic production of methane ) . <unk> Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane , many of which are Bacteria , as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers . <unk> also play a critical role in the carbon cycle , breaking down organic carbon into methane , which is also a major greenhouse gas . 
 = = = Relationship to other prokaryotes = = = 
 The relationship between the three domains is of central importance for understanding the origin of life . Most of the metabolic pathways , which comprise the majority of an organism 's genes , are common between Archaea and Bacteria , while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya . Within prokaryotes , archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram @-@ positive bacteria , largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick <unk> ( exoskeleton ) of varying chemical composition . In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene / protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs , the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram @-@ positive bacteria . Archaea and gram @-@ positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins , such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetase I ; however , the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal <unk> gene transfer , and might not reflect the organismal relationship ( s ) . 
 It has been proposed that the archaea evolved from gram @-@ positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure . This is suggested by the observation that archaea are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics that are primarily produced by gram @-@ positive bacteria , and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish archaea from bacteria . The proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram @-@ positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics ' target genes , and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present @-@ day Archaea . The evolution of Archaea in response to antibiotic selection , or any other competitive selective pressure , could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments ( such as high temperature or acidity ) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic @-@ producing organisms ; Cavalier @-@ Smith has made a similar suggestion . This proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram @-@ positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes . 
 = = = Relation to eukaryotes = = = 
 The evolutionary relationship between archaea and eukaryotes remains unclear . Aside from the similarities in cell structure and function that are discussed below , many genetic trees group the two . 
 Complicating factors include claims that the relationship between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea @-@ like genes in certain bacteria , such as <unk> maritima , from horizontal gene transfer . The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea , and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and <unk> , which became the nucleus and cytoplasm ; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure . An alternative hypothesis , the <unk> hypothesis , posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea . 
 A recently discovered lineage of archaea , <unk> , named for a hydrothermal vent called Loki 's Castle in the Arctic Ocean , has been found to be most closely related to eukaryotes . It has been called a transitional organism between prokaryotes and eukaryotes . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 Individual archaea range from 0 @.@ 1 micrometers ( μm ) to over 15 μm in diameter , and occur in various shapes , commonly as spheres , rods , spirals or plates . Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus , needle @-@ like filaments that are less than half a micrometer in diameter in <unk> , and almost perfectly rectangular rods in <unk> and <unk> . <unk> <unk> are flat , square archaea that live in hypersaline pools . These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton . Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea , and filaments form within their cells , but in contrast to other organisms , these cellular structures are poorly understood . In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes , and can resemble amoebae . 
 Some species form aggregates or filaments of cells up to 200 μm long . These organisms can be prominent in biofilms . Notably , aggregates of <unk> <unk> cells fuse together in culture , forming single giant cells . Archaea in the genus <unk> produce an elaborate multicell colony involving arrays of long , thin hollow tubes called <unk> that stick out from the cells ' surfaces and connect them into a dense bush @-@ like agglomeration . The function of these <unk> is not settled , but they may allow communication or nutrient exchange with neighbors . Multi @-@ species colonies exist , such as the " string @-@ of @-@ pearls " community that was discovered in 2001 in a German swamp . Round whitish colonies of a novel Euryarchaeota species are spaced along thin filaments that can range up to 15 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long ; these filaments are made of a particular bacteria species . 
 = = Structure , composition development , and operation = = 
 Archaea and bacteria have generally similar cell structure , but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart . Like bacteria , archaea lack interior membranes and organelles . Like bacteria , archaea cell membranes are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using one or more flagella . Structurally , archaea are most similar to gram @-@ positive bacteria . Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall , and lack a periplasmic space ; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus , which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane @-@ bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane . 
 = = = Membranes = = = 
 Archaeal membranes are made of molecules that differ strongly from those in other life forms , showing that archaea are related only distantly to bacteria and eukaryotes . In all organisms , cell membranes are made of molecules known as phospholipids . These molecules possess both a polar part that dissolves in water ( the phosphate " head " ) , and a " greasy " non @-@ polar part that does not ( the lipid tail ) . These dissimilar parts are connected by a glycerol moiety . In water , phospholipids cluster , with the heads facing the water and the tails facing away from it . The major structure in cell membranes is a double layer of these phospholipids , which is called a lipid bilayer . 
 These phospholipids are unusual in four ways : 
 Bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol @-@ ester lipids , whereas archaea have membranes composed of glycerol @-@ ether lipids . The difference is the type of bond that joins the lipids to the glycerol moiety ; the two types are shown in yellow in the figure at the right . In ester lipids this is an ester bond , whereas in ether lipids this is an ether bond . Ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester bonds . This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments . Bacteria and eukaryotes do contain some ether lipids , but in contrast to archaea these lipids are not a major part of their membranes . 
 The stereochemistry of the glycerol moiety is the reverse of that found in other organisms . The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another , called the right @-@ handed and left @-@ handed forms ; in chemistry these are called enantiomers . Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left @-@ handed glove , a right @-@ handed phospholipid generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the left @-@ handed form . This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes . Such enzymes developed very early in life 's history , suggesting an early split from the other two domains . 
 Archaeal lipid tails are chemically different from other organisms . Archaeal lipids are based upon the isoprenoid <unk> and are long chains with multiple side @-@ branches and sometimes even cyclopropane or <unk> rings . This is in contrast to the fatty acids found in other organisms ' membranes , which have straight chains with no branches or rings . Although isoprenoids play an important role in the biochemistry of many organisms , only the archaea use them to make phospholipids . These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures . 
 In some archaea , the lipid bilayer is replaced by a monolayer . In effect , the archaea fuse the tails of two independent phospholipid molecules into a single molecule with two polar heads ( a <unk> ) ; this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better able to resist harsh environments . For example , the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type , which is thought to aid this organism 's survival in its highly acidic habitat . 
 = = = Cell wall and flagella = = = 
 Most archaea ( but not Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma ) possess a cell wall . In most archaea the wall is assembled from surface @-@ layer proteins , which form an S @-@ layer . An S @-@ layer is a rigid array of protein molecules that cover the outside of the cell ( like chain mail ) . This layer provides both chemical and physical protection , and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane . Unlike bacteria , archaea lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls . <unk> do have cell walls containing <unk> , which resembles <unk> peptidoglycan in morphology , function , and physical structure , but <unk> is distinct in chemical structure ; it lacks D @-@ amino acids and N @-@ <unk> acid . 
 Archaea flagella operate like bacterial flagella — their long stalks are driven by <unk> motors at the base . These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane . However , archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development . The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors . The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system , while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili . In contrast to the bacterial flagellum , which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore to the tip of the flagella , archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base . 
 = = Metabolism = = 
 Archaea exhibit a great variety of chemical reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy . These reactions are classified into nutritional groups , depending on energy and carbon sources . Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia ( they are lithotrophs ) . These include <unk> , methanogens and anaerobic methane <unk> . In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another ( in a redox reaction ) , releasing energy to fuel the cell 's activities . One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor . The energy released generates adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) through chemiosmosis , in the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells . 
 Other groups of archaea use sunlight as a source of energy ( they are phototrophs ) . However , oxygen – generating photosynthesis does not occur in any of these organisms . Many basic metabolic pathways are shared between all forms of life ; for example , archaea use a modified form of glycolysis ( the <unk> – <unk> pathway ) and either a complete or partial citric acid cycle . These similarities to other organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency . 
 Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens living in anaerobic environments , such as swamps . This form of metabolism evolved early , and it is even possible that the first free @-@ living organism was a methanogen . A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen . <unk> involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea , such as coenzyme M and <unk> . Other organic compounds such as alcohols , acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens . These reactions are common in gut @-@ dwelling archaea . Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly , by <unk> archaea . These <unk> are archaea in the order <unk> , and are a major part of the communities of microorganisms that produce biogas . 
 Other archaea use CO 
 2 in the atmosphere as a source of carbon , in a process called carbon fixation ( they are autotrophs ) . This process involves either a highly modified form of the Calvin cycle or a recently discovered metabolic pathway called the 3 @-@ <unk> / 4 @-@ hydroxybutyrate cycle . The Crenarchaeota also use the reverse Krebs cycle while the Euryarchaeota also use the reductive acetyl @-@ CoA pathway . Carbon – fixation is powered by inorganic energy sources . No known archaea carry out photosynthesis . Archaeal energy sources are extremely diverse , and range from the oxidation of ammonia by the <unk> to the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur by species of Sulfolobus , using either oxygen or metal ions as electron acceptors . 
 <unk> archaea use light to produce chemical energy in the form of ATP . In the <unk> , light @-@ activated ion pumps like <unk> and <unk> generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane . The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase . This process is a form of photophosphorylation . The ability of these light @-@ driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light @-@ driven changes in the structure of a retinol cofactor buried in the center of the protein . 
 = = Genetics = = 
 Archaea usually have a single circular chromosome , the size of which may be as great as 5 @,@ 751 @,@ 492 base pairs in <unk> <unk> , the largest known archaeal genome . The tiny 490 @,@ 885 base @-@ pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one @-@ tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known ; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein @-@ encoding genes . Smaller independent pieces of DNA , called plasmids , are also found in archaea . Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact , in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation . 
 Archaea can be infected by double @-@ stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated to any other form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes , including bottles , hooked rods , or teardrops . These viruses have been studied in most detail in <unk> , particularly the orders <unk> and <unk> . Two groups of single @-@ stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated . One group is exemplified by the <unk> pleomorphic virus 1 ( " <unk> " ) infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the <unk> coil @-@ shaped virus ( " <unk> " ) infecting a hyperthermophilic ( optimal growth at 90 – 95 ° C ) host . Notably , the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome . Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses . 
 Archaea are genetically distinct from bacteria and eukaryotes , with up to 15 % of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain , although most of these unique genes have no known function . Of the remainder of the unique proteins that have an identified function , most belong to the <unk> and are involved in <unk> . The proteins that archaea , bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function , relating mostly to transcription , translation , and nucleotide metabolism . Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function — such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons , and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases . 
 Transcription in archaea more closely resembles eukaryotic than bacterial transcription , with the archaeal RNA polymerase being very close to its equivalent in eukaryotes ; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and <unk> equivalents . Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase , its structure and function in transcription seems to be close to that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II , with similar protein assemblies ( the general transcription factors ) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene 's promoter . However , other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria . Post @-@ transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes , since most archaeal genes lack introns , although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes , and introns may occur in a few protein @-@ encoding genes . 
 = = = Gene transfer and genetic exchange = = = 
 <unk> <unk> , an extreme halophilic archaeon , forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction . 
 When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus <unk> and Sulfolobus <unk> are exposed to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation , bleomycin or <unk> C , species @-@ specific cellular aggregation is induced . Aggregation in S. <unk> could not be induced by other physical stressors , such as pH or temperature shift , suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage . <unk> et al. showed that UV @-@ induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S. <unk> . Recombination rates exceeded those of <unk> cultures by up to three orders of magnitude . <unk> et al. and <unk> et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination . This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well @-@ studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Archaea reproduce asexually by binary or multiple fission , fragmentation , or budding ; meiosis does not occur , so if a species of archaea exists in more than one form , all have the same genetic material . Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle ; after the cell 's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate , the cell divides . In the genus Sulfolobus , the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems . The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting @-@ points ( origins of replication ) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes . 
 In <unk> the cell division protein <unk> , which forms a contracting ring around the cell , and the components of the septum that is constructed across the center of the cell , are similar to their bacterial equivalents . In <unk> and <unk> , however , the cell division machinery <unk> fulfills a similar role . This machinery is related to the eukaryotic <unk> @-@ III machinery which , while best known for its role in cell sorting , also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell , suggesting an ancestral role in cell division . 
 Both bacteria and eukaryotes , but not archaea , make spores . Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types , including thick @-@ walled structures that are resistant to osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations , but these are not reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Habitats = = = 
 Archaea exist in a broad range of habitats , and as a major part of global ecosystems , may represent about 20 % of microbial cells in the oceans . The first @-@ discovered <unk> were extremophiles . Indeed , some archaea survive high temperatures , often above 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) , as found in geysers , black smokers , and oil wells . Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline , acidic , or alkaline water . However , archaea include <unk> that grow in mild conditions , in swamps and marshland , sewage , the oceans , the intestinal tract of animals , and soils . 
 <unk> archaea are members of four main physiological groups . These are the halophiles , <unk> , <unk> , and acidophiles . These groups are not comprehensive or phylum @-@ specific , nor are they mutually exclusive , since some archaea belong to several groups . Nonetheless , they are a useful starting point for classification . 
 <unk> , including the genus <unk> , live in extremely saline environments such as salt lakes and outnumber their bacterial counterparts at salinities greater than 20 – 25 % . Thermophiles grow best at temperatures above 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ) , in places such as hot springs ; hyperthermophilic archaea grow optimally at temperatures greater than 80 ° C ( 176 ° F ) . The archaeal <unk> <unk> Strain 116 can even reproduce at 122 ° C ( 252 ° F ) , the highest recorded temperature of any organism . 
 Other archaea exist in very acidic or alkaline conditions . For example , one of the most extreme archaean acidophiles is <unk> <unk> , which grows at pH 0 , which is equivalent to thriving in 1 @.@ 2 molar sulfuric acid . 
 This resistance to extreme environments has made archaea the focus of speculation about the possible properties of extraterrestrial life . Some extremophile habitats are not dissimilar to those on Mars , leading to the suggestion that viable microbes could be transferred between planets in meteorites . 
 Recently , several studies have shown that archaea exist not only in <unk> and thermophilic environments but are also present , sometimes in high numbers , at low temperatures as well . For example , archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas . Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world 's oceans in non @-@ extreme habitats among the plankton community ( as part of the <unk> ) . Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers ( up to 40 % of the microbial biomass ) , almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture . Consequently , our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary , so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored . Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification , suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle , although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy . Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor , with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom . 
 = = = Role in chemical cycling = = = 
 Archaea recycle elements such as carbon , nitrogen and sulfur through their various habitats . Although these activities are vital for normal ecosystem function , archaea can also contribute to human @-@ made changes , and even cause pollution . 
 Archaea carry out many steps in the nitrogen cycle . This includes both reactions that remove nitrogen from ecosystems ( such as nitrate @-@ based respiration and denitrification ) as well as processes that introduce nitrogen ( such as nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation ) . Researchers recently discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions . These reactions are particularly important in the oceans . The archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils . They produce nitrite , which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate . Plants and other organisms consume the latter . 
 In the sulfur cycle , archaea that grow by oxidizing sulfur compounds release this element from rocks , making it available to other organisms . However , the archaea that do this , such as Sulfolobus , produce sulfuric acid as a waste product , and the growth of these organisms in abandoned mines can contribute to acid mine drainage and other environmental damage . 
 In the carbon cycle , methanogen archaea remove hydrogen and play an important role in the decay of organic matter by the populations of microorganisms that act as decomposers in anaerobic ecosystems , such as sediments , marshes and sewage @-@ treatment works . 
 Global methane levels in 2011 had increased by a factor of 2 @.@ 5 since pre @-@ industrial times : from 722 ppb to 1800 ppb , the highest value in at least 800 @,@ 000 years . Methane has an anthropogenic global warming potential ( <unk> ) of 29 , which means that it 's 29 times stronger in heat @-@ trapping than carbon dioxide is , over a 100 @-@ year time scale . 
 = = = Interactions with other organisms = = = 
 The well @-@ characterized interactions between archaea and other organisms are either mutual or commensal . There are no clear examples of known archaeal pathogens or parasites . However , some species of methanogens have been suggested to be involved in infections in the mouth , and Nanoarchaeum equitans may be a parasite of another species of archaea , since it only survives and reproduces within the cells of the <unk> Ignicoccus <unk> , and appears to offer no benefit to its host . In contrast , Archaeal Richmond Mine <unk> <unk> ( ARMAN ) occasionally connect with other archaeal cells in acid mine drainage biofilms . The nature of this relationship is unknown . However , it is distinct from that of <unk> – Ignicoccus in that the <unk> ARMAN cells are usually seen independent of the <unk> cells . 
 = = = = Mutualism = = = = 
 One well @-@ understood example of mutualism is the interaction between protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts of animals that digest cellulose , such as ruminants and termites . In these anaerobic environments , protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy . This process releases hydrogen as a waste product , but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production . When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane , protozoa benefit from more energy . 
 In anaerobic protozoa , such as <unk> <unk> , archaea reside inside the protozoa and consume hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes . Archaea also associate with larger organisms . For example , the marine archaean <unk> <unk> lives within ( is an endosymbiont of ) the sponge <unk> mexicana . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Archaea can also be commensals , benefiting from an association without helping or harming the other organism . For example , the methanogen <unk> smithii is by far the most common archaean in the human flora , making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut . In termites and in humans , these methanogens may in fact be mutualists , interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion . Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms , such as on the surface of corals , and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots ( the rhizosphere ) . 
 = = Significance in technology and industry = = 
 <unk> archaea , particularly those resistant either to heat or to extremes of acidity and alkalinity , are a source of enzymes that function under these harsh conditions . These enzymes have found many uses . For example , thermostable DNA polymerases , such as the <unk> DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus <unk> , revolutionized molecular biology by allowing the polymerase chain reaction to be used in research as a simple and rapid technique for cloning DNA . In industry , amylases , <unk> and <unk> in other species of Pyrococcus that function at over 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) allow food processing at high temperatures , such as the production of low lactose milk and whey . Enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents , allowing their use in environmentally friendly processes in green chemistry that synthesize organic compounds . This stability makes them easier to use in structural biology . Consequently , the counterparts of bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used in structural studies . 
 In contrast to the range of applications of archaean enzymes , the use of the organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed . <unk> archaea are a vital part of sewage treatment , since they are part of the community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas . In mineral processing , acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores , including gold , cobalt and copper . 
 Archaea host a new class of potentially useful antibiotics . A few of these <unk> have been characterized , but hundreds more are believed to exist , especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus . These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics , so they may have novel modes of action . In addition , they may allow the creation of new selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology . 
 = 100th Infantry Division ( United States ) = 
 The 100th Division ( formerly the 100th Infantry Division ) is an infantry division of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Knox , Kentucky . It currently serves as a major training command of the United States Army Reserve . 
 Throughout its long history , the division has taken on numerous roles . Serving as the 100th Infantry Division until the 1950s , the division then briefly became the 100th Airborne Division before becoming the 100th Division ( Training ) . Since this transformation , the division has primarily taken on numerous training roles for other Army units . 
 It was activated in mid 1918 , too late to join the fighting in World War I. The division is best known for its exploits during World War II as the 100th Infantry Division . Fighting in the European Theater , the division advanced through France and Germany through the end of the war , fending off serious German counterattacks along the way . World War II would be the only war the division would fight in before taking on its role as a training unit .

 = = = World War I = = = 
 The 100th Division was first constituted on 12 July 1918 in the National Army . It was organized in October of that year at Camp Bowie , Texas . It was assigned the 199th Infantry Brigade commanding the 397th Infantry Regiment , the 398th Infantry Regiment and the 200th Infantry Brigade , commanding the 399th Infantry Regiment and the 400th Infantry Regiment . Each brigade commanded around 8 @,@ 000 soldiers . 
 The division then began preparations to deploy to Europe and join the American Expeditionary Forces in combating the Central Powers during World War I. Before the division could deploy , though , the war ended on 11 November 1918 , Armistice Day . The 100th Division then began demobilization as part of the post @-@ war drawdown of the U.S. Army . 
 It would remain on the U.S. Army 's roll until November 1919 , when it was completely demobilized . Only two years later , in June 1921 , the division was reconstituted with its headquarters in Wheeling , West Virginia . On 29 May 1923 , the division received its shoulder sleeve insignia . 
 Through its interwar years , the division saw little service . Its location was changed in 1924 to Huntington , West Virginia and was changed again in 1937 to Charleston , West Virginia . 
 In 1940 , the 199th and 200th Infantry Brigade headquarters were disbanded , and the division was placed in command of the 397th , 398th , and 399th Infantry Regiments directly ; the 400th Infantry Regiment was inactivated .

 = = = = Mobilization = = = = 
 The 100th Infantry Division was reactivated in the active duty force on 15 November 1942 at Fort Jackson , South Carolina . Enlisted personnel were primarily original members of the unit , fleshed out by fillers from the 76th Infantry Division . The Officers were mostly members of the unit , again fleshed out with fillers from the Organized Reserves . The commander of the 100th was Major General Withers A. Burress , one of only eleven generals who commanded their divisions for the entire war . 
 From late 1943 to early 1944 , the division trained in the mountains of Tennessee and was subsequently sent to Fort Bragg , North Carolina , for further training . While at Fort Bragg , Technical Sergeant Walter L. Bull earned the first Expert Infantryman 's Badge . 
 The division remained organized around the 397th , 398th and 399th Infantry Regiments , and was also assigned the 374th Artillery Battalion , the 375th Artillery Battalion , the <unk> Artillery Battalion , and the 373rd Artillery Battalion for artillery support , as well as the 325th Engineer Combat Battalion , the 325th Medical Battalion , the 100th Military Police Company , the 100th Quartermaster Company , the 800th Ordnance Company , the 100th Reconnaissance Cavalry Troop and the 100th Signals Company . 
 The division sailed to Europe on 6 October of that year . The division arrived at Marseille , France on 20 October . It was made part of VI Corps of the Seventh United States Army , Sixth United States Army Group . 
 = = = = European Theater = = = = 
 As soon as the division was prepared for combat , it began moving into the Meurthe @-@ et @-@ Moselle region , and sent its first elements into combat at St. Remy in the Vosges Mountains on 1 November 1944 . The division as a whole began the relief of the 45th Infantry Division at Baccarat on 5 November , and assumed control of the sector on 9 November . The attack jumped off on 12 November , and the division drove against the German Winter Line in the Vosges Mountains . The 100th took <unk> and <unk> , pierced the German line , and seized <unk> @-@ l <unk> and Saint @-@ Blaise @-@ <unk> between 16 and 26 November . Later in November the division moved into the Vosges region , elements assisted in holding the Saverne Gap bridgehead while the bulk of the division went into reserve . The unit was relieved from assignment to VI Corps and transferred to the US XV Corps on 27 November 1944 . It then moved into the Moselle region . 
 In December 1944 , the division went on the offensive in the vicinity of Bitche , France . The division occupied the nearby areas of <unk> and Lemberg after fierce fighting on 6 – 10 December . The division then advanced to <unk> , which fell after fighting on 11 – 13 December . Fort <unk> , a major defensive work in the region , capitulated after a heavy assault by the 100th on 20 December . The division was ordered to halt its attack and to hold defensive positions south of Bitche as part of the Seventh Army during the Battle of the Bulge . Thanks to a stout defense , the men of the 100th later became known as the " Sons of Bitche " . The German counterattacks of 1 and 8 – 10 January 1945 were repulsed , after heavy fighting at Bitche . After further attacks stalled and the Germans began to withdraw , the sector was generally quiet and the division prepared to resume its offensive east . 
 On 15 March 1945 , the attack jumped off and on 16 March , Bitche fell to the 100th Infantry Division . The unit was then relieved from assignment to XV Corps , and transferred to XXI Corps on 22 March 1945 . Taking Neustadt and Ludwigshafen , the division reached the Rhine River on 24 March . On 25 March 1945 , the unit was returned from XXI Corps back to VI Corps . On 31 March 1945 , the 100th Infantry Division crossed the Rhine and moved south in the wake of the 10th Armored Division and then east across the Neckar River , establishing and enlarging a bridgehead from 4 to 11 April . Heilbronn fell after nine days of house @-@ to @-@ house combat on 12 April and the division resumed its rapid pursuit of the enemy , reaching Stuttgart by 21 April . The 100th was mopping up along the Neckar , southeast of Stuttgart on 23 April , when it was removed from VI Corps and assigned directly to the Seventh United States Army as an Echelon Above Corps Asset . The division was then assigned primarily to patrolling the sector east of Stuttgart . Shifting to <unk> on 30 April , the Division engaged in occupational duties as the war in Europe came to an end on V @-@ E Day . 
 The division spent 163 days in combat . During that time , it suffered 12 @,@ 215 casualties , including 933 killed in action , 3 @,@ 667 wounded in action , 589 missing in action , 1 prisoner of war , as well as 7 @,@ 425 non @-@ battle casualties . The division took 13 @,@ 351 prisoners of war on its own . Members of the division won three Medals of Honor , seven Distinguished Service Crosses , five Legions of Merit , 492 Silver Star Medals , 23 Soldier 's Medals , 5 @,@ 156 Bronze Star Medals , and 90 Air Medals . The division itself was awarded three campaign streamers for participation in the campaign . 
 100th Infantry Division returned to the United States via the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation on 10 January 1946 , and was released from active duty at Camp Patrick Henry , Virginia that day . The division then began the process of demobilization , before inactivating on 26 January . 
 = = = Cold War = = = 
 In fall of 1946 , the division was reactivated in the U.S. Army Reserve as the 100th Airborne Division in Louisville , Kentucky . This distinction as one of the few airborne divisions within the U.S. Army was brief ; in 1952 the division was once again redesignated the 100th Infantry Division . It would change names again in 1955 , this time to 100th Division ( Replacement Training ) . It would once again be reorganized in 1959 to its present designation as 100th Division ( Institutional Training ) . Its mission became to teach basic , advanced , and common training skills to soldiers from the Army 's active , reserve , and National Guard components . 
 In 1961 , some 1 @,@ 500 soldiers from the 100th were activated and sent to Fort Chaffee , Arkansas , in order to provide support during the Berlin Crisis . During their time on active duty , the 100th successfully trained some 32 @,@ 000 soldiers after thoroughly rebuilding and fixing the old Army base . The unit was returned to reserve status again in August 1962 . In 1968 , the division received its distinctive unit insignia , which alluded to its history in World War II and as a Kentucky @-@ based unit . 
 With the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan in 1968 , the division ceased to be centered on regiments and instead was reorganized with brigades . However , with the 199th Infantry Brigade active as a separate brigade , the division 's new brigades were activated from units that had been under its command in World War II . The division 's headquarters element ( which had since been replaced by a Headquarters and Headquarters Company ) was redesignated the 1st Brigade , 100th Division responsible for basic armor school training . The <unk> Field Artillery Battalion became the 2nd Brigade , 100th Division responsible for armored cavalry unit training . The 325th Engineer Battalion became the 3rd Brigade , 100th Division responsible for combat support training , and the 800th Ordnance Battalion became the 4th Brigade , 100th Division , responsible for combat service support training . 
 In 1978 , the 100th became the first Army Reserve formation to be equipped with its own squadrons of M1 Abrams tanks . With the arrival of the M3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles , the division 's mission profile changed from individual combat training to armor and armor reconnaissance training . By 1986 , it was the largest reserve unit within the state of Kentucky , commanding fifty @-@ eight percent of instate reservists . 
 = = = Gulf War and beyond = = = 
 At the outbreak of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 , the 100th was assigned to armor training at Fort Knox , Kentucky for deploying armor units . Armor training was a responsibility that the division continued after the war . 
 In 1995 the division was reorganized to include Army Reserve schools , taking over the responsibilities for new programs . In 1996 the 100th Division 's 1st Brigade worked with Readiness Group Knox to pioneer the national training experiment to reserve combat units at crew and platoon levels . Later that year , the division added three additional divisional brigades ; the 5th Brigade , 100th Division in Memphis , Tennessee for health services training , the 6th Brigade , 100th Division in Louisville , Kentucky for professional development training , and the 7th Brigade , 100th Division at Fort Knox , formed from the 100th Training Command and responsible for training exercises . The 5th Brigade moved to Millington , Tennessee in 1997 , and the 7th Brigade deactivated in 2000 . The 8th Brigade , 100th Division was also activated as a unit overseeing ROTC training . 
 During 1997 , the division was tasked with partial responsibility for Operation Future Challenge at Fort Knox , a six @-@ week Reserve Officer 's Training Corps Basic Camp during each summer . By 2000 , the 100th has assumed full responsibility for running the camp . Later that same year , the 100th began deactivating many of its M1A1 Abrams tanks as part of a reduction in military expenditures . 
 After the September 11 attacks , the 100th Division began taking on the job of preparing Army National Guard units from Ohio and Kentucky as they began to prepare for deployment in support of the War on Terrorism . 
 By 2006 , the division had moved its headquarters from Louisville to Fort Knox , easing distance strains in administration and training . In line with Army Reserve transformations , the 100th Division restructured , eliminating all but four of its brigades . The division shifted its focus from initial entry training to providing military occupational specialty and non @-@ commissioned officer training for four army career fields across the United States . The new 100th Division ( Operational Support ) teaches soldiers subjects from military intelligence , signal corps , civil affairs / psychological operations and health services .

Three soldiers earned the Medal of Honor serving with the division in World War II . They were Edward A. Silk , Mike <unk> , and Charles F. Carey , Jr .. A street in Bitche , France , is named for the 100th Infantry Division . 
 = John Boydell = 
 John Boydell ( / <unk> / ; 19 January 1720 ( New Style ) – 12 December 1804 ) was an 18th @-@ century British publisher noted for his reproductions of engravings . He helped alter the trade imbalance between Britain and France in engravings and initiated a British tradition in the art form . A former engraver himself , Boydell promoted the interests of artists as well as patrons and as a result his business prospered . 
 The son of a land surveyor , Boydell apprenticed himself to William Henry Toms , an artist he admired , and learned engraving . He established his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time . Boydell did not think much of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others , becoming a print dealer as well as an artist . He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind . To spark reciprocal trade , he commissioned William <unk> 's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson 's The Destruction of the Children of Niobe , which revolutionised the print trade . Ten years later , largely as a result of Boydell 's initiative , the trade imbalance had shifted , and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts . 
 In the 1790s , Boydell began a large Shakespeare venture that included the establishment of a Shakespeare Gallery , the publication of an illustrated edition of Shakespeare 's plays , and the release of a folio of prints depicting scenes from Shakespeare 's works . Some of the most illustrious painters of the day contributed , such as Benjamin West and Henry Fuseli . 
 Throughout his life , Boydell dedicated time to civic projects : he donated art to government institutions and ran for public office . In 1790 he became Lord Mayor of London . The French Revolutionary Wars led to a cessation in Continental trade at the end of the 1790s and without this business , Boydell 's firm declined and he was nearly bankrupt at his death in 1804 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Boydell was born , according to his monument in St Olave Old Jewry , London , ( later removed to St Margaret <unk> after St Olave 's demolition ) at <unk> , in the parish of <unk> , Shropshire , to Josiah and Mary Boydell ( née Milnes ) and was educated at least partially at Merchant Taylors ' School . His father was a land surveyor and young Boydell , the oldest of seven children , was expected to follow in his footsteps . In 1731 , when Boydell was eleven , the family moved to Hawarden , Flintshire . In 1739 he became house steward to MP John Lawton and accompanied him to London . A year later , like many other enterprising young men of the time , Boydell resolved to sail to the East Indies in hopes of making his fortune , but he abandoned the scheme in favour of returning to Flintshire and Elizabeth Lloyd , the woman he was courting . Whether or not he intended to pursue land surveying at this time is unclear . 
 In either 1740 or 1741 , Boydell saw a print of Hawarden Castle by William Henry Toms and was so delighted with it that he immediately set out again for London to learn printmaking and Lloyd promised to wait for him . Boydell apprenticed himself to Toms and enrolled in St Martin 's Lane Academy to learn drawing . Each day he worked about fourteen hours for Toms and then attended drawing classes at night . After six years , Boydell 's diligence allowed him to buy out the last year of his apprenticeship , and in 1746 he set up an independent shop on the Strand that specialised in topographical prints that cost six pence for a cheap print or one shilling for an expensive print . 
 Boydell 's willingness to assume responsibility for his own business so early in his career indicates that he had ambition and an enterprising spirit . Independent shops were risky in the 1740s because no strict copyright laws , other than the Engraving Copyright Act of 1734 ( known as " Hogarth 's Act " ) , had yet been instituted . The pirating of published books and prints became a profession in its own right and greatly decreased the profits of publishers such as Boydell . 
 Around 1747 , Boydell published his first major work , The Bridge Book , for which he drew and cut each print himself . It cost one shilling and contained six landscapes in each of which , not surprisingly , a bridge featured prominently . A year later , in 1748 , Boydell , apparently financially secure , married Elizabeth Lloyd . The couple did not have any children and Elizabeth died in 1781 . 
 Boydell realised early in his career that his engravings had little artistic merit , saying later that they were collected by others " more to show the improvement of art in this country [ Britain ] , since the period of their publication , than from any idea of their own merits " . This may explain why in 1751 , when he became a member of the Stationers ' Company , he started buying other artists ' plates and publishing them in addition to his own . Ordinarily an engraver , such as William Hogarth , had his own shop or took his finished engravings to a publisher . In adopting the dual role of artist and print dealer , Boydell altered the traditional organisation of print shops . He was not subject to the whims of public taste : if his engraves did not sell well , he could supplement his earnings by trading in the prints of other artists . He also understood the concerns of both the engraver and the publisher . In fact , as a publisher , he did much to help raise the level of respect for engravers in addition to furnishing them with better paying commissions . 
 = = Success = = 
 In 1751 , with his large volume of prints , Boydell moved to larger premises at 90 Cheapside . By 1755 , he had published A Collection of One Hundred and Two Views , & C. in England and Wales . This cheap but successful book gave him capital to invest . He became increasingly immersed in the commercial side of the print business and like most print dealers began importing prints to sell . These included print reproductions of landscapes by artists such as Claude Lorrain and Salvator Rosa . The bulk of the imports came from the undisputed masters of engraving during the 18th century : the French . Boydell made a small fortune in the 1750s from these imported prints . His early success was acknowledged in 1760 when he was named a member of the Royal Society . Winifred Friedman , who has written extensively on Boydell , explains that despite this success , " [ w ] hat rankled Boydell was that the French would not extend credit , or exchange prints ; he was required to produce hard cash . Boydell took action , and this was the turning point . " 
 In 1761 , Boydell decided that he would attempt to trade with the French in kind — something they had refused in the past because of the poor quality of British engravings . To inaugurate this change , he had to have a truly spectacular print . To this end , he hired William Woollett , the foremost engraver in England , to engrave Richard Wilson 's Destruction of the Children of Niobe . Woollett had already successfully engraved Claude Lorrain 's 1663 painting The Father of Psyche Sacrificing at the Temple of Apollo for Boydell in 1760 . Boydell paid him approximately £ 100 for the Niobe engraving , a staggering amount compared to the usual rates . This single act of patronage raised engravers ' fees throughout London . The print was wildly successful , but more importantly , the French accepted it as payment in kind . In fact , it was the first British print actively desired on the Continent . By 1770 , the British were exporting far more prints than they were importing , largely due to Boydell . 
 Boydell 's business flourished and he soon hired his nephew , Josiah Boydell , to assist him . Boydell 's biographer , Sven Bruntjen , hypothesizes that one of the reasons for Boydell 's early and phenomenal success was his specialisation . Unlike " his competitors [ who sold manuals , atlases and other assorted books ] ... his [ business had an ] almost exclusive concentration on the sale of reproductive prints " . Bruntjen argues that " despite the extensive sales of varied types of reproductive prints , it was the contemporary history print which accounted for the major part of Boydell 's success as a print dealer " . Most notable among these was the Death of General Wolfe a 1770 painting by Benjamin West , engraved by Woollett for Boydell in 1776 . As early as 1767 , Boydell had stopped engraving prints himself and began exclusively relying on commissions and trades and it was from these that he profited . 
 Boydell had opened up a new market with Niobe and he quickly followed up this success . With a prospering business and capital in reserve , he embarked on several ambitious projects , often simultaneously . In 1769 , he began A Collection of Prints , Engraved after the Most Capital Paintings in England . Its last , and ninth volume , was finished in 1792 to great critical and financial success . In 1773 , he began A Set of Prints Engraved after the Most Capital Paintings in the Collection of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress of Russia , Lately in the Possession of the Earl of Orford at Houghton in Norfolk , which was finished in 1788 . 
 In addition to these projects and in the middle of his Shakespeare undertaking Boydell experimented with aquatint in An History of the River Thames , published in 1796 . Bruntjen writes , " although not the first colored aquatint book , [ it ] was the first major one , and it was to set an example for the type of illustration that was to enjoy widespread popularity in England for some forty years " . Boydell also published The Original Work of William Hogarth in 1790 and The Poetical Works of John Milton and The Life of the Poet ( i.e. , Milton ) in 1794 . 
 The productivity and profitability of Boydell 's firm spurred the British print industry in general . By 1785 , annual exports of British prints reached £ 200 @,@ 000 while imports fell to £ 100 . Boydell was acknowledged and praised throughout England as the agent of this stunning economic reversal . In 1773 he was awarded the Royal Academy Gold Medal for his services in advancing the print trade . In 1789 , at the Royal Academy dinner , the Prince of Wales toasted " an English tradesman who patronizes art better than the Grand Monarque , Alderman Boydell , the Commercial Maecenas " .

 Boydell 's crowning achievement was his Shakespeare project , which was to occupy much of the last two decades of his life . The project contained three parts : an illustrated edition of Shakespeare 's plays , a public gallery of paintings depicting scenes from the plays , and a folio of prints based on the paintings . 
 The idea of a grand Shakespeare edition was conceived at a dinner at Josiah Boydell ’ s home in November 1786 . The guest list itself is evidence of Boydell ’ s extensive connections in the artistic world : Benjamin West , painter to King George III ; George Romney , a renowned painter ; George Nicol , bookseller to the king and painter ; William Hayley , a poet ; John Hoole , a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle ; and Daniel Braithwaite , an engineer . Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby . Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell 's , he was the one to seize and pursue it . He wanted to use the edition to facilitate the development of a British school of history painting . 
 The " magnificent and accurate " Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was the focus of the enterprise . The print folio and the gallery were simply offshoots of the main project . In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition , Nicol wrote that " splendor and magnificence , united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition " . Boydell was responsible for the " splendor " , and George Steevens , a renowned Shakespearean editor , was responsible for the " correctness of text " . The volumes themselves were handsome , with gilded pages . Even the quality of the paper was extraordinarily high . The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the customer desired . The first volumes of the Dramatick Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805 . The edition was financed through a subscription campaign in which the buyers would offer partial payment up front and then pay the remaining sum on delivery . This practice was necessitated by the fact that over £ 350 @,@ 000 — an enormous sum at the time — was eventually spent on the enterprise . 
 When it opened on 4 May 1789 at 52 Pall Mall , the Shakespeare Gallery contained 34 paintings and by the end of its run it had between 167 and 170 . The Gallery itself was a hit with the public and became a fashionable attraction . It took over the public 's imagination and became an end in and of itself . 
 To illustrate the edition and to provide images for the folio , Boydell obtained the assistance of the most eminent painters and engravers of the day . Artists included Richard Westall , Thomas Stothard , George Romney , Henry Fuseli , Benjamin West , Angelica Kauffman , Robert Smirke , John Opie , and Boydell 's nephew and business partner , Josiah Boydell . Among the engravers were Francesco Bartolozzi and Thomas Kirk . Boydell 's relationships with his artists , particularly his illustrators , was generally congenial . James Northcote praised Boydell 's liberal payments . He wrote in an 1821 letter that Boydell " did more for the advancement of the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together ! He paid me more nobly than any other person has done ; and his memory I shall every hold in reverence " . 
 At the beginning of the enterprise , reactions were generally positive . Two reviews from the most influential newspapers in London at the time solidified and validated the public 's interest in the project and the artists ' efforts . However , there was also some criticism . In particular the satirical engraver James Gillray appears to have been peeved at not being commissioned to engrave any of the Shakespeare scenes and , in revenge , published Shakespeare Sacrificed : Or the Offering to Avarice just six weeks after the gallery opened . Gillray followed up with further cartoons such as Boydell sacrificing the Works of Shakespeare to the Devil of Money @-@ Bags . As the project dragged on , the criticism increased . Yet , Boydell 's project still inspired imitators . Thomas Macklin attempted to found a Poet 's Gallery similar to the Shakespeare Gallery and several histories of England on the scale of the Shakespeare edition were also started . However , like Boydell 's venture , they ultimately ended in financial disaster . 
 The folio , which collected together the engravings from the paintings , has been the most lasting legacy of the Boydell enterprise : it was reissued throughout the 19th century and scholars have described it as a precursor to the modern coffee table book . 
 = = Civic service = = 
 Amidst all of the work generated by these publishing enterprises , Boydell still found time to be alderman of Cheap ward in 1782 , master of the Stationers ' Company in 1783 , sheriff of London in 1785 , and Lord Mayor of London in 1790 . With both a dedicated civic spirit and an eye towards business promotion , Boydell took advantage of his public positions to advocate public and private patronage of the arts . He frequently donated paintings from his own collections to the Corporation of London to be hung in the Guildhall . He hoped that his donation might spur others to similar generosity . However , he remained a solitary contributor . A catalogue was published in 1794 listing all of the works Boydell had donated to the Guildhall . In the preface , he explained why he had made such large gifts : 
 It may be a matter of wonder to some , what <unk> I could have to present the City of London with so many expensive Pictures ; the principal reasons that influence me were these : First : to show my respect for the Corporation , and my Fellow Citizens , Secondly : to give pleasure to the Public , and Foreigners in general , Thirdly : to be of service to the Artists , by shewing their works to the greatest advantage : and , Fourthly : for the mere purpose of pleasing myself . 
 In 1794 Boydell commissioned and donated Industry and Prudence by Robert Smirke . Most of the other works Boydell donated were similarly didactic . He was appealing to his fellow tradespeople and craftspeople with these gifts , a middle class which would have been only too pleased to see their values promoted by such a prominent figure . 
 In a speech before the Council to advocate the renovation of a building for the purpose of displaying public art , Boydell made the striking claim that if the rich could be persuaded to patronise art , they would forgo their wicked ways : 
 one might be found amongst the many <unk> of the present age , instead of ruining themselves by gaming , or laying snares to debauch young Females , by their false promises and many other bad vices ; would be rejoiced at such an opportunity , of reclaiming themselves by withdrawing from the snares laid for them by bad and designing Men and Women , who constantly lay wait to lead astray the young and unwary that are possessed of large property , such might here have the pleasure and satisfaction to make a real Paradise on earth , by illuminating a place that would for ever shine and display their generosity . 
 Boydell 's middle @-@ class consumers would have approved of his connection between morality and art . 
 = = Business decline , death , and legacy = = 
 In 1789 , the French revolution broke out and four years later war erupted between Britain and France . Throughout the next tumultuous decade , trade with Europe became increasingly difficult . As Boydell 's business relied heavily on foreign trade , especially French , his livelihood was threatened . When this market was cut off due to war in 1793 , Boydell 's business declined substantially . He was forced to sell the Shakespeare Gallery , via a lottery , in order for his business to remain solvent . He died in December 1804 before the lottery was drawn , but after all of its 22 @,@ 000 tickets had been sold . 
 According to Josiah , John Boydell caught a cold by going to the Old Bailey on a damp , foggy day to do his duty as an alderman . He died on 12 December 1804 almost bankrupt , but not without great public acclaim . He was buried on 19 December 1804 at the Church of St. Olave Old Jewry , his funeral attended by the Lord Mayor , aldermen , and several artists . 
 Boydell had , almost single @-@ handedly , made British prints a viable economic commodity and had demolished the French domination of the trade . In a letter to Sir John Anderson , asking Parliament for the private Lottery Act to sell off the Shakespeare Gallery , Boydell stated that it was " sufficient to say , that the whole course of that commerce [ print trade ] is changed " . The Times wrote on 7 May 1789 : " Historical painting and engraving are almost exclusively indebted to Mr. Boydell for their present advancement . " Boydell also played a part in changing the nature of art patronage in Britain . Until he advocated public patronage in his various civic posts , the government had little to do with British art . According to Bruntjen , " it was due to the enthusiasm of Boydell and others that the English government eventually provided funds for the establishment of the National Gallery in 1824 " . Boydell helped to make artists independent of aristocratic patronage by providing commercial opportunities for them . He " attempted to free artists from the traditional forms of state and aristocratic patronage by creating a public taste for reproductive prints of historical subjects " . Boydell 's entry in the Dictionary of National Biography ends with the assessment that " no print publisher before or since has ever exerted as much influence on the course of British art " . 
 Boydell 's nephew and business partner , Josiah Boydell , continued his uncle 's business for some time at 90 Cheapside , but by 1818 , the business was wound up by Jane Boydell , and the assets purchased by Hurst , Robinson , and Co . 
 = Life 's Shop Window = 
 Life 's Shop Window is a 1914 American silent drama film directed by J. Gordon Edwards and starring Claire Whitney and Stuart Holmes . It is a film adaptation of the eponymous 1907 novel by Annie Sophie Cory . The film depicts the story of English orphan Lydia Wilton ( Whitney ) , and her husband Bernard Chetwin ( Holmes ) . Although Wilton 's marriage is legitimate , it was conducted in secret , and she is accused of having a child out of wedlock . Forced to leave England , she reunites with her husband in Arizona . There , she is tempted by infidelity with an old acquaintance , Eustace Pelham , before seeing the error of her ways and returning to her family . 
 Life 's Shop Window was the first film produced , rather than simply distributed , by William Fox 's Box Office Attractions Company , the corporate predecessor to Fox Film . Several reviewers approved of the film 's expurgated treatment of the novel 's plot , although opinions of the quality of the film itself were mixed . It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York , and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere . Like many of Fox 's early works , it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Bernard Chetwin is a boarder at John Anderson 's farm in England . He is unimpressed by Anderson 's spoiled daughter Bella , but is attracted to their orphaned servant , Lydia Wilton . She tells him of her dreams for a happier life , and they fall in love . Wilton also meets Eustace Pelham , who introduces her to his philosophy of " life 's shop window " : that many people make life decisions on purely superficial grounds . Chetwin marries Wilton in a secret ceremony . 
 Intending to establish a farm to support his new family , Chetwin leaves the English countryside for Arizona . Concerned about the dangers of frontier territory , he travels without his newlywed wife , intending to send for her later . When she gives birth to Chetwin 's child , Anderson 's wife refuses to accept evidence of her marriage , and throws her out of the farm for having a child out of wedlock . She takes the infant with her to Arizona and reunites with Chetwin at his ranch . 
 The demands of managing the ranch consume all of Chetwin 's time , leaving Wilton to feel neglected and unloved . One day , a traveler is injured near the ranch , whom she recognizes as Pelham . Pelham courts her , taking advantage of her loneliness . Although she admits she does not love him , he convinces her to abandon her family and run away with him . As she is preparing to depart , she is confronted by Starlight , an Indian woman who works as a servant on the ranch , who reminds Wilton of the needs of her child . She spurns Pelham and returns to her family . Eventually , Chetwin forgives her and devotes more of his time to her . Pelham may have been killed by Starlight , although his ultimate fate is left unclear .

 Annie Sophie Cory , writing as Victoria Cross , was a popular but controversial British New Woman novelist . Adultery and female sexuality are common themes in her works , which often reversed the expected gender roles of the time , permitting female desire to motivate the plot . Elizabeth <unk> described Lydia , the main character of Cory 's 1907 novel Life 's Shop Window , as " a very modernist heroine " , comparing her to a more socially successful Hester Prynne . Like many of Cross 's novels , it attracted controversy , and was banned for a time by the Circulating Libraries Association in the United Kingdom . Life 's Shop Window had already become the basis of a successful play , based on an expurgated version of the novel 's plot . 
 In 1914 , William Fox was operating the successful film distributor Box Office Attraction Film Rental Company . Box Office purchased films from studios such as Balboa Amusement Producing Company , showing them in Fox 's New York area theaters and renting prints to exhibitors elsewhere in the country . Life 's Shop Window may have originally been considered for production in this manner . However , Fox decided he was unwilling to depend on others for the products his business required , and instead prepared to produce his own films under the Box Office Attractions Company name . He purchased the Éclair film studio in Fort Lee , New Jersey and property in Staten Island , arranged for actors and crew , and began production with an adaptation of an established work , as was common at the time . 
 Rights to the film adaptation were purchased for $ 100 . Like the theatrical adaptation , Mary Asquith 's screenplay removed much of the book 's controversial sexual elements , censorship intended to make Fox 's nascent studio appear more respectable to the industry . Fox selected J. Gordon Edwards to direct , in what may have been his directorial debut ; credit for the earlier St. Elmo is disputed , with sources disagreeing whether Edwards or Bertram Bracken directed . 
 Filming for Life 's Shop Window took place at a farm on the Staten Island property , and possibly in the Fort Lee studio . The budget for this five @-@ reel feature film was small , with the cost of production reported as $ 4 @,@ 500 or $ 6 @,@ 000 ; Fox would exaggerate the cost of production to over thirty times its true value in later advertising . At the time , films of comparable length generally required between $ 20 @,@ 000 and $ 30 @,@ 000 to produce . Film historian Terry <unk> reported that Fox was not pleased with the completed film and initially declared : " Let 's burn the damn thing " , before being convinced to allow its release . Life 's Shop Window premiered at the Academy of Music in New York on October 20 , 1914 , although it did not receive its official release until November 19 . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Contemporary reviews were mixed . Moving Picture World 's film critic W. Stephen Bush called the film " first @-@ class " despite problems with the plot , cinematography , and the " unbelievably poor " music accompaniment at the Academy of Music . He also remarked on the censorship of the novel 's plot , stating that " not even the sternest of moralists can find anything objectionable " in the film . Fox 's response was published the following week , in which he praised Bush 's review and committed to avoiding " the salacious or the sex drama " . Peter Milne of Motion Picture News also praised the decision to make a " clean " adaptation of the novel , as well as the film 's realism . However , Variety gave the film a negative review that criticized its editing , its direction , and Whitney 's acting ability , suggesting that the film would profit solely on the name of the book it adapted . 
 Despite some critical reviews , the film was popular , especially with women , and financially successful . Double @-@ file lines over a block long were reported for opening @-@ week showings at the Audubon Theatre in New York . After the incorporation of the Fox Film Corporation , distribution of this film continued under the new company 's name . The success of the initial New York showings featured in subsequent advertising , as did Fox 's greatly inflated claims of the cost of production . 
 The 1937 Fox vault fire destroyed most of Fox 's silent films , probably including Life 's Shop Window . The Library of Congress is not aware of any extant copies .

 Richard Bruce Cheney , generally known as Dick Cheney ( born January 30 , 1941 ) is an American politician and businessman who was the 46th Vice President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 , under President George W. Bush . 
 Born in Lincoln , Nebraska , Cheney was primarily raised in Sumner , Nebraska , and Casper , Wyoming . He attended Yale , then the University of Wyoming , where he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science . He began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger , eventually working his way into the White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations , where he later served as the White House Chief of Staff , from 1975 to 1977 . In 1978 , Cheney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives representing Wyoming 's At @-@ large congressional district from 1979 to 1989 ; he was reelected five times , briefly serving as House Minority Whip in 1989 . Cheney was selected to be the Secretary of Defense during the Presidency of George H. W. Bush , holding the position for the majority of Bush 's term from 1989 to 1993 . During his time in the Department of Defense , Cheney oversaw the 1991 Operation Desert Storm , among other actions . Out of office during the Clinton administration , Cheney was the Chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000 . 
 In July 2000 , Cheney was chosen by presumptive Republican Presidential nominee George W. Bush as his running mate in the 2000 Presidential election . They defeated their Democratic opponents , incumbent Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman . In 2004 Cheney was reelected to his second term as Vice President , defeating Senator John Kerry 's running mate , Senator John Edwards . During Cheney 's tenure as Vice President , he played a lead behind @-@ the @-@ scenes role in Bush Administration 's response to the September 11 attacks and coordination of the Global War on Terrorism . He was an early proponent of the Iraq War and defender of the Administration 's record on anti @-@ terrorism . He became at odds with the views of President Bush for his support of gay marriage in 2004 . Cheney was often criticized for the Bush Administration 's policies regarding the War on Terror , NSA <unk> and so @-@ called " enhanced interrogation techniques . " 
 In 2011 , Cheney published his memoir In My Time : A Personal and Political Memoir , written with daughter Liz Cheney , and in 2015 , published another book , Exceptional : Why the World Needs a Powerful America , again co @-@ authored with his daughter . He has been cited as the most powerful Vice President in American history . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Cheney was born in Lincoln , Nebraska , the son of Marjorie Lorraine ( née Dickey ) and Richard Herbert Cheney . He is of predominantly English , as well as Welsh , Irish , and French Huguenot ancestry ; Cheney 's 8th great @-@ grandfather , William Cheney , immigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 17th century . Although not a direct descendant , he is <unk> related to Benjamin Pierce Cheney ( 1815 – 1895 ) , the early American <unk> . Cheney is a very distant cousin of both Harry S. Truman and Barack Obama ; the three share a common ancestor in Mareen Duvall , a Huguenot who fled from France to England in the 17th century and later settled in Maryland . His father was a soil conservation agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and his mother was a softball star in the 1930s ; Cheney was one of three children . 
 He attended Calvert Elementary School before his family moved to Casper , Wyoming , where he attended <unk> County High School . 
 He attended Yale University , but by his own account had problems adjusting to the college , and failed out twice . Among the influential teachers from his days in New Haven was Professor H. Bradford Westerfield , whom Cheney repeatedly credited with having helped to shape his approach to foreign policy . He later attended the University of Wyoming , where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science . He subsequently started , but did not finish , doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin – Madison . 
 In November 1962 , at the age of 21 , Cheney was convicted of driving while intoxicated ( DWI ) . He was arrested for DWI again the following year . Cheney said that the arrests made him " think about where I was and where I was headed . I was headed down a bad road if I continued on that course " . 
 In 1964 , he married Lynne Vincent , his high school sweetheart , whom he had met at age 14 . 
 When Cheney became eligible for the draft , during the Vietnam War , he applied for and received five draft deferments . In 1989 , The Washington Post writer George C. Wilson interviewed Cheney as the next Secretary of Defense ; when asked about his deferments , Cheney reportedly said , " I had other priorities in the ' 60s than military service " . Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four , owing to sub @-@ par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education . Initially , Cheney was not drafted due to his marriage to Lynne Cheney . When the draft was expanded to include married men without children , he applied for four deferments in sequence . He applied for his fifth exemption on January 19 , 1966 , when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant . He was granted 3 @-@ A status , the " hardship " exemption , which excluded men with children or dependent parents . In January 1967 , Cheney turned 26 and was no longer eligible for the draft .

 Cheney 's political career began in 1969 , as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration . He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld , who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969 – 70 . He held several positions in the years that followed : White House Staff Assistant in 1971 , Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971 – 73 , and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974 – 1975 . As deputy assistant , Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld , including use of the US Justice Department , that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article , published by The New York Times , in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program , Operation Ivy Bells . 
 Cheney was Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Chief of Staff under Gerald Ford . When Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense , Cheney became White House Chief of Staff , succeeding Rumsfeld . He later was campaign manager for Ford 's 1976 presidential campaign .

 He voted against the creation of the U.S. Department of Education , citing his concern over budget deficits and expansion of the federal government , and claiming that the Department was an encroachment on states ' rights . He voted against funding Head Start , but reversed his position in 2000 . 
 Cheney initially voted in 1978 against establishing a national holiday in honor of Martin Luther King , Jr . , but supported creation of the holiday five years later in 1983 . 
 Cheney supported Bob Michel 's ( R @-@ IL ) bid to become Republican Minority Leader . In April 1980 , Cheney endorsed Governor Ronald Reagan for President , becoming one of Reagan 's earliest supporters . 
 In 1986 , after President Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to impose economic sanctions on South Africa for its policy of apartheid , Cheney was one of 83 Representatives to vote against overriding Reagan 's veto . In later years , he articulated his opposition to unilateral sanctions against many different countries , stating " they almost never work " and that in that case they might have ended up hurting the people instead . 
 In 1986 , Cheney , along with 145 Republicans and 31 Democrats , voted against a non @-@ binding Congressional resolution calling on the South African government to release Nelson Mandela from prison , after the Democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required Mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the African National Congress ( ANC ) and requiring it to oust the communist faction from its leadership ; the resolution was defeated . Appearing on CNN , Cheney addressed criticism for this , saying he opposed the resolution because the ANC " at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and had a number of interests that were fundamentally inimical to the United States .

 President George H. W. Bush nominated Cheney for the office of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S. Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position . The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0 and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993 . He directed the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East . In 1991 , he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush . Later that year , he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official , an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards . 
 Cheney has said his time at the Pentagon was the most rewarding period of his public service career , calling it " the one that stands out . " In 2014 , Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W.

 Cheney worked closely with Pete Williams , Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs , and Paul Wolfowitz , Under Secretary of Defense for Policy , from the beginning of his tenure . He focused primarily on external matters , and left most of the internal DoD management to Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood . 
 = = = Budgetary practices = = = 
 Cheney 's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget . Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military , following the Reagan Administration 's peacetime defense buildup at the height of the Cold War . As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget , Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft , the B @-@ 2 stealth bomber , the V @-@ 22 Osprey tilt @-@ wing helicopter , the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile , totaling approximately $ 4 @.@ 5 billion in light of changed world politics . Cheney opposed the V @-@ 22 program , which Congress had already appropriated funds for , and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting . When the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989 , it settled on a figure between the Administration 's request and the House Armed Services Committee 's recommendation . 
 In subsequent years under Cheney , the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990 . Early in 1991 , he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid @-@ 1990s to 1 @.@ 6 million , compared with 2 @.@ 2 million when he entered office . Cheney 's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992 , omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want , and omitting unrequested reserve forces . 
 Over his four years as Secretary of Defense , Cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth , despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress . The Department of Defense 's total <unk> authority in current dollars declined from $ 291 billion to $ 270 billion . Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent , from about 2 @.@ 2 million in 1989 to about 1 @.@ 8 million in 1993 . Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending , Cheney directed the development of a Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post @-@ Cold War era . 
 = = = Political climate and agenda = = = 
 Cheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as Iraq , Iran , and North Korea , could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The end of the Cold War , the fall of the Soviet Union , and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 's ( NATO 's ) purpose and makeup . Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term ; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe . 
 Cheney 's views on NATO reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former Eastern Bloc countries , where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability . He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor , Russian President Boris Yeltsin . Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies . 
 Cheney persuaded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war planes in the nation . This was an important element of the success of the Gulf War , as well as a lightning @-@ rod for Islamists , such as Osama bin Laden , who opposed having non @-@ Muslim armies near their holy sites .

 Using economic sanctions and political pressure , the United States mounted a campaign to drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor . In May 1989 , after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama , Noriega nullified the election outcome , drawing intensified pressure . In October , Noriega suppressed a military coup , but in December , after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S. serviceman , the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney 's direction . The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States , protect U.S. lives and property , and restore Panamanian civil liberties . Although the mission was controversial , U.S. forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the Presidency ; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992 . 
 In 1991 , the Somali Civil War drew the world 's attention . In August 1992 , the United States began to provide humanitarian assistance , primarily food , through a military airlift . At President Bush 's direction , Cheney dispatched the first of 26 @,@ 000 U.S. troops to Somalia as part of the Unified Task Force ( UNITAF ) , designed to provide security and food relief .

 On August 1 , 1990 , Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent the invading Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait , a small petroleum @-@ rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory .

An estimated 140 @,@ 000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia / Kuwait border .

 Shortly after the Iraqi invasion , Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested U.S. military assistance . The United Nations took action as well , passing a series of resolutions condemning Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait ; the UN Security Council authorized " all means necessary " to eject Iraq from Kuwait , and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by January 15 , 1991 . By then , the United States had a force of about 500 @,@ 000 stationed in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf . Other nations , including Britain , Canada , France , Italy , Syria , and Egypt , contributed troops , and other allies , most notably Germany and Japan , agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort , named Operation Desert Shield . 
 On January 12 , 1991 , Congress authorized Bush to use military force to enforce Iraq 's compliance with UN resolutions on Kuwait .

 The first phase of Operation Desert Storm , which began on January 17 , 1991 , was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraqi forces , targeting key Iraqi command and control centers , including the cities of Baghdad and Basra . Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war . He flew with Powell to the region ( specifically Riyadh ) to review and finalize the ground war plans . 
 After an air offensive of more than five weeks , UN Coalition forces launched the ground war on February 24 . Within 100 hours , Iraqi forces had been routed from Kuwait and Schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective — expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait — had been met on February 27 . After consultation with Cheney and other members of his national security team , Bush declared a suspension of hostilities . On working with this national security team , Cheney has said , " there have been five Republican presidents since Eisenhower . I worked for four of them and worked closely with a fifth — the Reagan years when I was part of the House leadership . The best national security team I ever saw was that one . The least friction , the most cooperation , the highest degree of trust among the principals , especially . "

 A total of 147 U.S. military personnel died in combat , and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes . Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3 , and a permanent cease @-@ fire on April 6 . There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power . Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct , but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces . Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon . In an April 15 , 1994 interview with C @-@ SPAN , Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad . Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a " bad idea " and would have led to a " quagmire " , explaining that : 
 Because if we 'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone . There wouldn 't have been anybody else with us . There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq . None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq . Once you got to Iraq and took it over , took down Saddam Hussein 's government , then what are you going to put in its place ? That 's a very volatile part of the world , and if you take down the central government of Iraq , you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off : part of it , the Syrians would like to have to the west , part of it — eastern Iraq — the Iranians would like to claim , they fought over it for eight years . In the north you 've got the Kurds , and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey , then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey . It 's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq . The other thing was casualties . Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had . But for the 146 Americans killed in action , and for their families — it wasn 't a cheap war . And the question for the president , in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad , took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein , was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth ? Our judgment was , not very many , and I think we got it right . 
 Cheney regarded the Gulf War as an example of the kind of regional problem the United States was likely to continue to face in the future . 
 We 're always going to have to be involved [ in the Middle East ] . Maybe it 's part of our national character , you know we like to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up , put a ribbon around it . You deploy a force , you win the war and the problem goes away . But it doesn 't work that way in the Middle East . It never has , and isn 't likely to in my lifetime .

 Between 1987 and 1989 , during his last term in Congress , Cheney was a director of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization . 
 With the new Democratic administration under President Bill Clinton in January 1993 , Cheney left the Department of Defense and joined the American Enterprise Institute . He also served a second term as a Council on Foreign Relations director from 1993 to 1995 . From 1995 until 2000 , he served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton , a Fortune 500 company . 
 Cheney 's record as CEO was subject to some dispute among Wall Street analysts . A 1998 merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries attracted the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton 's lack of accounting transparency . Although Cheney is not named as an individual defendant in the suit , Halliburton shareholders are pursuing a class @-@ action lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated its stock price during this period . In June 2011 , the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case to continue in litigation . Cheney was named in a December 2010 corruption complaint filed by the Nigerian government against Halliburton , which the company settled for $ 250 million . 
 During Cheney 's term , Halliburton changed its accounting practices regarding revenue realization of disputed costs on major construction projects . Cheney resigned as CEO of Halliburton on July 25 , 2000 . As vice president , he argued that this step removed any conflict of interest . Cheney 's net worth , estimated to be between $ 19 million and $ 86 million , is largely derived from his post at Halliburton . His 2006 gross joint income with his wife was nearly $ 8 @.@ 82 million . 
 He was also a member of the board of advisors of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs ( <unk> ) before becoming vice president .

 In early 2000 , while serving as the CEO of Halliburton , Cheney headed then @-@ Governor of Texas George W. Bush 's vice @-@ presidential search committee . On July 25 , after reviewing Cheney 's findings , Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket . Halliburton reportedly reached agreement on July 20 to allow Cheney to retire , with a package estimated at $ 20 million . 
 A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers ' license and voter registration back to Wyoming . This change was necessary to allow Texas ' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President . 
 Cheney campaigned against Al Gore 's running mate , Joseph Lieberman , in the 2000 presidential election . While the election was undecided , the Bush @-@ Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration . So , Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington . This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet . According to Craig Unger , Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department , and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet as director of the Central Intelligence Agency .

 Following the September 11 , 2001 attacks , Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons . For a period , Cheney stayed at a variety of undisclosed locations , out of public view . Cheney later revealed in his autobiographical memoir " In My Time " that these " undisclosed locations " included his official Vice Presidential residence , his home in Wyoming , and Camp David . He also utilized a heavy security detail , employing a motorcade of 12 to 18 government vehicles for his daily commute from the Vice Presidential residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory to the White House . 
 On the morning of June 29 , 2002 , Cheney served as Acting President of the United States under the terms of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution , while Bush was undergoing a colonoscopy . Cheney acted as President from 11 : 09 UTC that day until Bush resumed the powers of the presidency at 13 : 24 UTC .
