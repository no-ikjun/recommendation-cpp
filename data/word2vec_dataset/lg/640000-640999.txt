 Having used London @-@ based Indian musicians from the Asian Music Circle on " Love You To " and " Within You Without You " , Harrison recorded " The Inner Light " in India with some of the country 's foremost contemporary classical players . In early January 1968 , he travelled to HMV Studios in Bombay to record part of the score for Wonderwall , much of which would appear on his debut solo album , Wonderwall Music . The day after completing the soundtrack recordings , on 13 January , Harrison taped additional pieces for possible later use , one of which was the instrumental track for " The Inner Light " . Five takes of the song were recorded on a two @-@ track recorder . 
 The musicians on the track were Aashish Khan ( sarod ) , Mahapurush Misra ( pakhavaj ) , Hanuman Jadev ( shehnai ) , Hariprasad Chaurasia ( bansuri ) and Rijram Desad ( harmonium ) . In Lavezzoli 's estimation , although these instruments are more commonly associated with the Hindustani discipline , the performers play them in a South Indian style , which adds to the Carnatic identity of the song . The recording features tabla tarang over the quiet , vocal interludes . Author Simon Leng refutes the presence of the oboe @-@ like shehnai , however , saying that this part was played on an esraj , a bow @-@ played string instrument . As with the Wonderwall selections recorded at HMV , Harrison directed the musicians but did not perform on the instrumental track .

 Harrison completed the song in London during sessions for a new Beatles single , which was intended to cover their absence while the group were in Rishikesh , India , with the Maharishi . Once the Bombay recording had been transferred to four @-@ track tape , Harrison recorded his vocal part for " The Inner Light " on 6 February , at EMI 's Abbey Road Studios . Lacking confidence in his ability to sing in so high a register , he had to be coaxed by Lennon and Paul McCartney into delivering the requisite performance . Two days later , McCartney and Lennon overdubbed backing vocals at the very end of the song , over the words " Do all without doing " . 
 " The Inner Light " was held in high regard by Harrison 's bandmates , particularly McCartney , and was selected as the B @-@ side for the forthcoming single . It was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single , in addition to being the only Beatles studio recording made outside Europe . Everett writes that Lennon 's admiration for the track was evident from his subsequent creation of the song " Julia " through " a very parallel process " – in that instance , by adapting a work by Kahlil Gibran . Although Harrison had served as the producer at the Bombay session , only George Martin received a production credit for " The Inner Light " . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The song was issued as the B @-@ side of " Lady Madonna " on 15 March 1968 in the UK , with the US release following three days later . While Chris Welch of Melody Maker expressed doubts about the hit potential of the A @-@ side , Billboard magazine 's reviewer commented on the aptness of " The Inner Light " , given the band 's concurrent " meditation spell " . In America , the B @-@ side charted independently on the Billboard Hot 100 for one week , placing at number 96 . In Australia , it was listed with " Lady Madonna " , as a double A @-@ side , when the single topped the Go @-@ Set national singles chart . 
 Among Beatles biographers , Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977 that " The Inner Light " " proved to be the best – and last – of George 's attempts to incorporate Indian music into the context of the Beatles " . Schaffner paired it with " Within You Without You " as raga rock songs that " feature haunting , exquisitely lovely melodies " , and as two works that could have been among Harrison 's " greatest achievements " had they been made with his bandmates ' participation . Bruce Eder of AllMusic describes the same tracks as " a pair of beautiful songs … that were effectively solo recordings " . Ian MacDonald likens the song 's " studied innocence and exotic sweetness " to recordings by the Incredible String Band and concludes : " ' The Inner Light ' is both spirited and charming – one of its author 's most attractive pieces . " 
 Writing for Mojo magazine in 2003 , John Harris similarly admired it as Harrison 's " loveliest addition of Indian music to The Beatles ' repertoire " . In Ian Inglis ' view : " it is the extraordinary synthesis of separate musical and lyrical traditions ( in this case , Indian instrumentation , Chinese philosophy , and Western popular music ) that distinguishes the song . Harrison 's uncharacteristically warm vocal weaves in and around the delicate , almost fragile , melody to deliver a simple testimony to the power of meditation ... " With regard to the song 's influence , Inglis recognises Harrison 's espousal of Eastern spirituality as " a serious and important development that reflected popular music 's increasing maturity " , and a statement that prepared rock audiences for later religious pronouncements by Pete Townshend , Carlos Santana , John McLaughlin , Cat Stevens and Bob Dylan . 
 Nick DeRiso of the music website Something Else ! considers " The Inner Light " to be one of its composer 's " most successful marriages of raga and rock " and , through Harrison 's introduction of instruments such as sarod , shehnai and pakhavaj , a key recording in the evolution of the 1980s world music genre . While admiring the song 's transcendent qualities , Everett quotes the ethnomusicologist David Reck , who wrote in 1988 : " Most memorable is the sheer simplicity and straightforwardness of the haunting modal melody , somehow capturing perfectly the mood and truth and aphoristic essence of the lyrics . " 
 = = Later releases = = 
 A stereo mix of " The Inner Light " was created at Abbey Road on 27 January 1970 for what Beatles recording historian Mark Lewisohn terms " some indefinable future use " . On this later mix , the opening instrumental section differs slightly from that on the original , mono version . 
 Following its initial release in 1968 , " The Inner Light " became one of the rarest Beatles recordings . Although it appeared on Por Siempre Beatles , a 1971 Spanish compilation album , the song was not available on a British or American album until its inclusion on Rarities , which was originally issued as a disc in the 1978 box set The Beatles Collection before receiving an independent UK release . The 1980 US compilation titled Rarities also featured " The Inner Light " , again in its mono form . The stereo mix was first released as the opening track on a bonus EP , titled The Beatles , issued in the UK in December 1981 as part of the Beatles EP Collection box set . The song was issued on CD in 1988 , in stereo , on Past Masters , Volume Two . The mono mix was subsequently included on the Beatles ' Mono Masters compilation . 
 For the Beatles ' 2006 remix album Love , created for the Cirque du Soleil stage show , the song was segued onto the end of " Here Comes the Sun " . This mashup begins with Harrison singing " Here Comes the Sun " over the tabla part from " Within You , Without You " and ends with Indian instrumentation from " The Inner Light " . 
 In 2014 , an alternative instrumental take of the song was issued as a bonus track on Harrison 's Wonderwall Music remastered CD . The recording begins with a short studio discussion , as Harrison instructs the Bombay musicians .

 Having covered " Within You Without You " in 1967 , the Soulful Strings included " The Inner Light " on their album Another Exposure the following year . Junior Parker recorded the song , releasing a version on his 1971 album with Jimmy McGriff , The Dudes Doin ' Business . Later in the 1970s , the song 's title was appropriated for one of the first international Beatles fanzines .

 Jeff Lynne , who worked frequently with Harrison after the Beatles ' break @-@ up , sang " The Inner Light " at the Concert for George tribute , held at London 's Royal Albert Hall on 29 November 2002 , a year after the former Beatle 's death . In what Simon Leng describes as " a wonderfully eloquent duet " , Lynne performed the song with Anoushka Shankar , who played the original sarod part on sitar . Lynne and Shankar were accompanied by Harrison 's son Dhani ( on keyboards and backing vocals ) and an ensemble of Indian musicians that included percussionist Tanmoy Bose ( on dholak ) , Rajendra Prasanna ( shehnai ) and Sunil Gupta ( flute ) . 
 The song appeared partway through the concert 's opening , Indian music segment , which was performed by Shankar and otherwise composed by her father , and Harrison 's friend and former sitar tutor , Ravi Shankar . Inglis comments that , in its context at the Concert for George , " [ ' The Inner Light ' ] does not appear at all out of place among the Indian folk and classical compositions that surround it . " Reviewing the Concert for George film for The Guardian , James Griffiths admired Lynne 's reading of the song as a " particularly sublime version " .

 In June 1992 , the American television series Star Trek : The Next Generation aired an episode titled " The Inner Light " , which went on to win the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation . The plot centres around the show 's main character , Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard , temporarily living in a dream @-@ like state on an unfamiliar planet , during which decades elapse relative to a few minutes in reality . An avowed fan of the Beatles , screenwriter Morgan Gendel titled the episode after Harrison 's song . 
 In an email to the Star Trek blog site Soul of Star Trek , Nick Sagan , another of the show 's screenwriters , suggested that the song 's lyrics express the " ability to experience many things without actually going anywhere – and that 's what happens to Picard " . In his subsequent post on the same site , Gendel confirmed this similarity , saying that the Beatles track " captured the theme of the show : that Picard experienced a lifetime of memories all in his head " . When discussing the episode on the official Star Trek website in 2013 , Gendel concluded : " If you Google ' Inner Light + song ' you ’ ll get the Beatles tune and an acknowledgment of my TNG homage to it back @-@ to @-@ back … that might be the best gift my authorship of this episode has given me .

 = Fauna of Puerto Rico = 
 The fauna of Puerto Rico is similar to other island archipelago faunas , with high endemism , and low , skewed taxonomic diversity . Bats are the only extant native terrestrial mammals in Puerto Rico . All other terrestrial mammals in the area were introduced by humans , and include species such as cats , goats , sheep , the small Asian mongoose , and escaped monkeys . Marine mammals include dolphins , manatees , and whales . Of the 349 bird species , about 120 breed in the archipelago , and 47 @.@ 5 % are accidental or rare . 
 The most recognizable and famous animal of Puerto Rico is probably the common coquí , a small endemic frog , and one of the 86 species that constitute Puerto Rico 's herpetofauna . Some native freshwater fish inhabit Puerto Rico , but some species , introduced by humans , have established populations in reservoirs and rivers . The low richness @-@ high diversity pattern is also apparent among invertebrates , which constitutes most of the archipelago 's fauna . 
 The arrival of the first people about 4 @,@ 000 years ago and , to a larger extent , of Europeans more than 500 years ago , had a significant effect on Puerto Rico 's fauna . Hunting , habitat destruction , and the introduction of non @-@ native species led to extinctions and extirpations ( local extinctions ) . Conservation efforts , the most notable being for the Puerto Rican parrot , began in the second half of the 20th century . According to IUCN , as of 2002 , there were 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico : two mammals , eight breeding birds , eight reptiles , and three <unk> i 
 = = Origin of Puerto Rican fauna = = 
 The Caribbean Plate , an oceanic tectonic plate on which Puerto Rico and the Antilles ( with the exception of Cuba ) lie , was formed in the late Mesozoic . According to Rosen , when South America separated from Africa , a volcanic archipelago known as " Proto @-@ Antilles " was formed . It later divided into the present @-@ day Greater and Lesser Antilles because of a new fault line in the " Proto @-@ Antilles " . Geologically , the archipelago of Puerto Rico is young , having formed about 135 Ma ( million years ) ago . The prevailing hypothesis , proposed by Howard Meyerhoff , posits that the Puerto Rican Bank , consisting of Puerto Rico , its outlying islands , and the Virgin Islands with the exception of St. Croix , was formed from volcanism in the Cretaceous Period . Rock samples from Sierra Bermeja in southwestern Puerto Rico , dated to the late Jurassic / early Cretaceous period , confirm this theory . 
 There is ongoing debate over when and how the ancestors of vertebrate fauna colonized the Antilles — particularly whether the Proto @-@ Antilles were oceanic islands or whether they once formed a land connection between South and North America . The first , and prevailing , model favors overwater dispersal from continental , primarily South American , fauna ; the other suggests the vicarization of proto @-@ Antillean fauna . Hedges et al. conclude that dispersal was " the primary mechanism for the origin of West Indian biota " . Vertebrate terrestrial genera such as Eleutherodactylus dispersed in a " filter " effect among the islands before any vicarization event occurred . However , other fauna such as the endemic Antillean insectivores ( <unk> sp . , <unk> <unk> and others ) and freshwater fish appear to have colonized the West Indies earlier through other means . Woods provides evidence to support this hypothesis by analyzing the arrival of ancestors of the Antillean <unk> and <unk> , concluding that an ancient <unk> must have arrived on the Greater Antilles from South America either by island @-@ hopping through the Lesser Antilles or by rafting either to Puerto Rico or Hispaniola . 
 MacPhee and <unk> provide an alternate hypothesis that the initiators of land mammal clades arrived on the Proto @-@ Antilles by the mid @-@ Tertiary period , approximately at the Eocene – Oligocene boundary . A short @-@ lived ( ~ 1 Ma ) landmass named " <unk> " ( Greater Antilles + Aves Ridge land ) connected northwestern South America with three of the Greater Antilles ( Cuba , Hispaniola and Puerto Rico ) during this period . Afterwards , during the fragmentation of the Proto @-@ Antilles , divergence of <unk> lines would have begun . 
 The last major changes in Puerto Rican fauna occurred about 10 @,@ 000 years ago as a result of the post @-@ Ice Age rise in sea level and associated environmental changes . Puerto Rico 's transformation from a dry savanna environment to its present moist , forested state led to mass extinctions , especially of the vertebrate fauna . Around this time , the Puerto Rican Bank — a single landmass comprising the archipelago of Puerto Rico ( except for Mona , Monito and Desecheo ) and the Virgin Islands ( except for St. Croix ) — became separated . The Puerto Rican Bank has never been connected to its closest eastern bank , St. Maarten . 
 = = Mammals = = 
 The richness of mammals in Puerto Rico , like many other islands , is low relative to mainland regions . The present @-@ day native terrestrial mammal fauna of Puerto Rico is composed of only 13 species , all of which are bats . 18 marine mammals , including manatees , dolphins and whales , occur in Puerto Rico . Fossil records show the existence of one shrew ( Puerto Rican shrew , <unk> <unk> ) , one sloth ( Puerto Rican sloth ) , three additional leaf @-@ nosed bats ( <unk> <unk> , Monophyllus <unk> , and <unk> major ) , and five rodents ( one giant hutia : <unk> obliquus , one hutia : <unk> portoricensis and three spiny rats : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ) . Woods suggests a reason for their extinction : " Taxa evolving in isolation on oceanic islands without competition or predators may not be able to adapt to rapidly changing conditions , such as the extensive climatic fluctuations of the Ice Ages or sudden competition or predation from introduced animals " . 
 Other terrestrial mammals have been introduced throughout the history of Puerto Rico . Indigenous settlers first introduced dogs and guinea pigs from South or Central America . Afterwards , Taínos introduced hutias as a food source from Hispaniola . When the Spanish colonized the island in the early 16th century , they introduced domesticated animals such as dogs , cats , goats , pigs , cattle , horses , and donkeys . Other species such as black rats ( Rattus rattus ) , Norway rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) and house mice ( Mus sp . ) have been unintentionally introduced as stowaways , possibly since Christopher Columbus 's arrival in 1493 . More recently , species have been introduced as a means of biological pest control . For example , the small Asian mongoose ( Herpestes javanicus ) was introduced in the 19th century to control the damage caused by rats in sugar cane plantations . The introduction was a failure : the mongoose failed to control the rat population and instead contributed to the decline of native fauna such as the yellow @-@ shouldered blackbird and possibly the elfin @-@ woods warbler . 
 As part of a study on adaptation , 57 rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) were introduced to the island of Desecheo and other southern off @-@ shore islands and cays in 1967 . Prior to the introduction , Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby , but mainly as a result of egg predation by the introduced macaques , no bird species presently nests in the island . Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico . Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico . As a result of vandalism , 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s . The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals . 
 Arguably the best known of aquatic mammals occurring in Puerto Rican waters is the Antillean manatee ( Trichechus manatus manatus ) which is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN . The archipelago 's waters are one of the species ' main breeding areas . Manatees gathered local media attention when a two @-@ month manatee nicknamed Moisés was rescued and raised for 27 months by the Caribbean <unk> Network ( CSN ) . Moisés was the first successful release of an orphaned , captive @-@ raised manatee to the marine environment in the Caribbean . The animal became a Puerto Rican cultural , as well as scientific , icon when Tony <unk> wrote a song titled " Moisés " . A municipality of Puerto Rico , Manatí is believed to be named after the species . 
 Puerto Rico 's waters are also an important breeding site for the humpback whale during the Northern Hemisphere 's winter . Humpback whale watching is a popular tourist attraction in the municipality of Rincón in western Puerto Rico . 
 = = = Bats = = = 
 Extant bats of Puerto Rico belong to five families ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) and include a total of 13 species , of which six subspecies are endemic to the archipelago . Seven of the 13 species are insectivores , four can be considered frugivores , one species feeds on nectar and another on fish . The species total is a relatively low number in comparison to the other Greater Antilles . Jamaica , for example , with an area approximately 1 @.@ 2 times that of Puerto Rico , has 21 species ( 1 @.@ 6 times that of Puerto Rico ) . A possible explanation for this is the comparatively large distance between the archipelago and the mainland dispersion areas . Jamaica , for example , is closer to Cuba and Hispaniola which are themselves closer to the mainland dispersion areas of North and Central America . 
 Bats play an important role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations . Most species ( 10 of 13 ) are cave @-@ dwellers with low reproductive rates ; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest , where eleven species occur . The red fig @-@ eating bat ( red fruit bat ) , endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank , plays an important role in the ecology of tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of <unk> ( <unk> bidentata ) . Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces ( guano ) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers , detritivores or predators of the former two . 
 The bat species that occur in the archipelago of Puerto Rico are : greater bulldog bat ( <unk> <unk> ) , Antillean ghost @-@ faced bat ( <unk> <unk> ) , Parnell 's mustached bat ( <unk> <unk> ) , sooty mustached bat ( <unk> <unk> ) , Jamaican fruit bat ( Artibeus jamaicensis ) , Antillean fruit bat ( <unk> <unk> ) , buffy flower bat ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , Leach 's single leaf bat ( Monophyllus <unk> ) , red fruit bat ( <unk> rufum ) , big brown bat ( Eptesicus fuscus ) , eastern red bat ( Lasiurus borealis ) , velvety free @-@ tailed bat ( <unk> <unk> ) , and Mexican free @-@ tailed bat ( <unk> brasiliensis ) . 
 = = Birds = = 
 The avifauna of Puerto Rico is composed of 349 species , 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago . Almost half of the species ( 166 ) are accidental , meaning that they have been sighted only once or twice , and 42 of the species have been introduced , either directly or indirectly ( mainly through habitat alteration ) , by humans . Approximately 120 species , including both native and introduced , breed regularly in the archipelago . 
 The avifauna of the West Indies is predominantly of tropical North American ( southern North America and Central America ) origin with aggressive South American species having colonized the area only recently . The South American families occurring in the Greater Antilles are the hummingbirds ( <unk> ) , tyrant flycatchers ( Tyrannidae ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) and tanagers ( <unk> ) , all of which are represented in Puerto Rico . The prevailing theory suggests that bird fauna colonized the West Indies by transoceanic dispersal during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene . The most primitive West Indies birds are the <unk> which have an endemic representative in Puerto Rico , the Puerto Rican tody . 
 Puerto Rico 's avifauna has diminished due to extinction and extirpation , either by natural forces or human intervention . For example , fossil evidence was discovered for a species of swift , <unk> <unk> , dated to the late Pleistocene ( between 17 @,@ 000 and 21 @,@ 000 years ago ) . The species is believed to have become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation . At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia : Puerto Rican barn owl ( Tyto <unk> ) , Puerto Rican caracara ( <unk> <unk> ) , Puerto Rican <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , Puerto Rican woodcock ( <unk> <unk> ) , Puerto Rican quail @-@ dove ( <unk> larva ) , and the Antillean cave rail ( <unk> <unk> ) . With a population of 13 individuals in 1975 , the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh , but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction . However , it is still one of the ten most critically endangered birds in the world . Four Puerto Rican birds , the Hispaniolan parakeet , the white @-@ necked crow , the Cuban crow , and the limpkin , became extirpated after Puerto Rico 's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species , the black @-@ bellied whistling duck , the black rail , and the greater flamingo , no longer breed in the archipelago . 
 = = Amphibians and reptiles = = 
 Puerto Rico 's herpetofauna consists of 25 amphibian species and 61 reptile species . The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade is believed to have arrived by flotsam dispersion from South America . Little evidence exists to support the alternative hypothesis of proto @-@ Antillean vicariance . Other terrestrial herpetofauna are believed to have arrived to the West Indies ( and Puerto Rico ) by the same method and subsequently undergone vicarization by banks or islands . As a result , Puerto Rico , and the Caribbean in general , has one of the highest percentages of endemism among amphibians and reptiles in the world . Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families : Bufonidae ( 2 species ) , Hylidae ( 3 ) , Leptodactylidae ( 18 ) and Ranidae ( 2 ) . Reptiles include turtles ( freshwater and marine ) , lizards , worm lizards , snakes and a caiman . 
 All species of Ranidae and Hylidae occurring in Puerto Rico are introduced . One species from the family Bufonidae , the cane toad , is introduced while the other , the Puerto Rican crested toad , is endemic and critically endangered . The cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the 1920s to control the populations of white @-@ grub ( <unk> spp . ) , a sugar cane pest . All species from the family Leptodactylidae are native to the region . Of the 18 Leptodactylidae species , 17 are from the genus Eleutherodactylus and are commonly known in Puerto Rico as coquís . Three of these , the web @-@ footed coquí , the golden coqui and the mottled coqui , are likely to be extinct . The golden coqui is the only live @-@ bearing species from the family Leptodactylidae and Cook 's robber frog ( E. cooki ) is the only Eleutherodactylus sp. that exhibits sexual dimorphism in both size and color . The common coquí ( Eleutherodactylus coqui ) is an unofficial national symbol of Puerto Rico and an important aspect of Puerto Rican culture . Since 14 of the 17 coquís are endemic to the archipelago , a common phrase used by Puerto Ricans to assert their national pride is " De <unk> como el coquí " ( From here Puerto Rico like the coquí ) . 
 Puerto Rico 's turtle fauna includes both freshwater ( 5 species , including two extinct species ) and marine turtles ( 5 ) . Two of these species , the hawksbill turtle and the leatherback sea turtle , are critically endangered . Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals . The spectacled caiman , an introduced species , is the only representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico . 
 The 11 snake species occurring in Puerto Rico are generally considered non @-@ venomous , although research has concluded that at least one species , the Puerto Rican racer ( Alsophis portoricensis ) , secretes venom . These species belong to 3 families and 4 genera : Typhlopidae ( <unk> genus ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) and Colubridae ( Alsophis and <unk> ) . The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic Puerto Rican boa ( <unk> <unk> ) with a maximum length of 12 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles ( <unk> , Anolis , geckos ) , coquís and other frogs , and , to a lesser extent , mice , birds and bats ( exclusively by the Puerto Rican Boa ) . 
 The largest terrestrial lizard of the archipelago of Puerto Rico is the Mona ground iguana ( Cyclura cornuta <unk> ) . A subspecies of the rhinoceros iguana ( Cyclura cornuta ) , it is endemic to Mona Island , located in the Mona Passage between the main island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic . Another Cyclura species of similar size , the Anegada ground iguana ( Cyclura pinguis ) , once occurred in the archipelago but it became extirpated due to predation by dogs , cats , and humans , habitat destruction , and competition from goats and pigs , and is now restricted to Anegada . The most common lizard in Puerto Rico is the sharp @-@ mouthed lizard ( Anolis pulchellus ) . The Anolis lizards of Puerto Rico , and the Greater Antilles in general , represent an interesting case of adaptive radiation . Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles are more closely related to other species within the same island than to species of adjacent islands . Surprisingly , even though species divergence occurred independently on each island , the same set of ecomorphs ( habitat specialists ) have evolved on each island . 
 = = Fish = = 
 The first fish descriptions from Puerto Rico were compiled by Cuvier and Valenciennes in 1828 . They reported 33 taxa for the archipelago . Puerto Rico has few native freshwater fish species ; however , there are over 30 introduced species , mainly originating from Africa , South America and the southeastern United States , have established populations , and 60 marine species use Puerto Rico 's freshwater bodies intermittently during the year . Introductions have been intentional and accidental . The purposes of intentional introductions have been sport fishing for recreation and food , mosquito control , and to provide baitfish for largemouth bass . Accidental introductions , such as the <unk> armored catfish ( <unk> <unk> ) , are mainly attributed to the release of aquarium fish . Since 1936 , the Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources runs a hatchery at the municipality of Maricao . About 25 @,@ 000 fish , including largemouth bass , peacock bass , and channel catfish , and some turtle species are raised annually to stock Puerto Rico 's reservoirs and rivers . 
 Three types of habitats , mangroves , reefs and seagrasses , are found in Puerto Rico 's ocean waters . A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats ; 242 being reef species . Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are representative of the general Caribbean fauna . Common reef fishes include wrasses , damselfishes , white grunts ( Haemulon <unk> ) , <unk> grunts ( Haemulon <unk> ) , queen parrotfish ( Scarus <unk> ) , and sharks ( family Carcharhinidae ) . Sea breams ( <unk> <unk> ) and yellowfin mojarras ( <unk> cinereus ) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats . Other species of interest include flatfishes , with 21 recorded species , and sharks , with more than 20 species . Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage . 
 = = Invertebrates = = 
 The invertebrate fauna of Puerto Rico is high in richness but low in diversity relative to mainland neotropical faunas of similar size and habitat diversity . Puerto Rico , in comparison to other Antillean islands , is the most extensively studied in regards to invertebrates . 
 Puerto Rico 's insect fauna , similar to the majority of major invertebrate taxa in the archipelago , is considered <unk> when compared to its mainland counterparts . For example , approximately 300 species of butterfly occur in Puerto Rico , in contrast to more than 600 species in Trinidad and more than 1 @,@ 500 species documented from a 7 @.@ 5 km2 region in Brazil . As of 1998 , out of the estimated 925 @,@ 000 described insect species , only 5 @,@ 573 were documented from Puerto Rico . In terms of diversity , of the 31 extant insect orders , 27 have representatives in Puerto Rico . The orders without reported representatives are <unk> , Grylloblattaria , Plecoptera , and Mecoptera . The largest insect depository in Puerto Rico resides at the Museo de <unk> y <unk> Tropical ( Museum of Entomology and Tropical Biodiversity ) , part of the Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of Puerto Rico . 
 Arachnids are important to the forest ecology , as both predators and prey . In some forest types , such as tabonuco forest , they are the major arboreal invertebrate predators ; spiders being the most abundant representative . The Maricao Commonwealth Forest 's 27 spider species belong to five families : Uloboridae , <unk> , Theridiidae , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> minutissima , a small spider species found in abundance in the Caribbean National Forest , is believed to be parthenogenetic , meaning that it reproduces without fertilization by a male . 
 Other terrestrial invertebrates described from Puerto Rico include earthworms and cave dwelling animals . Eighteen native species of earthworm have been described , with 11 species belonging to the family <unk> , 3 to the family <unk> , and 4 to the family <unk> . Seventy @-@ eight invertebrate species are known to inhabit Puerto Rico 's caves . Six of these species are restricted to the Antilles , 23 come from North America and 23 are endemic to Puerto Rico . Only two of the species are confirmed as <unk> , or restricted to caves . Forty @-@ five percent of the species are predators while the remaining 55 % are guano scavengers , detritivores and herbivores . It is believed that most of this fauna arrived at Puerto Rico in the Pleistocene . 
 The marine invertebrate fauna of Puerto Rico is composed of 61 sponges , 171 cnidarians , 8 nemerteans , 1 @,@ 176 mollusks , 129 annelids ( polychaetes ) , 342 crustaceans , 165 echinoderms , 131 bryozoans , 117 hard corals , 99 soft corals and gorgonians , 13 <unk> , and 8 <unk> . Coral species found in Puerto Rican reefs are representative of the general Caribbean fauna . Commonly occurring corals include boulder star coral ( <unk> annularis ) , finger coral ( Porites <unk> ) , and elkhorn coral ( Acropora palmata ) . 
 Invertebrate introductions have had an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna . Native freshwater snails such as <unk> cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species . Currently , the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania ( <unk> <unk> ) , an introduced species . Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee . This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest . Africanized bees , which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters , have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico . Other introductions include 18 species of ant , one of the most abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats . 
 = = Human effect and conservation = = 
 The fauna of Puerto Rico has been subjected to human influence since the arrival of the <unk> , Puerto Rico 's first settlers , approximately 4 @,@ 000 years ago . The native fauna was used by the island 's indigenous population as a source of food , while others were used for skins and trade . Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century . Habitat destruction , primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations , had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during the latter half of the nineteenth century . Furthermore , human @-@ introduced species such as rats , cats , the small Asian mongoose , and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico . Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko , feral cats on Mona Island have been documented attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles , and have been associated with the reduction of Mona ground iguana juveniles , and mongooses have been documented preying on Puerto Rican parrot <unk> . 
 Conservation efforts include both land and species protection . Approximately 8 @.@ 95 km2 ( equal to 3 @.@ 4 % of total land area ) divided among 34 reserves are protected in Puerto Rico . According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico : 2 mammals , 8 breeding birds , 8 reptiles , and 3 amphibians . The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals , 2 amphibians , 8 birds , and 10 reptiles under the Federal Endangered Species Act . The Puerto Rican government , through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources ( <unk> ) , produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically endangered species ( 3 amphibians , 7 birds , 3 reptiles , 2 fish and 3 invertebrates ) , and 14 endangered species . The <unk> follows the IUCN classification scheme for species ' priority assignment . 
 Birds currently receive the greatest attention in regards to conservation . Arguably the most successful fauna recovery plan in Puerto Rico was the Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Plan . Initiated in 1968 , its main objective was to <unk> the Puerto Rican parrot 's status from critical to threatened by 2020 . Other objectives include the establishment of two separate , effective , wild populations ( 500 or more individuals for 5 years ) , the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators , parasites and competitors of the species . Currently , the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals , and 105 birds are in captivity . This program was fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico . 
 The Puerto Rico Breeding Bird Survey ( <unk> ) , established in 1997 , is a program with the purpose of monitoring the status and trends of Puerto Rican breeding bird populations . The information gathered by these surveys is used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) to assess bird conservation priorities . Other conservation programs by the USFWS include the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands Migratory Bird Conservation and the maintenance of 5 wildlife refuges at Cabo Rojo , Laguna Cartagena , Vieques , Culebra and Desecheo . Other institutions supporting bird conservation in Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican Ornithological Society and the Puerto Rico National History Association . 
 Marine conservation has recently garnered support in Puerto Rico . The archipelago has an estimated 700 miles ( 1 @,@ 126 @.@ 5 km ) of coastline and 1 @,@ 300 mi2 ( 3 @,@ 370 km2 ) of coral reef communities . The Department of Natural Resources of Puerto Rico maintains 25 areas with marine components but only two of these ( 11 km2 ) are designated as no @-@ take zones . All turtle species occurring in Puerto Rico 's waters are classified as either endangered or threatened . <unk> @-@ supported turtle conservation programs and U.S. federal programs have raised local awareness and have contributed to the decline of egg @-@ poaching and turtle meat consumption . 
 = Effects of Hurricane Dennis in Alabama = 
 The Effects of Hurricane Dennis in Alabama , USA included $ 127 million ( 2005 USD ) in damage and three injuries . Dennis made landfall on the Florida Panhandle as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale on July 10 , 2005 , before tracking over Alabama as a minimal hurricane . In preparation for the storm , about 500 @,@ 000 people were given evacuation orders , and the Red Cross opened 87 shelters . As a result , all southbound lanes of Interstate 65 from Mobile to Montgomery were closed . 
 Hurricane Dennis caused modest damage in Alabama , mostly related to moderate wind gusts . Several counties within the state reported downed trees and powerlines , leaving a total of 280 @,@ 000 people without electric power . Downed trees also left numerous county and state roads temporarily impassable . Maximum rainfall peaked at 12 @.@ 80 in ( 325 mm ) near Camden and top wind gusts surpassed 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . Despite the damage , there were no fatalities , although three injuries occurred . Also , an unconfirmed tornado tore the roof off a home , forcing emergency workers to evacuate a man inside . 
 = = Storm history and preparations = = 
 On June 29 , 2005 , a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa . Gradually , the system organized on July 2 and formed a broad low pressure area . The system continued to organize , and became a tropical depression on July 4 . Tracking westward , it became a tropical storm on July 5 and a hurricane on July 7 . Dennis rapidly intensified to attain Category 4 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale before making landfall on Cuba . The storm weakened to Category 1 status before re @-@ emerging in the Gulf of Mexico and intensifying . Dennis made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on July 10 before tracking over Alabama as a minimal hurricane . 
 On July 8 , a hurricane watch was put into effect for coastal areas between the Pearl River and the Steinhatchee River . Early on July 9 , the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning in anticipation of the storm . Early on July 10 prior to Dennis ' landfall , the warning was discontinued for locations between the Steinhatchee River and the Ochlockonee River , leaving Alabama within the advisory . Just hours after the storm moved ashore , the warning was adjusted to include areas from the Alabama / Mississippi border to Destin , Florida . On July 10 , the coastal hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning , although inland hurricane warnings remained in place . At 2200 ( UTC ) on July 10 , all tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued as the hurricane progressed inland . 
 About 500 @,@ 000 people were given evacuation orders in the state , mostly in coastal areas . Residents in Mobile County , and those south of I @-@ 10 in Baldwin County , were ordered to evacuate . Similar orders were issued in Mississippi for parts of Jackson , Hancock , and Harrison counties , and for coastal areas in the Florida Panhandle stretching from Escambia County to Bay County . 
 At 2300 ( UTC ) on July 9 , 2005 , all southbound lanes on Interstate 65 from Mobile to Montgomery were closed . Traffic was redirected , making all four lanes northbound to allow evacuations . Likewise , military installations such as NAS Pensacola , Whiting Field , Eglin AFB , Hurlburt Field and Tyndall AFB were all evacuated days before the storm . Red Cross officials opened 87 shelters across the state which were able to hold about 14 @,@ 000 evacuees . 
 = = Impact = = 
 As Hurricane Dennis moved through the state , sustained winds reached minimal hurricane force in the interior of the state . In total , 280 @,@ 000 people in Alabama experienced power outages during the storm . No deaths occurred , although Dennis caused three injuries and total damage amounted to $ 127 million ( 2005 USD ) , mostly due to structural damage . There was also severe damage to cotton crops . 
 Rainfall typically ranged from 2 – 4 inches ( 50 – 100 mm ) , although rainfall in localized areas reached 12 @.@ 80 in ( 325 mm ) . This caused numerous rivers to overflow causing widespread , locally major , flash flooding . The rainfall flooded numerous state and county roads , some with water up to 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) deep . Parts of Interstate 20 were <unk> with water , temporarily closing the highway . In Dallas County , a mudslide closed a section of State Highway 5 . In Greene County , the minor flooding was reported along the Tombigbee River . Throughout the region , numerous bridges were washed away several homes were flooded , sustaining major damage in some cases . 
 Storm surge generally ranged from 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) – 6 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) , with the highest surge reported in Mobile Bay as winds became onshore during Dennis ' landfall . 
 A wind gust of 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) was reported at Dothan , with minimum barometric pressure reaching 999 @.@ 2 mb . It is reported that the worst damage occurred in Escambia and Monroe counties . In the Escambia County city of <unk> , 100 percent of the city 's residents lost electric power for some a period of time during the hurricane . The strongest winds occurred in Escambia County , where gusts surpassed 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , leaving numerous structures damaged or destroyed as Dennis tracked through the western half of the county . One man in the county was injured by a fallen tree branch . Also , an unconfirmed tornado tore the roof off a home , forcing emergency workers to evacuate a man inside . In Coffee County , local officials reported wind gusts had blown a carport into a wall of a house . Marengo County received moderate damage , mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural damage caused by fallen trees and powerlines . Many customers were without electric power for at least a day , and numerous county roads were covered with debris . A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car . Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds , and thousands of people county @-@ wide experienced power outages . Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11 , 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed . In <unk> , a mobile home caught fire when a powerline fell on the home . A motorist ran into a fallen tree in <unk> although did not sustain injuries . In Perry County , 2 @,@ 200 homes were without electric power for several hours , and several vehicles and homes were damaged . A structural fire occurred in Russell County and was believed to be ignited by downed powerlines . 
 Wind gusts in <unk> County surpassed 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) , causing $ 180 @,@ 000 dollars ( 2005 USD ) in damage . The Robinson Springs United Methodist Church had part of its roof torn off in Elmore County , while numerous other homes sustained roof damage . One person was injured in Montgomery County when a tree fell on their vehicle . Another person was injured in Clay County when he ran his vehicle into a downed tree . A structural fire occurred in Randolph County as a result of fallen powerlines . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On July 10 , just hours after Hurricane Dennis made landfall in the Florida Panhandle , President George W. Bush ordered the federal government to provide necessary disaster resources and assets for the state to aid people who were affected by the storm . Also , 45 counties in the state were eligible for federal funds to pay 75 percent of the approved costs for debris removal and emergency protective services related to the hurricane , including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government . On July 11 , Escambia County joined Baldwin and Mobile counties to be eligible to receive individual assistance funds . 
 Shortly after , on July 13 , two Disaster Recovery Centers opened to provide information to those who have suffered damage . The next day , state and federal community relations teams were deployed into Alabama ’ s disaster @-@ declared counties , to assist residents who suffered from Dennis . The Alabama Emergency Management Agency ( <unk> ) and the Department of Homeland Security ’ s Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) had 20 federal community relations specialists and their state counterparts working in the disaster areas . Subsequently , three more Disaster Recovery Centers became scheduled to open on July 16 . On July 25 , four Disaster Recovery Centers in Alabama were scheduled to close . By August 19 , over $ 4 million ( 2005 USD ) in individual assistance funds were received . 
 = USS Chew ( DD @-@ 106 ) = 
 USS Chew ( DD @-@ 106 ) was a Wickes @-@ class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War I and World War II . She was named in honor of Samuel Chew . 
 From 1918 to 1922 , Chew operated along the East Coast of the United States on patrol and training duties , including escorting a transatlantic voyage of Curtiss NC seaplanes . In 1940 , she was recommissioned and operated out of Pearl Harbor . During the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor , she brought her guns to bear against aircraft of the Empire of Japan , and two of her men were killed helping to man the Pennsylvania . For the remainder of the war , Chew operated out of the port on escort and patrol duties , until she was decommissioned in 1945 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Chew was one of 111 Wickes @-@ class destroyers built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919 . She , along with seven of her sisters , were constructed at Union Iron Works shipyards in San Francisco , California using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel . 
 She had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 060 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 040 long tons ; 1 @,@ 170 short tons ) an overall length of 314 feet 5 inches ( 95 @.@ 83 m ) , a beam of 31 feet 9 inches ( 9 @.@ 68 m ) and a draught of 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 59 m ) . On trials , Harding reached a speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . She was armed with four 4 " / 50 caliber guns and twelve 21 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . She had a regular crew complement of 113 officers and enlisted men . She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers . 
 Specifics on Chew 's performance are not known , but she was one of the group of Wickes @-@ class destroyers designed by Bethlehem Steel , built from a different design than the ' Liberty type ' destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works , which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines . The non- ' Liberty ' type destroyers deteriorated badly in service , and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy . Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy , with most only able to make 2 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 300 km ; 2 @,@ 600 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) instead of the design standard of 3 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 700 km ; 3 @,@ 600 mi ) at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight . 
 Chew was the first and only ship commissioned in the U.S. Navy named for Samuel Chew , who had been a Continental Navy officer killed in the Revolutionary War . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Chew was launched on 26 May 1918 out of San Francisco , sponsored by F. X. Gygax . She was commissioned on 12 December 1918 under the command of Commander J. H. Klein Jr . 
 She sailed for the East Coast of the United States on 21 December 1918 , and arrived in port at Newport , Rhode Island on 10 January 1919 . After brief repairs at port in New York City , New York and refresher training at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , she cleared New York on 28 April and embarked as an escort during the first transatlantic seaplane flight , made by Curtiss NC @-@ 4 aircraft . Following this duty , she visited to the Azores , Gibraltar , Malta , and Constantinople before returning to New York on 5 June . After repairs , she steamed for San Diego , California , leaving New York on 17 September and arriving in San Diego on 12 October . Beginning on 19 November 1919 , she was placed in reduced commission , operating only infrequently with Naval reservists of Reserve Division 10 until she was placed out of commission on 1 June 1922 . 
 At a part of the mobilization effort preceding the U.S. entry into World War II , Chew was recommissioned on 14 October 1940 , assigned to Defense Force , 14th Naval District . She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 17 December 1940 which she made her home port . She spent the next year conducting patrols and had training duty from Pearl Harbor . She was assigned to Destroyer Division 80 , with sister ships Allen , Ward , and Schley . 
 On the morning of 7 December 1941 , Chew was moored in Berth X @-@ 5 , alongside Allen and the decommissioned Baltimore , which was being used for storage . At the outbreak of the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan that morning , Chew brought one of her 3 " / 23 caliber guns online and began firing at 08 : 03 , under the command of her executive officer . At 08 : 11 , two of her .50 caliber machine guns were also brought online and began firing . The 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) gun scored one Japanese aircraft shot down and two damaged , and the machine guns observed no hits . Chew maintained continuous fire from these weapons until 09 : 34 , when the last of the Japanese aircraft departed . She then got underway and began patrolling for Japanese submarine activity , just southwest of the port entrance buoy . She <unk> eight possible contacts and dropped 28 depth charges , which her commander , H. R. Hummer , Jr . , reported two Japanese submarines destroyed . Subsequent evidence does not suggest Chew struck any Japanese submarines . In the chaos of the attack , a number of Chew crew members also disembarked and came aboard nearby Pennsylvania , which was in drydock , to assist in manning guns , forming ammunition trains , and fighting fires . Aboard Pennsylvania , two Chew crewman were killed in defending the ship , Seaman Second Class Matthew J. <unk> and Fireman Third Class Clarence A. Wise . 
 From 1941 through the end of World War II , Chew operated out of Pearl Harbor on patrol . She took on periodic escort duties among the Hawaiian Islands and on training duty for submarines . She made occasional trips to San Francisco and Seattle escorting convoys and screening for other Navy ships , inter @-@ island escort , and submarine training duty . Following the end of the war , she departed Pearl Harbor on 21 August 1945 and arrived at Philadelphia 13 September . She was decommissioned there on 10 October 1945 , and sold for scrap on 4 October 1946 . Chew received one battle star for World War II service . 
 = Roentgenium = 
 Roentgenium is a chemical element with symbol Rg and atomic number 111 . It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element ( an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature ) ; the most stable known isotope , roentgenium @-@ 282 , has a half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 1 minutes . Roentgenium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt , Germany . It is named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen ( also spelled Roentgen ) . 
 In the periodic table , it is a d @-@ block transactinide element . It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 11 elements , although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to gold in group 11 . Roentgenium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues , copper , silver , and gold , although it may show some differences from them .

 = = = Official discovery = = = 
 Roentgenium was first synthesized by an international team led by Sigurd Hofmann at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung ( GSI ) in Darmstadt , Germany , on December 8 , 1994 . The team bombarded a target of bismuth @-@ 209 with accelerated nuclei of nickel @-@ 64 and detected a single atom of the isotope roentgenium @-@ 272 : 
 209

 This reaction had previously been conducted at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna ( then in the Soviet Union ) in 1986 , but no atoms of <unk> had then been observed . In 2001 , the IUPAC / IUPAP Joint Working Party ( JWP ) concluded that there was insufficient evidence for the discovery at that time . The GSI team repeated their experiment in 2002 and detected three more atoms . In their 2003 report , the JWP decided that the GSI team should be acknowledged for the discovery of this element . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Using Mendeleev 's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements , roentgenium should be known as eka @-@ gold . In 1979 , IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called <unk> ( with the corresponding symbol of <unk> ) , a systematic element name as a placeholder , until the element was discovered ( and the discovery then confirmed ) and a permanent name was decided on . Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels , from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks , the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field , who either called it " element 111 " , with the symbol of ( 111 ) or even simply 111 . 
 The name roentgenium ( Rg ) was suggested by the GSI team in 2004 , to honor the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen , the discoverer of X @-@ rays . This name was accepted by IUPAC on November 1 , 2004 . 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 Roentgenium has no stable or naturally @-@ occurring isotopes . Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory , either by fusion of the nuclei of lighter elements or as intermediate decay products of heavier elements . Seven different isotopes of roentgenium have been reported with atomic masses 272 , 274 , and 278 – 282 , two of which , roentgenium @-@ 272 and roentgenium @-@ 274 , have known but unconfirmed metastable states . All of these decay through alpha decay or spontaneous fission . 
 = = = Stability and half @-@ lives = = = 
 All roentgenium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive ; in general , the heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter . The most stable known roentgenium isotope , <unk> , is also the heaviest known roentgenium isotope ; it has a half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 1 minutes . The isotopes <unk> and 281Rg have also been reported to also have half @-@ lives over a second . The remaining isotopes have half @-@ lives on the millisecond range . The undiscovered isotope <unk> has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay ; however , no known roentgenium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay . The unknown isotopes <unk> and <unk> are also expected to have long half @-@ lives of 1 second and 10 minutes respectively . Before their discovery , the isotopes <unk> , 281Rg , and <unk> were predicted to have long half @-@ lives of 1 second , 1 minute , and 4 minutes respectively ; however , they were discovered to have shorter half @-@ lives of 4 @.@ 2 milliseconds , 17 seconds , and 2 @.@ 1 minutes respectively .

 = = = Chemical = = = 
 Roentgenium is the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals . Since copernicium ( element 112 ) has been shown to be a transition metal , it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would form a fourth transition metal series . Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold , thus implying that roentgenium 's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements , copper , silver , and gold ; however , it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues . 
 Roentgenium is predicted to be a noble metal . Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 11 elements , roentgenium is predicted to show stable + 5 , + 3 , and − 1 oxidation states , with a less stable + 1 state . The + 3 state is predicted to be the most stable . Roentgenium ( III ) is expected to be of comparable reactivity to gold ( III ) , but should be more stable and form a larger variety of compounds . Gold also forms a somewhat stable − 1 state due to relativistic effects , and roentgenium may do so as well : the electron affinity of roentgenium is expected to be around 1 @.@ 6 eV ( 37 kcal / mol ) , significantly lower than gold 's value of 2 @.@ 3 eV ( 53 kcal / mol ) , so <unk> may not be stable or even possible . The 6d orbitals are destabilized by relativistic effects and spin – orbit interactions near the end of the fourth transition metal series , thus making higher oxidation states like roentgenium ( V ) and copernicium ( IV ) more stable than their lighter homologues gold ( V ) and mercury ( IV ) ( each of which are known only in one compound ) as the 6d electrons participate in bonding to a greater extent . The spin @-@ orbit interactions stabilize molecular roentgenium compounds with more bonding 6d electrons ; for example , RgF − 
 6 is expected to be more stable than RgF − 
 4 , which is expected to be more stable than RgF − 
 2 . Roentgenium ( I ) is expected to be difficult to obtain . 
 The probable chemistry of roentgenium has received more interest than that of the two previous elements , meitnerium and darmstadtium , as the valence s @-@ subshells of the group 11 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at roentgenium . Calculations on the molecular compound <unk> show that relativistic effects double the strength of the roentgenium – hydrogen bond , even though spin – orbit interactions also weaken it by 0 @.@ 7 eV ( 16 kcal / mol ) . The compounds <unk> and <unk> , where X = F , Cl , Br , O , Au , or Rg , were also studied . Rg + is predicted to be the softest metal ion , even softer than Au + , although there is disagreement on whether it would behave as an acid or a base . In aqueous solution , Rg + would form the aqua ion [ Rg ( H2O ) 2 ] + , with an Rg – O bond distance of 207 @.@ 1 pm . It is also expected to form Rg ( I ) complexes with ammonia , phosphine , and hydrogen sulfide . 
 = = = Physical and atomic = = = 
 Roentgenium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body @-@ centered cubic structure , unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face @-@ centered cubic structure , due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them . It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 28 @.@ 7 g / cm3 ; in comparison , the densest known element that has had its density measured , osmium , has a density of only 22 @.@ 61 g / cm3 . This results from roentgenium 's high atomic weight , the lanthanide and actinide contractions , and relativistic effects , although production of enough roentgenium to measure this quantity would be impractical , and the sample would quickly decay . 
 The stable group 11 elements , copper , silver , and gold , all have an outer electron configuration <unk> ( n + 1 ) s1 . For each of these elements , the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration <unk> ( n + 1 ) s2 . Due to spin @-@ orbit coupling between the d electrons , this state is split into a pair of energy levels . For copper , the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish . For silver , the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery . However , as the atomic number increases , the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold . For roentgenium , calculations indicate that the <unk> level is stabilized to such an extent that it becomes the ground state and the <unk> level becomes the first excited state . The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance . The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 138 pm . 
 = = Experimental chemistry = = 
 Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of roentgenium has yet to have been established due to the low yields of reactions that produce roentgenium isotopes . For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide , at least four atoms must be produced , the half @-@ life of the isotope used must be at least 1 second , and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week . Even though the half @-@ life of 281Rg , the most stable known roentgenium isotope , is 26 seconds , long enough to perform chemical studies , another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of roentgenium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained . Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the roentgenium isotopes and automated systems can then experiment on the gas @-@ phase and solution chemistry of roentgenium as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements . However , the experimental chemistry of roentgenium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium , despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to the maximizing of relativistic effects on the ns subshell in group 11 occurring at roentgenium . 
 = Impossible Princess = 
 Impossible Princess ( retitled Kylie Minogue in the UK and Europe ) is the sixth studio album by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue , released on 22 October 1997 . Because the A & R department of her label , Deconstruction Records , were not present throughout the majority of the album 's production process , song writing and production were primarily handled by Minogue , in collaboration with producers Dave Ball , Ingo Vauk , Brothers in Rhythm , Manic Street Preachers and Rob Dougan . 
 Minogue started work on the album in October 1995 when she returned from her trips with French photographer and her then @-@ boyfriend Stéphane Sednaoui . A release with a mixture of different musical genres and styles , the album features several songs employing themes of self @-@ reflection , relationships and insecurities . The album cover was photographed by Sednaoui and the album title was derived from the book Poems to Break the Harts of Impossible Princesses ( 1994 ) by Billy Childish and from a lyric in the song " Dreams " . The tracks " Some Kind of Bliss " , " Did It Again " , " Breathe " and " Cowboy Style " served as the album 's official singles , while the other songs from the album served as promotional singles in Australia and New Zealand . 
 Impossible Princess received positive reviews from most critics . Australian and American critics viewed the album positively for its production and experimentation , while the British press criticized Minogue 's indie image and music change from her earlier work . Peaking at number four and ten in Australia and the United Kingdom respectively , it was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) . Minogue promoted the album on her Intimate and Live tour , which was positively received critically and commercially . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Minogue left her label PWL in 1992 due to creative differences , and signed a three album deal with Deconstruction Records the following year . Her self @-@ titled album was released through Deconstruction in September 1994 , where it peaked at number three in Australia and number four in the United Kingdom . The following year , she recorded the song " Where the Wild Roses Grow " , a duet with Australian rock musician Nick Cave . Cave was interested in working with Minogue since hearing her 1990 single " Better the Devil You Know " , saying it contained " one of pop music 's most violent and distressing lyrics " . 
 In 1995 , Minogue began a relationship with French photographer Stéphane Sednaoui and embarked a series of trips to North America and South East Asia . Minogue was encouraged by Sednaoui to write songs for the album ; she had written lyrics before , but described them as " safe , just neatly rhymed words " . Each morning , Minogue would present lyrics to producer Dave Seaman from the night before . Impossible Princess took nearly two years to record , the longest period of time Minogue had worked on a project since her time acting on the Australian soap opera Neighbours ( from 1986 to 1988 ) . Minogue 's creative director Steve Anderson later explained that its lengthy time was " due to the pure perfectionism of all creatively involved " . 
 Minogue started recording rough demos in October 1995 with Brothers in Rhythm in Chippenham , where they completed the unreleased track " You 're the One " . Impossible Princess is Minogue 's first album to incorporate live instrumentation ; she had commented " I was joking with James Dean <unk> ' Oh my god , every instrument is a real instrument , I don 't think I 've ever had this before ! ' " Minogue felt it was unusual because she was familiar with the use of synthesizers . Minogue attended all music sessions from start to finish , and often turned up late and asked several questions because she wanted more information on how to produce , compose and " change and distort " songs . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Impossible Princess combines several musical genres including trip hop , techno , Britpop , pop music , indie rock and dance music . <unk> writer Marcel Anders felt though the album includes guitar @-@ driven tracks , " Most tracks are still very dancefloor oriented " . Music critic Michael R. Smith from the <unk> noted the techno elements , while a reviewer from Classic Pop Magazine found influences of 1990s Britpop . Digital Spy critic Nick Levine said the album was " all over the dance @-@ pop shop " . Sednaoui introduced her to the work of Icelandic musician Björk , American – Scottish band Garbage , Japanese producer Towa Tei and Irish band U2 , all whom influenced the work from Impossible Princess . Minogue cited The Verve , The Prodigy , The Chemical Brothers , The Eels and the " British music scene " as influences to the album . 
 " Too Far " , Impossible Princess ' opening track and lead promotional single , is a drum and bass track that was noted as one of " the toughest club cuts in Kylie 's career " by Levine . Minogue wrote the track at a local cafe and sings about stress and anger . The second track and fourth single , " Cowboy Style " , is a tribal – Celtic pop song that mixes both live instrumentation and electronic synths , and talks about the first time she met Sednaoui . " Some Kind of Bliss " , the album 's lead single , is her first track to work strictly with live instrumentation , focusing on instruments such as bass guitar , string arrangements and drums . Her most indie track , the lyrics focus on being happy while away from family and friends . The fourth track and second single , " Did It Again " , also focuses on live instrumentation with elements of dance music , and discusses her self @-@ consciousness and self @-@ hatred . Both " Breathe " , the album 's third single , and " Say Hey " are electronic tracks that have been compared to the music of Icelandic recording artist Björk . " Breathe " deals with calmness , while " Say Hey " talks about verbal communication with Sednaoui . 
 The seventh track , " Drunk " , is a Techno song which Minogue sings about desiring Sednaoui 's attention and wanting him to be satisfied . " I Don 't Need Anyone " has been recognized as the album 's most straightforward Motown – indie rock song . Minogue stated that the lyrical narrative was " difficult " to explain . The ninth track , " Jump " , is a slow trip @-@ hop song that has Minogue singing about self @-@ acceptance and the future . " Limbo " is a dance song that deals with being trapped and not visiting anyone . The eleventh track , " Through the Years " , was compared to the work of Björk once again , and deals with past relationships and affairs . The twelfth and final track on the album is " Dreams " , a track about pushing boundaries over an orchestral and string arrangement .

 Deconstruction aimed to release the album in January 1997 , but the release was postponed until May 1997 . Deconstruction then decided to release the album in September 1997 , but the release was postponed once again . Because of constant delays , Deconstruction , BMG and Mushroom released selected album tracks on various formats throughout Australia , New Zealand and the United Kingdom . BMG released Impossible Princess on 22 October 1997 in Japan and Taiwan , followed by a 12 January 1998 release in Australia through Mushroom and 23 March 1998 in the UK . On 26 May 2003 , Deconstruction and Mushroom re @-@ released the album with a new disc with bonus tracks and remixes . Minogue told Billboard that she and Deconstruction had plans to release the album in North America , but dismissed these plans after they failed to find an American label to promote it . 
 The album cover , photographed by Sednaoui , is a frontal @-@ view shot of Minogue , sitting down inside of a multi @-@ coloured cut cone . The shoot was inspired by Japanese and French pop culture , and Sednaoui identified Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki as an inspiration . For the limited 3D cover , it required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue and she grew tired of posing for long periods of time . Minogue was dressed in a blue Véronique Leroy mini dress . Minogue recalled " The shoot was so very difficult but we knew that once we got it right it would be amazing . " The album title references Poems to Break the Harts of Impossible Princesses ( 1994 ) by Billy Childish . A copy of the book was given to Minogue as a gift by Cave ; she said its poems summarized where she was at that time in her life . Minogue recalled " The first time I saw the name Impossible Princess , It had me written all over it . " Due to the death of Diana , Princess of Wales in August 1997 , the album title was changed to Kylie Minogue for the UK and the rest of Europe .

 Minogue embarked a promotional tour in the Oceanic region in October 1997 . Minogue performed in Singapore and then followed with Australian state capitals Melbourne , Brisbane , Sydney and Adelaide . Next was Auckland and she finished off in Hong Kong . After the album 's European release , Minogue went on to promote the album with concert gigs in Norway , Denmark and the Netherlands . Minogue embarked Intimate and Live , an Australian and European tour , which spanned from 2 June 1998 to 8 July 1998 . Minogue started rehearsing for the tour after performing at the 1998 Sydney Mardi Gras in January . Unlike her previous tours , Intimate and Live 's production was handled with a low budget . 
 Minogue and Baker sketched plans and stage props for the tour . The " K " symbol and the multi @-@ coloured cone from the album 's photoshoot had been featured as props for the tour . The show was accompanied by only two dancers ( David <unk> and Ashley Wallen ) and a backing group – mainly John Farnham 's band members – with added backing vocalists . Despite initial plans not to take the show outside of Australia , Minogue decided to extend it into Europe due to high demand . From the supporting album , Minogue performed " Too Far " , " Some Kind of Bliss " , " Breathe " , " Cowboy Style " , " Say Hey " , " Drunk " , " Did It Again " , and " Limbo " . The live album was released on 30 November 1998 in Australia and the DVD was released in July 2002 .

 Impossible Princess received positive reviews from most music critics . Billboard 's Larry Flick described the album as " stunning " , concluding that " it 's a golden commercial opportunity for a major record company with vision and energy to release it in the United States ... " Herald Sun writer C. Adams said " Impossible Princess is her best yet , the <unk> , personal pop album she has always threatened . " Chris True of Allmusic called it " a pretty damn good record " and opined , " Unlike Minogue 's early work , this album sounds stronger and has a more natural feel . Her songwriting abilities have come a long way , and Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album . " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was impressed with the album 's " starkly personal and unified cord " , saying Impossible Princess " is the work of an artist willing to take risks , not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign . " 
 While reviewing her tenth album X ( November 2007 ) , Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented " For those who still have a copy of her Manic Street Preachers @-@ assisted Impossible Princess , then you have one of the most crazed , damn @-@ near perfect dance @-@ pop albums ever created . " Michael R. Smith from The Daily Vault called it her " biggest step forward " . Ben Willmott of NME criticized Impossible Princess ' musical direction , branding Minogue a " total fraud " for introducing several different genres . Specifically , he lambasted her collaborations with Bradfield . A reviewer from the publication Music Week was less than impressed , writing that " Kylie 's vocals take on a stroppy edge ... but not strong enough to do much " . A reviewer from Samesame.com.au said " Impossible Princess remains Kylie watershed moment creatively ... The resulting LP remains Kylie at her most pure . " 
 The album was nominated for Album of the Year at the 1998 ARIA Music Awards , her first nomination in that category , but lost to Unit by Regurgitator respectively . Sarah Smith from FasterLouder rated the album at number five on their The Most Underrated Albums of All Time , saying " Why Madonna 's Ray Of Light was acclaimed for pushing these boundaries at the very same moment Impossible Princess was maligned for it , is confusing , but perhaps best explained by the music media 's ongoing narrative of these two singers : Madonna is meant to challenge , Kylie , to smile , pout and spin round . " Slant Magazine included the album on their Vital Pop : 50 Essential Pop Albums list in June 2003 .

 The album debuted and peaked at number four on the ARIA Albums Chart and number one on the Australian Music Report chart in January 1998 . It became the highest debuting album on the top 50 chart for the week . It dropped to eight , unable to reach a higher position and descended out of the chart on the week end 26 April 1998 after fourteen weeks . It stayed in for thirty @-@ five weeks , Minogue 's longest @-@ charting album at that point . It became the thirty @-@ first best @-@ selling album of 1998 and was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) for shipments of 70 @,@ 000 copies . 
 In the UK , it entered the UK Albums Chart at number ten on 4 April 1998 . Despite being higher than her previous album Let 's Get To It , which reached number fifteen , it descended its way out and stayed in the chart for four weeks . Impossible Princess is Minogue 's worst selling studio album in the UK . Publications in the United Kingdom pointed out that the lack of devoted promotion with a tour was possible cause of low sales , along with Minogue 's image change . After a year of its release , UK Virgin Radio mocked the sales of the album along with Minogue 's concepts , stating : " We 've done something to improve Kylie 's records : we 've banned them . " 
 = = Impact = = 
 Impossible Princess is considered to be an example of Minogue 's constant " reinventions " and is recognized as her most personal and experimental album to date . Critics feel Impossible Princess is Minogue 's biggest leap forwards in terms of lyrics , vocals and music , with True commenting " She recruits Manic Street Preachers ' James Dean Bradfield , Sean Moore , and Nicky Wire , starts writing unaided , and completely changes musical direction . Enter Kylie Minogue 's Impossible Princess . From the trippy cover art to the abundance of guitars and experimental vocal tracks , this was her " great leap forward . " UK editor Tom Parker , who wrote the liner notes for the re @-@ released edition , labelled it her " greatest triumph " . Alan McGee from The Observer labelled her " Self @-@ realized Kylie " , but commented " Impossible Princess bombed . She was written off again " . Michael Paoletta from Billboard said that it is her most misunderstood album in her career . 
 Impossible Princess received huge backlash and mockery for her " Indie Kylie " image and low sales . It was viewed as an inferior attempt of Ray of Light by American singer Madonna , despite Madonna 's album being released months later . In retrospect , Tim Jonze from The Guardian felt her pop and disco @-@ influenced album Light Years ( 2000 ) saved her career from Impossible Princess ' backlash . 
 Minogue said that while Impossible Princess was strong , " I 've gotten stronger and more focused since that album " . As a result of the low success , Minogue left Deconstruction and BMG . Minogue told NME in 2008 that if she ever wrote another album solely by her " it 'd be seen as ' Impossible Princess 2 ' " . She did admit that she does not intend to do this because she may fear it " it would be equally critiqued . " In October 2012 , Minogue revealed that her most disappointing career moment was in fact the low sales of the album by commenting " look at Impossible Princess - it didn 't exactly sell truckloads of album ! " Minogue confirmed that she would never release an " Impossible Princess 2 " in the future .

 = Pushkar Lake = 
 Pushkar Lake or Pushkar Sarovar ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is located in the town of Pushkar in Ajmer district of the Rajasthan state of western India . Pushkar Lake is a sacred lake of the Hindus . The Hindu scriptures describe it as " Tirtha @-@ Raj " – the king of pilgrimage sites related to a water @-@ body and relate it to the mythology of the creator @-@ god Brahma , whose most prominent temple stands in Pushkar . The Pushkar Lake finds mention on coins as early as the 4th century BC . 
 Pushkar Lake is surrounded by 52 bathing ghats ( a series of steps leading to the lake ) , where pilgrims throng in large numbers to take a sacred bath , especially around Kartik Poornima ( October – November ) when the Pushkar Fair is held . A dip in the sacred lake is believed to cleanse sins and cure skin diseases . Over 500 Hindu temples are situated around the lake precincts . 
 Tourism and deforestation in the surroundings have taken a heavy toll on the lake , adversely affecting its water quality , reducing the water levels and destroying the fish population . As part of conservation measures , the government is undertaking de @-@ silting , de @-@ weeding , water treatment , and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Pushkar Lake around which the Pushkar town has developed is in the Ajmer district in the state of Rajasthan , India amidst the Aravalli range of hills . The mountain range known as Nag Parbat ( " snake mountain " ) separates the lake from the city of Ajmer . The valley is formed between the two parallel ranges of the Aravalli hills ( in elevation range of 650 – 856 metres ( 2 @,@ 133 – 2 @,@ 808 ft ) running south @-@ west to north @-@ east . Situated at 14 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) northwest from Ajmer , the artificial Pushkar Lake created by building a dam is surrounded by deserts and hills on all three sides . The lake is categorized as a " Sacred Lake " under the list of " Classification of Lakes in India " . 
 The soil and topography in the catchment are predominantly sandy with very low water retention capacity . The land use pattern in the Pushkar valley that drains into the lake comprises 30 % of the area under shifting sand dunes , 30 % under hills ( degraded and barren ) and streams and 40 % of the area is agricultural . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 The region experiences semi @-@ arid climatic conditions with dry and hot summers and cool winters . The summer months of May and June are the hottest , with a maximum temperature of around 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ) . During the winter months , the maximum mean temperature is in the range of 25 – 10 ° C ( 77 – 50 ° F ) . Rain mainly occurs during a short spell of two months during July and August . The recorded average rainfall is in the range of 400 – 600 millimetres ( 16 – 24 in ) . Rainfall is also recorded some times during winter months of January and February . 
 From April to September , strong winds blowing in the southwest to northeast direction add to the formation of sand dunes . 
 = = = Hydrology = = = 
 The Pushkar Lake drains a catchment of the Aravalli hills covering an area of 22 square kilometres ( 8 @.@ 5 sq mi ) . The lake has a water surface area of 22 hectares ( 54 acres ) . It is a perennial lake sourced by the monsoon rainfall over the catchment . The depth of water in the lake varies from season to season from 8 – 10 metres ( 26 – 33 ft ) . The total storage capacity of the lake is 0 @.@ 79 million cubic metres ( 1 @.@ 03 million cu yd ) . As the lake periphery is encircled by 52 ghats of various sizes , the surface water flow from the catchment into the lake is channelled through a series of arches under a foot bridge , 110 metres ( 360 ft ) long at the southern end . The foot bridge facilitates the parikrama ( circumambulation ) that is performed by pilgrims around the lake covering all the 52 ghats ( covers an area of 2 hectares ( 4 @.@ 9 acres ) ) . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 Pushkar Lake , when full , is rich in fish and other aquatic life . The depth of the lake has substantially shrunk – to less than 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) from a maximum of 9 metres ( 30 ft ) – resulting in the death of large fish weighing 5 – 20 kilograms ( 11 – 44 lb ) , caused due to the viscous water and the lack of oxygen for the fish to survive . Since the region where the lake and its valley is situated is arid , the flora and fauna recorded relate to desert plants , including cactus and thorny bushes , as well as desert animals like camels and cattle . Man @-@ eating crocodiles used to be a menace in the <unk> Lake , resulting in the deaths of people . Pilgrims were aware of this fact , yet many considered it as lucky to be eaten by crocodiles . The crocodiles were caught with nets by the British and shifted to a nearby reservoir . 
 = = History = = 
 Pushkar Lake 's history dates back to the 4th century BC . Numismatics , in the form of punched Greek and Kushan coins date the lake back to this time . The inscriptions found at Sanchi attest to the lake 's existence to the 2nd Century BC . This suggests that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre even if it did not lie on the trade route . 
 In the fifth century AD , Chinese traveller Fa Xian made reference to the number of visitors to Pushkar Lake . 
 A story tells of a ninth @-@ century Rajput king , Nahar Rao <unk> of Mandore , chasing a white boar to the lake shore on a hunting expedition . In order to quench his thirst , he dipped his hand into the lake and was astonished to see that the <unk> marks on his hand had disappeared . Impressed with the sacred curative nature of the lake , he got the lake restored to its glory . After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water , people have since visited the lake to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems . 
 The creation of Pushkar Lake , as an artificial lake , is also credited to the 12th century when a dam was built across the headwaters of the <unk> River . The 10th Sikh guru , Guru Govind Singh ( 1666 – 1708 ) , is said to have recited the Sikh sacred text Guru Granth Sahib on the banks of the lake . 
 During the Mughal rule , there was a short break in the lake 's importance due to the levy of a pilgrim tax and a ban on religious processions . In 1615 – 16 , the Mughal emperor Jahangir ( 1569 – 1627 ) built his hunting lodge ( seen now in total ruins ) on the shores of the Pushkar Lake to celebrate his victory over the local Rajput Rana ( king ) . He came to this lodge 16 times for hunting during his stay in Ajmer , about 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) from Pushkar . This act violated the local tradition of not killing any animals in the precincts of the sacred lake . He also committed an idolatrous act by breaking the image of Varaha – the boar Avatar of the god Vishnu , as it resembled a pig and symbolically hurt Islamic sensitivity . Thereafter , Jahangir 's grandson emperor Aurangzeb ( 1618 – 1707 ) destroyed and desecrated several temples , which were later rebuilt . However , during the rule of Jahangir 's father , Emperor Akbar ( 1542 – 1605 ) , there was a revival of not only the lake but also the Ajmer 's Dargah dedicated to <unk> saint <unk> Chishti , of whom Akbar was a devout follower . 
 The Rajput rulers of Amber , Bundi , Bikaner and Jaisalmer made great efforts to restore the importance of the lake and its surrounding temples . Credits given for modern additions to the building of ghats and the renovation / construction of temples go to Maharaja Man Singh I of Amber for the Raj Ghat and Man temple ; Maha Rana Pratap for the Varaha temple ; Daulat Rao Scindia for Kot Tirth Ghat , the Marathas @-@ <unk> Scindia to the <unk> Mahadev temple and Govind Rao , the Maratha governor of Ajmer for Shiva Ghat ; to the British rule for combining the religious pilgrimage with a cattle fair to generate taxes for improving the lake and its surroundings ; and gifting of the Jaipur Ghat and the Main Palace on the ghat in 1956 by the Maharaja of Jaipur . 
 = = Religious significance = = 
 There are various legends from Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata and the Puranic scriptures which mention the <unk> Lake and the town of Pushkar surrounding it . 
 According to the Hindu scripture Padma Purana , Brahma saw the demon <unk> ( <unk> in another version ) trying to kill his children and harassing people . He immediately slew the demon with his weapon , the lotus @-@ flower . In this process , the lotus petals fell on the ground at three places , where springs emerged creating three lakes : the Pushkar Lake or <unk> Pushkar ( greatest or first Pushkar ) , the <unk> Pushkar ( middle Pushkar ) Lake , and <unk> Pushkar ( lowest or youngest Pushkar ) lake . When Brahma came down to the earth , he named the place where the flower ( " <unk> " ) fell from Brahma 's hand ( " kar " ) as " Pushkar " . It is also said that the sacred Sarasvati River emerged at Pushkar as five streams . The three lakes were assigned their presiding deities as the Hindu Trinity Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva , respectively . When Brahma came down to the earth , he named the place where the lotus fell as ' Pushkar ' . Brahma then decided to perform a yagna at the place , at the main Pushkar Lake . However , his wife Savitri ( called Sarasvati in some versions ) could not be present at the designated time to perform the essential part of the yagna . Brahma , therefore , married a Gujjar , a dominant agricultural race named Gayatri and completed the yagna with his new consort sitting beside him . However , when Savitri finally arrived at the venue , she found Gayatri sitting next to Brahma in her rightful place . Agitated , she cursed Brahma that he would be worshipped only in Pushkar . As a result of this , yagna performed in the presence of all the gods , it is said that a dip in the lake created at this place is credited with holiness , assuring salvation from all sins . It is now one of the five holiest centres of pilgrimage for Hindus . 
 Ramayana and Mahabharata refer to Pushkar Lake as Adi Tirtha , or the " original sacred water @-@ body " . The famous Sanskrit poet and play @-@ writer Kalidasa also referred to this lake in his poem <unk> . The Ramayana mentions that Vishwamitra performed penance at Pushkar Lake for a thousand years . In spite of Brahma appearing before him and granting him the higher status of a rishi instead of a royal @-@ sage ( <unk> ) , Vishwamitra continued his penance , but , the celestial nymph apsara , Menaka came to the lake to take a bath . Vishwamitra was enamoured by her beauty and they decided to live together in pursuit of pleasure for ten years . Then , Vishwamitra realized that his main activity of penance was disturbed . He , therefore , took leave of Menaka and went away to the north to continue his meditation . Vishwamitra was also described as building the Brahma temple at Pushkar after Brahma 's yagna . Mahabharata mentions that Pushkar is a holy place of the god Vishnu , considered as the Adi Tirtha where millions of <unk> united during sunrise and sunset , and visiting the lake and taking a holy bath in the lake would wash off all sins . 
 According to Hindu theology , there are five sacred lakes collectively called Panch @-@ Sarovar ( ' Sarovar ' means " lake " ) . Namely , Mansarovar , Bindu Sarovar , Narayan Sarovar , Pampa Sarovar and Pushkar Sarovar ; hence , Pushkar is considered one of the most sacred places in India . It is also the belief of devotees that a dip in the waters of the lake on Kartik Poornima would equal the benefits that would accrue by performing <unk> ( fire @-@ sacrifices ) for several centuries . Pushkar is often called " Tirtha @-@ Raj " – the king of pilgrimage sites related to water @-@ bodies . The scriptures also mention that doing parikrama ( circumambulation ) of the three lakes ( the main Pushkar , <unk> Pushkar where there is a Hanuman temple and an old Banyan tree , and <unk> Pushkar where a Krishna temple exists ) , which cover a distance of 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) , during the Kartik Poornima day would be highly auspicious . International Business Times has identified Pushkar as one of the ten most religious places in the world and one of the five sacred pilgrimage places for the Hindus , in India . 
 = = Cultural attractions = = 
 Pushkar Lake and its precincts offer a plethora of monuments of national importance , such as the Pushkar city , the Brahma temple at Pushkar and the ghats on the periphery of the lakes . The lake is the central divine theme for the popularity of all the monuments seen in the town and the fairs held here . 
 = = = Pushkar city = = = 
 Pushkar city , with a population of 14 @,@ 791 at the 2001 census , is one of the oldest cities in India . The city lies on the shore of Pushkar Lake . The date of its actual origin is not known , but legend associates Brahma with its creation concurrent with the lake ; Brahma is said to have performed penance here for a darshan ( sight ) of god Vishnu . Thus , its uniqueness lies in the fact of its historic @-@ religious @-@ cultural background , and as a result it attracts approximately 100 @,@ 000 visitors every month , apart from the very large congregation that occurs during the annual Pushkar Fair . However , the Pushkar Lake is central to its sustenance as a religious centre . The tourist arrivals during 2005 were reported to be about 16 @.@ 12 million ( said to be the maximum among all tourist attractions in Rajasthan ) , out of which the foreign tourists were about 63 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Temples = = = 
 Apart from the sacred Lake , Pushkar is said to have over 500 temples ( 80 are large and the rest are small ) ; of these many old temples were destroyed or desecrated by Muslim depredations during Aurangzeb 's rule ( 1658 – 1707 ) but were re @-@ built subsequently . The most important of these is the Brahma temple . Though the current structure dates to the 14th century , the original temple is believed to be 2000 years old . Pushkar is often described in the scriptures as the only Brahma temple in the world , owing to the curse of Savitri , but also as the " King of the sacred places of the Hindus " . Although now the Pushkar temple does not remain the only Brahma temple , it is still one of very few existing temples dedicated to Brahma in India as well as the most prominent . Hindu pilgrims , including holy men and sages visit this temple after taking a ceremonial sacred bath in the Pushkar Lake . Other notable temples around the lake include Varaha temple – dedicated to Varaha ( the boar incarnation of god Vishnu ) , Savitri temple and Gayatri temple , dedicated to the consorts of Brahma . 
 = = = Ghats = = = 
 Ghats ( stone steps laid on a gradual bank slope to descend to the lake edge ) at Pushkar are integral to the lake . Ghats are also used for sacred bathing and rites , such as ancestor worship . Out of 52 ghats used by pilgrims to take a holy bath in the lake , ten important ghats on the periphery of the lake , which have other contiguous ghats adjoining them , have also been declared as ' Monuments of National Importance ' . These ghats are : the Varaha Ghat , the <unk> Ghat , Saptarishi Ghats , Gwalior Ghat , Kota Ghat , Gau ghat , <unk> Ghat , Jaipur Ghat , <unk> Ghat and <unk> Ghat . These ghats as well as the sacred Pushkar Lake ( which is also a declared heritage monument ) have been refurbished over the centuries by the Royal families of Rajasthan and by the Maratha kings . These are now undergoing further improvements as part of a heritage improvement programme launched with funds provided by the Government of Rajasthan and several departments of the Government of India . There are strict codes to be followed while taking a bath in the ghats , such as removing shoes away from the ghats and avoiding the passing of unwarranted comments about Hindu religious beliefs by non @-@ Hindus , since the ghats and the temples are linked to the divine lake . The sacred water of the lake is said to be curative of many skin diseases . Local belief is that water around each ghat has a special curative power . While many ghats have been named after the Rajas who built them , some ghats have particular importance . Varaha ghat is so named since Vishnu appeared here in his incarnation of a boar ( Varaha ) . Brahma Ghat is so named since Brahma bathed here . The Gau Ghat was renamed as Gandhi Ghat after Mahatma Gandhi 's ashes were immersed at this ghat . <unk> Singh Ghat , close to Varaha Ghat , has a stuffed crocodile on display . 
 A coinage known as " Puskar Passport " used by visitors to the lake and the ghats denotes the red thread that is tied on the wrists of pilgrims by the priests ( for a <unk> – an unspecified fee ) . This indicates that the pilgrim has visited Pushkar Lake and is usually not approached by priests again for further rites and fees . 
 = = Pushkar Fair = = 
 Pushkar Lake and its precincts become very heavily populated during the annual Pushkar Fair or Pushkar mela , which has both a religious as well as an economic aspect . During the fair , a very large gathering of pilgrims takes a holy dip in the lake and the camel fair is an adjunct celebration . Pushkar Fair commences on Prabodhini Ekadashi , the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight and ends on Kartik Poornima – the full Moon day in the month of Kartik ( October – November ) , the latter being the most important day of the fair . This fair is held in the honour of god Brahma . A ritual bath on Kartik Poornima in the Pushkar Lake is considered to lead one to salvation . It is believed circling the three <unk> on Kartik Poornima is highly meritorious . Sadhus , Hindu holy men , gather here and stay from the Ekadashi to full moon day in caves . The Pushkar fair is also Asia 's largest camel fair . The colourful and lively Camel Fair reportedly attracts 2 lakh people and 50 @,@ 000 camels . In this fair held on the banks of the lake , camels are very colourfully decorated and paraded in the sand dunes on the southern part of the lake . Tribes from several neighbouring villages are seen in their traditional colourful costumes . The fair on Kartik Poornima , the day when Brahma is believed to have concluded his Yagna establishing the lake . It is organized by the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation ( <unk> ) , Pushkar Municipal Board and the Animal Husbandry Department of Rajasthan . The fair is a colourful cultural event also with folk dances , music , camel races and the cattle fair . The tug of war is a popular entertaining sport held during the fair . This event is held between the <unk> and foreigners ; locals invariably win the event . 
 = = Status and conservation issues = = 
 The natural environment of Pushkar Lake and its precincts has become increasingly degraded in the last few decades . The problems arise primarily from the over development of tourist facilities as well as the deforestation of the surrounding area . 
 The critical issues related to the conservation of the lake have been identified as : 
 Siltation during the rainy season due to soil erosion of the denuded hills and inappropriate agricultural practices flowing through the three feeder streams namely , the <unk> , the Nag Pahar and Savitri . 
 Shifting sand dunes from hills and surrounding areas causing a rise of the bed level of the lake . 
 Upstream interception by farmers through check dams for farming practices causing reduction in inflows . This reduction is reflected in the full reservoir level of 8 @.@ 53 metres ( 28 @.@ 0 ft ) not being achieved during most years , resulting in pilgrim displeasure and the reduction in maximum depth of the lake , reported now as only 4 @.@ 6 metres ( 15 ft ) . 
 Large inflow of sewage from the ghats and the surrounding habitation has caused serious water pollution . 
 <unk> rate of fall in ground water level has occurred in the vicinity of the lake due to high extraction for various uses . 
 In recent years , storage in the Pushkar Lake has been reduced alarmingly , leaving only a small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred bathing during the Hindu holy month of Kartik , when the Pushkar Fair is held . During the 2009 Pushkar fair , the situation became very grim when the lake dried up entirely . Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred bathing by providing water in concrete tanks near one of the upper ghats , fed by tube wells from ground water sources . While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de @-@ silting the lake , the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake . 
 = = = Water quality issues = = = 
 The lake does not meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high concentration of Biochemical Oxygen Demand ( <unk> ) . Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication , anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism , a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months . The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations . The water samples were analysed for temperature , pH , salinity , conductivity , total dissolved solids , alkalinity , hardness , turbidity , dissolved oxygen , chloride , nitrite , nitrate , phosphate , sulphate , sodium , ammonium , potassium , total chlorophyll , biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand . The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline , chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites , and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen ( at sites with greater pollution load ) and high hardness ( on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run @-@ off ) . During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair , a distinct co @-@ relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake . This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management , with people 's participation . 
 = = = Restoration works = = = 
 To supplement water supply to the lake , even as early as in 1993 , the government built 12 deep tube wells to supplement water supply to the lake . However , most tube wells were dysfunctional , thereby aggravating the problem . The Union Ministry for Environment and Forests included Pushkar Lake on a list of five lakes under the National Lake Conservation Project ( <unk> ) for restoration . They have been providing funds since 2008 for the restoration works , but the situation has not eased . 
 Development plans are under various stages of implementation to address the critical issues related to the lake . They aim to improve water quality , increase water storage capacity , prevent encroachment of the lake periphery , improve the ambience around the lake , as well as to introduce recreational and revenue generating schemes . 
 Sewage outfalls into the lake are proposed to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines . Lining the main feeders into the lake and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned . Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of <unk> and <unk> , water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake , construction of check dams , conservation of ghats , afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment , soil moisture conservation measures , stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation in the bed of feeder channels . In addition , the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population 's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation to reduce the risk of death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake .

The vocals were recorded by Jim Annunziato , Josh Gudwin and Kuk Harrell at Cove Studios in New York City , New York and Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles , California . RedOne , Chris " Tek " O 'Ryan and Trevor Muzzy handled audio engineering of " Invading My Mind " , while RedOne and O 'Ryan were in charge of vocal editing . RedOne , BeatGeek and Joker provided instruments for the song and also programming for them . The song was later mixed by Trevor Muzzy . 
 " Invading My Mind " is an uptempo song , with a length of three minutes and twenty seconds ( 3 : 20 ) . Melinda Newman of HitFix described " Invading My Mind " as being a " fast @-@ paced , Euro @-@ tinged , robotic dance thumper " , while <unk> <unk> of Radio and Music called it a " groovy club banger " with " high energy beats " .

 In August 2011 , Rebecca Francescatti , a Chicago @-@ based singer , filed a lawsuit against Lady Gaga claiming that she had plagiarized elements of her 1999 recording " Juda " ( It 's All About You ) for Gaga 's 2011 single " Judas " . Francescatti 's lawyer told TMZ : " Though the songs are different styles , the composition is the same , and the chorus is the same melody . [ Francescatti ] is seeking recognition for what she created . " Francescatti noted that the similarities of the two songs could stem from the fact that her former bass player , Brian Gaynor , was now working for a company who wrote several tracks for Gaga 's second album Born This Way ( 2011 ) . 
 Francescatti 's lawyer claimed in December 2012 that Gaga used an additional unlicensed sample in " Judas " and then incorporated it into " Invading My Mind " . It was alleged that Gaga asked Lopez for a credit on " Invading My Mind " to " cover her tracks " , with Francescatti 's lawyer claiming that she did not even contribute to the song . The lawsuit claimed to have uncovered text messages between Gaga and RedOne proving that she had stolen the sample loop used in both " Judas " and " Invading My Mind " .

Now she unites with Gaga pal RedOne for this appropriately named piece of pop pleasure : Once the club banger hits your ears , good or bad , you won 't be able to get it out of your head . " Tanner Stransky , also of Entertainment Weekly , gave a positive review of the song , stating that between " On the Floor " and " Invading My Mind " Lopez is " really made a glittery return to her extreme club / " Waiting for Tonight " roots " . She continued by stating : " Sure , ' [ Invading My ] Mind ' may be shallower than the kiddie pool , but this one is up from the first second ... and never goes down " . Monica Herrera from Billboard stated that on " Invading My Mind " RedOne and Lady Gaga bring the " hit potential " , while Lopez " brings the heat " . She continued by stating that the song is an " irresistible ' 80s euphoria and release " . 
 Digital Spy 's Robert Copsey , who although stated that the song isn 't anything " we haven 't heard before , " it is worthy of a standalone release . Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots disagreed , stating that " the lyrics are a little repetitive to be a feature single " , but it could , however , be a " great follow up to ' On the Floor ' if you want to listen back to back and keep dancing " .

 = Q * bert = 
 Q * bert / <unk> / is an arcade video game developed and published by Gottlieb in 1982 . It is a 2D action game with puzzle elements that uses " isometric " graphics to create a pseudo @-@ 3D effect , and serves as a precursor to the isometric platformer genre . The objective is to change the color of every cube in a pyramid by making the on @-@ screen character hop on top of the cube while avoiding obstacles and enemies . Players use a joystick to control the character . 
 The game was conceived by Warren Davis and Jeff Lee . Lee designed the title character and original concept , which was then further developed and implemented by Davis . Q * bert was developed under the project name Cubes , but was briefly named <unk> And Boogers and @ ! # ? @ ! during development . 
 Q * bert was well received in arcades and among critics . The game was Gottlieb 's most successful video game and among the most recognized brands from the golden age of arcade video games . It has been ported to numerous platforms . The success resulted in sequels and the use of the character 's likeness in merchandising , such as appearances on lunch boxes , toys , and an animated television show . The character Q * bert became known for his " swearing " , an incoherent phrase of synthesized speech generated by the sound chip and a speech balloon of nonsensical characters that appear when he collides with an enemy . 
 Because the game was developed during the period when Columbia Pictures owned Gottlieb , the intellectual rights to Q * bert remained with Columbia even after they divested themselves of Gottlieb 's assets in 1984 . Therefore , the rights have been owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment since its parent Sony acquired Columbia in 1989 . Q * bert appeared in Disney 's computer @-@ animated film Wreck @-@ It Ralph under license from Sony , and later appeared in Columbia 's live @-@ action film Pixels in 2015 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Q * bert is an action game with puzzle elements played from an axonometric third @-@ person perspective to convey a three @-@ dimensional look . The game is played using a single , diagonally mounted four @-@ way joystick . The player controls Q * bert , who starts each game at the top of a pyramid made of 28 cubes , and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube . Landing on a cube causes it to change color , and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage . 
 At the beginning , jumping on every cube once is enough to advance . In later stages , each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color . Other times , cubes change color every time Q * bert lands on them , instead of remaining on the target color once they reach it . Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages . Jumping off the pyramid results in the character 's death . 
 The player is impeded by several enemies , introduced gradually to the game : 
 Coily - Coily first appears as a purple egg that bounces to the bottom of the pyramid and then transforms into a snake that chases after Q * bert . 
 Ugg and <unk> - Two purple creatures that hop along the sides of the cubes in an <unk> manner . Starting at either the bottom left or bottom right corner , they keep moving toward the top right or top left side of the pyramid respectively , and fall off the pyramid when they reach the end . 
 Slick and Sam - Two green creatures that descend down the pyramid and revert cubes whose color has already been changed . 
 A collision with purple enemies is fatal to the character , whereas the green enemies are removed from the board upon contact . Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward ; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q * bert , while contact with a green one immobilizes the on @-@ screen enemies for a limited time . <unk> floating discs on either side of the pyramid serve as an escape from danger , particularly Coily . When Q * bert jumps on a disc , it transports him to the top of the pyramid . If Coily is in close pursuit of the character , he will jump after Q * bert and fall to his death , awarding bonus points . This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear , though they start to return after a few seconds . 
 Points are awarded for each color change ( 25 ) , defeating Coily with a flying disc ( 500 ) , remaining discs at the end of a stage ( at higher stages , 50 or 100 ) and catching green balls ( 100 ) or Slick and Sam ( 300 each ) . Extra lives are granted for reaching certain scores , which are set by the machine operator . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Concept = = = 
 The basic ideas for the game were thought up by Warren Davis and Jeff Lee . The initial concept began when artist Jeff Lee drew a pyramid of cubes inspired by M. C. Escher . Lee felt a game could be derived from the artwork , and created an orange , armless main character . The character jumped along the cubes and shot projectiles , called " mucus bombs " , from a tubular nose at enemies . Enemies included a blue creature , later changed purple and named Wrong Way , and an orange creature , later changed green and named Sam . Lee had drawn similar characters since childhood , inspired by characters from comics , cartoons , Mad magazine and by artist Ed " Big Daddy " Roth . Q * bert 's design later included a speech balloon with a string of nonsensical characters , " @ ! # ? @ ! " , which Lee originally presented as joke . 
 = = = Implementation = = = 
 Warren Davis , a programmer hired to work on the action game Protector , noticed Lee 's ideas , and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic . Thus , he added balls that bounced from the pyramid 's top to bottom . Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics , he wanted to keep the design simple . He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand . To accomplish this , Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger . As Davis worked on the game one night , Gottlieb 's vice president of engineering , Ron Waxman , noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game 's character has landed on them . Davis implemented a unique control scheme ; a four @-@ way joystick was rotated 45 ° to match the directions of Q * bert 's jumping . Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation , but Davis stuck to his decision . Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982 , but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 A MOS Technology 6502 chip that operates at 894 kHz generates the sound effects , and a speech synthesizer by <unk> generates Q * bert 's incoherent expressions . The audio system uses <unk> of random @-@ access memory and <unk> of <unk> programmable read only memory to store the sound data and code to implement it . Like other Gottlieb games , the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage . In retrospect , audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing . 
 Thiel was tasked with using the synthesizer to produce English phrases for the game . However , he was unable to create coherent phrases and eventually chose to string together random phonemes instead . Thiel also felt the incoherent speech was a good fit for the " @ ! # ? @ ! " in Q * bert 's speech balloon . Following a suggestion from technician Rick Tighe , a pinball machine component was included to make a loud sound when a character falls off the pyramid . The sound is generated by an internal coil that hits the interior of a cabinet wall . Foam padding was added to the area of contact on the cabinet ; the developers felt the softer sound better matched a fall rather than a loud knocking sound . The cost of installing foam , however , was too expensive and the padding was omitted . 
 = = = Title = = = 
 The Gottlieb staff had difficulty naming the game . Aside from the project name " Cubes " , it was untitled for most of the development process . The staff agreed the game should be named after the main character , but disagreed on the name . Lee 's title for the initial concept — <unk> And Boogers — was rejected , as was a list of suggestions compiled from company employees . According to Davis , vice president of marketing Howie Rubin championed @ ! # ? @ ! as the title . Although staff members argued it was silly and would be impossible to pronounce , a few early test models were produced with @ ! # ? @ ! as the title on the units ' artwork . During a meeting , " Hubert " was suggested , and a staff member thought of combining " Cubes " and " Hubert " into " <unk> " . Art director Richard Tracy changed the name to " Q @-@ bert " , and the hyphen was later changed to an asterisk . In retrospect , Davis expressed regret for the asterisk , because he felt it prevented the name from becoming a common crossword term and it is a wildcard character for search engines . 
 = = = Testing = = = 
 As development neared the production stage , Q * bert underwent location tests in local arcades under its preliminary title @ ! # ? @ ! , before being widely distributed . According to Jeff Lee , his oldest written record attesting to the game being playable as @ ! # ? @ ! in a public location , a Brunswick bowling alley , dates back to September 11 , 1982 . Gottlieb also conducted focus groups , in which the designers observed players through a one @-@ way mirror . The control scheme received a mixed reaction during play testing ; some players adapted quickly while others found it frustrating . Initially , Davis was worried players would not adjust to the different controls ; some players would unintentionally jump off the pyramid several times , reaching a game over in about ten seconds . Players , however , became accustomed to the controls after playing several rounds of the game . The different responses to the controls prompted Davis to reduce the game 's level of difficulty — a decision that he would later regret .

 A copyright claim registered with the United States Copyright Office by Gottlieb on February 10 , 1983 cites the date of publication of Q * bert as October 18 , 1982 . Video Games reported that the game was sold directly to arcade operators at its public showing at the AMOA show held November 18 – 20 , 1982 . Gottlieb offered the machines for $ 2600 per unit . Q * bert is Gottlieb 's fourth video game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Q * bert was Gottlieb 's only video game that gathered huge critical and commercial success , selling around 25 @,@ 000 arcade cabinets . Cabaret and cocktail versions of the game were later produced . The machines have since become collector 's items ; the rarest of them are the cocktail versions . 
 When the game was first introduced to a wider industry audience at the November 1982 AMOA show , it was immediately received favorably by the press . Video Games placed Q * bert first in its list of Top Ten Hits , describing it as " the most unusual and exciting game of the show " and stating that " no operator dared to walk away without buying at least one " . The Coin Slot reported " Gottlieb 's game , Q * <unk> , was one of the stars of the show " , and predicted that " The game should do very well . " 
 Contemporaneous reviews were equally enthusiastic , and focused on the uniqueness of the gameplay and audiovisual presentation . Roger C. Sharpe of Electronic Games considered it " a potential Arcade Award winner for coin @-@ op game of the year " , praising innovative gameplay and outstanding graphics . William <unk> of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games described the game as an " all @-@ round winner " that had many strong points . He praised the variety of sound effects and the graphics , calling the colors vibrant . <unk> lauded Q * bert 's inventiveness and appeal , stating that the objective was interesting and unique . Michael Blanchet of Electronic Fun suggested the game might push Pac @-@ Man out of the spotlight in 1983 . Neil <unk> of Video Games also likened Q * bert to Japanese games like Pac @-@ Man and Donkey Kong , due to the focus on characters , animation and story lines , as well as the " absence of violence " . Computer and Video Games magazine praised the game 's graphics and colors . 
 Electronic Games awarded Q * bert " Most Innovative Coin @-@ op Game " of the year . Video Game Player called it the " Funniest Game of the Year " among arcade games in 1983 . 
 Q * bert continues to be widely recognized as a significant part of video game history . Author Steven Kent and GameSpy 's William Cassidy considered Q * bert one of the more memorable games of its time . Author David Ellis echoed similar statements , calling it a " classic favorite " . 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish and Kim Wild of Retro Gamer magazine described the game as difficult yet addictive . Author John Sellers also called Q * bert addictive , and praised the sound effects and three @-@ dimensional appearance of the graphics . Cassidy called the game unique and challenging ; he attributed the challenge in part to the control scheme . IGN 's Jeremy Dunham felt the controls were poorly designed , describing them as " unresponsive " and " a struggle " . He nonetheless commented that the game was addictive despite the controls . 
 The main character also received positive press coverage . Edge magazine attributed the success of the game to the title character . They stated that players could easily relate to Q * bert , particularly because he swore . Computer and Video Games , however , considered the swearing a negative , but still felt the character was appealing . Cassidy believed the game 's appeal lay in the main character . He described Q * bert as cute and having a personality that made him stand out in comparison to other popular video game characters . The authors of High Score ! referred to Q * bert as " ultra @-@ endearing alien <unk> " , and the cutest game character of 1982 .

 At the 1982 AMOA Show , Parker Brothers secured the license to publish home conversions of the Q * bert arcade game . Parker first published a port to the Atari 2600 , and by the end of 1983 , the company also advertised versions for Atari 5200 , Intellivision , ColecoVision , the Atari 8 @-@ bit computer family , Commodore VIC @-@ 20 , Texas Instruments TI @-@ 99 / 4A and Commodore 64 . The release of the Commodore 64 version was noted to lag behind the others but appeared in 1984 . Parker Brothers also translated the game into a stand @-@ alone tabletop electronic game . It uses a VFD screen , and has since become a rare collector 's item . Q * bert was also published by Parker Brothers for the Philips <unk> in Europe , by <unk> Original for the Othello <unk> in Japan , and by Ultra Games for the NES in North America . 
 The initial home port for the Atari 2600 , the most widespread system at the time , was met with mixed reactions . Video Games warned that buyers of the Atari 2600 version " may find themselves just a little disappointed . " They criticized the lack of music , the removing of the characters Ugg and <unk> , and the system 's troubles to handle the character sprites on screen at a steady performance . Later Mark Brownstein of the same magazine was more in favor of the game , but still cited the presence of fewer cubes in the game 's pyramidal layout and " pretty poor control " as negatives . Will Richardson of Electronic Games noted a lack in audiovisual qualities and counter @-@ intuitive controls , but commended the gameplay , stating that the game " comes much closer to its source of inspiration than a surface evaluation indicates " . Randi Hacker of Electronic Fun with Computers & Games called it a " sterling adaption [ sic ] " In 2008 , however , IGN 's Levi Buchanan rated it the fourth worst arcade port for the Atari 2600 , mostly due to a lack of jumping animations for enemies , which instead pop up instantly on the adjacent cube , making it impossible to know which direction they travel before they land . Entertainment Weekly called Q * Bert one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013 , saying the port " lost the cool isometric perspective but none of the addictive gameplay " . 
 Other home versions were well @-@ received for the most part , with some exceptions . Of the ColecoVision version , Electronic Fun with Computers & Games noted that " Q * bert aficionados will not be disappointed " . Marc Brownstein of Video Games called it one of the best of the authorized versions . Warren Davis also considered the ColecoVision version the most accurate port of the arcade . Mark Brownstein judged the Atari 5200 version inferior to the ColecoVision , due to the imprecision of the Atari 5200 controller , but noted that " it does tend to grow on you . " Video Games determined the Intellivision version as the worst of the available ports , criticizing the system 's controller for being inadequate for the game . Antic magazine 's David Duberman called the Atari 8 @-@ bit version " one of the finest translations of an arcade game for the home computer format " , and Arthur <unk> of Creative Computing listed it as a runner @-@ up for Best Arcade Adaptation to the system , praising its faithful graphics , sound , movement and playability . Softline was more critical , criticizing the Atari version 's controls and lack of swearing . The magazine concluded that " the home computer game doesn 't have the sense of style of the one in the arcades ... the execution just isn 't there " . In 1984 the magazine 's readers named the game the fifth @-@ worst Atari program of 1983 . Computer Games called the C64 version an " absolutely terrific translation " that " almost totally duplicates the arcade game , " aside from its lack of synthesized speech . The stand @-@ alone tabletop was awarded Stand @-@ Alone Game of the Year in Electronic Games . 
 In 2003 , a version for Java @-@ based mobile phones was announced by Sony Pictures Mobile . Reviewers generally acknowledged it as a faithful port of the arcade original , but criticized the controls . <unk> 's Robert Falcon stated that the diagonal controls take time to adapt to on a cell phone with traditional directions . Michael French of Pocket Gamer concluded : " You can 't escape the fact it doesn 't exactly fit on mobile . The graphics certainly do , and the spruced @-@ up sound effects are timeless … but really , it 's a little too perfect a conversion . " <unk> criticized the gameplay as monotonous and the difficulty as frustrating . By contrast , Wireless Gaming Review called it " one of the best of mobile 's retro roundup " . 
 On February 22 , 2007 , Q * bert was released on the PlayStation 3 's PlayStation Network . It features upscaled and filtered graphics , an online leaderboard for players to post high @-@ scores , and Sixaxis motion controls . The game received a mixed reception . Dunham and Gerstmann did not enjoy the motion controls and felt it was a title only for nostalgic players . Eurogamer.net 's Richard Leadbetter judged the game 's elements " too simplistic and repetitive to make them worthwhile in 2007 " . In contrast , Parish considered the title worth purchasing , citing its addictive gameplay .

 Q * bert became one of the most merchandised arcade games behind Pac @-@ Man , although according to John Sellers it was not nearly as successful as that franchise or Donkey Kong . The character 's likeness appears on various items including coloring books , sleeping bags , <unk> , board games , wind @-@ up toys , and stuffed animals . In a flyer distributed in 1983 , Gottlieb claimed over 125 licensed products . However , the North American video game crash of 1983 depressed the market , and the game 's popularity began to decline by 1984 . 
 In the years following its release , Q * bert inspired many other games with similar concepts .

 = Ralph Milne = 
 Ralph Milne ( 13 May 1961 – 6 September 2015 ) was a Scottish professional footballer whose clubs included Dundee United , Charlton Athletic , Bristol City and Manchester United . He played as both an attacking midfielder or a winger . 
 He began his career at Dundee United , helping the club to be crowned Premier Division champions in 1982 – 83 , and playing in Scottish Cup and League Cup final defeats . In recognition of his contribution to the most successful period in the club 's history , Milne has been inducted into the Dundee United Hall of Fame , alongside several of his former teammates . He made a total of 285 appearances for Dundee United in major competitions and is the club 's all @-@ time top scorer in Europe ( UEFA Cup and European Cup ) with a tally of 15 goals . Milne is often considered to be amongst some of the best Scottish footballers not to win a full senior cap . 
 Hampered by his heavy drinking , he hit his peak at an early age and after an unsuccessful spell at English club Charlton Athletic from January 1987 , ended the 1987 – 88 season with Third Division club Bristol City . He returned to the First Division after being signed by Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in November 1988 for a £ 170 @,@ 000 fee , but failed to restart his career . Barring a brief spell in Hong Kong with Sing Tao , Milne played his last first @-@ team game as a professional at the age of 28 . 
 = = Club career = = 
 Ralph Milne was born in Dundee , the youngest of four siblings , on 13 May 1961 . He was moved forward a year in primary school due to his remarkable academic progress . He began his football career as a youth with Dundee Celtic Boys Club , where he played initially as a striker and had a prolific goalscoring record .

 = = = = Immediate success = = = = 
 Milne signed for Dundee United in January 1976 and after a couple of seasons in the reserves began to feature for the first team during the 1979 – 80 campaign . He scored his first goal at the age of 18 during his full debut appearance on 28 July 1979 , United 's third goal in a 3 – 0 win over Dunfermline Athletic in a Drybrough Cup tie . Milne scored his first Premier Division goal on 8 September in a 2 – 2 draw away against Celtic , netting the equaliser with a long @-@ range shot . By the end of his debut season , Milne had played 20 games , eight of which he was in the starting line @-@ up for , and scored three goals . He was named as the club 's Reserve Player of the Year and picked up a 1979 Scottish League Cup Final winners medal despite not being named in the matchday squad . 
 The 1980 – 81 season saw Milne become a regular in the Dundee United team , scoring 10 goals in 33 appearances . United retained the League Cup , though Milne did not feature in the final victory over their Dundee derby rivals at Dens Park . He finished the season playing in the 1981 Scottish Cup Final side , which ended in a 4 – 1 defeat to Rangers after a replay . Milne was now being described by manager Jim McLean as " potentially ... the most exciting player in Scotland " , describing Milne as a " winger with pace who can score goals " . McLean however expressed reservations about Milne 's overall attitude and ability to play through patches of poor form . 
 Dundee United reached another final in the 1981 – 82 season , and Milne scored the opening goal in the 1981 Scottish League Cup Final on 28 November 1981 , latching onto a pass from Paul Sturrock and striking a low powerful shot past the Rangers goalkeeper ; however Rangers went on to controversially win 2 – 1 after another goal for Dundee United , " scored " by Sturrock , had been disallowed for offside . Milne also impressed in Europe that season , scoring against AS Monaco , Borussia Mönchengladbach and <unk> ( twice ) in the UEFA Cup . 
 = = = = League title and European Cup campaign = = = = 
 The 1982 – 83 season proved to be a seminal year for both Dundee United and 21 year @-@ old Milne . The club won the league for the first time , finishing one point ahead of Celtic and " New Firm rivals " Aberdeen in a tightly fought league campaign . Milne 's 16 goals in the league , playing wide right , were a significant contribution to United 's league win . One of the most high profile of these goals was on 20 April when he scored the winning goal in a 3 – 2 win over Celtic at Parkhead ; he controlled an Eamonn Bannon cross from the right on his chest and volleyed the ball from 20 yards out past Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner . On the last day of the season , 14 May 1983 , Dundee United needed a win to guarantee the league title . The day after his 22nd birthday , Milne opened the scoring against local rivals Dundee with a skilfully executed long @-@ distance chipped shot ; the match finished 2 – 1 to United . Milne achieved his peak goal tally in his career that season , scoring 21 goals in all competitions . Having turned 22 the day before the game , the goal against Dundee was to be the defining moment of his career . 
 Dundee United 's league success saw them take part in the European Cup in 1983 – 84 . Milne scored doubles against <unk> Spartans and Standard Liège as United reached the semi @-@ final , losing 3 – 2 on aggregate to Roma in an ill @-@ tempered tie . Dundee United also failed to retain their league title , finishing in third place and 10 points behind champions Aberdeen . Milne 's goal tally also dropped significantly from the previous year , down to five goals in the league and a total of 12 in all competitions . 
 = = = = Discipline problems and decline = = = = 
 Milne was with Dundee United for a further three seasons and still a regular player in the team , although he scored less frequently . Milne 's increasingly fractious relationship with manager Jim McLean was also becoming common knowledge ; in December 1983 McLean publicly criticised Milne , stating " I have tried to get the message across to him that it is when he is not playing well that he needs to work hardest . It is plainly not sinking in . " Ironically some months later in August 1984 , it was Milne who scored both goals against Nottingham Forest in a pre @-@ season testimonial match for McLean . However , after the game the pair again fell out because of a brief conversation Milne had with Brian Clough which led McLean to believe the player was trying to arrange a deal away from United ; by this time Milne had grown increasingly frustrated over being frequently fined a week 's wages for breaking minor club rules and generally offending McLean 's strict sense of discipline . The financial strain this caused led to him to work as a casual labourer in order to meet his mortgage repayments . By this time his drinking had become more of a problem , resulting in a struggle to maintain fitness . 
 Milne featured in a further two Cup finals for United , losing 1 – 0 to Rangers in October 1984 in the Scottish League Cup Final and losing 2 – 1 to Celtic in May 1985 in the Scottish Cup Final . He aggravated a hamstring injury in the final against Rangers and was out of action for three months . In 1986 – 87 , he played in the first three rounds of the UEFA Cup run ( scoring once , against RC Lens in the first round ) which eventually saw the team beat Barcelona and Borussia Mönchengladbach on their way to the final . However Milne had left in January 1987 before these high profile games took place , sold to Charlton Athletic , having lost his place in the side to the up @-@ and @-@ coming Kevin Gallacher . He made a total of 285 appearances for Dundee United in major competitions and is the club 's all @-@ time top scorer in Europe ( UEFA Cup and European Cup ) with a tally of 15 goals .

 He was sold to English First Division club Charlton Athletic in January 1987 for a fee of £ 125 @,@ 000 . He played at Wembley Stadium in the final of the Full Members Cup on 29 March , which ended in a 1 – 0 defeat to Blackburn Rovers . Charlton finished the 1986 – 87 season in the relegation play @-@ off place , but retained their top @-@ flight status after beating Leeds United 2 – 1 in a replay in the play @-@ off final , following a 1 – 1 aggregate draw . Milne only played as a late substitute in the first leg at Selhurst Park , and ended the game with a broken jaw after being elbowed by Micky Adams . He dropped out of manager Lennie Lawrence 's first team plans during the 1987 – 88 season , and was allowed to leave the club . 
 = = = Bristol City = = = 
 Milne dropped down two divisions to join Bristol City for a £ 50 @,@ 000 fee in January 1988 . City ended the 1987 – 88 campaign in the play @-@ offs , but failed to gain promotion after losing 4 – 0 to Walsall in a replay of the play @-@ off final . 
 After a full pre @-@ season he started to play well and hit six goals in 30 Third Division games during his time at Ashton Gate . Milne 's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested , a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland . On being called into a meeting with manager , Joe Jordan , Milne was told by Jordan that he had no intention of letting him nor any of his other best players leave , but that he would make an exception for Manchester United . 
 = = = Manchester United = = = 
 Milne 's form at Bristol City was enough to convince Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson that he was still worth a contract with a top @-@ flight club . In November 1988 he moved to Old Trafford in a £ 170 @,@ 000 deal . Ferguson was looking to build a title winning side two years after joining United , but had seen his side finish second in the league the previous season and now they were on a winless run in the league that saw them mid @-@ table . He put Milne on the left @-@ wing as Gordon Strachan was already established on the right @-@ wing . 
 Milne managed three goals in 22 league appearances in 1988 – 89 . The first was a 20 @-@ yard volley on 3 December 1988 in a 3 – 0 home win over former club Charlton Athletic , which ended United 's nine @-@ match winless run ( eight draws and a defeat ) in the First Division . He also found the net on Boxing Day in a 2 – 0 win over Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford . The week after Milne played what he felt was his best game in a Manchester United jersey in a 3 – 1 New Year 's victory over rivals Liverpool . However they were unable to maintain their form and finished 11th in the league after winning only three of their last 14 league games . Milne scored his third and final United goal on 25 March 1989 in a 2 – 0 home win over Luton Town , once again in the league . 
 In September 1989 , Ferguson signed left @-@ winger Danny Wallace from Southampton . Wallace was not a particularly successful buy for United , and was soon himself struggling to hold down a place in the first team , but the progression of Lee Sharpe meant that Milne was forced out of the first team picture at Old Trafford in 1989 – 90 , making one substitute appearance in the league . During that season , as United struggled in the league but won the FA Cup , Milne was loaned out to Lou Macari 's West Ham United , where he made the final appearance of his career in a League Cup tie on 24 January 1990 away to Derby County at the age of 28 . His season was ended shortly afterwards after he picked up groin injury that required surgery . Despite being given a new one @-@ year contract he began missing reserve team games during the 1990 – 91 season and instead spent his time drinking . 
 Milne has been described as Ferguson 's and even as Manchester United 's worst signing , despite his low transfer fee . Ferguson defended the signing by pointing out Milne 's contribution to the development of Lee Sharpe , who was playing left @-@ back at the time . Ferguson remarked that Milne helped Sharpe by both dropping back to protect Sharpe and by giving him positional advice . Milne remained on United 's payroll until 30 June 1991 , when he was released . 
 " You know what it ’ s like ? It ’ s like being a kid watching a movie , and it ’ s a sad ending . And you start crying . If it makes a huge impression when United want to sign you , it makes a huge one when they want to get rid of you . Bang , the door ’ s closed . You ’ re finished . "

 Milne had unsuccessful trials with Turkish club <unk> Ankaragücü and Danish side Esbjerg fB in 1991 . Later in the year he travelled to Hong Kong to play for Sing Tao SC . He spent a year there , helping the club to finish fourth in the First Division in 1991 – 92 , before he rejected the offer of a new contract and instead returned to Britain . He had a trial spell at Derry City before quitting football at the age of 32 .

 Milne made his debut for the Scotland under @-@ 21 side on 8 September 1981 at the age of 20 , when he on came as a substitute for Alan Brazil during a 4 – 0 win over Sweden in Edinburgh . He made a further two appearances for the under @-@ 21 side as an <unk> player in the autumn of 1983 , playing against Belgium ( 0 – 0 at Dundee ) and East Germany ( 1 – 1 at Jena , East Germany ) . He was never capped for the senior team , and has been cited as one of the best Scottish footballers not to win a full senior cap .

 Milne was naturally right @-@ footed , though trained hard with his left foot as a boy to become equally skilled with both feet . Former Dundee United teammate Paul Hegarty stated that Milne possessed great pace , as well as bravery , a good work ethic , and an ability to score important goals . Another former Dundee United teammate , Davie Dodds , said that Milne was as good a finisher as any player in Scottish football during the 1980s . 
 Jim McLean , Milne 's manager at Dundee United , summed up Milne 's career and footballing ability when writing his autobiography : 
 " If I had an outstanding failure then it was Ralph Milne . He should have been playing in World Cups . He should have won a bundle of Scotland international honours . It was a tragedy that that boy was not playing for his country all the time . He had tremendous talent – and I failed with him . He did not have the right attitude to the game and I could not instil that into him . "

 He was married to Kim from 1985 to 1988 , and the couple had a son , Bradley . He also had a son , Robert , with new partner Lee in 1990 . The relationship with Lee ended after ten years . In 2005 he began a relationship with Fiona Spence , 19 years his junior , who stayed with Milne for over eight years despite admitting that Milne regularly beat her . 
 = = = Struggle with alcoholism = = = 
 Milne had admitted to problems with alcoholism and gambling addiction during and after his playing career . He was always an enthusiastic drinker throughout his career , but he lost his passion for football after picking up an injury in 1990 and began drinking in a way which began to severely damage his health . After retiring as a player he worked at a pub in Nailsea . He appeared in court in 2010 and 2013 , but was never convicted , for allegedly attacking his partner Fiona Spence whilst highly intoxicated . Milne 's manager at Dundee United , Jim McLean , has since stated that Milne would have had greater success in his career were it not for his problems with alcohol and discipline . Milne died on 6 September 2015 , at the age of 54 , due to complications from liver problems .

Hypokalemia ( a decreased potassium level in the blood ) is usually present during attacks . The condition may be life @-@ threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure , or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias ( irregularities in the heart rate ) . If untreated , it is typically recurrent in nature . 
 The condition has been linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes ( sodium and potassium ) across cell membranes . The main ones are the L @-@ type calcium channel α1 @-@ subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2 @.@ 6 ; it is therefore classified as a <unk> . The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells , under conditions of high thyroxine ( thyroid hormone ) levels , usually with an additional precipitant . 
 Treatment of the hypokalemia , followed by correction of the hyperthyroidism , leads to complete resolution of the attacks . It occurs predominantly in males of Chinese , Japanese , Vietnamese , Filipino , and Korean descent . TPP is one of several conditions that can cause periodic paralysis . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 An attack often begins with muscle pain , cramping , and stiffness . This is followed by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly , usually in late evening or the early hours of the morning . The weakness is usually symmetrical ; the limb muscles closer to the trunk ( proximal ) are predominantly affected , and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms . Muscles of the mouth and throat , eyes , and breathing are usually not affected , but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life @-@ threatening respiratory failure . Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days , even in the absence of treatment . On neurological examination during an attack , flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted ; reflexes are usually diminished , but the sensory system is unaffected . Mental status is not affected . 
 Attacks may be brought on by physical exertion , drinking alcohol , or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt . This may explain why attacks are more common in summer , when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise . Exercise @-@ related attacks tend to occur during a period of rest immediately after exercise ; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack . 
 There may be symptoms of thyroid overactivity , such as weight loss , a fast heart rate , tremor , and perspiration ; but such symptoms occur in only half of all cases . The most common type of hyperthyroidism , Graves ' disease , may additionally cause eye problems ( Graves ' <unk> ) and skin changes of the legs ( <unk> myxedema ) . Thyroid disease may also cause muscle weakness in the form of <unk> myopathy , but this is constant rather than episodic . 
 = = Causes = = 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Genetic mutations in the L @-@ type calcium channel α1 @-@ subunit ( <unk> ) have been described in Southern Chinese with TPP . The mutations are located in a different part of the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis . In TPP , the mutations described are single @-@ nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone , implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels . Furthermore , mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage @-@ gated channel , Shaw @-@ related subfamily , member 4 ( <unk> ) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha ( <unk> ) . 
 Of people with TPP , 33 % from various populations were demonstrated to have mutations in <unk> , the gene coding for <unk> , an inward @-@ rectifier potassium ion channel . This gene , too , harbors a thyroid response element . 
 Certain forms of human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) — especially <unk> , <unk> , DQB1 * 0303 , A2 , <unk> , <unk> , B17 , and <unk> — are more common in TPP . Linkage to particular forms of HLA , which plays a central role in the immune response , might imply an immune system cause , but it is uncertain whether this directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves ' disease , a known autoimmune disease . 
 = = = Thyroid disease = = = 
 The most common underlying form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves ' disease , a syndrome due to an autoimmune reaction that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone . TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as thyroiditis , toxic nodular goiter , toxic adenoma , TSH @-@ producing pituitary adenoma , excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine , and amiodarone @-@ induced hyperthyroidism . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 The muscle weakness and increased risk of irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream . Potassium is not in fact lost from the body , but increased Na + / K + -ATPase activity ( the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood ) leads to shift of potassium into tissues , and depletes the circulation . In other types of potassium derangement , the acid @-@ base balance is usually disturbed , with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present . In TPP , these disturbances are generally absent . Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells , making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles . 
 It is not clear how the described genetic defects increase the Na + / K + -ATPase activity , but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels . Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines ( such as adrenaline ) in the blood , increasing Na + / K + -ATPase activity . The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes . For instance , increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels ; this is known to activate Na + / K + -ATPase . Once the precipitant is removed , the enzyme activity returns to normal levels . It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na + / K + -ATPase activity , and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females . 
 TPP is regarded as a model for related conditions , known as " <unk> " , which have been linked with mutations in ion channels ; the majority of these conditions occurs episodically . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Hypokalemia ( low blood potassium levels ) commonly occurs during attacks ; levels below 3 @.@ 0 mmol / l are typically encountered . Magnesium and phosphate levels are often found to be decreased . Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases , usually due to a degree of muscle injury ; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis ( muscle tissue destruction ) are rare . <unk> ( ECG / EKG ) may show tachycardia ( a fast heart rate ) due to the thyroid disease , abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia ) , and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia ( U waves , QRS widening , QT prolongation , and T wave flattening ) . <unk> shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies ( muscle diseases ) , with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials ( <unk> ) ; they resolve when treatment has commenced . 
 TPP is distinguished from other forms of periodic paralysis ( especially <unk> periodic paralysis ) with thyroid function tests on the blood . These are normal in the other forms , and in <unk> the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated , with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland . Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 In the acute phase of an attack , administration of potassium will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications . However , caution is advised as the total amount of potassium in the body is not decreased , and it is possible for potassium levels to overshoot ( " rebound hyperkalemia " ) ; slow infusions of potassium chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced . 
 The effects of excess thyroid hormone typically respond to the administration of a non @-@ selective beta blocker , such as propranolol ( as most of the symptoms are driven by increased levels of adrenaline and its effect on the β @-@ adrenergic receptors ) . Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants , such as high salt or carbohydrate intake , until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated . 
 Treatment of the thyroid disease usually leads to resolution of the paralytic attacks . Depending on the nature of the disease , the treatment may consist of <unk> ( drugs that reduce production of thyroid hormone ) , radioiodine , or occasionally thyroid surgery . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 TPP occurs predominantly in males of Chinese , Japanese , Vietnamese , Filipino , and Korean descent , as well as Thais , with much lower rates in people of other ethnicities . In Chinese and Japanese people with hyperthyroidism , 1 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 9 % experience TPP . This is in contrast to North America , where studies report a rate of 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 % . Native Americans , who share a genetic background with East Asians , are at an increased risk . 
 The typical age of onset is 20 – 40 . It is unknown why males are predominantly affected , with rates in males being 17- to 70 @-@ fold those in females , despite thyroid overactivity being much more common in women . 
 = = History = = 
 After several case reports in the 18th and 19th centuries , periodic paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal ( 1833 – 1890 ) in 1885 . In 1926 the Japanese physician <unk> <unk> , from Fukuoka , observed the high rate of thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis . The first English @-@ language report , in 1931 , originated from Dunlap and Kepler , physicians at the Mayo Clinic ; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves ' disease . In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia , as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin . This phenomenon has been used as a diagnostic test . 
 In 1974 it was discovered that propranolol could prevent attacks . The concept of <unk> and the link with specific ion channel mutations emerged at the end of the 20th century . 
 = Doom Bar = 
 The Doom Bar ( previously known as Dunbar sands , Dune @-@ bar , and similar names ) is a sandbar at the mouth of the estuary of the River Camel , where it meets the Celtic Sea on the north coast of Cornwall , England . Like two other permanent sandbanks further up the estuary , the Doom Bar is composed mainly of marine sand that is continually being carried up from the seabed . More than 60 percent of the sand is derived from marine shells , making it an important source of agricultural lime , which has been collected for hundreds of years ; an estimated 10 million tons of sand or more has been removed from the estuary since the early nineteenth century , mainly by dredging . 
 The estuary mouth , exposed to the Atlantic Ocean , is a highly dynamic environment , and the sands have been prone to dramatic shifts during storms . According to tradition , the Doom Bar formed in the reign of Henry VIII , damaging the prosperity of the port of Padstow a mile up the estuary . 
 Until the twentieth century , access to Padstow 's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point , a difficult passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north @-@ westerly gales when the cliffs would cut off the wind . Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar , despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind . In the early twentieth century the main channel moved away from the cliffs , and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats , but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997 . 
 A Cornish folklore legend relates that a mermaid created the bar as a dying curse on the harbour after she was shot by a local man . The Doom Bar has been used in poetry to symbolise feelings of melancholy , and it has given its name to the flagship ale from Sharp 's Brewery . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Doom Bar is a sandbar at the mouth of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall . The bar is composed mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes , and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary . This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes , but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood . There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself : most of the river 's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary . 
 There are three persistent sandbars in the Camel estuary : the Doom Bar ; the Town Bar at Padstow , about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) upstream ; and the <unk> Bank just upstream of Padstow , where the estuary changes direction . All three are of similar composition ; a large proportion of their sediment is derived from marine mollusc shells , and as a consequence it includes a high level of calcium carbonate , measured in 1982 at 62 per cent . The high calcium carbonate content of the sand has meant that it has been used for hundreds of years to improve agricultural soil by <unk> . This use is known to date back to before 1600 . High calcium carbonate levels combined with natural sea salt made the sand valuable to farmers as an alkaline fertiliser when mixed with manure . 
 In a report published in 1839 , Henry De la Beche estimated that the sand from the Doom Bar accounted for between a fifth and a quarter of the sand used for agriculture in Devon and Cornwall . He also stated that around 80 men were permanently employed to dredge the area from several barges , removing an estimated 100 @,@ 000 long tons ( 100 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 kg ) of sand per year , which he said he had been " assured by competent persons " had caused a reduction in height of the bar of between 6 and 8 feet ( 180 and 240 cm ) in the 50 years before 1836 . Another report , published about twenty years earlier by Samuel Drew , stated , however , that although the sandbars had been " pillaged " for ages they remained undiminished . An estimated ten million tons of sediment was removed from the estuary between 1836 and 1989 , mostly for agricultural purposes and mostly from the Doom Bar . Sand is still regularly dredged from the area ; in 2009 an estimated 120 @,@ 000 tons of sand were removed from the bar and the surrounding estuary . 
 There is a submerged forest beneath the eastern part of the Doom Bar , off <unk> Bay . It is believed to be part of the wooded plain that existed off the current Cornwall coast before it was overcome by sand dunes and beach sand during the last significant rise in sea @-@ level , which ended around 4 @,@ 000 years ago . Exposed as they are to the Atlantic Ocean , the sands of the area have always been prone to sudden shifts : several houses were said to have been buried one night during a powerful storm . According to tradition one such shift led to the formation of the Doom Bar during the reign of Henry VIII ( 1509 – 1547 ) , causing a decline in the prosperity of Padstow . Today , the sandbank covers approximately 0 @.@ 4 square miles ( 1 @.@ 0 km2 ) , linking the beaches near Harbour Cove by sand flats , although the actual size and shape varies . 
 The name " Doom Bar " is a corruption of the older name Dunbar which itself derives from dune @-@ bar . Although the bar was commonly known as " Dunbar sands " before 1900 , the name " Doom Bar " was used in 1761 ( as " the Doom @-@ bar " ) , and it was also used in poetry , and in House of Commons papers in the nineteenth century . 
 = = Danger to shipping = = 
 For centuries , the Doom Bar was regarded as a significant danger to ships — to be approached with caution to avoid running aground . When sails were the main source of power , ships coming round Stepper Point would lose the wind , causing loss of steerage , leaving them to drift away from the channel . Sometimes , gusts of wind known colloquially as " flaws " blew over Stepper Point and pushed vessels towards the sandbank . Dropping anchor would not help , as it could not gain a firm hold on the sand . Richard Hellyer , the Sub @-@ Commissioner of Pilotage at Padstow , gave evidence in 1859 that the Doom Bar was regarded as so dangerous that in a storm , vessels would risk being wrecked on the coast rather than negotiate the channel to Padstow harbour . 
 In 1761 John Griffin published a letter in the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather , particularly while north @-@ northwest winds were blowing and described the bolts and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour . Mooring rings were still there in 1824 , and around 1830 , three capstans at the base of the cliffs and bollards along the cliffs , by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed . 
 In 1846 , the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an interest in trying to remove the Doom Bar , hoping to increase trade through the harbour at Padstow . The plan was to create a breakwater on the bar , which would stop the build @-@ up of sand , and the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west . 
 In the event , neither the breakwater nor the railway were built , but the issue was re @-@ examined by the 1858 British Parliamentary Select Committee on Harbours for Refuge . The select committee took evidence from many witnesses about harbours all around the country . For Padstow , evidence from Captain Claxton , RN , stated that without the removal of the sand , ships in distress could only use the harbour at high tide . The committee was told by J. D. Bryant , a port commissioner and Receiver of Wreck for Padstow , that in 1848 Padstow Harbour Association had cut down a small piece of Stepper Point , which had given ships about 50 fathoms of extra " fair wind " into the harbour . Bryant recommended further removal of the point which would allow a true wind along the whole channel past the dangerous sandbar . 
 The select committee report concluded the bar would return through re @-@ silting if it were dredged , and there were insufficient resources to prevent it . Several alternatives were discussed , including the construction of two guide walls to sluice water across the bar , thereby removing it . Evidence was given that the bar was made up of " hard sand " which would prove difficult to remove . During the discussions , it was indicated that whilst the sandbank could be removed by a variety of methods , it would not significantly improve access to the harbour , and that a harbour of refuge would be better on the Welsh coast . 
 The committee 's final report determined that along the whole of the rocky coast between Land 's End and Hartland Point , Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north @-@ westerly onshore gales were blowing . It noted that Padstow 's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy @-@ forming effect of Stepper Point . The report recommended initial expenditure of £ 20 @,@ 000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point , which , in conjunction with the capstans , bollards and mooring rings , would significantly reduce the risk to shipping . 
 During the twentieth century the Doom Bar was regularly dredged to improve access to Padstow . By the 1930s , when Commander H.E. Turner surveyed the estuary , there were two channels round the Doom Bar , and it is thought that the main channel may have moved to the east side in 1929 . By 2010 the original channel had disappeared . The estuary is regularly dredged by Padstow Harbour Commission 's dredgers , <unk> and Mannin . 
 = = Shipwrecks = = 
 The Doom Bar has accounted for more than 600 beachings , <unk> and wrecks since records began early in the nineteenth century , the majority of which are wrecks . 
 Larger boats entering Padstow were offered assistance , generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled it would be entering . If a boat was foundering , salvors would step in and help . There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court , so as to extort more money from the owners . This happened to the brig The <unk> , which floundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger . Although it did not need assistance , salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner . 
 In 1827 , the recently founded Life @-@ boat Institution helped fund a permanent lifeboat at Padstow , a 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) rowing boat with four oars . The lifeboat house at Hawker 's Cove was erected two years later by the Padstow Harbour Association for the Preservation of Life and Property from Shipwreck . Reverend Charles Prideaux @-@ Brune of Prideaux Place was the patron . In 1879 , four of his granddaughters and their friend were rowing on the Doom Bar and saw a craft go down . They rowed out to save the drowning sailor . As it was very unusual for women to rescue men all five girls received a Royal National Lifeboat Institution Silver Medal for their bravery . 
 Despite the safer eastern channel and improvements in maritime technology , the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar . In February 1997 , two fishermen who were not wearing lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized . Two anglers had been killed in a similar incident in 1994 . On 25 June 2007 , the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued the crews of two yachts in separate incidents from the area . 
 = = = HMS Whiting = = = 
 The only warship reported wrecked on the Doom Bar was HMS Whiting , a 12 @-@ gun schooner . The Whiting was originally a cargo ship named Arrow , which travelled from the United States to France ; she was captured by the Royal Navy on 8 May 1812 and renamed . On 15 September 1816 , she ran aground on the Doom Bar as the tide was ebbing and the wind was from an unfavourable direction offering little assistance . According to court @-@ martial transcripts , an attempt to move her was made at the next high tide , but she was taking on water and it was impossible to save her . 
 Whiting was abandoned over the next few days and the crew salvaged whatever they could . The officer in charge , Lieutenant John Jackson , lost one year 's seniority for negligence , and three crewmen were given " 50 lashes with nine tails " for desertion . The wreck was sold to salvors and , despite correspondence requesting salvage eleven years later , the navy took no further interest . The Royal Navy attempted to survey the wreck in June 1830 , by which time the sandbank had covered most of it . In May 2010 a marine research and exploration group , <unk> , and the Nautical Archaeology Society , with the help of Padstow Primary School , mounted a search for the ship . The groups searched four sites on the Doom Bar , but have so far been unsuccessful . 
 = = = Antoinette = = = 
 The largest ship wrecked on the Doom Bar is believed to be the Antoinette , an 1874 barque of 1 @,@ 118 tonnes . On New Year 's Day 1895 , she set sail from Newport in South Wales with a cargo of coal for Brazil , but foundered near Lundy Island , losing parts of her mast . She was towed by a steam tug towards Padstow but struck the Doom Bar and the tow rope either broke , or had to be released . Her crew of fourteen and several men who had attempted to salvage her were rescued by lifeboats from Port Isaac and Padstow , following which she rapidly sank . 
 Attempts by three tugs from Cardiff to remove the wreck were unsuccessful , but the next spring tide carried the midsection up the estuary onto Town Bar , opposite Padstow , where it was a hazard to shipping . A miner named Pope was called in to remove it : he used gelignite without success , though the explosion was reported to have broken many windows in the town . In 2010 a wreck , identified as almost certainly the Antoinette , surfaced on Town Bar . The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy ; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws . 
 = = In literature = = 
 According to local folklore , the Doom Bar was created by the Mermaid of Padstow as a dying curse after being shot . In 1906 , Enys <unk> wrote that a Padstow local , Tristram Bird , bought a new gun and wanted to shoot something worthy of it . He went hunting seals at Hawker 's Cove but found a young woman sitting on a rock brushing her hair . <unk> by her beauty , he offered to marry her and when she refused he shot her in retaliation , only realising afterwards that she was a mermaid . As she died she cursed the harbour with a " bar of doom " , from Hawker 's Cove to <unk> Bay . A terrible gale blew up that night and when it finally subsided there was the sandbar , " covered with wrecks of ships and bodies of drowned men " . 
 The ballad , The Mermaid of Padstow , tells a similar story of a local named Tom Yeo , who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal . John Betjeman , who was well @-@ acquainted with the area , wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man and fell in love with him . When she could no longer bear living without him , she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by shooting her . In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow , around which the sandbank grew . In other versions of the tale , the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow , or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow . Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death . 
 The mermaid legend extends beyond the creation of the Doom Bar . In 1939 Samuel Williamson declared there are mermaids comparable to Sirens who lie in the shallow waters and draw in ships to be wrecked . In addition , " the <unk> cry of a woman bewailing her dead " is said to be heard after a storm where lives are lost on the sandbar . 
 Rosamund Watson 's " Ballad of <unk> Town " uses the sandbank for imagery to elicit feelings of melancholy when talking of giving up everything for love . A Victorian poem by Alice E. <unk> , " The Doom @-@ Bar " , relates the story of a girl who gave an engraved ring to the man she loved before he sailed away across the Doom Bar , breaking her heart . Four years later , when the tide was lower than usual , her friends persuaded her to walk out on the sand where she found the ring inside a scallop . Realising he must have tossed it aside on the night he left , she resolved not to remain heart @-@ broken , but to sail out to sea herself . 
 A play , The Doom Bar , about smuggling and wrecking was written in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush . Although there was no interest in London it was well received in America , and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York . A series of mishaps , blamed on the legendary wrecker Cruel Coppinger , culminating in a fire at Baltimore , caused the play to be considered cursed by America 's actors ' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it .

 = Komm , du süße Todesstunde , BWV 161 = 
 Komm , du süße Todesstunde ( Come , o sweet hour of death ) , BWV 161 , is a church cantata composed by Johann Sebastian Bach in Weimar for the 16th Sunday after Trinity . 
 Bach had taken up regular cantata composition two years before when he was promoted to concertmaster at the Weimar court , writing one cantata per month to be performed in the Schlosskirche , the court chapel in the ducal Schloss . The text of Komm , du süße Todesstunde , as of most other cantatas written in Weimar , was provided by court poet Salomon Franck . He based it on the prescribed gospel reading about the Young man from Nain . His text reflects on longing for death , seen as a transition to a life united with Jesus . The text includes as a closing chorale the fourth stanza of the hymn " Herzlich tut mich <unk> " by Christoph Knoll . 
 The cantata comprises six movements , which opens with a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives leading to a chorus and a concluding chorale . The chorale tune , known as " O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden " , appears already in the first movement , played by the organ , and musical motifs of the arias are derived from it , providing an overall formal unity to the composition . Bach scored the work for two vocal parts ( alto and tenor ) , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque chamber ensemble of recorders , strings and continuo . In the alto recitative ( movement 4 ) , accompanied by all instruments , Bach creates the images of sleep , of waking up , and of funeral bells , the latter in the recorders and pizzicato of the strings . 
 While the libretto was published in a collection in 1715 , Bach possibly led the first performance only a year later on 27 September 1716 , due to a period of public mourning . Bach revived the cantata in Leipzig , but not during his cantata cycles when he composed three new works for the 16th Sunday after Trinity . With minor changes , he performed Komm , du süße Todesstunde between 1737 and 1746 . He also assigning it to the occasion of Purification , a feast with a similar topic . 
 = = Background = = 
 Bach established his reputation as an outstanding organist while in his teens . He moved to Weimar in 1708 to take up position as court organist to the co @-@ reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe @-@ Weimar . He had already begun to compose cantatas at his previous posts at Arnstadt and Mühlhausen , and his reasons for moving included disappointment with the standard of singing at the churches where he had worked . He was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle on 2 March 1714 . As concertmaster , he assumed principal responsibility for composing new works . Specifically he was tasked with providing cantatas for the Schlosskirche ( palace church ) on a monthly schedule , and a complete annual cycle within four years . While Bach had composed vocal music only for special occasions until his promotion , the regular chance to compose and perform a new work resulted in a program into which Bach " threw himself wholeheartedly " , as the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff notes . 
 = = = Cantatas in 1716 = = = 
 The cantatas probably first performed in 1716 were written on texts by the Weimar court poet Salomon Franck , published in his collections Evangelisches Andachts @-@ Opffer ( 1715 ) and Evangelische <unk> und <unk> @-@ <unk> ( 1717 ) . Fewer cantatas survived than from the years before , which could be the result of less interest , but also loss of composed works . 
 Bach turned again to prolific writing with the beginning of a new liturgical year with the first Sunday in Advent . He composed works for three consecutive Sundays in Advent , prompted probably by the death of the Kapellmeister Johann Samuel Drese on 1 December 1716 . When Bach 's hope to become Drese 's successor was disappointed he ceased to compose cantatas for the Weimar court . 
 The following table of works performed by Bach as concertmaster in 1716 is based on Wolff and the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr . 
 = = Readings and text = = 
 Bach wrote Komm , du süße Todesstunde for the 16th Sunday after Trinity . The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Ephesians , dedicated to the strengthening of faith in the congregation of Ephesus ( Ephesians 3 : 13 – 21 ) , and from the Gospel of Luke , the raising from the dead of the Young man from Nain ( Luke 7 : 11 – 17 ) . In Bach 's time the story pointed at the resurrection of the dead , expressed in words of desire to die soon . 
 The text for this cantata , as for many others of Bach 's Weimar period , was written by the court poet Salomon Franck , and published in his collection Evangelisches Andachts @-@ Opffer in 1715 . He included as the closing chorale the fourth stanza of the hymn " Herzlich tut mich <unk> " ( 1611 ) by Christoph Knoll . Franck wrote a libretto full of biblical references , such as a phrase in movement one , " feeding on honey from the lion 's mouth " , which is based on Judges 14 : 5 – 9 . Alfred Dürr , an authority on Bach 's cantatas , summarizes that Franck wrote " a deeply felt , personal confession of longing for Jesus " . The Bach scholar Richard D. P. Jones notes that the cantata is " one of the most richly inspired of all Bach 's Weimar cantatas " , and sees the text as a part of the inspiration , with its " mystical longing for union with Christ . 
 = = Performances = = 
 Bach led the first performance , but the date has been debated . Dürr concluded initially ( in the first edition of his book Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach of 1971 ) that the cantata was first performed on 6 October 1715 . However , as this date fell in a period of public mourning in Weimar , the first performance is now generally accepted as the same occasion the following year , 27 September 1716 , by the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff , the publisher Carus @-@ Verlag , and Dürr in the revised and translated edition of 2006 . Richard D. P. Jones notes in his book The Creative Development of Johann Sebastian Bach that " technical novelties " suggest that the cantata was also composed in 1716 , according to a recent study . 
 In his first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig , Bach composed a new cantata for the 16th Sunday after Trinity , Christus , der ist mein Leben , BWV 95 . A year later he wrote a chorale cantata for his second cantata cycle , Liebster Gott , wenn werd ich sterben ? BWV 8 , and for his third cantata cycle there he composed Wer weiß , wie nahe mir mein Ende ? BWV 27 . He revived Komm , du süße Todesstunde in Leipzig , but only later , in a version dated some time between 1737 and 1746 , with minor changes to the scoring . He even performed it for a different liturgical occasion , the feast of the Purification of Mary on 2 February . The prescribed readings for the Purification included Simeon 's canticle Nunc dimittis ( Luke 2 : 22 – 32 ) , which with its line " now <unk> thou thy servant depart in peace " has a similar topic .

 = = = Structure and scoring = = = 
 The cantata is structured in six movements : a series of alternating arias and recitatives leads to a chorus and a concluding chorale . As with several other cantatas on words by Franck , it is scored for a small ensemble : two vocal soloists ( alto ( A ) and tenor ( T ) ) , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque chamber ensemble of two recorders ( Fl ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , organ ( Org ) and basso continuo ( Bc ) . The title page reads simply : " Auf den <unk> Sontag nach <unk> " ( For the sixteenth Sunday after Trinity ) . The duration is given as 19 minutes . 
 A structural element is the anticipation of the closing chorale in the first movement , where the chorale melody is used as a cantus firmus . Bach used this approach to unify a structure also in the cantatas Alles , was von Gott <unk> , BWV <unk> , and Barmherziges Herze der ewigen Liebe , BWV 185 , also composed at Weimar . He later used the juxtaposition of a chorale cantus firmus against vocal music later on a grand scale in his St Matthew Passion , in both the opening chorus and the movement concluding Part I. The use of recorders in Komm , du süße <unk> reminiscent of the early cantata Actus tragicus , Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit , BWV 106 . 
 In the Leipzig performances of the cantata , the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano , instead of an instrumental quotation of the chorale tune in the first aria . The cantata was transposed from C major to E @-@ flat major at Leipzig ) . The recorders were then possibly replaced by transverse flutes . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring and keys are given for the version performed in Weimar in 1714 . The keys and time signatures are taken from Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings , while the continuo , playing throughout , is not shown .

 A Phrygian chorale melody , well @-@ known as the melody of " O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden " , provides the musical theme of the cantata , appearing in movement 1 in both its original form and the alto line derived from it . The themes of the two other arias are taken from the same melody , providing formal unity . The same melody appears five times in chorales of Bach 's St Matthew Passion .

 The opening aria for alto , " Komm , du süße Todesstunde " ( " Come , o sweet hour of death " or " Come , thou sweet hour of parting " ) is accompanied by the recorders . They move in the ritornello in parallel thirds and sixths . The organ serves not only as a bass instrument but supplies the chorale melody . In Weimar , Bach seems to have expected the congregation to know the words of the first stanza of Knoll 's hymn . 
 Jones points out that the cantus firmus of the organ seems " objective " , in contrast to the subjective " display of personal feeling " of the voice and the complexity of the other parts . 
 In a later performance in Leipzig , a soprano sang the stanza with the organ .

 The tenor recitative , " Welt , deine Lust ist Last " ( World , your pleasure is a burden ) , begins as a secco recitative , but ends in an arioso as the words paraphrase a biblical verse from Philippians 1 : 23 , " Ich habe Lust <unk> und bei Christo zu sein " to " Ich habe Lust , bei Christo bald zu <unk> . Ich habe Lust , von dieser Welt zu scheiden " ( I desire to pasture soon with Christ . I desire to depart from this world ) . Dürr notes that the development from secco to arioso is frequent in Bach 's early cantatas , and is here especially motivated to highlight the biblical paraphrase .

 The aria for tenor , " Mein Verlangen ist , den Heiland zu <unk> " ( My longing is , to embrace my Savior ) , is the first movement with the strings , expressing a deep sense of longing . It returns to the hope for union with Jesus of the first movement , expressed in in an agitated way , with <unk> for " longing " and flowing motifs for " embracing " . The middle section is mostly accompanied by the continuo only , but at times interjected by the strings playing the " longing " <unk> .

 The alto recitative , " Der <unk> ist schon <unk> " ( The end has already come ) , is accompanied by all instruments , creating the images of sleep ( in a downward movement , ending in long notes ) , the waking up ( in fast movement upwards ) , and funeral bells in the recorders and pizzicato of the strings . The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes : " In this movement the anticipation of death appears to be fulfilled , and the alto 's declamation , welcoming death and the ringing of the funeral bells , is filled with a pathos amounting almost to obsession . "

 The first choral movement 5 , " Wenn es meines Gottes Wille " ( If it is my God 's will ) , is marked aria by Franck . Bach set it for four parts , using song @-@ like homophony . Wolff compares the style to Thuringian motets of around 1700 . The first part is not repeated da capo , in keeping with the last words " <unk> sei mein <unk> Wort " ( May this be my last word ) . While a textual da capo is impossible , Bach composed a musical da capo , giving the movement a structure of ABB 'A ' . Dürr notes that " Arnold Schering has drawn attention to the increasing rapture " .

 The closing chorale , " Der Leib <unk> in der Erden " ( The body , indeed , in the earth ) , is illuminated by a fifth part of the two recorders playing a lively counterpoint in unison . 
 The " soaring descant " of the recorders has been interpreted as " creating the image of the flesh transfigured " .

 Wolff summarizes : " Cantata 161 is one of the most delicate and jewel @-@ like products of Bach 's years in Weimar . The writing in up to ten parts is extraordinarily subtle . ... The recorders additionally contribute in no small way to the <unk> emotion and positive feelings associated with the ' sweet hour of death ' " . Jones writes : " Bach 's arrival at full maturity by about the middle of his Weimar period ( 1713 – 17 ) is attested by the stylistic and technical assurance , and the consistently high standard , of his writing at that time . " He counts the cantata as one of several that reached a level of mastery unsurpassed in later years , along with the Orgelbüchlein and the cantata Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis , BWV 21 , among others .

 The cantata was edited for the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe , the first complete edition of Bach 's works , by Franz Wüllner . The volume in question was published in 1887 .

 = Pi = 
 The number π is a mathematical constant , the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter , commonly approximated as 3 @.@ 14159 . It has been represented by the Greek letter " π " since the mid @-@ 18th century , though it is also sometimes spelled out as " pi " ( / paɪ / ) . 
 Being an irrational number , π cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction ( equivalently , its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanent repeating pattern ) . Still , fractions such as 22 / 7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to approximate π . The digits appear to be randomly distributed . In particular , the digit sequence of π is conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness , but to date no proof of this has been discovered . Also , π is a transcendental number – a number that is not the root of any non @-@ zero polynomial having rational coefficients . This transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge . 
 Ancient civilizations needed the value of π to be computed accurately for practical reasons . It was calculated to seven digits , using geometrical techniques , in Chinese mathematics and to about five in Indian mathematics in the 5th century AD . The historically first exact formula for π , based on infinite series , was not available until a millennium later , when in the 14th century the Madhava – Leibniz series was discovered in Indian mathematics . In the 20th and 21st centuries , mathematicians and computer scientists discovered new approaches that , when combined with increasing computational power , extended the decimal representation of π to , as of 2015 , over 13 @.@ 3 trillion ( 1013 ) digits . Practically all scientific applications require no more than a few hundred digits of π , and many substantially fewer , so the primary motivation for these computations is the human desire to break records . However , the extensive calculations involved have been used to test supercomputers and high @-@ precision multiplication algorithms . 
 Because its definition relates to the circle , π is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry , especially those concerning circles , ellipses or spheres . Because of its special role as an eigenvalue , π appears in areas of mathematics and the sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles , such as number theory and statistics . It is also found in cosmology , thermodynamics , mechanics and electromagnetism . The ubiquity of π makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community : Several books devoted to it have been published , the number is celebrated on Pi Day and record @-@ setting calculations of the digits of π often result in news headlines . Attempts to memorize the value of π with increasing precision have led to records of over 70 @,@ 000 digits .

 The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter is the lowercase Greek letter π , sometimes spelled out as pi , and derived from the first letter of the Greek word <unk> , meaning circumference . In English , π is pronounced as " pie " ( / paɪ / , paɪ ) . In mathematical use , the lowercase letter π ( or π in sans @-@ serif font ) is distinguished from its capital counterpart Π , which denotes a product of a sequence . 
 The choice of the symbol π is discussed in the section Adoption of the symbol π . 
 = = = Definition = = = 
 π is commonly defined as the ratio of a circle 's circumference C to its diameter d : 
 <formula> 
 The ratio C / d is constant , regardless of the circle 's size . For example , if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle it will also have twice the circumference , preserving the ratio C / d . This definition of π implicitly makes use of flat ( Euclidean ) geometry ; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any curved ( non @-@ Euclidean ) geometry , these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula π 
 = C / d . 
 Here , the circumference of a circle is the arc length around the perimeter of the circle , a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using limits , a concept in calculus . For example , one may compute directly the arc length of the top half of the unit circle given in Cartesian coordinates by x2 + y2 = 
 1 , as the integral : 
 <formula> 
 An integral such as this was adopted as the definition of π by Karl Weierstrass , who defined it directly as an integral in 1841 . 
 Definitions of π such as these that rely on a notion of circumference , and hence implicitly on concepts of the integral calculus , are no longer common in the literature . <unk> ( 1991 ) explains that this is because in many modern treatments of calculus , differential calculus typically precedes integral calculus in the university curriculum , so it is desirable to have a definition of π that does not rely on the latter . One such definition , due to Richard <unk> , and popularized by Edmund Landau , is the following : π is twice the smallest positive number at which the cosine function equals 0 . The cosine can be defined independently of geometry as a power series , or as the solution of a differential equation . 
 In a similar spirit , π can be defined instead using properties of the complex exponential , exp ( z ) , of a complex variable z . Like the cosine , the complex exponential can be defined in one of several ways . The set of complex numbers at which exp ( z ) is equal to one is then an ( imaginary ) arithmetic progression of the form : 
 <formula> 
 and there is a unique positive real number π with this property . A more abstract variation on the same idea , making use of sophisticated mathematical concepts of topology and algebra , is the following theorem : there is a unique continuous isomorphism from the group R / Z of real numbers under addition modulo integers ( the circle group ) onto the multiplicative group of complex numbers of absolute value one . The number π is then defined as half the magnitude of the derivative of this homomorphism . 
 A circle encloses the largest area that can be attained within a given perimeter . Thus the number π is also characterized as the best constant in the isoperimetric inequality ( times one @-@ fourth ) . There are many other , closely related , ways in which π appears as an eigenvalue of some geometrical or physical process ; see below . 
 = = = Irrationality and normality = = = 
 π is an irrational number , meaning that it cannot be written as the ratio of two integers ( fractions such as 22 / 7 are commonly used to approximate π ; no common fraction ( ratio of whole numbers ) can be its exact value ) . Because π is irrational , it has an infinite number of digits in its decimal representation , and it does not settle into an infinitely repeating pattern of digits . There are several proofs that π is irrational ; they generally require calculus and rely on the reductio ad absurdum technique . The degree to which π can be approximated by rational numbers ( called the irrationality measure ) is not precisely known ; estimates have established that the irrationality measure is larger than the measure of e or ln ( 2 ) but smaller than the measure of Liouville numbers . 
 The digits of π have no apparent pattern and have passed tests for statistical randomness , including tests for normality ; a number of infinite length is called normal when all possible sequences of digits ( of any given length ) appear equally often . The conjecture that π is normal has not been proven or disproven . 
 Since the advent of computers , a large number of digits of π have been available on which to perform statistical analysis . Yasumasa Kanada has performed detailed statistical analyses on the decimal digits of π and found them consistent with normality ; for example , the frequency of the ten digits 0 to 9 were subjected to statistical significance tests , and no evidence of a pattern was found . Any random sequence of digits contains arbitrarily long subsequences that appear non @-@ random , by the infinite monkey theorem . Thus , because the sequence of π 's digits passes statistical tests for randomness , it contains some sequences of digits that may appear non @-@ random , such as a sequence of six consecutive 9s that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of π . 
 = = = Transcendence = = = 
 In addition to being irrational , more strongly π is a transcendental number , which means that it is not the solution of any non @-@ constant polynomial with rational coefficients , such as <unk> / 120 − x3 / 6 + x = 0 . 
 The transcendence of π has two important consequences : First , π cannot be expressed using any finite combination of rational numbers and square roots or n @-@ th roots such as 3 √ 31 or √ 10 . Second , since no transcendental number can be constructed with compass and straightedge , it is not possible to " square the circle " . In other words , it is impossible to construct , using compass and straightedge alone , a square whose area is equal to the area of a given circle . Squaring a circle was one of the important geometry problems of the classical antiquity . Amateur mathematicians in modern times have sometimes attempted to square the circle and sometimes claim success despite the fact that it is impossible . 
 = = = Continued fractions = = = 
 Like all irrational numbers , π cannot be represented as a common fraction ( also known as a simple or vulgar fraction ) , by the very definition of " irrational " . But every irrational number , including π , can be represented by an infinite series of nested fractions , called a continued fraction : 
 <formula> 
 <unk> 
 <unk> the continued fraction at any point yields a rational approximation for π ; the first four of these are 3 , 22 / 7 , 333 / 106 , and 355 / 113 . These numbers are among the most well @-@ known and widely used historical approximations of the constant . Each approximation generated in this way is a best rational approximation ; that is , each is closer to π than any other fraction with the same or a smaller denominator . Because π is known to be transcendental , it is by definition not algebraic and so cannot be a quadratic irrational . Therefore , π cannot have a periodic continued fraction . Although the simple continued fraction for π ( shown above ) also does not exhibit any other obvious pattern , mathematicians have discovered several generalized continued fractions that do , such as :

 = = = Complex numbers and Euler 's identity = = = 
 Any complex number , say z , can be expressed using a pair of real numbers . In the polar coordinate system , one number ( radius or r ) is used to represent z 's distance from the origin of the complex plane and the other ( angle or φ ) to represent a counter @-@ clockwise rotation from the positive real line as follows : 
 <formula> 
 where i is the imaginary unit satisfying i2 
 = − 1 . The frequent appearance of π in complex analysis can be related to the behavior of the exponential function of a complex variable , described by Euler 's formula : 
 <formula> 
 where the constant e is the base of the natural logarithm . This formula establishes a correspondence between imaginary powers of e and points on the unit circle centered at the origin of the complex plane . Setting φ = 
 π in Euler 's formula results in Euler 's identity , celebrated by mathematicians because it contains the five most important mathematical constants : 
 <formula> 
 There are n different complex numbers z satisfying zn = 1 , and these are called the " n @-@ th roots of unity " . They are given by this formula : 
 <formula> 
 = = = Spectral characterizations = = = 
 Many of the appearances of π in the formulas of mathematics and the sciences have to do with its close relationship with geometry . However , π also appears in many natural situations having apparently nothing to do with geometry . 
 In many applications it plays a distinguished role as an eigenvalue . For example , an idealized vibrating string can be modelled as the graph of a function f on the unit interval [ 0 @,@ 1 ] , with fixed ends f ( 0 ) 
 = f ( 1 ) = 
 0 . The modes of vibration of the string are solutions of the differential equation f " ( x ) + <unk> f ( x ) 
 = 0 . Here λ is an associated eigenvalue , which is constrained by Sturm – Liouville theory to take on only certain specific values . The value λ = 
 π is one such eigenvalue , as the function f ( x ) 
 = sin ( π x ) satisfies the boundary conditions and the differential equation with λ = 
 π . 
 The value π is in fact the least such eigenvalue , and is associated with the fundamental mode of vibration of the string . One way to obtain this is by estimating the energy . The energy satisfies an inequality , Wirtinger 's inequality for functions , which states that if a function f : [ 0 , 1 ] → <unk> is given such that f ( 0 ) 
 = f ( 1 ) = 
 0 and f and f ' are both square integrable , then the inequality holds : 
 <formula> 
 and the case of equality holds precisely when f is a multiple of sin ( π x ) . So π appears as an optimal constant in Wirtinger 's inequality , and from this it follows that it is the smallest such eigenvalue ( by Rayleigh quotient methods ) . 
 The number π serves a similar role in higher @-@ dimensional analysis , appearing as eigenvalues for other similar kinds of problems . As mentioned above , it can be characterized via its role as the best constant in the isoperimetric inequality : the area A enclosed by a plane Jordan curve of perimeter P satisfies the inequality 
 <formula> 
 and equality is clearly achieved for the circle , since in that case A 
 = πr2 and P = 
 <unk> . 
 Ultimately as a consequence of the isoperimetric inequality , the constant π is associated with best constants of the Poincaré inequality . As a special case , π appears as the optimal smallest eigenvalue of the Dirichlet energy , in dimensions 1 and 2 , which thus characterizes the role of π in many physical phenomena as well , for example those of classical potential theory . The one @-@ dimensional case is just Wirtinger 's inequality . 
 The constant π also appears as a critical spectral parameter in the Fourier transform . This is the integral transform , that takes a complex @-@ valued integrable function f on the real line to the function defined as : 
 <formula> 
 There are several different conventions for the Fourier transform , all of which involve a factor of π that is placed somewhere . The appearance of π is essential in these formulas , as there is there is no possibility to remove π altogether from the Fourier transform and its inverse transform . The definition given above is the most canonical however , because it describes the unique unitary operator on L2 that is also an algebra homomorphism of L1 to L ∞ . 
 The Heisenberg uncertainty principle also contains the number π . The uncertainty principle gives a sharp lower bound on the extent to which it is possible to localize a function both in space and in frequency : with our conventions for the Fourier transform , 
 <formula> 
 The physical consequence , about the uncertainty in simultaneous position and momentum observations of a quantum mechanical system , is discussed below . The appearance of π in the formulae of Fourier analysis is ultimately a consequence of the Stone – von Neumann theorem , asserting the uniqueness of the Schrödinger representation of the Heisenberg group . 
 = = = Gaussian integrals = = = 
 The fields of probability and statistics frequently use the normal distribution as a simple model for complex phenomena ; for example , scientists generally assume that the observational error in most experiments follows a normal distribution . The Gaussian function , which is the probability density function of the normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ , naturally contains π : 
 <formula> 
 For this to be a probability density , the area under the graph of f needs to be equal to one . This follows from a change of variables in the Gaussian integral : 
 <formula> 
 which says that the area under the basic Bell curve in the figure is equal to the square root of π . 
 The central limit theorem explains the central role of normal distributions , and thus of π , in probability and statistics . This theorem is ultimately connected with the spectral characterization of π as the eigenvalue associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , and the fact that equality holds in the uncertainty principle only for the Gaussian function . Equivalently , π is the unique constant making the Gaussian normal distribution e @-@ <unk> equal to its own Fourier transform . Indeed , according to Howe ( 1980 ) , the " whole business " of establishing the fundamental theorems Fourier analysis reduces to the Gaussian integral .
