 Diodorus Cronus , who was one of Zeno 's teachers , is considered the philosopher who first introduced and developed an approach to logic now known as propositional logic . This is an approach to logic based on statements or propositions , rather than terms , making it very different from Aristotle 's term logic . Later , Chrysippus developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system , Stoic Syllogistic , which was considered a rival to Aristotle 's Syllogistic ( see <unk> ) . New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th century , when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic . Susanne <unk> wrote , " The many close similarities between Chrysippus ' philosophical logic and that of Gottlob Frege are especially striking . " 
 <unk> also notes that " Chrysippus wrote over 300 books on logic , on virtually any topic logic today concerns itself with , including speech act theory , sentence analysis , singular and plural expressions , types of predicates , <unk> , existential propositions , <unk> connectives , negations , disjunctions , <unk> , logical consequence , valid argument forms , theory of deduction , propositional logic , modal logic , tense logic , epistemic logic , logic of suppositions , logic of imperatives , ambiguity and logical paradoxes . " 
 = = = Categories = = = 
 The Stoics held that all being ( <unk> ) – though not all things ( <unk> ) – is corporeal . They accepted the distinction between concrete bodies and abstract ones , but rejected Aristotle 's belief that purely incorporeal being exists . Thus , they accepted Anaxagoras ' idea ( as did Aristotle ) that if an object is hot , it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object . But , unlike Aristotle , they extended the idea to cover all accidents . Thus if an object is red , it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object . 
 They held that there were four categories . 
 substance ( <unk> ) 
 The primary matter , formless substance , ( ousia ) that things are made of 
 quality ( <unk> ) 
 The way matter is organized to form an individual object ; in Stoic physics , a physical ingredient ( pneuma : air or breath ) , which informs the matter 
 somehow disposed ( <unk> <unk> ) 
 Particular characteristics , not present within the object , such as size , shape , action , and posture 
 Somehow disposed in relation to something ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) 
 Characteristics related to other phenomena , such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects 
 = = = Epistemology = = = 
 The Stoics propounded that knowledge can be attained through the use of reason . Truth can be distinguished from fallacy — even if , in practice , only an approximation can be made . According to the Stoics , the senses constantly receive sensations : pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the mind , where they leave an impression in the imagination ( <unk> ) ( an impression arising from the mind was called a <unk> ) . 
 The mind has the ability to judge ( <unk> , <unk> ) — approve or reject — an impression , enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false . Some impressions can be assented to immediately , but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval , which can be labeled belief or opinion ( <unk> ) . It is only through reason that we achieve clear comprehension and conviction ( <unk> ) . Certain and true knowledge ( <unk> ) , achievable by the Stoic sage , can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one 's peers and the collective judgment of humankind . 
 = = Physics and cosmology = = 
 According to the Stoics , the universe is a material , reasoning substance , known as God or Nature , which the Stoics divided into two classes , the active and the passive . The passive substance is matter , which " lies sluggish , a substance ready for any use , but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion . " The active substance , which can be called Fate , or Universal Reason ( Logos ) , is an intelligent aether or primordial fire , which acts on the passive matter : 
 The universe itself is god and the universal outpouring of its soul ; it is this same world 's guiding principle , operating in mind and reason , together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence ; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future ; then fire and the principle of aether ; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition , such as water , earth , and air ; then the sun , the moon , the stars ; and the universal existence in which all things are contained . 
 Everything is subject to the laws of Fate , for the Universe acts according to its own nature , and the nature of the passive matter it governs . The souls of people and animals are emanations from this primordial fire , and are , likewise , subject to Fate : 
 Constantly regard the universe as one living being , having one substance and one soul ; and observe how all things have reference to one perception , the perception of this one living being ; and how all things act with one movement ; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist ; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the structure of the web . 
 Individual souls are perishable by nature , and can be " transmuted and diffused , assuming a fiery nature by being received into the Seminal Reason ( logos <unk> ) of the Universe . " Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe , it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason , that is , to live a life according to Nature . 
 = = Ethics and virtues = = 
 The ancient Stoics are often misunderstood because the terms they used pertained to different concepts in the past than they do today . The word " stoic " has come to mean " unemotional " or indifferent to pain , because Stoic ethics taught freedom from " passion " by following " reason " . The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions ; rather , they sought to transform them by a resolute " <unk> " that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm . Logic , reflection , and concentration were the methods of such self @-@ discipline . 
 Borrowing from the Cynics , the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself ; in wisdom and self @-@ control . Stoic ethics stressed the rule : " Follow where reason leads . " One must therefore strive to be free of the passions , bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of " passion " was " anguish " or " suffering " , that is , " passively " reacting to external events , which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word . A distinction was made between pathos ( plural <unk> ) which is normally translated as passion , <unk> or instinctive reaction ( e.g. , turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger ) and <unk> , which is the mark of the Stoic sage ( <unk> ) . The <unk> are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way as passions result from incorrect judgment . 
 The idea was to be free of suffering through <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) or peace of mind ( literally , " without passion " ) , where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense — being objective or having " clear judgment " and the maintenance of equanimity in the face of life 's highs and lows . 
 For the Stoics , reason meant not only using logic , but also understanding the processes of nature — the logos , or universal reason , inherent in all things . Living according to reason and virtue , they held , is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe , in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people . 
 The four cardinal virtues of the Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of Plato : 
 wisdom ( Sophia ) 
 courage ( <unk> ) 
 justice ( <unk> ) 
 temperance ( <unk> ) . 
 Following Socrates , the Stoics held that unhappiness and evil are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature . If someone is unkind , it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason , which leads to the conclusion of kindness . The solution to evil and unhappiness then , is the practice of Stoic philosophy : to examine one 's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature . 
 The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life . Plutarch held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised Cato 's self @-@ consistency ( <unk> ) as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices . Suicide could be justified if one fell victim to severe pain or disease , but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one 's social duty . 
 = = = The doctrine of " things indifferent " = = = 
 In philosophical terms , things that are indifferent are outside the application of moral law , that is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends . Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law , or that do not affect morality , are called morally indifferent . The doctrine of things indifferent ( <unk> , adiaphora ) arose in the Stoic school as a corollary of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ( <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , respectively " convenient actions , " or actions in accordance with nature , and mistakes ) . As a result of this dichotomy , a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent . 
 Eventually three sub @-@ classes of " things indifferent " developed : things to prefer because they assist life according to nature ; things to avoid because they hinder it ; and things indifferent in the narrower sense . The principle of adiaphora was also common to the Cynics and Sceptics . The doctrine of things indifferent was revived during the Renaissance by Philipp Melanchthon . 
 = = = Spiritual exercise = = = 
 Philosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims , it is a way of life involving constant practice and training ( or <unk> , see asceticism ) . Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included logic , Socratic dialogue and self @-@ dialogue , contemplation of death , training attention to remain in the present moment ( similar to some forms of Eastern meditation ) , and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions . Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self @-@ reminder . 
 In his Meditations , Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices . For example , in Book <unk> : 
 Say to yourself in the early morning : I shall meet today ungrateful , violent , treacherous , envious , uncharitable men . All of the ignorance of real good and ill ... I can neither be harmed by any of them , for no man will involve me in wrong , nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him ; for we have come into the world to work together ... 
 Prior to Aurelius , Epictetus in his Discourses , distinguished between three types of act : judgment , desire , and inclination . According to French philosopher Pierre <unk> , Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic , physics , and ethics respectively . <unk> writes that in the Meditations , " Each maxim develops either one of these very characteristic topoi [ i.e. , acts ] , or two of them or three of them . " 
 The practices of spiritual exercises have been described as influencing those of reflective practice by Seamus Mac <unk> . Parallels between Stoic spiritual exercises and modern cognitive @-@ behavioral therapy have been detailed at length in Robertson 's The Philosophy of Cognitive @-@ Behavioral Therapy . 
 = = Social philosophy = = 
 A distinctive feature of Stoicism is its cosmopolitanism : All people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should , according to the Stoics , live in brotherly love and readily help one another . In the Discourses , Epictetus comments on man 's relationship with the world : " Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth ; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men , whereof the city political is only a copy . " This sentiment echoes that of Diogenes of Sinope , who said " I am not an Athenian or a Corinthian , but a citizen of the world . " 
 They held that external differences such as rank and wealth are of no importance in social relationships . Instead they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings . Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco @-@ Roman world , and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities , such as Cato the Younger and Epictetus . 
 In particular , they were noted for their urging of clemency toward slaves . Seneca exhorted , " Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock , is smiled upon by the same skies , and on equal terms with yourself breathes , lives , and dies . " 
 = = Christianity = = 
 The major difference between the two philosophies ( social and spiritual ) is Stoicism 's pantheism , in which God is never fully transcendent but always immanent . God as the world @-@ creating entity is personalized in Christian thought , but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe , which was deeply contrary to Christianity . The only incarnation in Stoicism is that each person has part of the logos within . Stoicism , unlike Christianity , does not posit a beginning or end to the universe . 
 Stoicism was later regarded by the Fathers of the Church as a " pagan philosophy " ; nonetheless , some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism were employed by the early Christian writers . Examples include the terms " logos " , " virtue " , " Spirit " , and " conscience " . But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology . Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world , a belief in human kinship with Nature or God , a sense of the innate depravity — or " persistent evil " — of humankind , and the futility and <unk> of worldly possessions and attachments . Both encourage <unk> with respect to the passions and inferior emotions such as lust , and envy , so that the higher possibilities of one 's humanity can be awakened and developed . 
 Stoic writings such as the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius have been highly regarded by many Christians throughout the centuries . The Stoic ideal of dispassion is accepted to this day as the perfect moral state by the Eastern Orthodox Church . Saint Ambrose of Milan was known for applying Stoic philosophy to his theology . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 The apostle Paul met with Stoics during his stay in Athens , reported in Acts 17 : 16 @-@ 18 . In his letters , Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy , using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new Gentile converts in their understanding of the revealed word of God . 
 Stoic influence can also be seen in the works of St. Ambrose , Marcus Minucius Felix , and Tertullian . 
 Admiral James Stockdale , who was shot down over North Vietnam , held as a prisoner and repeatedly tortured was deeply influenced by Epictetus after being introduced to his works while at Stanford University . As he parachuted down from his plane , he reportedly said to himself " I 'm leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus ! " 
 = = Modern usage = = 
 The word " stoic " commonly refers to someone indifferent to pain , pleasure , grief , or joy . The modern usage as " person who represses feelings or endures patiently " was first cited in 1579 as a noun , and 1596 as an adjective . In contrast to the term " Epicurean " , the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 's entry on Stoicism notes , " the sense of the English adjective ' stoical ' is not utterly misleading with regard to its philosophical origins .

 = Kikuuiki = 
 Kikuuiki ( English : Mixing Airspace ; stylized as <unk> , Japanese pronunciation : [ <unk> : iki ] ) is the fourth studio album by Japanese band Sakanaction . It was released on March 17 , 2010 , through Victor Entertainment . In January , the album was preceded by the single " Aruku Around " , which was met with the greatest commercial success for the band since their debut , reaching number three on Oricon 's singles chart . The album was nominated as one of the finalists for the CD Shop Awards , and was lauded by critics for its cohesive sound and literary lyrics . At the time of release , it was their most commercially successful release since their debut , reaching number three in Japan . 
 Sakanaction spent most of 2009 experimenting on the album 's single " Aruku Around " , followed by two months of recording in January and February 2010 . Most of the final recording stages were spent on the song " Me ga Aku Aiiro " , a seven @-@ minute rock opera used as a promotional single during its release . The album saw a new recording approach for the band , where the members worked more spontaneously and synchronized . The album was influenced by the commercial success of " Aruku Around " , and was written as a response to the song . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 After recording two studio albums in Sapporo , the band moved to Tokyo in spring 2009 to further their musical potential . Their first album produced in Tokyo , Shin @-@ shiro ( 2009 ) , saw a new approach for the band , where vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi asked the other members of Sakanaction to arrange songs individually , instead of together . Led by the singles " Sen to Rei " and " Native Dancer " , the album became their most commercially successful in their career , peaking at number eight on Oricon 's album chart . Despite this , Yamaguchi was disappointed with the sales , and was not sure why the album stalled at 30 @,@ 000 copies sold . 
 After the release of the album in January 2009 , Sakanaction performed a two @-@ month tour of Japan , Sakanaquarium 2009 : Shinshiro . This was followed by appearances at many summer music festivals , including Sweet Love Shower , Nano @-@ Mugen Fes , Rock in Japan and Rising Sun Rock Festival . On June 13 , 2009 , Sakanaction performed at Version 21 @.@ 1 , a newly created rock event by Sakanaction and the rock bands Ogre You Asshole and the Telephones to showcase rock music of the 2010s . On October 10 , Sakanaction performed their first overseas concert , the <unk> X <unk> Sound Festival in Paju , South Korea . 
 Yamaguchi had started collecting ideas for Kikuuiki in February 2009 , less than a month after the release of Shin @-@ shiro . The band spent most of 2009 experimenting on the song " Aruku Around " , and performed the song at their summer festival appearances at Rock in Japan and Rising Sun Rock Festival , to see how the audience would react to the song 's different approach . After " Aruku Around " was released as a single in January 2010 , it became a commercial and critical success . It reached number three on Oricon 's single charts , and was praised for its strong arrangement and Yamaguchi 's poetic lyrics . The single 's success surprised the band , who never considered it could become as popular as it did . 
 = = Writing and production = = 
 The album was primarily recorded at Freedom Studio in Shinjuku , Tokyo , with secondary recording sessions held at Sound Arts , <unk> Creative Studio and <unk> Studio , all in Tokyo , as well as Studio Wakefield in Tama @-@ ku , Kawasaki . Recording sessions for " Aruku Around " were held in 2009 , while the bulk of the album was recorded in January and February 2010 . The recording sessions finished on February 16 , a month before the album 's release date . The writing process took longer than expected and the band had to postpone the album four times from their intended finishing date , mostly due to the complexities of recording the seven minute long song " Me ga Aku Aiiro " . 
 The Kikuuiki album sessions were influenced by the commercial success of " Aruku Around " , where the band considered what sorts of songs they wanted to make , and what sort of music they should present to their new audience for the audience to understand what songs Sakanaction create other than " Aruku Around " -style ones . The band did not want to make an album full of songs identical to " Aruku Around " , and instead wanted to express to their listeners the breadth of musical inspirations that they could mix together . Yamaguchi felt that it was important to not release a second similar song immediately after " Aruku Around " , as he saw that music consumers in the 2010s were acting as critics on their own <unk> or Twitter accounts . For these people , he believed it was important to exhibit different aspects of the band . He felt this was important for growing Sakanaction as a band , to break the cycle of a musical act becoming popular , then continuing to release the same style of music that made them popular until people grew tired of them . Even before the single 's success , the band planned to feature songs on the album that would go against listeners expectations of what Sakanaction was as a band . On the other hand , the band attempted to keep a commercial sound , the same goal of Shin @-@ shiro , or else they felt that their efforts would have been wasted . This led the band trying to create pop art music , blending art with commercialism . 
 The creation process for Kikuuiki was different to that of Shin @-@ shiro , where each member worked alongside Yamaguchi in a two @-@ person meeting , and later working on the songs together as a band . For Kikuuiki , Yamaguchi recorded each song 's demo , then in a meeting the band would discuss the song 's feel and emotions , listing everything on a white board . Yamaguchi would then leave the other four band members to work on the song together , while he worked on their next song . Afterwards , he would return to the studio and make suggestions on their progress on the first song . This meant that Yamaguchi had less input on Kikuuiki than on the band 's previous albums , which made him feel more like the band 's producer . The lessened input made Yamaguchi feel that he had come to trust each member 's musical abilities much more than before . On previous albums , the members needed to compromise or give up on ideas that they had , however on Kikuuiki they found that they understood each other much better . This led to the members expressing themselves more , such as drummer Keiichi Ejima , who showcased his taste in rock music strongly in the sound he created for the album . Many songs were still being created when they were recording , unlike previous albums where songs were entirely finished before recording the final take . This meant that many spontaneous ideas were included on the album . An example of this was the band wanted to add a chorus , they collected together all the people who happened to be in the studio at the time , including their musical director . The spontaneous process led to the song " Klee " , written about the paintings of Swiss @-@ German painter Paul Klee , to be recorded in a single take . Similarly , the song " <unk> to Boku " was inspired by the atmosphere of Yamaguchi 's room as the album was being created . Instead of featuring repeating sounds on the album , Sakanaction decided to carefully consider how each sound @-@ effect effected the song , and included very few repeating sounds . 
 The album 's title Kikuuiki ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a word coined by Yamaguchi . It is related to the term <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , a term describing the brackish water around river heads , where fresh water and salt water mix together . Yamaguchi replaced the character referring to water with the character referring to sky , applying the concept to mixing air instead . This phrase is used to represent the album 's theme : mixing the <unk> . This idea related to how each member had completely different music tastes , but somehow were able to create music together . Similarly , it related to the idea of how Sakanaction as a band mixed rock , club and folk music , but were able to blend different tastes to find an equilibrium that a wide range of people would like . The band created the song " Me ga Aku Aiiro " as a song that would represent the album 's theme in a single song . The album 's introduction , a mix of recordings taken by Yamaguchi on his iPhone at the recording studio , was similarly created to match this theme . 
 The album was influenced by the changing mediums people listen to music in the 2000s and 2010s : how people used their cellphones or YouTube to discover new music . Yamaguchi wanted to create songs that were difficult to evaluate by listening to just a sample of the song . The seven minute long " Me ga Aku Aiiro " in particular was written with such music consumers in mind . The band also felt influenced by the city of Tokyo , after living in the city for a year and a half and deciding to call it their permanent home . Retrospectively , Yamaguchi saw Shin @-@ shiro as depicting the band as they had arrived in Tokyo , while Kikuuiki showed the versions of themselves that they had discovered by living in Tokyo . 
 After recording Shin @-@ shiro , the band had many opportunities to meet other bands that performed similar music to them , because they were now based in Tokyo . In particular , Yamaguchi felt influenced by Yūsuke Koide of Base Ball Bear , impressed that Koide 's lyrics managed to express himself as himself , despite their fictional nature . Yamaguchi wrote his first fiction song because of this , " Omotesandō Nijūroku @-@ ji " , as a challenge for himself , and to match the mixing theme of Kikuuiki . Yamaguchi took further inspiration from the Shōwa period in Japan during its asset price bubble when writing " Omotesandō Nijūroku @-@ ji " . The song " Ushio " was one of the first compositions written for the album . Yamaguchi decided to place it as the first song on the album , as he felt it was similar to the material found on Shin @-@ shiro , as a way to show off what sort of band Sakanaction were up until the release of " Aruku Around " . The song mixed a heavy lyrical theme of whether personal philosophies arise from a person 's community or from within themselves , with a psychedelic , avant garde pop sound . 
 Yamaguchi found the Kikuuiki recording sessions exhausting , as if he had used all of his energy in the writing process . In an interview with Rockin ' On Japan in 2011 , Yamaguchi felt that the people who became fans during this period became <unk> 's core fanbase . Because of this , many of Sakanaction 's concert set @-@ lists continue to feature songs from Kikuuiki for these people .

 The album 's artwork was created by <unk> and Daisuke Ishizaka of <unk> . It features two overlapping circles colored deep blue and bright blue , in order to create <unk> ( <unk> ) , a color close to indigo . The bright blue was chosen as it was a synthetic ink that regularly occurs in Japanese printing , while the deep blue was taken naturally , isolating a color taken from a photo of the sky just before dawn . The center of the artwork features the Kikuuiki typography , as well as a logo of two overlapping circles . The mix of natural and artificial blue circles was used to represent Kikuuiki 's theme of mixing points .

 Kikuuiki 's release was announced in mid @-@ January 2010 , after the release of the single " Aruku Around " . On March 10 , the song " Me ga Aku Aiiro " was released as a digital download to cellphones in Japan , as well as ringtones of all of the tracks on the standard edition of the album . The song was the lead promotional track on the album , and received enough radio airplay to reach number 92 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart . 
 To promote the album , the band made the album 's songs available for listening on their website between February 24 and 28 . The songs were only available from 4 : 00 @-@ 5 : 30am Japan Standard Time , during what they dubbed <unk> time . Each listener could randomly listen four or five songs . The whole album was made available for listening on March 1 . The band held a listening party at Liquid Loft in Shibuya , Tokyo on March 13 , which was simulcast on the video streaming website Ustream . The album was released in two editions – limited and standard . The limited edition features a bonus track , " Paradise of Sunny " , which is a dub remix of the song " Yes No " , remixed by recording engineer <unk> " Sunny " Sasaki . 
 The band performed a thirteen @-@ date national tour of Japan in April and May , dubbed the Sakanaquarium 2010 Kikuuiki . The final two dates were held at the 2 @,@ 000 capacity Zepp Sapporo concert hall on May 8 , followed by the 2 @,@ 400 capacity Shinkiba Studio Coast in Koto , Tokyo . Footage of seven songs performed at Shinkiba Studio Coast on May 15 were made available as iTunes downloads in August 2010 . The band followed up this tour with their first concert at the Nippon Budokan stadium . The Shinkiba Studio Coast and Nippon Budokan concerts were released on DVD in 2011 . The album was re @-@ released on March 25 , 2015 , as a lossless digital download . This was followed by an LP record edition on August 5 , 2015 , to coincide with the release of the band 's compilation album <unk> Tsuki wa Atarashii Tsuki : Coupling & Remix Works .

 The album was well received by Japanese music critics , and was chosen as one of the eleven finalists for the 2011 CD Shop Awards . <unk> <unk> of Skream ! named the album his third favorite of 2011 , feeling that the album had simultaneously created new genres of alternative rock and pop music . He felt the album 's music was catchy , and that its success was expected due to its high quality . Entertainment Media Kulture called Kikuuiki the album that established Sakanaction 's current style . Yuji Tanaka of CDJournal felt the album was more cohesive than their previous works , praising the band 's skill progression and Yamaguchi 's lyrics , which he described as " literary @-@ style " and " cynical " . He was struck by the " heroic march " after the album 's introduction in the song " Ushio " , which made him feel " suddenly intoxicated ... like being in the ocean " . Takayuki <unk> of Skream ! similarly believed the album showed growth in the band . Although their previous releases incorporated dance and rock music , <unk> felt that the music on Kikuuiki had struck a better harmony between the two , and had simultaneously become more rock and dance – oriented . He praised the album 's " poppy floating feeling , highly literary lyrics , and romantic electro sound " , feeling that the band was unique in the music industry . 
 Koji Dejima of Bounce felt that the album was ingenious in the way that it created a feeling of being out of place due to the its arrangements , melodies and lyrics . He praised the album 's varied sound , and the fact that the band always " spoke with their own words " despite this variety of sound . He noted " Aruku Around " ' s strong dance music sound , and likened " Klee " to the songs of The Police , and " Omotesandō Nijūroku @-@ ji " to the music of the 1970s American band Television . Rolling Stone Japan gave the album four stars out of five , praising the Yamaguchi 's " literary and original " lyrics , and how human the music sounded despite its electronic sound . Kaori Komatsu of Rockin ' On Japan felt that Yamaguchi 's lyrics created an " interesting feeling of unease " and had a " deep flavor " . She noted that Yamaguchi 's lyrics often described everyday life and his mental space , layered on top of each other in impressionist scenes . She felt that the band 's sound had become more ambitious in their genre crossovers , especially the inclusions of ambient music and dub elements , and that the songs had a " sense of city " , much stronger since they had moved to Tokyo . Tanaka of CDJournal noted similar qualities in the songs " Yes No " and " Ashita kara " , which to him expressed the loneliness of city life . 
 The album 's lead single " Aruku Around " was well received by music critics . CDJournal reviewers gave the single its star of recommendation , calling it a " killer tune " where the " pleasure of living in the moment " and " prudence " is balanced . They noted the song 's retro sound , like nostalgic dance music , and felt that the band 's decision to move to Tokyo two years ago was reflected in the song . Kenji Sasaki of Skream ! felt that the song had a " gentle electronica feel " , praising the 1980s @-@ style synths , aggressive sound and " unique poetic sentiment " of Yamaguchi 's . He also praised the emotions the song gave him , mixing pain and exhilaration . Tomoki Takahashi of Rockin ' On Japan felt the greatest strength of the song was how its lyrical content jarred with its " high @-@ spirited words " and " explosive hybrid beat " . He noted that instead of talking about the pleasures of the dance floor , Yamaguchi 's lyrics were introspective , discussing loneliness , pain and longing . Takahashi praised the brave fanfare @-@ like synth based leading melody , and the " tight " and " earth @-@ shaking " four on the floor beat .

 On 15 September 2009 , the BBC announced plans to broadcast the first ever live episode of EastEnders , to celebrate the show 's 25th anniversary . The air date was set for 19 February 2010 , with the episode to be broadcast from the BBC 's Elstree Studios in Borehamwood . EastEnders ' executive producer Diederick Santer initially refrained from discussing the episode 's plot , but commented that it would resolve a " big storyline " which would " keep the audience ( as well as the cast and crew ) guessing until the very last moment . " EastEnders storylines saw Archie Mitchell , landlord of The Queen Victoria public house murdered on Christmas Day 2009 , with many characters considered potential suspects in the crime . Santer confirmed that the killer would be revealed in the live episode , and that their identity would be kept secret until the night of broadcast , even from the cast member playing them . Another aspect of the episode is the remarriage of characters Bianca Jackson ( Patsy Palmer ) and Ricky Butcher ( Sid Owen ) . Santer deemed it the " soap wedding of the year — and perhaps the soap wedding of the decade " , commenting that playing the romance against the " thriller " of the " whodunnit " storyline provided a balance he hoped audiences would be " gripped by and satisfied with . "

 In November 2009 , actor Charlie Clements , announced that he would be leaving the soap in 2010 . It was rumoured that Bradley would be seen to commit suicide during the live episode , but this was refuted by an EastEnders spokesperson . It was later revealed that Bradley would make his last appearance in the live episode , urged to flee Walford by his father Max and uncle Jack ( Scott Maslen ) after becoming the prime suspect in the investigation into Archie 's murder . Bradley 's motive for murder came from the discovery that Archie raped his partner Stacey . In an interview with daytime television show This Morning , Clements stated it was possible that Bradley was responsible , but was unsure whether he " [ had ] it in him " , though felt that it would be " quite historical to go down as the one who killed Archie Mitchell " . In the event , Bradley exited the soap by falling to his death from the roof of The Queen Victoria public house during the live episode . Immediately after filming , Clements stated that he was " drained " , referring to his character 's death as " a big way to go out . " 
 In total , 51 EastEnders cast members were involved in the live broadcast . Several cast members expressed trepidation at the prospect of the live episode . Before details of the episode 's plot were confirmed , Turner hoped that she would not be involved in it , deeming herself " awful " at performing live , unable to even deliver speeches . Neil McDermott feared that he would lose his composure and laugh during the broadcast , while Palmer hoped that the episode would not turn into a pantomime , commenting : " I hope we 're a bit more professional than that . " Simons stated that she was looking forward to the challenge the episode presented , though she would be happier once she had seen the script . Clements denied any apprehension , likening the performance to acting in theatre , and Nina Wadia stated that she was " really looking forward to it " , enjoying experiences with an " adrenaline rush . " Once the script was released , Wadia was " disappointed yet relieved " to learn she did not have a speaking role , explaining : " You want to be in it , but not to mess it up . " She expected to feel " uncomfortable " during the broadcast , as the episode is set the day before her character Zainab Masood gives birth , necessitating the wearing of a body suit with a large " baby bump " sewn in .

 The EastEnders cast and crew had two weeks to rehearse the episode prior to its live transmission . The script was issued on the afternoon of 5 February 2010 , written by series consultant and lead show writer Simon Ashdown . The first read @-@ through took place on 8 February 2010 , though producers held back the part of the script revealing Archie 's true killer . Eight different possible endings were rehearsed , with Santer reiterating that the actor playing the killer would only be told so on the night of broadcast . He revealed that the actor playing the killer would be informed of their actions at 7 : 30 pm on 19 February , 30 minutes before the episode 's transmission , with their reaction filmed for the documentary EastEnders Live : The Aftermath , which aired on BBC Three immediately after " EastEnders Live " was broadcast , narrated by Lamb 's son George . 
 Santer explained that the killer " may be revealed to the audience rather than the Square " , preserving secrecy as the crew began filming episodes to be transmitted after the live broadcast . Actress Charlie Brooks , who plays Archie 's former lover Janine Butcher , found the secrecy difficult to work with , explaining : " In the episodes to be shown afterwards , you ’ re being told to look or speak a certain way , but not why . " Santer confirmed that the cast found the episode challenging , stating : " They are as desperate to know who did it as the viewers " , though believed they were all capable of coping with the pressure of the live episode . He explained that the cast typically film scenes in one take anyway , and observed that several EastEnders actors had formerly appeared in live broadcasts for other series . Cast members had just two dress rehearsals in advance of the live episode , and only one read @-@ through of the entire episode . 
 = = = Directing = = = 
 Arnold was initially sceptical when approached about directing " EastEnders Live " , but agreed once it was explained that the impetus for the episode was motivated by the " whodunnit " storyline . He explained : " We pre @-@ record TV drama for lots of very good reasons and doing a live episode can sometimes come across a little gimmicky , so for me , story is the one and only reason a drama should go live . " Direction of the episode differed from typical episodes of EastEnders , whereby actors briefly run through their lines , block the scene to be filmed , then begin shooting with the director on the studio floor . For " EastEnders Live " , cast and crew had two weeks to work on the episode , rehearsing , blocking scenes and discussing the characters ' journeys at length . 
 Once technical rehearsals began and cameras were added in , Ashdown moved from the studio floor to an outside broadcast truck . All cameras on set were cabled to the truck , allowing Ashdown to oversee the entire episode remotely . Ashdown approached the episode as though it were a theatrical performance , explaining : " We can work on performance and blocking early on , discussing issues and discovering the text as we go . Actors know to save their energy when technical rehearsals are taking place and then it 's quite magical when all elements are combined close to the first performance . Of course , our theatre company will have it 's [ sic ] opening and closing night on Friday , February 19 ! " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 In case of any serious problems during transmission , a rehearsal for the episode was filmed , including each version of the reveal scene . Santer explained that the tape would not be used for minor problems such as cast members forgetting their lines , in which instance : " we 'll power on using our improvisational skills . It 's really just for technical backup in case of a proper crisis . " The live broadcast took 400 camera shots to film , and 36 camera operators . Typical episodes of EastEnders utilise just four camera operators . Two outside broadcast trucks were hired to remotely direct and monitor the episode from , and three golf buggies were used to transport cast between sets , as the minimum length of time actors had to move from one set to another was just 131 seconds . 
 Ashdown explained that filming " EastEnders Live " to look like a typical episode of EastEnders was difficult , giving the example of a scene involving a ringing mobile phone . In a usual EastEnders episode , the viewer would see a shot of the phone and know who was calling . In the live episode , the caller would have to be visually or audibly obvious , as a result of the camera set @-@ up and inability to edit scenes . He described the episode 's biggest limitation as the weather , explaining that " EastEnders Live " begins with a direct pickup from the previous episode of EastEnders , with the same characters in the same outside location , leaving the crew hoping for a dry night . Sound was also a problem , as sound quality is better using boom rods than radio microphones , but booms often dip into shot during the filming of EastEnders . Ashdown commented that the production crew would be using booms where possible , but that all cast members with dialogue would be given a radio microphone as backup .

 On the day of broadcast , The Mirror reported that EastEnders producers may have to re @-@ write the episode or run a pre @-@ recorded rehearsal tape rather than go ahead with the live transmission , as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak . In the event , Turner recovered enough to appear , though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary . She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned , however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live : The Aftermath following the episode . Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode , as the cast had worked so hard on it , and it was " such a big part of TV history " . Several errors were made during the transmission . Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine " June " and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines . During the final scene , a camera was visibly jostled , sound became muffled and some zoom shots " misfired " . Following Bradley 's fall , Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him <unk> . The script called for Wood to be sick , though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth , and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway , " to get it all out " . During a scene in which Roxy and Ronnie argued in the Minute Mart , Womack took a bottle of paint stripper from the shelves , but forgot to stop at the counter to pay for it before exiting . 
 Santer , who stood down as executive producer after the episode 's transmission , succeeded by Bryan Kirkwood , commented that he was happy , relieved and proud with the broadcast . Santer stated : " I just think everyone did brilliantly tonight — the cast , the crew , everyone . It 's everything I wished for and more . I 'm thrilled with how it went . It was quite remarkable . Everything went to plan . I spotted a couple of little wobbles but what I was proudest of was the recovery . The technical crew , the cast — every time we maybe veered slightly off course , they pulled it back round . " Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie 's killer , and was never tempted to air a different conclusion , despite at least ten characters having strong motives . Turner was surprised to learn that Stacey was the killer , and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character , observing : " She not only has to deal with the guilt of what she did but she also knows that she 's inadvertently responsible for Bradley 's death . I think that 's going to hurt her more than anything . "

 In the weeks preceding the transmission of " EastEnders Live " , the episode prompted a series of retrospective articles in the British print media , examining EastEnders ' development over its 25 years of broadcast . Critical commentary was mixed . The Guardian 's Dan Sabbagh observed that the storylines which will culminate in " EastEnders Live " — Ricky and Bianca 's remarriage and the Archie Mitchell " whodunnit " — have seen the show undergo a revival , overtaking rival soap opera Coronation Street in the ratings for the first time in over three years . Tim Teeman of The Times highlighted the Archie storyline as representative of male characters in EastEnders offering an " essential foil " to their female counterparts , who he appraised as being " key " to the show 's success , using the example of Archie 's relationship with his wife Peggy and daughter Ronnie . He felt that the episode deserved high viewership , deeming EastEnders " a brilliant drama " . 
 Conversely , Alison Rowat of The Herald felt that the current storylines indicated " the best days of EE are over " , commenting : " Contrast it with the ever sprightly Coronation Street , where the scenes featuring Gail “ Black Widow ” McIntyre and her lucky white heather husband have been perfect soap fare . What does EastEnders have ? Another murder investigation in a place that has a higher homicide rate than The Wire 's Baltimore . Andrew Billen of The Times refuted claims by the BBC that " EastEnders Live " was not a " gimmick " but in fact proof of the soap 's " innovative vigour " . Billen deemed the live episode a " reactionary move " , observing that Coronation Street had aired a live episode for its 40th anniversary in 2000 . He reminded readers : " live television drama is nothing new but rather harks back to the earliest days of television and , beyond them , to theatre itself . " The Mirror 's Jane Simon hoped for multiple errors during the transmission of " EastEnders Live " , commenting : " It 's time EastEnders gave us a laugh . " 
 = = = Gambling = = = 
 In a world first , online gambling company Bodog offered live odds during the episode , allowing viewers to continue to bet on the identity of Archie 's killer as events unfolded . Although " in @-@ running " betting is common during sports events , it had never before been offered for a soap opera . Odds on the killer 's identity changed frequently in the fortnight preceding the transmission of " EastEnders Live " . On 5 February , the clear favourite was Stacey , with odds at Bodog of 2 / 1 . By 9 February , Stacey 's odds had shortened to 6 / 4 , though the character dropped into third place by 12 February , usurped by her brother Sean Slater ( Robert Kazinsky ) at odds of 9 / 4 , and Ben Mitchell ( Charlie Jones ) at 7 / 2 . On 14 February , the unlikely favourite became Tracey the barmaid ( Jane Slaughter ) , a background character whose odds shortened considerably from 40 / 1 to 11 / 4 . Sean moved back into first place on 16 February , with odds of 2 / 1 , and remained there until the eve of broadcast . 
 Bookmakers estimated that over £ 1 million would be spent gambling on the outcome of the storyline . Ladbrokes experienced its busiest ever 24 hours of gambling on a television series ahead of the episode 's transmission , taking £ 100 @,@ 000 in bets on 30 different characters , while William Hill took £ 500 @,@ 000 , surpassing the amount placed on Dallas ' Who shot J.R. ? storyline in 1980 . Spokesman Rupert Adams commented : " The BBC were amazing keeping this quiet . We have broken even which in a market like this is amazing . We have had a roller @-@ coaster but have enjoyed every minute . "

 The episode won in the " Best Single Episode " category at the 2010 British Soap Awards , and was nominated in the " Best Live Event Coverage " category of the Broadcast Digital Awards 2010 . It received mixed reviews from critics . Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent rated " EastEnders Live " 4 out of 5 , noting that there were " a couple of moments where the seams showed " , but that " half the fun in watching was seeing if you could spot them " . He praised EastEnders for not " playing safe " by including stunt work , and commented that Ian Beale 's line : " I wish we could go back and do it all again . Do it right this time . " could potentially have been " a horrible hostage to fortune " , however felt that : " in the end they more than got away with it . " Tim Teeman of The Times also rated the episode 4 out of 5 , calling the revelation of Stacey as Archie 's killer a " genuine surprise " , and commenting that " EastEnders Live " : " sometimes creaked under the weight of its own ambitions – but who cares , gold stars for effort . " Teeman praised Clements and Turner , feeling that they " excelled themselves despite the odd strained pause " , though noted that in the aftermath of Bradley 's fall , " the perils of live TV became apparent " , commenting that : " The direction slackened at just the wrong moment , and you were left hoping someone would get to a bit of script to ward off any more bizarre shots of Jack and Max fighting to free themselves from a policeman 's soft grip . " 
 Mike Higgins of The Independent deemed the episode " a technical triumph " , praising the " smooth , almost flawless " and " fluent " production . Shane Donaghey of The Belfast Telegraph also called the episode a " triumph " , opining that it could not possibly have lived up to the hype surrounding the storyline , but that transmitting live gave EastEnders " an energy it normally lacks , with great violence , excellent direction " . He summarised : " the story gripped so well you forgot to look for the cock @-@ ups , before a genuinely shocking denouement that you never saw coming amid all of the hype . " Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie 's killer was " a slight let @-@ down " and " a little bit predictable " , calling the episode " a triumph of logistics over logic " . However , Stacey wrote that aside from the " damp @-@ squib " ending , " EastEnders Live " was " surprisingly enjoyable [ ... ] even for a committed ' <unk> like [ her ] self . " She felt that transmitting live " added a tangible layer of tension " to proceedings , lamenting : " If only EastEnders was this exciting all the time . " The Guardian 's Nancy Banks @-@ Smith similarly felt that transmitting live made for " tension , not clarity " , commenting that bookmakers would be " absolutely delighted " with the outcome , but that viewers would be " incredulous " . Cate Devine of The Herald was similarly critical , describing the episode as " 30 minutes of cheesy dramatic counterpoint " , and highlighting the " ropey lighting and poor sound effects . "

 = Ibrox Stadium = 
 Ibrox Stadium is a football stadium located on the south side of the River Clyde in the Ibrox district of Glasgow . The home of Rangers F.C. , Ibrox is one of the largest football stadiums in the UK , and the third largest football stadium in Scotland , having an all @-@ seated capacity of 50 @,@ 947 . 
 It was opened as Ibrox Park in 1899 , but suffered a disaster in 1902 when a wooden terrace collapsed . Vast earthen terraces were built in its place , while a main stand , which is now a listed building , was built in 1928 . A British record crowd of 118 @,@ 567 gathered in January 1939 for a league match with Celtic . After the Ibrox disaster of 1971 , the stadium was largely rebuilt . The vast bowl @-@ shaped terracing was removed and replaced by three rectangular , all @-@ seated stands by 1981 . After renovations were completed in 1997 , the ground was renamed Ibrox Stadium . 
 Ibrox has also hosted the Scotland national football team , particularly when the national stadium Hampden Park was redeveloped in the 1990s . Ibrox also hosted three Scottish domestic cup finals in the same period . It has also been the venue for concerts by major performers , including Frank Sinatra .

 Rangers played its first match in May 1872 , on Glasgow Green . The club then played home matches on public pitches across Glasgow , first moving to a regular home ground at <unk> in 1875 . A year later , Rangers played at the Clydesdale cricket ground in <unk> Park . This ground was improved to give a capacity of 7 @,@ 000 , but it was not owned by Rangers . After hints by the landlords that they wished to develop the site , Rangers left in February 1887 . The club shared Cathkin Park with Third Lanark for the remainder of the 1886 – 87 season . 
 Rangers first moved to the Ibrox area later in 1887 , playing on a site immediately to the east of the current stadium . The first match at this stadium was an 8 – 1 defeat to English side Preston North End on 20 August 1887 , watched by a capacity crowd of over 15 @,@ 000 . This inaugural match had to be abandoned after 70 minutes due to a pitch invasion . The first Ibrox Park was a success in the short term , as three Scotland international matches and the 1890 Scottish Cup Final were played at the ground . Celtic Park , built in 1892 , was more advanced , however . Rangers opted to construct a new stadium , raising funds by forming a limited company . The last match at the old ground was played on 9 December 1899 . The new Ibrox Park was formally opened with a 3 – 1 victory over Hearts on 30 December . 
 = = = Ibrox Park = = = 
 Ibrox Park , as it was known between 1899 and 1997 , is almost completely different from the Ibrox Stadium of today . It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time , comprising an oval track around the pitch , with a pavilion and one stand along one side . The ground had a capacity of 40 @,@ 000 . Celtic Park , Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed with each other to host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland matches , one of which could generate up to £ 1 @,@ 000 in revenue for the host club . To aid their chances of gaining that revenue , Rangers constructed a large terracing , holding 36 @,@ 000 people , behind the western goalmouth . The terracing , designed by Archibald Leitch , was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron . A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end , giving a total capacity of 75 @,@ 000 . 
 The structure was passed by the Govan Burgh Surveyor in March 1902 , but there were newspaper reports that it was unstable . A crowd of 68 @,@ 114 assembled for a Scotland v England match on 5 April 1902 , but shortly after the kick @-@ off one section of the terracing " collapsed like a trap door " . A gap of 20 square yards appeared , causing about 125 people to fall to the ground 50 feet below the terracing . Most survived due to the fact they fell on top of other bodies , but 25 people were killed . 517 people were injured , some due to being crushed in the panic caused by the collapse . 
 Most people in the stadium were unaware that the ( first ) Ibrox disaster had happened . People even re @-@ occupied the damaged area , despite the danger of further collapse . A definite reason for the disaster was not agreed upon , partly because there was no public inquiry held . Some experts blamed the quality of wood and the supplier was tried for culpable homicide , but was acquitted . The design was also cited as a possible cause . Generally , wooden structures of that size were not trusted . Rangers removed the wooden terraces , reducing capacity to 25 @,@ 000 . The criticism of the design did not deter Rangers from hiring Leitch in the future . He designed an expansion of Ibrox to a 63 @,@ 000 capacity by 1910 , using slopes made of earth . By this point , the city of Glasgow had the three largest purpose @-@ built football grounds in the world . 
 The next major redevelopment occurred in 1928 , after Rangers had won their first double . A new Main Stand , to the south side of the ground , was opened on 1 January 1929 . The Main Stand , which has the familiar Leitch style criss @-@ cross balcony and a red @-@ brick facade , seated 10 @,@ 000 people and provided standing accommodation in an enclosure . Simon Inglis , a writer on football stadia , commented in 2005 that the Main Stand is Leitch 's " greatest work " and is " still resplendent today in its red brick glory under a modern mantle of glass and steel " . The architectural significance of the Main Stand was reflected when it became a Category B listed building in 1987 . Original seats in the Main Stand were made of cast iron and oak . When one was auctioned in 2011 , it raised a sale price of £ 1 @,@ 080 . 
 The banking of the terracing continued to increase in the 1930s . On 2 January 1939 , the Old Firm game against Celtic attracted a crowd of 118 @,@ 567 , the record attendance for any league match played in Britain . At this point , Ibrox was the second @-@ largest stadium in Britain . Floodlights were first used at Ibrox in December 1953 , for a friendly match against Arsenal . The first floodlit Scottish league match was played at Ibrox , in March 1956 . Covers were built over the north and east terracing during the 1960s . No structural changes were made to Ibrox , but capacity was cut to approximately 80 @,@ 000 by safety legislation . 
 Ibrox Park had the worst fan safety record in Britain before its complete redesign and renaming in 1997 . Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on Stairway 13 , resulting in a crush . Stairway 13 was a popular , often overcrowded , and very steep exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters ' coaches . After this incident , Rangers installed safety measures , but further injuries were sustained in crushes on Stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969 . On 23 October 1968 , the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire . Just seven months later there was another fire , which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box . The worst disaster to yet affect football in Britain happened on Stairway 13 after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971 , when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on Stairway 13 . The game itself ended in a 1 – 1 draw , with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers . This led to a widespread belief that the crush had been caused by fans who had left the game early , but had turned back when they heard the roar that greeted the Rangers goal . A public inquiry discounted this initial story . It established that the crowd had been travelling in the same direction when the crush happened , with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations . The downward force of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush . 
 The inquiry and subsequent compensation cases found that Rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after the incidents in the 1960s . The disaster also highlighted , however , the fact that there were no established safety standards that should be adhered to , let alone any means of enforcing such standards . This had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier , after the 1923 FA Cup Final . The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973 , and legislation was enacted with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 . This law cut the capacity of Ibrox to 65 @,@ 000 . In the short term , Rangers took the stopgap measure of installing benches in the North Stand , which was renamed the Centenary Stand .

 The 1971 Ibrox disaster led to the club developing a modern , safe stadium . Willie Waddell visited modern grounds in West Germany during the 1974 World Cup and believed that steep terracing and exits , such as Stairway 13 , had to be replaced . The cut in capacity and boardroom changes led to radical plans by architects Miller Partnership , which were published in November 1977 . The plans were modelled on the Westfalenstadion , home ground of Borussia Dortmund . They involved a radical reshaping of the stadium , with the old bowl @-@ shaped terracing to be replaced by three new all @-@ seated structures . Only the old Main Stand would remain , with its enclosure providing the only standing room in the ground . 
 Although later events , such as the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent Taylor Report , vindicated this plan , Rangers were taking a significant risk . The whole plan was estimated to cost £ 6 million , which no other club could have afforded in a short period of time . The development was funded by the Rangers football pools operation , which was the largest club @-@ based scheme in Britain . The first phase of the plan , which began in 1978 , was the removal of the east terracing and its replacement with the Copland Road stand . The same process was repeated on the west side of the ground a year later , with the two identical stands each holding 7 @,@ 500 seats . The redevelopment was completed in 1981 with the replacement of the Centenary Stand by the 10 @,@ 300 capacity Govan Stand . 
 The new Ibrox had a capacity of 44 @,@ 000 and was opened with an Old Firm game played on 19 September 1981 . By this time , however , the development cost had risen to £ 10 million , which depleted the club financially . This resulted in a difficult period in the history of Rangers , as the average attendance fell to 17 @,@ 500 in the 1981 – 82 season , including a crowd of only 4 @,@ 500 for a game against St Mirren . The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this , as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to the spaces between the stands . This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general . Despite the relatively low attendance at Ibrox , Rangers had the highest average home attendances in the Premier Division in both 1983 – 84 and 1984 – 85 . 
 This all changed when a new regime , chaired by David Holmes , took control of Rangers in 1986 . Graeme Souness was appointed player – manager , while several English stars , including Terry Butcher and Chris Woods , were signed . Season ticket sales rose from 7 @,@ 000 in 1986 to over 30 @,@ 000 in the 1990s , while commercial income increased from £ 239 @,@ 000 in 1986 to over £ 2 million in 1989 . The introduction of computerised ticketing , zonal public address systems and closed @-@ circuit television for monitoring turnstile areas meant that Ibrox was at the forefront of stadium management . Rangers also adopted the American technique of analysing the types of fans in each area of the stadium and adjusted their food stalls accordingly . Greater success on the pitch meant that Ibrox demonstrated that seated stadiums would be welcomed by most fans , if designed and fitted well . 
 David Murray acquired control of Rangers in November 1988 . Argyle House , a £ 4 million extension behind the Govan Stand , was opened in 1990 . This added executive boxes , office space and hospitality suites . A further series of developments was started in the early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50 @,@ 000 . Murray commissioned architect Gareth Hutchison to find a way of adding a third tier to the Main Stand . This was a highly complex process , as the Main Stand facade had become a listed building and Murray wanted the existing structure to remain open during construction . The contractors removed the original roof and added a temporary cover while the work carried on above . The Club Deck , which cost approximately £ 20 million , was opened with a league match against Dundee United in December 1991 . The redevelopment of the Main Stand was partially financed by a Football Trust grant of £ 2 million and a debenture issue that raised £ 8 @.@ 5 million . Ordinary fans bought debentures for between £ 1 @,@ 000 and £ 1 @,@ 650 each , which guaranteed the right to buy season tickets for at least 30 years , along with some other minor benefits . 
 Four columns were built through the existing Main Stand to support the Club Deck , which resulted in approximately 1 @,@ 000 seats having a restricted view . After opening the Club Deck , Ibrox had a capacity of 44 @,@ 500 . When a new playing surface was installed in 1992 , Rangers were able to add a further 1 @,@ 300 seats to the front of three stands by lowering the pitch slightly . The only standing area of the ground , the enclosure of the Main Stand , was seated in 1994 to comply with the Taylor Report and UEFA regulations . The multi @-@ coloured seats were replaced in 1995 with uniform blue seats . A further 1 @,@ 200 seats was added in this process by reconfiguring passageways , giving a total capacity of 47 @,@ 998 . 
 The two spaces between the Govan , Copland and Broomloan Stands were filled in with seats and Jumbotron screens . The ground was officially renamed Ibrox Stadium after renovations were completed in 1997 , when Ibrox had a capacity of just over 50 @,@ 000 . Three rows of seating were added to the front of the Govan Stand upper tier in 2006 , linked to a new ' Bar 72 ' area , increasing the capacity to its present figure of 50 @,@ 947 . The Main Stand was renamed the Bill Struth Main Stand in September 2006 , to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death . The Jumbotron screens were replaced in 2011 . 
 Rangers became insolvent in February 2012 and was unable to reach a company voluntary arrangement with its creditors , principally HM Revenue and Customs . Ibrox Stadium , along with the business and other assets of Rangers , was sold in June 2012 to a new company run by Charles Green . The new company obtained the SFA membership of the old Rangers FC company and gained entry to the Scottish Football League Third Division . 
 On 16 July 2014 the club paid a lasting tribute to Sandy Jardine by renaming the Govan Stand in his honour . 
 = = Structure and facilities = = 
 The Ibrox pitch is surrounded by four covered all @-@ seater stands , officially known as the Bill Struth Main ( south ) , Broomloan Road ( west ) , Sandy Jardine ( north ) and Copland Road ( east ) Stands . Each stand has two tiers , with the exception of the Bill Struth Main Stand , which has had three tiers since the Club Deck was added in 1991 . The two corner areas , known as the West and East areas of the Sandy Jardine Stand , have one tier of seating below a JumboTron screen . 
 The Bill Struth Main Stand , formerly known as the Main Stand , faces onto Edmiston Drive ( A8 road ) . The red @-@ brick facade , designed by Archibald Leitch , is a Category B listed building . Simon Inglis , writing in 1996 , described it as an " imposing red @-@ brick facade , with its mock neo @-@ classical arched , square and pedimented windows , exudes prestige and power . " On each end wall the club crest is depicted in a blue and gold mosaic . <unk> leading to the Club Deck ( third tier ) stand at each end of the Main Stand . These towers are also framed in red @-@ brick , but deliberately contrast with the main body of the stand . The two <unk> also support a 146 @-@ metre ( 479 ft ) long and 540 @-@ tonne ( 530 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 600 @-@ short @-@ ton ) truss , which claimed to be the longest and heaviest clear span girder in the world . 
 Through the main doors of the Main Stand is a wood @-@ panelled hallway . A staircase leads to the boardroom and trophy room . Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury , in that it combined corporate power with a sense of tradition and solidity . It was originally constructed as a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ seat stand above a standing enclosure . It was redeveloped in the early 1990s with the addition of the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure . It is now a three @-@ tier all @-@ seated structure , accommodating approximately 21 @,@ 000 spectators . The front wall of the middle tier is one of the last surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss @-@ cross detailing . The middle tier is split into front and rear sections , while the enclosure is split into east and west sections , either side of the retractable tunnel cover . 
 Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand formerly known as the Govan Stand . It is a two @-@ tier stand , similar in style to the two end stands , which was completed in 1981 . To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension , completed in 1990 , which provides executive boxes , hospitality areas and office space . The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006 . The Copland Road Stand , at the east end of the stadium , was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8 @,@ 000 fans . It is traditionally the ' Rangers end ' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end in the second half of matches . The western Broomloan Road Stand , which was completed in 1980 , is identical to the opposite end . Although constructed as separate structures , the three stands have been linked since the mid @-@ 1990s , when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas . All of the stands are designed using the ' goalpost ' structure , in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured . A Rangers Megastore is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands . 
 Away fans are normally accommodated in the corner of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands . For bigger games , such as the Old Firm derbies , the whole of the Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support . Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters . Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox , citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies . The ban was lifted after one game , as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action . Before the corners were filled in , away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand . Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors .

 Since the redevelopments to Celtic Park and Hampden Park were completed in the late 1990s , Ibrox has had the smallest capacity of the three major stadiums in Glasgow . Rangers have since explored options to increase capacity . After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006 , chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be replicated in the Copland Stand . A report in the Daily Record in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57 @,@ 000 , principally by removing the JumboTron screens and lowering the pitch to accommodate more seating . These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by the team . In January 2008 , Rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop Ibrox . One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70 @,@ 000 , by replacing three of the stands with a bowl @-@ type structure . These plans were shelved by October 2008 , however , due to the late @-@ 2000s financial crisis . 
 Alongside changes to the stadium itself , Rangers have also sought to develop land around Ibrox . In partnership with the Las Vegas Sands corporation , the club received outline planning permission from Glasgow City Council for the development of land adjoining Ibrox as the home of a super casino . The casino was planned to be accompanied by a Rangers @-@ themed leisure complex . Britain 's Casino Advisory Panel reviewed bids from eight short @-@ listed cities , including Glasgow , and in 2007 awarded the first licence to Manchester . There is no immediate prospect of the Ibrox proposal being resurrected , as Gordon Brown dropped the plans for super casinos soon after becoming Prime Minister . Rangers were given approval by Glasgow City Council in October 2008 to purchase land around Ibrox and redevelop the area with hotel and retail outlets . This scheme stalled , however , as regulations constrained what could be built in the area .

 Ibrox has been a home venue for the Scotland national football team 18 times , the third most of any ground . The first Ibrox Park ( 1887 – 99 ) hosted three internationals , giving an overall Ibrox total of 21 . The ground most recently hosted a Scotland game in October 2014 , when Hampden Park was unavailable due to its temporary conversion to hold athletics in the 2014 Commonwealth Games . Ibrox hosted several internationals during the 1990s , particularly when Hampden was being redeveloped . Hampden was redeveloped in two phases . Ibrox hosted four Scotland games in the first phase , starting with a 1994 World Cup qualifier against Portugal in October 1992 . It was not a happy interlude for Scotland fans , however , as the team failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970 . Although the attendances at Ibrox were higher than at Hampden , some fans resented the fact that they were helping the finances of Rangers . Fans also complained that the ticket prices were too high . During the second period of redevelopment , however , Scotland won an important 1998 World Cup qualifier against Sweden at Ibrox . 
 During these periods of redevelopment to Hampden , Ibrox also hosted the 1997 Scottish Cup Final and the 1994 and 1997 Scottish League Cup Finals . Ibrox was on the approved UEFA list to host major European finals in the 1990s , but it lost out in a bid to host the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup Final because a convention threatened a shortage of hotel rooms in Glasgow . Ibrox continues to hold the top UEFA rating , but the Scottish Football Association put forward the redeveloped Hampden for European finals in the 2000s .

 King George V visited Ibrox Park in 1917 , to thank Rangers for its efforts in the First World War . His son , King George VI , opened the 1938 Empire Exhibition with a speech at Ibrox . This was used as source material by Colin Firth for his performance in The King 's Speech movie . Ibrox has been used for concerts , including performances by Simple Minds ( 1986 x2 ) , Frank Sinatra ( 1990 ) , Rod Stewart ( 1995 ) , Elton John and Billy Joel ( 1998 ) . 
 In June 1980 , Ibrox hosted a world championship boxing match between Jim Watt and Howard Davis . Ibrox hosted the rugby sevens event at the 2014 Commonwealth Games , won by South Africa . There was a total attendance of 171 @,@ 000 for the four sessions of play , which set a new record for a rugby sevens tournament . 
 The stadium has also hosted the 1983 Centenary Celebrations of The Boys ' Brigade .

 The main railway stations in Glasgow , Central and Queen Street , are both approximately two miles from Ibrox . The Ibrox and Cessnock stations on the Glasgow Subway both serve Ibrox . It is also served by First Glasgow buses on Paisley Road West .

 = Eliurus petteri = 
 Eliurus petteri is a rodent in the genus Eliurus found in lowland eastern Madagascar . First described in 1994 , it is most closely related to the smaller Eliurus grandidieri . Virtually nothing is known of its natural history , except that it occurs in rainforest and is nocturnal and solitary . It is threatened by destruction and fragmentation of its habitat and is listed as " Vulnerable " on the IUCN Red List . 
 With a head and body length of 130 to 136 mm ( 5 @.@ 1 to 5 @.@ 4 in ) , Eliurus petteri is a moderately large species of Eliurus . Its upperparts are gray @-@ brown to gray and contrast sharply with the white underparts . The tail tuft , a characteristic feature of Eliurus , is weakly developed . The skull is delicate and the incisive foramina ( openings in the front part of the palate ) are short and narrow . The incisors are weak . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Eliurus petteri was first described in 1994 by American zoologist Michael Carleton as part of a revision of the genus Eliurus . Carleton had only three specimens of the new species , which had been collected in 1929 , 1956 , and 1963 in close proximity in an area of eastern Madagascar . The specific name honors French biologist François Petter , who has contributed to the scientific study of the nesomyines . In 1998 , Carleton and Steven Goodman described a related species , Eliurus grandidieri , from the Northern Highlands of Madagascar . Surprisingly , DNA sequence data suggest that this species is more closely related to Voalavo gymnocaudus than to other species of Eliurus ; however , E. petteri has not been studied genetically . Carleton and Goodman reported additional occurrences of E. petteri ( though within the same general area ) in 2007 , and formally recognized the " Eliurus petteri group " ( including E. grandidieri and E. petteri ) as one of five species groups within the genus . 
 The common names " Petter 's Tuft @-@ tailed Rat " and " Petter 's Tufted @-@ tailed Rat " have been used for this species . It is now one of twelve species recognized within Eliurus , the most diverse and widespread genus of the native Malagasy rodents ( subfamily Nesomyinae ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 Eliurus petteri is a fairly large , long @-@ tailed species of Eliurus that resembles a smaller version of Eliurus webbi . It is larger than the closely related E. grandidieri . The fur is soft and fine . The upperparts appear gray @-@ brown to gray in overall color ; individual hairs are light gray for most of their length , then pale buff , and dark brown to black at the tip . Dark guard hairs — longer hairs projecting above the main fur — are present , but relatively short . The underparts are entirely white , a feature unique for the genus ; even E. grandidieri has dark gray underparts . The transition between the coloration of the upper- and underparts is sharp . The mystacial vibrissae ( whiskers on the upper lip ) are 50 to 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) long and extend beyond the ears when pressed against the head . In some specimens , the eyes are surrounded by a dark ring . The pinnae ( external ears ) are dark and appear naked , but are covered by fine brown fur on the outer and by white hairs on the inner surface . The forefeet are entirely white above , but a narrow dark streak is present on the hindfeet . The skin of the tail is dark , sometimes with some white spots on the lower side . Although the tail appears mostly naked , it is covered with inconspicuous hairs . The tail tuft — characteristic of the genus Eliurus — is weakly developed and consists of light brown to grayish brown hairs along the 25 to 30 % of the tail closest to the tip . 
 The skull looks delicate . The interorbital region ( between the eyes ) is narrow and hourglass @-@ shaped , and the braincase is smooth ; both lack conspicuously developed ridges and shelves . The zygomatic arches ( cheekbones ) are poorly developed . The incisive foramina ( openings in the front part of the palate ) are short and narrow . The bony palate ends at the level of the back of the third upper molars . The alisphenoid strut ( a piece of bone at the back of the skull separating two foramina , or openings ) is absent . The strut is present in most Eliurus , but absent in some specimens of E. grandidieri . The subsquamosal fenestrae ( openings in the squamosal bone ) are fairly large . The auditory bullae are small . The incisors are weak and the enamel on the upper incisors is yellow to light orange . The root of the lower incisor does not project into a distinct capsular process at the back of the mandible ( lower jaw ) , a feature shared only with E. grandidieri among species of Eliurus . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Eliurus petteri is known only from a limited area in the foothills of eastern Madagascar ( Toamasina Province ) , where it occurs from 450 to 1 @,@ 145 m ( 1 @,@ 476 to 3 @,@ 757 ft ) above sea level . It occurs in close proximity with E. minor , E. <unk> , and E. webbi , and is probably sympatric with them . Information on the natural history of E. petteri is extremely limited . It occurs in lowland rainforest and is probably arboreal or scansorial ( climbing in vegetation ) . It is nocturnal and solitary and may eat fruits , seeds , and insects . The weak incisors suggest to Carleton that it eats more " <unk> " fruits and insects than other Eliurus . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 Destruction and fragmentation of its habitat are major threats to Eliurus petteri , which is not known to occur in any protected area . Furthermore , it may be vulnerable to plague transmitted by introduced rodents . Accordingly , it is classified as " Vulnerable " on the IUCN Red List . 
 = 1985 – 86 Calgary Flames season = 
 The 1985 – 86 Calgary Flames season was the sixth season in Calgary and 14th for the Flames franchise in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . It was a banner season for the Flames , who overcame a franchise record eleven game losing streak to finish 2nd in the Smythe Division and captured the franchise 's first Clarence S. Campbell Bowl as Campbell Conference champions . In doing so , they became the first Calgary team to reach the Stanley Cup Finals since the Calgary Tigers in 1923 – 24 . The Flames season ended at the hands of the Montreal Canadiens , who defeated Calgary in five games in the final . 
 The season began with the departure of franchise leading scorer Kent Nilsson who was sent to the Minnesota North Stars in a trade . Rookie goaltender Mike Vernon emerged as the team 's top goaltender and Joe Mullen was acquired in a major trade midway through the season . Gary Suter captured the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league 's top rookie while also being named to the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team . Additionally , Suter was the team 's lone representative at the 1986 All @-@ Star Game . Håkan Loob captured the Molson Cup . 
 The Flames upset the heavily favoured Edmonton Oilers in the Smythe Division final to end the Oilers ' hopes of winning a third consecutive championship . The series winning goal was scored into his own net by Oilers rookie Steve Smith . As Smith collapsed to the ice , Flames players celebrated the difference maker in what would finish as a 3 – 2 Calgary win . Smith 's error remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history . 
 = = Regular season = = 
 The Flames began the year with a similar roster as finished the 1984 – 85 season , with one major exception . Kent Nilsson , the franchise 's all @-@ time leading scorer , was dealt to the Minnesota North Stars for two draft picks . Nilsson was viewed as a player with immense talent who ended each season as a perennial disappointment in the playoffs . Though he scored 99 points the season before , the Flames received few offers before agreeing to send him to Minnesota . As the deal provided no immediate help for the team , co @-@ captain Doug Risebrough anticipated that 1985 – 86 would be a transitional year for the Flames and the loss of Nilsson might force the team to play a more defensive style when compared to the team that finished second in league scoring the year previous . 
 The season opened in Calgary with a game against the Winnipeg Jets , the team that eliminated the Flames in the first round of the previous spring 's playoffs . It ended with an 8 – 3 victory for the Flames , but not before a bench @-@ clearing brawl resulted in the ejection of five players . Calgary was one of the top teams in the league in the early going , standing third overall on December 10 with a 15 – 8 – 3 record . 
 Four nights later , they were defeated by the Vancouver Canucks , 4 – 3 , and continued losing for nearly a month . After the Hartford Whalers handily defeated the Flames 9 – 1 on January 7 , 1986 , to send Calgary to its 11th consecutive defeat , a franchise record , coach Bob Johnson promised changes . Among them was the recall of goaltender Mike Vernon from the Moncton Golden Flames , who was given the start ahead of Rejean Lemelin in their next game , against Vancouver . He held the Flames in the game long enough for Jim Peplinski to score in the first minute of overtime for a 5 – 4 victory that ended the eighth @-@ longest losing streak in NHL history . 
 During the losing streak , on December 29 , the Flames hosted Soviet team Dynamo Moscow in an exhibition game as part of the 1986 Super Series . Vernon was given the start for the game to let Lemelin rest and led Calgary to a 4 – 3 victory over Dynamo . It was the Flames ' second victory in three years against a Soviet league club , and came despite what the team considered biased officiating by the Russian referee working the game . 
 The team enjoyed greater success in the second half of the season , finishing the final 40 games with a record of 22 – 12 – 5 . Vernon established himself as the starting goaltender by mid February and finished the regular season with only three losses in 15 decisions . The Flames ended the season in second place in the Smythe Division , sixth overall in the NHL , with 89 points . Seeking to upgrade the team 's offence as the playoffs approached , General Manager Cliff Fletcher completed a six @-@ player trade with the St. Louis Blues that brought Joe Mullen , a player who had scored at least 40 goals each of his previous two seasons , to Calgary . A second deal in March had the Flames acquire four @-@ time Stanley Cup champion John Tonelli from the New York Islanders and initiated a war of words with Edmonton Oilers general manager and coach Glen Sather , who accused Islanders general manager Bill Torrey of trying to help Fletcher eliminate the Oilers in the upcoming playoffs .

 The Flames began the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs with a Smythe semi @-@ final match @-@ up against the Winnipeg Jets , the team that eliminated them in the first round the previous season . Calgary won the best @-@ of @-@ five series in three consecutive games , eliminating the Jets on a Lanny McDonald overtime goal in the third game . The victory set up a best @-@ of @-@ seven Smythe Division final against the two @-@ time defending champion Edmonton Oilers who swept the Vancouver Canucks in the opening round . The Flames opened the series in Edmonton with a 4 – 1 victory , the first loss the Oilers had suffered on home ice in 18 playoff games . 
 The two teams traded victories through the first six games , leading to a deciding seventh game in Edmonton . The Flames stepped out to an early 2 – 0 lead before the Oilers tied it . Disaster then struck Edmonton at the 5 : 14 mark of the third period . Oilers ' rookie defenceman Steve Smith , attempting to play the puck from behind his own goal line , accidentally shot the puck off Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr 's skate and into his own net . As Smith collapsed to the ice in shock , the Flames celebrated the goal that was ultimately credited to Perry Berezan . He was the last Flame to touch the puck , though he was no longer on the ice when it went in . The Oilers were unable to come back , losing the game , 3 – 2 , series , 4 – 3 , and ending their hopes of winning a third consecutive Stanley Cup . Smith 's blunder remains one of the most legendary errors in NHL history . 
 The Campbell Conference Final against the St. Louis Blues was also a back and forth affair in which the Flames take a 3 – 2 series lead into the sixth game in St. Louis . Calgary led the sixth game 5 – 2 with 12 minutes to play before three quick goals by the Blues sent the game into overtime . Doug Wickenheiser scored to win the game for the Blues . The comeback came to be known as the Monday Night Miracle in St. Louis . The Flames rebounded in game seven , winning 2 – 1 to claim the first Clarence S. Campbell Bowl in franchise history as Campbell Conference champions . The victory also sent the Flames to their first Stanley Cup final . It was the first time a team representing the city played in the final since the Calgary Tigers lost to the Montreal Canadiens in the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals . 
 Their opponent in 1986 was also the Canadiens in what constituted the first all @-@ Canadian final since 1967 . Calgary opened the series with a 5 – 2 victory at home in the battle of rookie goaltenders : Vernon against Patrick Roy . Montreal evened the series with a 3 – 2 overtime victory in game two in which Brian Skrudland set an NHL record for the fastest overtime goal in playoff history when he scored nine seconds into the extra frame . Already missing three key players in Carey Wilson , Colin Patterson and Nick <unk> due to injury , the Flames lost their top scorer in Joe Mullen to a neck injury during a game two loss . The Canadiens also won the third game as the series shifted to Montreal , and 1 – 0 Calgary loss in game four pushed the Flames to the brink of elimination . Montreal broke out to a 4 – 1 lead in the fifth game , at Calgary , before the Flames made a comeback attempt . They scored with less than four minutes remaining , and then moved within one goal when Mullen – who returned for game five wearing a neck brace – scored with 46 seconds remaining . A desperate push for the tying goal fell short when Roy made several key saves as time expired . Montreal celebrated the 23rd Stanley Cup championship in their franchise history as the fans loudly chanted " thank you Flames , thank you Flames " in appreciation of their team 's efforts .

 The Battle of Alberta dominated the Flames ' focus late in the season as they continued to struggle against their provincial rival . The two @-@ time defending champion Oilers were nearly unbeatable against Calgary , losing just five of 31 matchups over three years . Calgary 's frustration against Edmonton was highlighted by a mid @-@ season game where , after a large brawl that resulted in the ejection of five players from the game , Calgary 's Doug Risebrough ended up in the penalty box with Marty McSorley 's Oilers jersey . Risebrough shredded the jersey with his skates before tossing it back onto the ice . Oilers ' coach Glen Sather , enraged by the act , called Risebrough " childish " and threatened to send him a $ 1000 bill to replace the sweater . 
 Realizing Calgary 's path to the Stanley Cup would go through Edmonton , coach Bob Johnson devised a seven @-@ point plan for beating the Oilers that focused on limiting Wayne Gretzky , Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri 's creativity , limiting access to the left side of the ice where the Oilers ' top stars liked to skate , leaving their physical players on the ice by not engaging them and utilizing Neil Sheehy and Colin Patterson in roles designed to frustrate the Oiler players . Johnson first utilized the strategy in a late season game that ended in a 4 – 4 tie . The Flames then defeated the Oilers 9 – 3 in their final regular season meeting , a game that ended with another brawl and accusations by both teams that the other was sending their goons out after talented players . 
 The rivalry extended into the stands in the second game of the Smythe Division final in Edmonton . During the game , trainer Bearcat Murray went into the stands to rescue his son Al , also a trainer for the Flames , and tore ligaments in his leg in the process . Al had gone into the stands in an attempt to retrieve Gary Suter 's stick , which had been knocked into the crowd and was being hidden by Oiler fans . Fearing for his son 's safety , Bearcat jumped into the fray himself , suffering the injury . While being wheeled into an ambulance , Murray blew kisses for the cameras . The incident caught the attention of a group of fans in Boston , who formed the " Bearcat Murray Fan Club " , and began showing up at the Boston Garden wearing skull caps and oversized moustaches mimicking Murray 's looks when the Flames played there . The Flames lost players on the ice during the physical series as well , as Carey Wilson required surgery to remove his spleen after he was " skewered " by Steve Smith , according to Johnson . Suter had his season ended after suffering torn ligaments in his knee following a low hit by Mark Messier . 
 When the seventh game ended in victory , Flames fans in both Calgary and at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton spilled onto the streets in celebration . The " C of Red " was born in that playoff series as fans responded to a promotion to wear the colour with such enthusiasm that many stores across the city sold out of red clothing . The effect was most pronounced during games , where nearly every fan in the Saddledome was in red . The C of Red inspired the Winnipeg Jets to create their White Out the following year .

 Listed at five feet , nine inches tall by NHL Central Scouting , defenceman Gary Suter was considered too small for the NHL and went unselected at both the 1982 and 1983 NHL Entry Drafts . Suter moved on to the University of Wisconsin where Flames scouts noted that he had grown two inches and was a leading player for his team . Calgary selected him with their 9th round selection in 1984 . He joined the Flames in 1985 – 86 and quickly established himself as the team 's top defenceman in the eyes of his coaches and teammates . Suter finished the season with 18 goals and 68 points and was awarded the Calder Trophy as the NHL 's top rookie in addition to being named to the All @-@ Rookie Team . Additionally , Suter was the Flames ' lone representative at the 1986 All @-@ Star Game . Suter 's 68 points was the second highest total by a rookie defenceman in league history , behind Larry Murphy 's 76 .

 The draft @-@ day trade that sent franchise scoring leader Kent Nilsson to Minnesota , along with a third round selection , for second round draft picks in 1985 and 1987 was immediately controversial in Calgary as players and fans were divided on the merit of dealing Nilsson . While some players felt the trade was inevitable , others expressed their disappointment at the move , including co @-@ captain Lanny McDonald , who wondered how the team would replace Nilsson 's offensive production . Former teammate Willi Plett supported the trade , noting Nilsson 's inconsistency : " Maybe I shouldn 't be saying this , but trading a player like him , it never hurts you . " 
 The Flames completed a second significant trade in February , acquiring scoring forward Joe Mullen along with defencemen Terry Johnson and Rik Wilson from the St. Louis Blues in exchange for Ed Beers , Charlie Bourgeois and Gino <unk> . The Flames had targeted Mullen , who had scored 40 + goals each of his previous two seasons and had 28 for the Blues at the time of the deal , believing he could be a game breaker for them heading into the playoffs .

 The 1985 NHL Entry Draft was held in Toronto , Ontario on June 15 . The Flames used their first round pick , 17th overall , on American defenceman Chris Biotti . The team was surprised that he had fallen to them , believing Biotti to be the best defenceman available and expressing confidence he would be a star in the NHL . Their predictions ultimately proved unfounded . After spending two seasons at Harvard University , Biotti played three seasons for their minor league team in Salt Lake and another two in Europe before retiring . He never appeared in a National Hockey League game . 
 With the second round pick acquired from Minnesota in the Nilsson trade , Calgary selected East Coast Athletic Conference rookie of the year Joe Nieuwendyk from Cornell University . Labeled " Joe who ? " by media and fans unsure of his potential , Nieuwendyk ultimately had the longest NHL career of any Flames ' selection in this draft . He appeared in 1 @,@ 257 games , scoring 1 @,@ 126 points and won the Stanley Cup with Calgary in 1989 , the Dallas Stars in 1999 and the New Jersey Devils in 2003 , in addition to a gold medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics . He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011 . 
 = Give Peace a Chance ( Grey 's Anatomy ) = 
 " Give Peace a Chance " is the seventh episode of the sixth season of the American television medical drama Grey 's Anatomy , and the show 's 109th episode overall . Written by Peter Nowalk and directed by Chandra Wilson , the episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) in the United States on October 29 , 2009 . Grey 's Anatomy centers on a group of young doctors in training . In this episode , Dr. Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) performs an operation on a hospital technician 's " inoperable " tumor , despite the objections of the chief of surgery , Dr. Richard Webber ( James Pickens , Jr . ) . 
 The episode was designed to revolve around Dempsey 's character . Katherine Heigl ( Dr. Izzie Stevens ) was absent from the episode , as she was filming the 2010 blockbuster Life as We Know It . Mark Saul , Jesse Williams , and Nora Zehetner returned as guest stars , while Faran Tahir made his only appearance . " Give Peace a Chance " won Wilson an NAACP Image Award , and was generally well received among critics , with Tahir 's character particularly praised . The initial airing was viewed by 13 @.@ 74 million people , garnered a 5 @.@ 2 / 13 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic , and achieved the fourth highest viewership on the night .

 " Give Peace a Chance " opens with Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital 's chief of surgery , Dr. Richard Webber ( James Pickens , Jr . ) implementing a new computerized surgical scheduling system , which is disliked by many of the hospital 's staff . Thereafter , Isaac ( Faran Tahir ) , a hospital lab technician , brings Dr. Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) a scan of his tumor , which has been declared inoperable by several other physicians due to its complexity . Isaac asks Shepherd to remove it . Shepherd agrees , but Webber refuses permission for the procedure because of the high risk involved . Shepherd ignores the chief 's directions and schedules the surgery . The interns and residents all want the chance to assist due to the rarity of such a tumor , so Shepherd hosts a competition in which the winner gets to join him in the operating room . After seeing Dr. Steve Mostow ( Mark Saul ) make a mistake , Dr. Cristina Yang ( Sandra Oh ) is confident that she will win the competition , but loses to Dr. Jackson Avery ( Jesse Williams ) . Dr. Lexie Grey ( Chyler Leigh ) is not invited to compete because Shepherd wants her to be his caregiver in what would be a long surgery . Knowing that she will not be able to use the bathroom for the entire procedure , Lexie decides to wear a diaper into the operating room ; her courage and dedication impresses Yang . 
 Dr. Izzie Stevens ( Katherine Heigl ) is scheduled for an interleukin 2 ( IL @-@ 2 ) treatment but is absent from the hospital . Dr. Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) calls her , but she does not answer or come , so Karev cries to fellow resident Dr. Reed Adamson ( Nora Zehetner ) . Shepherd spends ten hours in the operating room contemplating what to do about the tumor , with the motivational support of fellow surgeons Dr. Mark Sloan ( Eric Dane ) , Dr. Miranda Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ) , and Dr. Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) . Webber orders Shepherd to end the surgery because he is wasting hospital resources . Shortly thereafter , Isaac awakens to Shepherd explaining that the surgery would not have been possible without paralyzing him . Isaac convinces Shepherd to operate again in secret the next day , and the latter maps out a diagram of the surgery on his bedroom wall while discussing it with his wife Dr. Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) , who is home on bed rest after donating part of her liver to her father in the episode " Tainted Obligation " . Backed by his fellow attendings , Shepherd obtains Webber 's permission to cut the chord but tells Avery and Lexie that they were not cutting the chord and playing by ear instead . He removes all but a tiny section of the tumor . Webber discovers that Shepherd is operating and is about to put an end to it , but Dr. Arizona Robbins ( Jessica Capshaw ) tells him to go away . Shepherd has to cut a nerve to remove the rest of the tumor , but does not know which will result in paralysis . He decides with a game of " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , moe " , ultimately cutting the correct nerve and eliminating the entirety of the tumor . Despite the successful surgery , Webber is enraged and verbally fires Shepherd . Shepherd dismisses this in a light tone and goes home to drink champagne with his wife . 
 = = Production = = 
 Running for 43 minutes , the episode was written by Peter Nowalk and directed by Wilson ; the latter portrays Bailey . Jenny Barak edited the music and Donald Lee Harris served as the production designer . Heigl was absent from the episode , as she was filming the romantic comedy Life as We Know It ( 2010 ) . The song featured in the episode was Bat for Lashes ' " Moon and Moon " , featured on their second album Two Suns . Saul , Zehetner , and Williams returned to the episode as Mostow , Adamson , and Avery , respectively , while Tahir made his first and only appearance as Isaac . The scenes in the operating room were filmed at the Prospect Studios in Los Feliz , Los Angeles ; Nowalk said the scenes were difficult to shoot , due to the technicality involved . Pompeo 's appearances in the episode were scarce , as she was eight and a half months pregnant during shooting . 
 According to Nowalk , the idea to have Lexie wear a diaper to get through the operation was inspired by an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show . He added : " It wasn 't that big of a leap for us to go diaper . Our doctors are hardcore by nature . " Nowalk said that this episode was primarily focused around Shepherd , which he considered an " experiment " . He commented that the idea of Isaac 's storyline came from Dr. Robert Bray , a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles . Nowalk intended the nature of the episode to be " different " , attributing it to the fact that Heigl 's character was absent . He also praised Wilson for directing the episode , commenting that " she acts , she sings , and now she directs " . The majority of the episode involved Shepherd staring at his patient 's tumor , contemplating what to do . Nowalk offered his insight on this : 
 " It 's quieter than a typical episode . More single @-@ minded . Derek is our sole focus . And really , what an amazing character to spend an entire episode with . Watch Patrick Dempsey on your screen and you can 't help but be struck by how much he says without saying anything . The guy can pretty much give you an entire soliloquy with just one look . That 's a rare talent , and we really wanted to use that to our advantage in an episode about stillness and peace . "

 Critics were largely positive in their reviews of the episode . The Huffington Post 's Michael Pascua called " Give Peace a Chance " a " hit and miss " episode , criticizing the slang dialogue by saying it " sounded like it came from an MTV drama " , but praising the installment 's " character driven development " . Pascua was positive on the development of Tahir 's character , writing : " I hope he comes back in a later episode just to remind these people about patience and hope . " TV Fanatic 's Steve Marsi gave a positive review of the episode , saying it " won [ him ] over " , and also praising Tahir 's character . Marsi applauded the development of Dempsey 's character , calling him " the best [ doctor ] " , and noted that Wilson 's directing may " net her an Emmy nomination " . 
 Writing for Entertainment Weekly , Jennifer Armstrong had mixed feedback on the episode , writing : " The all @-@ medical , all @-@ the @-@ time episodes need to stop . " However , she found it " fantastic " when Shepherd drew on the wall , and enjoyed Tahir 's character , calling him " lovely " . Armstrong also said that " Give Peace a Chance " was in " ER territory " , adding : " I do not watch Grey 's Anatomy to get my ER fix .

The episode also earned Wilson an NAACP Image Award under the Outstanding Directing in a Dramatic Series category . 
 = Cross @-@ country skiing ( sport ) = 
 The sport of cross @-@ country skiing encompasses a variety of formats for cross @-@ country skiing races over courses of varying lengths according to rules sanctioned by the International Ski Federation and by various national organizations , such as the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association ( USSA ) and Cross Country Ski Canada . International competitions include the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships , the FIS Cross @-@ Country World Cup , and at the Winter Olympic Games . Such races occur over homologated , groomed courses designed to support classic ( in @-@ track ) and freestyle events , where the skiers may employ skate skiing . It also encompasses cross @-@ country ski marathon events , sanctioned by the Worldloppet Ski Federation , and cross @-@ country ski orienteering events , sanctioned by the International Orienteering Federation . Related forms of competition are biathlon , where competitors race on cross @-@ country skis and stop to shoot at targets with rifles , and paralympic cross @-@ country skiing that allows athletes with disabilities to compete at cross @-@ country skiing with adaptive equipment . 
 Norwegian army units were skiing for sport ( and prizes ) in the 18th century . Starting in the latter part of the 20th century , technique evolved from the striding in @-@ track classic technique to include skate @-@ skiing , which occurs on courses that have been groomed with wide lanes for those using the technique . At the same time , equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural materials to comprising such man @-@ made materials as fiberglass , carbon fiber , and polyethylene plastics . 
 Athletes train to achieve endurance , strength , speed , skill and flexibility at different levels of intensity . Offseason training often occurs on dry land , sometimes on roller skis . The organization of cross @-@ country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences . As with other sports that require endurance , strength and speed , some athletes have chosen to use banned performance @-@ enhancing drugs . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1767 Danish @-@ Norwegian general , Carl Schack Rantzau , codified four classes of military skiing contests and established prizes for each : 
 Shooting at prescribed targets at 40 @-@ 50 paces while skiing downhill at " top speed " ( precursor to biathlon ) . 
 " Hurling " themselves while racing downhill among trees " without falling or breaking skis " ( precursor to slalom ) . 
 Downhill racing on large slopes without " riding or resting on their stick " or falling ( precursor to downhill racing ) . 
 " Long racing " with full military kit and a gun on the shoulder over ca . 2 @.@ 5 km of " flat ground " within 15 minutes ( precursor to modern cross @-@ country skiing ) . 
 An early record of a public ski competition was for an 1843 event in Tromsø . The announcement called the event a " wagering race on skis " . A distinct alpine technique emerged around 1900 from how skiing was practiced up until then when Mathias <unk> advocated the " <unk> Ski Method " as an alternative to the Norwegian technique . In Norwegian , langrenn refers to " competitive skiing where the goal is to complete a specific distance in pre @-@ set tracks in the shortest possible time " . Alpine skiing competitions ( known as hill races ) existed in Norway during the 18th and 19th centuries , but were discontinued when the main ski festival in Oslo focused on long races ( competitive cross @-@ country skiing ) and ski jumping ( now known as the Nordic disciplines ) . The alpine disciplines reemerged in Central Europe around 1920 . Ski touring competitions ( Norwegian : turrenn ) are long @-@ distance cross @-@ country competitions open to the public , competition is usually within age categories . 
 In the 1800s racers used a single , wooden pole , which was longer and stronger than modern poles , and could be used for braking downhill , as well . In Norway , racing with two poles ( " Finland style " ) met with resistance , starting in the 1880s , when some race rules forbade them ; objections included issues of aesthetics — how they made skiers " [ waddle ] like geese " . As the use of pairs of pole became the norm , materials favored lightness and strength , starting with bamboo , which gave way to fiberglass , used at the 1968 Winter Olympics , aluminum , used at the 1972 Winter Olympics , and ultimately carbon fiber , introduced in 1975 . 
 = = = Skate skiing = = = 
 Skate skiing was introduced to competition in the 20th Century . At the first German ski championship , held at the Feldberg in the Black Forest in 1900 , the Norwegian Bjarne Nilssen won the 23 km cross @-@ country race and was observed using a skating motion while skiing — a technique unknown to the spectators . Johan <unk> used the skating technique at the 1931 World Championship in Oberhof , one of the earliest recorded use of skating in competitive cross @-@ country skiing . This technique was later used in ski orienteering in the 1960s on roads and other firm surfaces . Finnish skier Pauli <unk> developed a variant of the style for marathon or other endurance events in the 1970s by leaving one ski in the track while skating outwards to the side with the other ski ( one @-@ sided skating ) ; this became known as the " marathon skate " . Bill Koch ( USA ) further developed the marathon skate technique in the late 1970s . Skate @-@ skiing became widespread during the 1980s after Koch 's success with it in the 1982 Cross @-@ country Skiing Championships drew more attention to the technique . Norwegian skier , Ove <unk> , started using the technique in 1984 , when he found it to be much faster than classic style . Skating is most effective on wide , smooth , groomed trails , using fiberglass skis that glide well ; it also benefits a stronger athlete — which , according to Olav Bø , are the reasons that the technique made a breakthrough in the early 1980s . Athletes widely adopted skating to both sides by the time of the 1985 world championship and it was formally adopted by the FIS in 1986 — despite initial opposition from Norway , the Soviet Union and Finland — while preserving events using only classic technique .

 The Winter Olympic Games are a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years . The first Winter Olympics , the 1924 Winter Olympics , was held in Chamonix , France and included Nordic skiing ( which includes cross @-@ country skiing ) among the five principal disciplines . Cross @-@ country events have evolved in the Winter Olympics since 1924 , as seen in the following timeline : 
 1924 Winter Olympics : Cross @-@ country skiing debuts . 
 1952 Winter Olympics . : Women 's Nordic skiing debuts 
 1956 Winter Olympics : men 's 30 km and the women 's <unk> added .

 The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women . From 1924 to 1939 , the World Championships were held annually , including years with Winter Olympic Games . After World War II , the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982 . Since 1985 , the World Championships have been held in odd @-@ numbered years . 
 FIS events include : 
 The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 
 FIS Cross @-@ Country World Cup : each year medalists are announced who have the highest total scores at the end of the World Cup season .

 A ski marathon is a long @-@ distance , usually point @-@ to @-@ point race , of more than 40 kilometers ; some are held concurrent with shorter races and participation is usually open to the public . In Norwegian , such a race is called turrenn ( " ski touring race " ) . Major events have more than 10 @,@ 000 participants where mass starts often have a modified starting order by groupings of participants — who have been judged to be of similar ability , beginning with the elite skiers group and ending with a group of the least experienced skiers . Skiers can use either classic or skate @-@ skiing techniques , depending on the rules of the race . Awards are usually based on overall placement , placement by sex of athlete , and by age category . There are two major series in this category , the Ski Classics and the Worldloppet . 
 = = = = Ski Classics series = = = = 
 Ski Classics is a commercially sponsored international long @-@ distance cross @-@ country skiing cup competition , held in Europe . It originated in January 2011 .

 The Worldloppet Ski Federation recognizes twenty ski marathons including those in the Ski Classics series ( except La <unk> and <unk> ) . They recognize those athletes who complete Worldloppet races in 10 different countries , at least one of which has to be on another continent , to qualify as a " Worldloppet Master " . The organization , sanctioned by FIS , seeks to attract elite racers to its events with the FIS Worldloppet Cup and aims thereby to " increase media and spectator interest in long distance racing " . Notable races , other than the Ski Classics series include :

 Ski orienteering is an orienteering discipline recognized by the International Orienteering Federation . The World Ski Orienteering Championships is organized every odd year and includes sprint , middle and long distance competitions , and a Relay for both men and women . The World Cup is organized every even year . Junior World Ski Orienteering Championships and World Masters Ski Orienteering Championships are organized annually . 
 = = = Biathlon = = = 
 Biathlon combines cross @-@ country skiing and rifle shooting . Depending on the shooting performance , extra distance or time is added to the contestant 's total running distance / time . For each shooting round , the biathlete must hit five targets ; the skier receives a penalty for each missed target , which varies according to the competition rules ; in any given competition one of the following penalties would apply : 
 Skiing around a 150 @-@ metre ( 490 ft ) penalty loop , which , depending on conditions , takes 20 – 30 seconds for elite athletes to complete . 
 Adding one minute to the skier 's total time . 
 Use of an extra cartridge ( placed at the shooting range ) to hit the target ; only three such extras are available for each round , and a penalty loop must be made for each target left standing .

 Paralympic cross @-@ country skiing is an adaptation of cross @-@ country skiing for athletes with disabilities . Paralympic cross @-@ country skiing is one of two Nordic skiing disciplines in the Winter Paralympic Games ; the other is biathlon . Competition is governed by the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) . Paralympic cross @-@ country skiing includes standing events , sitting events ( for wheelchair users ) , and events for visually impaired athletes under the rules of the International Paralympic Committee . These are divided into several categories for people who are missing limbs , have amputations , are blind , or have any other physical disability , to continue their sport . The classifications are for : 
 Standing skiers with arm impairments , leg impairments or with both arm and leg impairments . 
 Sit @-@ Skiers , all with leg impairments , but with varying degrees of torso control . 
 Skiers with visual impairment including blindness , low visual acuity , and limited field of vision . 
 = = Technique and equipment = = 
 Cross @-@ country ski competitors employ one of two techniques , according to the event : classic and skating ( in freestyle races , where all techniques are allowed ) . <unk> combines the two techniques in one race . 
 Skis are lighter , narrower and designed to be faster than those used in recreational cross @-@ country skiing and made of composite materials . For classic events , typical ski lengths are between 195 to 210 centimetres , while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200 cm . Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical . Skis are waxed for speed and , in the case of classic skis , traction when striding forward . Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing . 
 Racing ski poles are usually made from carbon fiber and feature smaller , lighter baskets than recreational poles . Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing . 
 = = = Classic = = = 
 In classic cross @-@ country skiing the skis remain parallel , as the skier strides straight ahead . The undersides of the skis have a grip section in the middle treated with a special ski wax that provides friction when the foot is still , yet glides when the foot is in motion , while the rest of the ski bottom has a glide wax . Classic events occur on courses with tracks set by a grooming machine at precise intervals and with carefully planned curvature . Both poles may be used simultaneously ( " double @-@ poling " ) or with alternating foot and arm extended ( as with running or walking ) with the pole pushing on the side opposite of the extended , sliding ski . In classic skiing the alternating technique is used for the " diagonal stride " — the predominant classic sub @-@ technique . In diagonal @-@ stride legs move like in ordinary walking , but with longer and more powerful steps . Diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes . Uphill steps are shorter and more frequent . With double @-@ poling both poles are used simultaneously for thrust , which may be augmented with striding . Double @-@ poling is useful on level ground and on gentle downhill slopes . On steep uphills <unk> technique can be used . 
 = = = Skating = = = 
 While skate skiing , the skier provides propulsion on a firm snow surface by pushing alternating skis away from one another at an angle , in a manner similar to ice skating . Skis are waxed with a glide wax over their entire length , making them faster than classic skis . Freestyle events take place on smooth , wide specially groomed courses . With the skating technique double @-@ poling is usually employed with alternating skating strides or with every skate stride . The following table puts these poling sequences into order according to the speed achieved as a progression of " gears " . In the lowest gear ( rarely used in racing ) , one is poling on the side of the sliding ski , similar to diagonal stride . In the highest gear , the athlete skates without poles . There are equivalent terms in other languages ; for example in Norwegian , skating is likened to paddling or dancing , depending on the tempo . 
 The primary turns used for racing , are the parallel turn , which is used while descending and can provide braking , and the step turn , which is used for maintaining speed during descents or out of track on flats . The wedge turn ( or " snowplow turn " ) , is sometimes used for braking and turning . 
 = = <unk> training and development = = 
 Countries with cross @-@ country ski teams usually have a strategy for developing promising athletes and programs to encourage participation in the sport , starting at a young age . One example is Cross @-@ Country Ski Canada 's " Long @-@ Term Athlete Development " program . The program encompasses youth development , training , introduction to competition and improvement of promising athletes with an emphasis on " stamina ( endurance ) , strength , speed , skill and suppleness ( flexibility ) " . It covers age groups from toddlers to mature adults , who are able to enjoy and participate in the sport . Similarly , the USSA has an outline of " Cross Country Athlete <unk> " that has four phases beginning at 12 years old and under and addressing the 21 and older phase at the top . The program encompasses six " domains : " 
 Technical skills specific to cross @-@ country ski racing . 
 Physiological and motor skills addressing physical fitness , strength , power , and endurance . 
 Psychological and sociological skills , emphasizing sound relationships and the mental skills required for competition . 
 Training and competition performance , addressing goal @-@ directed training to achieve favorable competition results . 
 Equipment selection , use , and maintenance of the athlete 's skis , boots , bindings , wax , clothing , and poles necessary to success . 
 Education that eventually allows the athlete to become his or her own coach . 
 Ski training for the athlete depends on whether the desired specialty emphasizes endurance ( marathon ) or intensity ( mid @-@ distance events ) . The " intensity " theory of ski training uses stress to break down muscles and recovery and recovery to build them up stronger than before . In this theory , there are five levels of intensity for training : 
 Aerobic : Low @-@ intensity , aerobic training ( at 60 @-@ 70 % of an athlete 's maximum intensity ) should consume most of the training hours for endurance athletes . 
 Strength : Strength training improves flexibility and joint motion to minimize injury and to improve overall strength , not addressed by sport @-@ specific training . 
 Lactate Threshold : This level builds an efficient base speed by training the body to convert blood lactate into energy , rather than creating a sensation of tired muscles . 
 VO2 max : This level uses interval training to build the athlete 's VO2 max — volume of oxygen that the lungs pass into the musculature via the cardiovascular system . 
 Speed : This level of training addresses the athlete 's ability to sprint and is neuromuscular , essentially training the muscles to move quickly . 
 Athletes train for each level on a seasonal schedule designed for the targeted events : marathon or mid @-@ distance . Additional aspects of training address aerobic ( low @-@ intensity ) exercise — especially for endurance — and strength to improve joint flexibility and to minimize the risk of injury . Cross @-@ country ski training occurs throughout the year , including on dry land where athletes engage in roller skiing and ski striding to maintain ski @-@ specific muscle fitness . 
 = = Race management = = 
 In its " Organizing committee handbook , " the FIS covers aspects of race management , including the layout of the competition venue , organization of the events ( including scheduling , officiating , and awards ) , and addressing ancillary factors , such as the role of the media . National handbooks , such as the " USSA Cross @-@ Country Technical Handbook " and the " Cross Country Canada officials manual , " provide further guidance , sometimes specific to their venues . 
 An important aspect of race preparation is grooming the course to provide a surface for skate @-@ skiing and setting tracks for classic events . This takes into account snow physics , methods for packing snow and surface shaping , and the equipment used for these functions . Also key is the layout of grooming and track setting in the stadium with various formats for starts , finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits .

 In its " Cross @-@ country homologation manual , " the FIS recognizes that fans of the sport wish to follow it on television . With this in mind , the manual addresses how to design the race course and the stadium in a manner that not only enhances the experience of spectators , but of viewers , as well — not just to show the athletes in action , but to show the ways in which fans enjoy the action . The manual includes considerations of : 
 Course design criteria 
 Requirements for different race formats 
 Course layouts 
 Courses for skiers with disabilities 
 Stadium layout 
 <unk> rooms with ski test areas 
 Warm up course 
 A course is expected to test the skier 's technical and physical abilities , to be laid out in a manner that takes advantage of the natural terrain , and to provide smooth transitions among uphills , <unk> and " undulating " terrain — distributed approximately evenly among the three . The manual advocates that courses present a variety of uphills , varying in lengths and gradients between 6 % and 12 % , which are arrayed efficiently within the venue . It cites two types of stadium , the horseshoe ( preferred for television ) and the " ski in , ski out " layout . It emphasizes the importance of accommodating television coverage at the start , finish , and exchange zones for equipment or relays . In addition , television coverage requires a variety of facilities to support the activities of the press .

 As with other sports , some competitors in cross @-@ country skiing have chosen to enhance their performance through doping . Anti @-@ doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti , Finland revealed that Jari <unk> , Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland 's gold @-@ medal relay team , Mika <unk> and Harri <unk> , and two female skiers tested positive for <unk> starch ( HES ) , a blood plasma expander usually used to cover up the use of erythropoietin ( EPO ) . EPO boosts the oxygen @-@ carrying capability of hemoglobin . In addition , the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport . At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games , Austrian cross @-@ country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO . In 2007 , The International Olympic Committee banned <unk> , Wolfgang <unk> and Wolfgang <unk> , and the cross @-@ country skiers , Martin Tauber , Jürgen Pinter , Johannes Eder , Roland <unk> and Christian Hoffmann , from all future Olympic competition .

 = Homotopy groups of spheres = 
 In the mathematical field of algebraic topology , the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other . They are examples of topological invariants , which reflect , in algebraic terms , the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces , forgetting about their precise geometry . Unlike homology groups , which are also topological invariants , the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute . 
 The n @-@ dimensional unit sphere — called the n @-@ sphere for brevity , and denoted as Sn — generalizes the familiar circle ( S1 ) and the ordinary sphere ( S2 ) . The n @-@ sphere may be defined geometrically as the set of points in a Euclidean space of dimension n + 1 located at a unit distance from the origin . The i @-@ th homotopy group πi ( Sn ) summarizes the different ways in which the i @-@ dimensional sphere Si can be mapped continuously into the n @-@ dimensional sphere Sn . This summary does not distinguish between two mappings if one can be continuously deformed to the other ; thus , only equivalence classes of mappings are summarized . An " addition " operation defined on these equivalence classes makes the set of equivalence classes into an abelian group . 
 The problem of determining πi ( Sn ) falls into three regimes , depending on whether i is less than , equal to , or greater than n . For 0 < i < n , any mapping from Si to Sn is homotopic ( i.e. , continuously deformable ) to a constant mapping , i.e. , a mapping that maps all of Si to a single point of Sn . When i = n , every map from Sn to itself has a degree that measures how many times the sphere is wrapped around itself . This degree identifies πn ( Sn ) with the group of integers under addition . For example , every point on a circle can be mapped continuously onto a point of another circle ; as the first point is moved around the first circle , the second point may cycle several times around the second circle , depending on the particular mapping . However , the most interesting and surprising results occur when i > n . The first such surprise was the discovery of a mapping called the Hopf fibration , which wraps the 3 @-@ sphere S3 around the usual sphere S2 in a non @-@ trivial fashion , and so is not equivalent to a one @-@ point mapping . 
 The question of computing the homotopy group πn + k ( Sn ) for positive k turned out to be a central question in algebraic topology that has contributed to development of many of its fundamental techniques and has served as a stimulating focus of research . One of the main discoveries is that the homotopy groups πn + k ( Sn ) are independent of n for n ≥ k + 2 . These are called the stable homotopy groups of spheres and have been computed for values of k up to 64 . The stable homotopy groups form the coefficient ring of an extraordinary cohomology theory , called stable <unk> theory . The unstable homotopy groups ( for n < k + 2 ) are more erratic ; nevertheless , they have been tabulated for k < 20 . Most modern computations use spectral sequences , a technique first applied to homotopy groups of spheres by Jean @-@ Pierre Serre . Several important patterns have been established , yet much remains unknown and unexplained . 
 = = Background = = 
 The study of homotopy groups of spheres builds on a great deal of background material , here briefly reviewed . Algebraic topology provides the larger context , itself built on topology and abstract algebra , with homotopy groups as a basic example . 
 = = = n @-@ sphere = = = 
 An ordinary sphere in three @-@ dimensional space — the surface , not the solid ball — is just one example of what a sphere means in topology . Geometry defines a sphere rigidly , as a shape . Here are some alternatives . 
 Implicit surface : x02 + x12 + <unk> 
 = 1 
 This is the set of points in 3 @-@ dimensional Euclidean space found exactly one unit away from the origin . It is called the 2 @-@ sphere , S2 , for reasons given below . The same idea applies for any dimension n ; the equation x02 + x12 + ⋯ + <unk> = 
 1 produces the n @-@ sphere as a geometric object in ( n + 1 ) -dimensional space . For example , the 1 @-@ sphere S1 is a circle . 
 Disk with collapsed rim : written in topology as D2 / S1 
 This construction moves from geometry to pure topology . The disk D2 is the region contained by a circle , described by the inequality x02 + x12 ≤ 1 , and its rim ( or " boundary " ) is the circle S1 , described by the equality x02 + x12 
 = 1 . If a balloon is punctured and spread flat it produces a disk ; this construction repairs the puncture , like pulling a drawstring . The slash , pronounced " modulo " , means to take the topological space on the left ( the disk ) and in it join together as one all the points on the right ( the circle ) . The region is 2 @-@ dimensional , which is why topology calls the resulting topological space a 2 @-@ sphere . Generalized , <unk> / Sn − 1 produces Sn . For example , D1 is a line segment , and the construction joins its ends to make a circle . An equivalent description is that the boundary of an n @-@ dimensional disk is glued to a point , producing a CW complex . 
 Suspension of equator : written in topology as <unk> 
 This construction , though simple , is of great theoretical importance . Take the circle S1 to be the equator , and sweep each point on it to one point above ( the North Pole ) , producing the northern hemisphere , and to one point below ( the South Pole ) , producing the southern hemisphere . For each positive integer n , the n @-@ sphere x02 + x12 + ⋯ + <unk> = 
 1 has as equator the ( n − 1 ) <unk> x02 + x12 + ⋯ + xn − 12 = 1 , and the suspension <unk> − 1 produces Sn . 
 Some theory requires selecting a fixed point on the sphere , calling the pair ( sphere , point ) a pointed sphere . For some spaces the choice matters , but for a sphere all points are equivalent so the choice is a matter of convenience . The point ( 1 , 0 , 0 , … , 0 ) , which is on the equator of all the spheres , works well for geometric spheres ; the ( collapsed ) rim of the disk is another obvious choice . 
 = = = Homotopy group = = = 
 The distinguishing feature of a topological space is its continuity structure , formalized in terms of open sets or neighborhoods . A continuous map is a function between spaces that preserves continuity . A homotopy is a continuous path between continuous maps ; two maps connected by a homotopy are said to be homotopic . The idea common to all these concepts is to discard variations that do not affect outcomes of interest . An important practical example is the residue theorem of complex analysis , where " closed curves " are continuous maps from the circle into the complex plane , and where two closed curves produce the same integral result if they are homotopic in the topological space consisting of the plane minus the points of singularity . 
 The first homotopy group , or fundamental group , π1 ( X ) of a ( path connected ) topological space X thus begins with continuous maps from a pointed circle ( S1 , s ) to the pointed space ( X , x ) , where maps from one pair to another map s into x . These maps ( or equivalently , closed curves ) are grouped together into equivalence classes based on homotopy ( keeping the " base point " x fixed ) , so that two maps are in the same class if they are homotopic . Just as one point is distinguished , so one class is distinguished : all maps ( or curves ) homotopic to the constant map S1 ↦ x are called null homotopic . The classes become an abstract algebraic group with the introduction of addition , defined via an " equator pinch " . This pinch maps the equator of a pointed sphere ( here a circle ) to the distinguished point , producing a " bouquet of spheres " — two pointed spheres joined at their distinguished point . The two maps to be added map the upper and lower spheres separately , agreeing on the distinguished point , and composition with the pinch gives the sum map . 
 More generally , the i @-@ th homotopy group , πi ( X ) begins with the pointed i @-@ sphere ( Si , s ) , and otherwise follows the same procedure . The null homotopic class acts as the identity of the group addition , and for X equal to Sn ( for positive n ) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated . If for some i all maps are null homotopic , then the group πi consists of one element , and is called the trivial group . 
 A continuous map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups . In particular , if the map is a continuous bijection ( a homeomorphism ) , so that the two spaces have the same topology , then their i @-@ th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i . However , the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point ( as does a Euclidean space of any dimension ) , and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle , so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces . Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate , it can also make certain computations easier . 
 = = Low @-@ dimensional examples = = 
 The low @-@ dimensional examples of homotopy groups of spheres provide a sense of the subject , because these special cases can be visualized in ordinary 3 @-@ dimensional space ( Hatcher 2002 ) . However , such visualizations are not mathematical proofs , and do not capture the possible complexity of maps between spheres . 
 = = = π1 ( S1 ) = 
 Z = = = 
 The simplest case concerns the ways that a circle ( 1 @-@ sphere ) can be wrapped around another circle . This can be visualized by wrapping a rubber band around one 's finger : it can be wrapped once , twice , three times and so on . The wrapping can be in either of two directions , and wrappings in opposite directions will cancel out after a deformation . The homotopy group π1 ( S1 ) is therefore an infinite cyclic group , and is isomorphic to the group Z of integers under addition : a homotopy class is identified with an integer by counting the number of times a mapping in the homotopy class wraps around the circle . This integer can also be thought of as the winding number of a loop around the origin in the plane . 
 The identification ( a group isomorphism ) of the homotopy group with the integers is often written as an equality : thus π1 ( S1 ) = Z. 
 = = = π2 ( S2 ) = 
 Z = = = 
 <unk> from a 2 @-@ sphere to a 2 @-@ sphere can be visualized as wrapping a plastic bag around a ball and then sealing it . The sealed bag is topologically equivalent to a 2 @-@ sphere , as is the surface of the ball . The bag can be wrapped more than once by twisting it and wrapping it back over the ball . ( There is no requirement for the continuous map to be injective and so the bag is allowed to pass through itself . ) The twist can be in one of two directions and opposite twists can cancel out by deformation . The total number of twists after cancellation is an integer , called the degree of the mapping . As in the case mappings from the circle to the circle , this degree identifies the homotopy group with the group of integers , Z. 
 These two results generalize : for all n > 0 , πn ( Sn ) = Z ( see below ) . 
 = = = π1 ( S2 ) = 
 0 = = = 
 Any continuous mapping from a circle to an ordinary sphere can be continuously deformed to a one @-@ point mapping , and so its homotopy class is trivial . One way to visualize this is to imagine a rubber @-@ band wrapped around a frictionless ball : the band can always be slid off the ball . The homotopy group is therefore a trivial group , with only one element , the identity element , and so it can be identified with the subgroup of Z consisting only of the number zero . This group is often denoted by 0 . 
 This result <unk> to higher dimensions . All mappings from a lower @-@ dimensional sphere into a sphere of higher dimension are similarly trivial : if i < n , then πi ( Sn ) = 0 . 
 = = = π2 ( S1 ) = 
 0 = = = 
 All the interesting cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher @-@ dimensional sphere onto one of lower dimension . Unfortunately , the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting : there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle . Hence , π2 ( S1 ) = 0 . This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible ( it has the homotopy type of a point ) . In addition , because S2 is simply connected , by the lifting criterion , any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the <unk> descends to the downstairs space . 
 = = = π3 ( S2 ) = 
 Z = = = 
 The first nontrivial example with i > n concerns mappings from the 3 @-@ sphere to the ordinary 2 @-@ sphere , and was discovered by Heinz Hopf , who constructed a nontrivial map from S3 to S2 , now known as the Hopf fibration ( Hopf 1931 ) . This map generates the homotopy group π3 ( S2 ) = Z. 
 = = History = = 
 In the late 19th century Camille Jordan introduced the notion of homotopy and used the notion of a homotopy group , without using the language of group theory ( O 'Connor & Robertson 2001 ) . A more rigorous approach was adopted by Henri Poincaré in his 1895 set of papers Analysis <unk> where the related concepts of homology and the fundamental group were also introduced ( O 'Connor & Robertson 1996 ) . 
 Higher homotopy groups were first defined by Eduard Čech in 1932 ( Čech 1932 , p . 203 ) . ( His first paper was withdrawn on the advice of Pavel Sergeyevich Alexandrov and Heinz Hopf , on the grounds that the groups were commutative so could not be the right generalizations of the fundamental group . ) Witold Hurewicz is also credited with the introduction of homotopy groups in his 1935 paper and also for the Hurewicz theorem which can be used to calculate some of the groups ( May 1999a ) . An important method for calculating the various groups is the concept of stable algebraic topology , which finds properties that are independent of the dimensions . Typically these only hold for larger dimensions . The first such result was Hans Freudenthal 's suspension theorem , published in 1937 . Stable algebraic topology flourished between 1945 and 1966 with many important results ( May 1999a ) . In 1953 George W. Whitehead showed that there is a metastable range for the homotopy groups of spheres . Jean @-@ Pierre Serre used spectral sequences to show that most of these groups are finite , the exceptions being πn ( Sn ) and <unk> − 1 ( <unk> ) . Others who worked in this area included José <unk> , Hiroshi Toda , Frank Adams and J. Peter May . The stable homotopy groups πn + k ( Sn ) are known for k up to 64 , and , as of 2007 , unknown for larger k ( Hatcher 2002 , Stable homotopy groups , pp. 385 – 393 ) . 
 = = General theory = = 
 As noted already , when i is less than n , πi ( Sn ) 
 = 0 , the trivial group ( Hatcher 2002 ) . The reason is that a continuous mapping from an i @-@ sphere to an n @-@ sphere with i < n can always be deformed so that it is not surjective . Consequently , its image is contained in Sn with a point removed ; this is a contractible space , and any mapping to such a space can be deformed into a one @-@ point mapping . 
 The case i = 
 n has also been noted already , and is an easy consequence of the Hurewicz theorem : this theorem links homotopy groups with homology groups , which are generally easier to calculate ; in particular , it shows that for a simply @-@ connected space X , the first nonzero homotopy group πk ( X ) , with k > 0 , is isomorphic to the first nonzero homology group Hk ( X ) . For the n @-@ sphere , this immediately implies that for n > 0 , πn ( Sn ) 
 = Hn ( Sn ) = 
 Z. 
 The homology groups Hi ( Sn ) , with i > n , are all trivial . It therefore came as a great surprise historically that the corresponding homotopy groups are not trivial in general . This is the case that is of real importance : the higher homotopy groups πi ( Sn ) , for i > n , are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute , and the effort to compute them has generated a significant amount of new mathematics . 
 = = = Table = = = 
 The following table gives an idea of the complexity of the higher homotopy groups even for spheres of dimension 8 or less . In this table , the entries are either the trivial group 0 , the infinite cyclic group Z , finite cyclic groups of order n ( written as Zn ) , or direct products of such groups ( written , for example , as Z24 × Z3 or Z22 
 = Z2 × Z2 ) . Extended tables of homotopy groups of spheres are given at the end of the article . 
 The first two rows of this table are straightforward . The homotopy groups πi ( S0 ) of the 0 @-@ dimensional sphere are trivial for i > 0 , because any base point preserving map from an i @-@ sphere to a 0 @-@ sphere is a one @-@ point mapping . Similarly , the homotopy groups πi ( S1 ) of the 1 @-@ sphere are trivial for i > 1 , because the universal covering space , R , which has the same higher homotopy groups , is contractible . 
 Beyond these two rows , the higher homotopy groups ( i > n ) appear to be chaotic , but in fact there are many patterns , some obvious and some very subtle . 
 The groups below the jagged black line are constant along the diagonals ( as indicated by the red , green and blue coloring ) . 
 Most of the groups are finite . The only unstable groups which are not are either on the main diagonal or immediately above the jagged line ( highlighted in yellow ) . 
 The third and fourth rows of the table are the same starting in the third column ( i.e. , πi ( S2 ) = 
 πi ( S3 ) for i ≥ 3 ) . This isomorphism is induced by the Hopf fibration S3 → S2 . 
 These patterns follow from many different theoretical results . 
 = = = Stable and unstable groups = = = 
 The fact that the groups below the jagged line in the table above are constant along the diagonals is explained by the suspension theorem of Hans Freudenthal , which implies that the suspension homomorphism from πn + k ( Sn ) to πn + k + 1 ( Sn + 1 ) is an isomorphism for n > k + 1 . The groups πn + k ( Sn ) with n > k + 1 are called the stable homotopy groups of spheres , and are denoted <unk> : they are finite abelian groups for k ≠ 0 , and have been computed in numerous cases , although the general pattern is still elusive . ( Hatcher 2002 , Stable homotopy groups , pp. 385 – 393 ) . For n ≤ k + 1 , the groups are called the unstable homotopy groups of spheres . 
 = = = Hopf fibrations = = = 
 The classical Hopf fibration is a fiber bundle : 
 <formula> 
 The general theory of fiber bundles F → E → B shows that there is a long exact sequence of homotopy groups 
 <formula> 
 For this specific bundle , each group homomorphism πi ( S1 ) → πi ( S3 ) , induced by the inclusion S1 → S3 , maps all of πi ( S1 ) to zero , since the lower @-@ dimensional sphere S1 can be deformed to a point inside the higher @-@ dimensional one S3 . This corresponds to the vanishing of π1 ( S3 ) . Thus the long exact sequence breaks into short exact sequences , 
 <formula> 
 Since Sn + 1 is a suspension of Sn , these sequences are split by the suspension homomorphism πi − 1 ( S1 ) → πi ( S2 ) , giving isomorphisms 
 <formula> 
 Since πi − 1 ( S1 ) vanishes for i at least 3 , the first row shows that πi ( S2 ) and πi ( S3 ) are isomorphic whenever i is at least 3 , as observed above . 
 The Hopf fibration may be constructed as follows : pairs of complex numbers ( z0 , z1 ) with | z0 | 2 + | z1 | 2 
 = 1 form a 3 @-@ sphere , and their ratios z0 / z1 cover the complex plane plus infinity , a 2 @-@ sphere . The Hopf map S3 → S2 sends any such pair to its ratio . 
 Similarly , there are generalized Hopf fibrations 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 constructed using pairs of quaternions or <unk> instead of complex numbers ( Hatcher 2002 ) . Here , too , π3 ( S7 ) and <unk> ( S15 ) are zero . Thus the long exact sequences again break into families of split short exact sequences , implying two families of relations . 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 The three fibrations have base space Sn with n = 
 2m , for m 
 = 1 , 2 , 3 . A fibration does exist for S1 ( m = 
 0 ) , but not for S16 ( m = 4 ) and beyond . Although generalizations of the relations to S16 are often true , they sometimes fail ; for example , 
 <formula> 
 Thus there can be no fibration 
 <formula> 
 the first non @-@ trivial case of the Hopf invariant one problem , because such a fibration would imply that the failed relation is true . 
 = = = Framed cobordism = = = 
 Homotopy groups of spheres are closely related to cobordism classes of manifolds . In 1938 Lev Pontryagin established an isomorphism between the homotopy group πn + k ( Sn ) and the group <unk> ( Sn + k ) of cobordism classes of differentiable k @-@ submanifolds of Sn + k which are <unk> ' , i.e. have a trivialized normal bundle . Every map ƒ : Sn + k → Sn is homotopic to a differentiable map with <formula> a framed k @-@ dimensional submanifold . For example , πn ( Sn ) = Z is the cobordism group of framed 0 @-@ dimensional submanifolds of Sn , computed by the algebraic sum of their points , corresponding to the degree of maps <formula> . The projection of the Hopf fibration <formula> represents a generator of π3 ( S2 ) = <unk> ( S3 ) = Z which corresponds to the framed 1 @-@ dimensional submanifold of S3 defined by the standard embedding <formula> with a nonstandard trivialization of the normal 2 @-@ plane bundle . Until the advent of more sophisticated algebraic methods in the early 1950s ( Serre ) the Pontrjagin isomorphism was the main tool for computing the homotopy groups of spheres . In 1954 the Pontrjagin isomorphism was generalized by René Thom to an isomorphism expressing other groups of cobordism classes ( e.g. of all manifolds ) as homotopy groups of spaces and spectra . In more recent work the argument is usually reversed , with cobordism groups computed in terms of homotopy groups ( Scorpan 2005 ) . 
 = = = Finiteness and torsion = = = 
 In 1951 , Jean @-@ Pierre Serre showed that homotopy groups of spheres are all finite except for those of the form πn ( Sn ) or <unk> − 1 ( <unk> ) ( for positive n ) , when the group is the product of the infinite cyclic group with a finite abelian group ( Serre 1951 ) . In particular the homotopy groups are determined by their p @-@ components for all primes p . The 2 @-@ components are hardest to calculate , and in several ways behave differently from the p @-@ components for odd primes . 
 In the same paper , Serre found the first place that p @-@ torsion occurs in the homotopy groups of n dimensional spheres , by showing that πn + k ( Sn ) has no p @-@ torsion if k < 2p − 3 , and has a unique subgroup of order p if n ≥ 3 and k 
 = 2p − 3 . The case of 2 @-@ dimensional spheres is slightly different : the first p @-@ torsion occurs for k = 
 2p − 3 + 1 . In the case of odd torsion there are more precise results ; in this case there is a big difference between odd and even dimensional spheres . If p is an odd prime and n = 2i + 1 , then elements of the p @-@ component of πn + k ( Sn ) have order at most pi ( Cohen , Moore & <unk> 1979 ) . This is in some sense the best possible result , as these groups are known to have elements of this order for some values of k ( Ravenel 2003 , p . 4 ) . Furthermore , the stable range can be extended in this case : if n is odd then the double suspension from πk ( Sn ) to πk + 2 ( Sn + 2 ) is an isomorphism of p @-@ components if k < p ( n + 1 ) − 3 , and an <unk> if equality holds ( Serre 1952 ) . The p @-@ torsion of the intermediate group πk + 1 ( Sn + 1 ) can be strictly larger . 
 The results above about odd torsion only hold for odd @-@ dimensional spheres : for even @-@ dimensional spheres , the James fibration gives the torsion at odd primes p in terms of that of odd @-@ dimensional spheres , 
 <formula> 
 ( where ( p ) means take the p @-@ component ) ( Ravenel 2003 , p . 25 ) . This exact sequence is similar to the ones coming from the Hopf fibration ; the difference is that it works for all even @-@ dimensional spheres , albeit at the expense of ignoring 2 @-@ torsion . Combining the results for odd and even dimensional spheres shows that much of the odd torsion of unstable homotopy groups is determined by the odd torsion of the stable homotopy groups . 
 For stable homotopy groups there are more precise results about p @-@ torsion . For example , if k < 2p ( p − 1 ) − 2 for a prime p then the p @-@ primary component of the stable homotopy group <unk> vanishes unless k + 1 is divisible by 2 ( p − 1 ) , in which case it is cyclic of order p ( <unk> 2001 ) . 
 = = = The J @-@ homomorphism = = = 
 An important subgroup of πn + k ( Sn ) , for k ≥ 2 , is the image of the J @-@ homomorphism J : πk ( SO ( n ) ) → πn + k ( Sn ) , where SO ( n ) denotes the special orthogonal group ( Adams 1966 ) . In the stable range n ≥ k + 2 , the homotopy groups πk ( SO ( n ) ) only depend on k modulo 8 . This period 8 pattern is known as Bott periodicity , and it is reflected in the stable homotopy groups of spheres via the image of the J @-@ homomorphism which is : 
 a cyclic group of order 2 if k is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 8 ; 
 trivial if k is congruent to 2 , 4 , 5 , or 6 modulo 8 ; and 
 a cyclic group of order equal to the denominator of <unk> / 4n , where <unk> is a Bernoulli number , if k ≡ 3 ( mod 4 ) . 
 This last case accounts for the elements of unusually large finite order in πn + k ( Sn ) for such values of k . For example , the stable groups πn + 11 ( Sn ) have a cyclic subgroup of order 504 , the denominator of B6 / 12 
 = 1 ⁄ 504 . 
 The stable homotopy groups of spheres are the direct sum of the image of the J @-@ homomorphism , and the kernel of the Adams e @-@ invariant , a homomorphism from these groups to Q / Z. Roughly speaking , the image of the J @-@ homomorphism is the subgroup of " well understood " or " easy " elements of the stable homotopy groups . These well understood elements account for most elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres in small dimensions . The quotient of πnS by the image of the J @-@ homomorphism is considered to be the " hard " part of the stable homotopy groups of spheres ( Adams 1966 ) . ( Adams also introduced certain order 2 elements <unk> of πnS for n = 
 1 or 2 mod 8 , and these are also considered to be " well understood " . ) Tables of homotopy groups of spheres sometimes omit the " easy " part Im ( J ) to save space . 
 = = = Ring structure = = = 
 The direct sum 
 <formula> 
 of the stable homotopy groups of spheres is a <unk> graded ring , where multiplication is given by composition of representing maps , and any element of non @-@ zero degree is <unk> ( Nishida 1973 ) ; the <unk> theorem on complex cobordism implies Nishida 's theorem . 
 Example : If η is the generator of <unk> ( of order 2 ) , then η2 is nonzero and generates <unk> , and <unk> is nonzero and 12 times a generator of <unk> , while η4 is zero because the group <unk> is trivial . 
 If f and g and h are elements of π ∗ S with f ⋅ g 
 = 0 and g ⋅ h = 
 0 , there is a Toda bracket 〈 f , g , h 〉 of these elements ( Toda 1962 ) . The Toda bracket is not quite an element of a stable homotopy group , because it is only defined up to addition of products of certain other elements . Hiroshi Toda used the composition product and Toda brackets to label many of the elements of homotopy groups . There are also higher Toda brackets of several elements , defined when suitable lower Toda brackets vanish . This parallels the theory of Massey products in cohomology . Every element of the stable homotopy groups of spheres can be expressed using composition products and higher Toda brackets in terms of certain well known elements , called Hopf elements ( Cohen 1968 ) .

 If X is any finite simplicial complex with finite fundamental group , in particular if X is a sphere of dimension at least 2 , then its homotopy groups are all finitely generated abelian groups . To compute these groups , they are often factored into their p @-@ components for each prime p , and calculating each of these p @-@ groups separately . The first few homotopy groups of spheres can be computed using ad hoc variations of the ideas above ; beyond this point , most methods for computing homotopy groups of spheres are based on spectral sequences ( Ravenel 2003 ) . This is usually done by constructing suitable fibrations and taking the associated long exact sequences of homotopy groups ; spectral sequences are a systematic way of organizing the complicated information that this process generates . 
 " The method of killing homotopy groups " , due to Cartan and Serre ( 1952a , 1952b ) involves repeatedly using the Hurewicz theorem to compute the first non @-@ trivial homotopy group and then killing ( eliminating ) it with a fibration involving an Eilenberg @-@ MacLane space . In principle this gives an effective algorithm for computing all homotopy groups of any finite simply connected simplicial complex , but in practice it is too cumbersome to use for computing anything other than the first few nontrivial homotopy groups as the simplicial complex becomes much more complicated every time one kills a homotopy group . 
 The Serre spectral sequence was used by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously . He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1 , so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its ( n − 1 ) <unk> repeated loop space , which is equal to the first homology group of the ( n − 1 ) <unk> loop space by the Hurewicz theorem . This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces . The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space , so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces . The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non @-@ zero differentials , which are hard to control , and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups . Consequently , it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non @-@ zero differentials , which give more information . 
 The <unk> spectral sequence can be used to compute many homotopy groups of spheres ; it is based on some fibrations used by Toda in his calculations of homotopy groups ( Mahowald 2001 , Toda 1962 ) . 
 The classical Adams spectral sequence has E2 term given by the <unk> groups <unk> ( p ) ∗ , ∗ ( Zp , Zp ) over the mod p Steenrod algebra A ( p ) , and converges to something closely related to the p @-@ component of the stable homotopy groups . The initial terms of the Adams spectral sequence are themselves quite hard to compute : this is sometimes done using an auxiliary spectral sequence called the May spectral sequence ( Ravenel 2003 , pp. 67 – 74 ) . 
 The Adams – Novikov spectral sequence is a more powerful version of the Adams spectral sequence replacing ordinary cohomology mod p with a generalized cohomology theory , such as complex cobordism or , more usually , a piece of it called Brown – Peterson cohomology . The initial term is again quite hard to calculate ; to do this one can use the chromatic spectral sequence ( Ravenel 2003 , Chapter 5 ) . 
 A variation of this last approach uses a backwards version of the Adams – Novikov spectral sequence for Brown – Peterson cohomology : the limit is known , and the initial terms involve unknown stable homotopy groups of spheres that one is trying to find . Kochman ( 1990 ) used this approach to calculate the 2 @-@ components of the first 64 stable homotopy groups ; unfortunately there was a mistake in his calculations for the 54th stem and beyond , which was corrected by Kochman & Mahowald ( 1995 ) . 
 The computation of the homotopy groups of S2 has been reduced to a combinatorial group theory question . <unk> et al . ( 2006 ) identify these homotopy groups as certain quotients of the Brunnian braid groups of S2 . Under this correspondence , every nontrivial element in πn ( S2 ) for n > 2 may be represented by a Brunnian braid over S2 that is not Brunnian over the disk D2 . For example , the Hopf map S3 → S2 corresponds to the Borromean rings . 
 = = Applications = = 
 The winding number ( corresponding to an integer of π1 ( S1 ) 
 = Z ) can be used to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra , which states that every non @-@ constant complex polynomial has a zero . 
 The fact that πn − 1 ( Sn − 1 ) = 
 Z implies the Brouwer fixed point theorem that every continuous map from the n @-@ dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point . 
 The stable homotopy groups of spheres are important in singularity theory , which studies the structure of singular points of smooth maps or algebraic varieties . Such singularities arise as critical points of smooth maps from Rm to Rn . The geometry near a critical point of such a map can be described by an element of <unk> − 1 ( Sn − 1 ) , by considering the way in which a small m − 1 sphere around the critical point maps into a topological n − 1 sphere around the critical value . 
 The fact that the third stable homotopy group of spheres is cyclic of order 24 , first proved by Vladimir Rokhlin , implies Rokhlin 's theorem that the signature of a compact smooth spin 4 @-@ manifold is divisible by 16 ( Scorpan 2005 ) . 
 Stable homotopy groups of spheres are used to describe the group <unk> of h @-@ cobordism classes of oriented homotopy n @-@ spheres ( for n ≠ 4 , this is the group of smooth structures on n @-@ spheres , up to orientation @-@ preserving <unk> ; the non @-@ trivial elements of this group are represented by exotic spheres ) . More precisely , there is an injective map 
 <formula> 
 where <unk> + 1 is the cyclic subgroup represented by homotopy spheres that bound a parallelizable manifold , πnS is the nth stable homotopy group of spheres , and J is the image of the J @-@ homomorphism . This is an isomorphism unless n is of the form 2k − 2 , in which case the image has index 1 or 2 ( Kervaire & <unk> 1963 ) . 
 The groups <unk> above , and therefore the stable homotopy groups of spheres , are used in the classification of possible smooth structures on a topological or piecewise linear manifold ( Scorpan 2005 ) . 
 The Kervaire invariant problem , about the existence of manifolds of Kervaire invariant 1 in dimensions 2k − 2 can be reduced to a question about stable homotopy groups of spheres . For example , knowledge of stable homotopy groups of degree up to 48 has been used to settle the Kervaire invariant problem in dimension 26 − 2 = 62 ( Barratt , Jones & Mahowald 1984 ) . ( This was the smallest value of k for which the question was open at the time . ) 
 The Barratt – Priddy theorem says that the stable homotopy groups of the spheres can be expressed in terms of the plus construction applied to the classifying space of the symmetric group , leading to an identification of K @-@ theory of the field with one element with stable homotopy groups ( <unk> 2006 ) . 
 = = Table of homotopy groups = = 
 Tables of homotopy groups of spheres are most conveniently organized by showing πn + k ( Sn ) . 
 The following table shows many of the groups πn + k ( Sn ) . ( These tables are based on the table of homotopy groups of spheres in Toda ( 1962 ) . ) The stable homotopy groups are highlighted in blue , the unstable ones in red . Each homotopy group is the product of the cyclic groups of the orders given in the table , using the following conventions : 
 The entry " ⋅ " denotes the trivial group . 
 Where the entry is an integer , m , the homotopy group is the cyclic group of that order ( generally written <unk> ) . 
 Where the entry is ∞ , the homotopy group is the infinite cyclic group , Z. 
 Where entry is a product , the homotopy group is the cartesian product ( equivalently , direct sum ) of the cyclic groups of those orders . Powers indicate repeated products . ( Note that when a and b have no common factor , Za × <unk> is isomorphic to Zab . ) 
 Example : <unk> ( S10 ) 
 = <unk> + 10 ( S10 ) = 
 Z × Z2 × Z2 × Z2 , which is denoted by ∞ ⋅ 23 in the table . 
 = = Table of stable homotopy groups = = 
 The stable homotopy groups πk are the product of cyclic groups of the infinite or prime power orders shown in the table . ( For largely historical reasons , stable homotopy groups are usually given as products of cyclic groups of prime power order , while tables of unstable homotopy groups often give them as products of the smallest number of cyclic groups . ) The main complexity is in the 2- , 3- , and 5 @-@ components : for p > 5 , the p @-@ components in the range of the table are accounted for by the J @-@ homomorphism and are cyclic of order p if 2 ( p − 1 ) divides k + 1 and 0 otherwise ( <unk> 2001 ) . ( The 2 @-@ components can be found in Kochman ( 1990 ) , though there were some errors for k ≥ 54 that were corrected by Kochman & Mahowald ( 1995 ) , and the 3- and 5 @-@ components in Ravenel ( 2003 ) . ) The mod 8 behavior of the table comes from Bott periodicity via the J @-@ homomorphism , whose image is underlined .

 " Missing My Baby " is a song released by American singer Selena on her third studio album Entre a Mi Mundo ( 1992 ) . It was composed by A.B. Quintanilla — her brother and principal record producer , whose intention was to showcase Selena 's diverse musical abilities . Selena included it on the album to help her cross over into the English @-@ speaking market . Critics praised her emotive enunciation in the song . After Selena was murdered in 1995 , a posthumous music video made for VH1 was released to promote the triple box @-@ set Anthology ( 1998 ) . 
 " Missing My Baby " is a mid @-@ tempo R & B ballad influenced by urban and soul music . The lyrics describe the love felt by the narrator , who reminisces of rhapsodic events she has shared with her lover . In some parts of the song , the narrator experiences loneliness and anguish because of the absence of her boyfriend . Although never intended to be released as a single , the track peaked at number 22 on the US Rhythmic Top 40 chart in 1995 . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 " Missing My Baby " was written by Selena 's brother and the song 's principal record producer A.B. Quintanilla . It was created for Selena 's 1992 album Entre a Mi Mundo , to showcase her diverse musical abilities and to add to the album 's variety of musical styles , which include Mexican pop and traditional Mexican songs , whereas " Missing My Baby " is in the style of contemporary R & B. 
 After the release of Selena 's full @-@ length Spanish albums Selena ( 1989 ) and Ven Conmigo ( 1990 ) , which included Tejano and other Mexican pop styles , she decided that her next recording would feature an English @-@ language song . She believed that such a song would convince EMI Records ' chairman Charles Koppelman that she was ready to release a crossover album . EMI had wanted her to acquire a larger fan base before launching her crossover career . In spite of this , Selena included the song on Entre a Mi Mundo . 
 Quintanilla III wrote " Missing My Baby " in a week , and three weeks later , in late 1991 , it was recorded at Sun Valley , Los Angeles . EMI Latin wanted R & B duo Full Force to perform a remixed version of the recording . Quintanilla III and Selena met with the group at their Brooklyn recording studio , and Full Force agreed to add backing vocals , which they recorded in two days . EMI Latin , the record label Selena belongs to , chose Full Force 's version of " Missing My Baby " instead of Selena 's solo version of the song . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Missing My Baby " is a mid @-@ tempo R & B ballad with influences of urban and soul music . It is in the key of B minor , at 144 beats per minute in common time . The recording incorporates melisma , with sung poetry during the downtempo part of the song . The melody is accompanied by backing vocals , and instrumentation is provided by an electric piano , drums , a keyboard , a synthesizer and strings . Contemporary music critics praised Selena 's emotive enunciation , which emphasized the song 's title and central theme . R & B duo Full Force were the backing vocalists for the original and remix versions of " Missing My Baby " . 
 J.R. Reynolds , formerly of Billboard , called " Missing My Baby " a " dreamy ballad " with an " R & B @-@ styled melody under Selena 's pop vocals " . Ramiro Burr of the Austin American @-@ Statesman described it as a soul ballad . Jerry Johnston of the Deseret News thought that Selena displayed a " Leslie Gore [ sic ] baby @-@ voice " in " Missing My Baby " and that she " displays a wonderful suppleness in her voice " . The Virginian @-@ Pilot said that the song was built on hooks that recall Diana Ross 's " Missing You " , which is a tribute to Marvin Gaye , and the Beach Boys ' " Good to My Baby " . 
 The song begins with a drum solo before the other instruments enter to form the musical foundation . Selena sings to her absent lover about how much she misses him , saying that he is " always on [ her ] mind " and that she feels lonely when he is not with her . Three times she sings , " I often think of the happy times we spent together / And I just can 't wait to tell you that I love you " . In the chorus , she sings of wanting to hold him tight and feel his heartbeat .

 " Missing My Baby " received positive reviews from critics . Vibe magazine reported that Full Force was awarded gold and platinum discs for " Missing My Baby " and " Techno Cumbia " , and described " Missing My Baby " as giving a " hint of her aspirations " . After it was remixed by Quintanilla III and later produced for the 1995 album Dreaming of You , the Hi XD said that it was the best English @-@ language song on the album . Chris Riemenschneider and John T. Davis of the Austin American @-@ Statesman wrote that " Missing My Baby can sound as fluffy as the Big M 's " Crazy for You " . Cary Clack of the San Antonio Express @-@ News wrote that " Missing My Baby " was played on non @-@ Tejano radio stations and that he thought it might become a posthumous hit , while commenting that the recording " displays [ Selena 's ] wonderful vocal and emotional range " . However , Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News believed that " Missing My Baby " and other tracks were added to Entre a Mi Mundo " for good measure " . 
 " Missing My Baby " was one of the first Selena songs to be played on radio stations after she was murdered by Yolanda Saldívar , her friend and former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques . A music video of the song , incorporating footage from Selena 's personal home videos , was released for VH1 in 1998 to promote the triple box @-@ set Anthology . Billboard reported that the video was the 47th most played music video for that channel in the week ending 5 April 1998 .

 " The Problem Solvers " is the fifth episode of the fourth season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock , and the 63rd overall episode of the series . It was written by co @-@ executive producer Ron Weiner and directed by co @-@ executive producer John Riggi . It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) network in the United States on November 12 , 2009 . Guest stars in the episode include Josh Fadem , Cheyenne Jackson , Padma Lakshmi , and Shawn Levy . 
 In the episode , the new cast member for the fictional sketch comedy show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan ( TGS ) , Jack " Danny " Baker ( Jackson ) arrives on set and learns the intricacies of the show . Meanwhile , Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) offers Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) a chance to create a television pilot based on her " Dealbreakers " sketch but Liz decides to search for other offers . In addition , after offering some advice Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) and Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) decide to solve other problems of the cast and crew . Finally , NBC page Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) grows annoyed as the cast members begin to ask less of him . 
 " The Problem Solvers " received generally positive reception from television critics , although some expressed disappointment in the tone . According to the Nielsen ratings system , the episode was watched by 5 @.@ 8 million households during its original broadcast , and received a 2 @.@ 9 rating / 7 share among viewers in the 18 – 49 demographic . 
 = = Plot = = 
 This episode opens with Liz Lemon , Jack Donaghy , and the rest of the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff welcoming Jack Baker , the new cast member , to the show . After realizing that Baker has the same first name as him , Jack quickly decides to rename him Danny . In the previous episode , Danny was hired by Jack from his work as a street performer who dressed up like a robot and had very limited recent experience with " real acting " . 
 Meanwhile , Jack offers Liz the chance to star in a new television pilot based on her " Dealbreakers " sketch . She is initially excited , but Tracy Jordan and Jenna Maroney convince her to test the market and search for other offers before agreeing to work with Jack . Liz signs with a talent agent ( Josh Fadem ) to explore other options , but later learns he is a low @-@ level agent . Jack cannot stand Liz 's dismissal of him , and as a result , he announces through the media that NBC is moving forward with the pilot 's production and calls in Padma Lakshmi as a potential new host in place of Liz . Liz threatens to sue Jack and NBC for the rights to " Dealbreakers " , but Jack informs her that NBC owns the rights to it . Liz takes a meeting with Sports Shouting producer , Scottie Shofar ( Shawn Levy ) , and Jack meets with Padma . During their respective meetings , however , the two realize that they should work with one another . They shake hands at the end of the episode , agreeing to create the pilot together . 
 After giving advice to Liz , Tracy and Jenna spend the episode calling themselves " The Problem Solvers " giving the TGS crew advice on their lives . From the moment he arrives , Danny treats NBC page Kenneth Parcell politely and does not ask him to run any errands for him , a break from how Tracy and Jenna treat him . Danny explains to the two that lower @-@ level people such as pages often rise up to positions where they would be the boss of actors such as themselves , and as a result , he is polite to avoid building bad relationships with potential future bosses . Danny even speculates that Kenneth could be running the network someday . Jenna initially dismisses the idea out @-@ of @-@ hand , but Tracy becomes concerned , and tells Kenneth that he doesn 't want him to perform any more menial tasks for him ; Jenna soon joins him . Meanwhile , Kenneth lets slip that he may have been alive forever . Kenneth becomes upset that he is losing his responsibilities and confronts Danny , driving him to yell at Kenneth . Danny , who is Canadian , has had a hard time pronouncing the word " about " , but after yelling at Kenneth , and saying " about " without his Canadian accent , thanks Kenneth for helping him .

 " The Problem Solvers " was written by Ron Weiner and directed by John Riggi , both co @-@ executive producers on 30 Rock . This episode was Weiner 's fifth writing credit , having penned " Secrets and Lies " , " Señor Macho Solo " , " Goodbye , My Friend " , and " Mamma Mia " , and was Riggi 's second directed episode , having helmed " Goodbye My Friend " in the show 's third season . " The Problem Solvers " originally aired in the United States on November 12 , 2009 , on NBC as the fifth episode of the show 's fourth season and the 63rd overall episode of the series . 
 " The Problem Solvers " was filmed on October 23 , October 28 , and October 29 , 2009 . Jack Donaghy hiring the robot street performer in the previous episode , " Audition Day " , was first introduced in the fourth season premiere episode " Season 4 " , in which Jack explains that the TGS staff have become too elitist and need to change to survive in tough economic times , and informs Liz Lemon — the head writer on TGS — to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image . In this episode , the robot street performer is introduced to the TGS crew as Danny Baker , and was played by actor Cheyenne Jackson , who made his 30 Rock debut with this episode . Series creator , executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees , the latter that starred Jane Krakowski , who plays Jenna Maroney on the show . According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview , Fey set up a meeting to interest him in a role on the program . In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson to the attention of the 30 Rock producers . In " Audition Day " , Jackson did not play the robot , instead actor Daniel Genalo played the character . 
 The actor Josh Fadem played an inexperienced agent that Liz signs with in the episode . In a November 2009 interview with Tulsa World , Fadem admitted to " [ <unk> ] a couple lines " during filming , but that no one on the set " made me feel bad . " Director Shawn Levy guest starred in the episode as Scottie Shofar , a producer for the show Sports Shouting , and who Liz has a meeting with in regards to her " Dealbreakers " talk show . Levy directed Fey in the 2010 comedy film Date Night . Padma Lakshmi , the host of the reality show Top Chef , played herself in this 30 Rock episode in which she is a potential new host for the " Dealbreakers " talk show . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 During Danny 's rallying speech in a football movie flashback , he makes several references to Canadian culture such as Boxing day and the different rules used between Canadian and American football ( e.g. 3 downs instead of 4 , 12 men per side instead of 11 , though incorrectly uses meters while Canadian football uses yards ) . The episode twice refers to a fictional show Sports Shouting which features four panelists yelling at each other about sports . Some reviewers noted the similarity to the real show Around the Horn , an ESPN program which also features four panelists discussing sports in a competitive setting . J. A. Adande , a frequent panelist on Around the Horn , said through his Twitter page " Sports Shouting now tops ' Werewolf Bar Mitzvah ' as my favorite 30 Rock gag . " 
 When Jack tells Liz that Padma Lakshmi is coming in for the pilot she says " Then who 's going to host Top Chef ? You 're ruining my life ! " referring to a cooking reality television show Lakshmi hosts which Liz had previously shown a taste for in the season two episode " Cougars " . Tracy reveals that early in his career he signed a very badly structured contract which requires he publicize " Wade Boggs Carpet World " five times whenever he appears on camera , a reference to the baseball player Wade Boggs . Later , Jenna reveals that Scottie Shofar was her assistant in Trivial Pursuit : The Movie . The latter is a board game in which progress is determined by a player 's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions . As Danny grew angry he described Kenneth as having a " weird Don Knotts face " and a " Hitler Youth haircut . " 
 This was the fourth time the show referenced Liz 's " Dealbreakers " story arc . This first began in the third season episode " Mamma Mia " , in which Liz had written a comedy sketch titled " Dealbreakers " , and in the sketch , Jenna doled out comedic catchphrases as relationship advice to other women such as " If he wears an Atlanta Falcons jersey to your sister 's wedding ? That 's a Dealbreaker , ladies ! " Liz tried gaining attention for writing the sketch , but Jenna took all the credit for it , thus making Liz jealous . Liz dispensed more " Dealbreaker " -style romantic advice in a talk show appearance in the episode " Kidney Now ! " and at the end of the episode Liz told Jack that she had signed a book deal based on the sketch . In the episode " Into the Crevasse " , Liz 's book is published , but receives backlash from men close to her , as they believe her advice damaged their relationships . In this 30 Rock episode , Jack offers Liz a chance to create a television pilot based on her " Dealbreakers " sketch and although Liz decides to search for other offers she ultimately decides to work on the pilot with Jack .

 = The Land of Lost Content = 
 The Land of Lost Content : the Biography of Anthony Chenevix @-@ Trench is a biographical book about the life of British headmaster Anthony Chenevix @-@ Trench , written by Mark Peel . Chenevix @-@ Trench had been a widely acclaimed teacher at Shrewsbury School , and subsequently headmaster at Bradfield College , Eton College and Fettes College , but was later criticised for his approach to corporal punishment . Published by Pentland Press in 1996 , the book received mixed reviews , with questions over its neutrality and writing style , but plaudits for its insights into British culture and education . 
 = = Background = = 
 Chenevix @-@ Trench was known for his substantial tenures as headmaster of Bradfield College , Eton College and Fettes College ; he had also taught at Shrewsbury School . He died in 1979 . In 1994 , a book by Tim Card , a former Vice @-@ Provost of Eton , revealed for the first time that Chenevix @-@ Trench had not left his position as headmaster of Eton of his own accord . There followed some newspaper articles critical of Chenevix @-@ Trench 's use of corporal punishment , and numerous letters to the editor in response , most of which were positive about Chenevix @-@ Trench 's legacy . Peel , a teacher at Fettes College at the time , published The Land of Lost Content two years later . 
 = = Content = = 
 The book is divided into seven chapters , respectively covering Chenevix @-@ Trench 's ancestry and early childhood , his education at Shrewsbury School and Christ Church , Oxford , his military service in the Malayan Campaign during the Second World War , and his successive spells of teaching at Shrewsbury , Bradfield , Eton and Fettes . A five @-@ page postscript entitled merely " Tony Chenevix @-@ Trench " draws conclusions . There is also a five @-@ page introduction , and a three @-@ page foreword by Sir William Gladstone . The Land of Lost Content is the title of a poem from A.E. Housman 's 1896 cycle A Shropshire Lad , which Chenevix @-@ Trench translated into Latin while a prisoner of the Japanese during the Second World War . 
 In Peel 's view , Bradfield , Eton and Fettes all saw Chenevix @-@ Trench become headmaster at " critical points in their history " , and he was " a headmaster whose personality met many of their priorities , breathing fresh life into creaking limbs " . The book argues that , despite Chenevix @-@ Trench 's shortcomings being " too readily obvious " , " overshadowing the flaws stands his passionate concern for the individual , a vital quality for any leader to possess " . 
 The book ends with a quotation from Chenevix @-@ Trench about the importance of education : 
 What is a boy ? He is a person who is going to carry on what you have started , to sit where you are sitting and , when you are gone , attend to those things you think are so important . You can adopt all the policies you please , but how they will be carried on depends on him . Even if you make leagues and treaties , he will have to manage them . He will assume control of your cities and nations . He is going to move on and take over your prisons , churches , schools , universities and corporations . 
 All your work is going to be judged by him . Your reputation and the future are in his hands . All your work is for him , and the fate of nations and humanity is also in his hands . 
 So it might be well to pay him some attention now . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The book received a mixed reception from critics . Writing in the Daily Telegraph , Ludovic Kennedy said that the book describes Chenevix @-@ Trench 's career with considerable " affection " , while not shying away from revealing " many uncomfortable home truths " . Kennedy has a few " quibbles " with the book , particularly its over @-@ use of clichés , but concludes that Chenevix @-@ Trench , who he said " never bore a grudge " , would have approved despite the flaws . Kennedy also titles his review with the words of Chenevix @-@ Trench , who joked of his own tenure at Eton — " endearingly " , according to Kennedy — " In some ways I 'm too small a man in too big a job . " 
 Another positive voice was Lorn Macintyre , writing in the Herald , who said that the book gives " an honest insight into the public school system with all its imperfections " . He further comments that although Peel reveals some things that are " disturbing " , he also shows Chenevix @-@ Trench 's " dedication to high academic standards , to the all @-@ round development of a young person despite his use of the rod " . 
 Simon Heffer , writing in the Daily Mail , said that Peel " does not write with sufficient detachment " or rigorously enough , but that the book will be of great interest to those who want to know " what is really wrong with the British Establishment " — Heffer made it clear that he felt Chenevix @-@ Trench should never have been Headmaster of Eton in the first place , and that other people 's appointments in the " British Establishment " were equally flawed . Paul Foot wrote a personal recollection for the Diary section of the London Review of Books , reprinted in the Guardian , in which he described the book as " a wretched hagiography , full of clichés and bad jokes " , and objected to its portrayal of Chenevix @-@ Trench as " a heroic figure " .

 " Lazer Beam " is a single by Super Furry Animals . It was the only single to be released from the Love Kraft album and reached # 28 in the UK Singles Chart . The song is " about making your own reality " and tells the story of aliens coming down to earth to shoot humans with laser beams which " make them intelligent rather than being jerks " . Some of singer Gruff Rhys 's lyrics were lifted from a speech made by Tony Blair at the Labour Party Conference in 2004 . 
 Although critical response to the track was mostly positive , with some journalists hailing " Lazer Beam " as a " return to form " , some reviews were scathing with the NME even going so far as to call it " the worst Furries song ever " in their review of 2007 's Hey Venus ! 
 Two music videos were produced to accompany the song 's release as a single . The first , directed by Palumbo & Coch , features a fluorescent cityscape with the band and a monster with their ' SFA ' logo , appearing between the translucent buildings while the second , directed by Aurelien and Florian Marrel , features a fictional sideways @-@ scrolling arcade beat ' em up in the style of Metal Slug and Michael Jackson 's Moonwalker .

 In a 2005 interview with The Big Issue Gruff Rhys claimed that some of the lyrics to the song are based on Tony Blair 's speech at the Labour Party Conference in 2004 , in particular his opening line ' a radical new vision is needed ' : " I 've nicked that wholesale , but I am offering a radical new vision whereas he wasn 't . He was offering a 19th century imperialist vision and " Lazer Beam " offers an end to Hollywood romantic comedies and imperial colonialist bastards " . According to guitarist Huw Bunford the song is " about making your own reality " : " Today 's reality is insane so we may as well make our own . It 's about aliens coming down from space and zapping humans with amazing <unk> beams that make them intelligent rather than being jerks . It 's obviously a highly unlikely scenario " . 
 " Lazer Beam " was recorded in Figueres , Spain , and mixed in a suburb of Rio de Janeiro along with the rest of the Love Kraft album . According to Bunford , the band recorded " three versions of the song " before deciding to release the version that appears on Love Kraft . 
 = = Musical structure = = 
 The album version of " Lazer Beam " is 4 minutes 55 seconds long and is in the key of A major . This version appeared on all commercially released singles containing the track . 
 The track starts with 24 seconds of heavily effected guitar , drums and " bizarre sound effects " before the first verse begins , rising in volume as a looping bass line joins the mix and Gruff Rhys speaks the lines " This song is daunted by a radical new vision , no more imperial colonial bastards , no more romantic comedies , this is a fanfare introduction to a high @-@ powered , purposeful theme . " 
 A string section join on the chorus as Rhys 's voice is augmented by falsetto harmony backing vocals . The chords for the chorus remain the same as those used in the verse , namely A and G. The song then breaks down to a lead guitar melody line at 1 minute and 8 seconds before another verse with Rhys this time singing his lyrics . Another chorus , verse and chorus follow in this fashion until " Lazer Beam " breaks down completely at 2 : 55 to keyboard swells with Debi McLean providing a " space vocal " , speaking the lines " we will conquer utopia in space chariots " . The song builds back up to a double chorus before the outro . The string section returns once Rhys has sung a final verse using a vocoder . " Lazer Beam " then breaks down for the last time to handclaps and keyboard swells and ends with a few seconds of isolated keyboard noise . 
 = = = Radio edit = = = 
 A radio edit of " Lazer Beam " was included on promotional <unk> sent to radio stations and was also used in both music videos . This version of the track is 3 minutes and 36 seconds long and omits both the 24 second introduction , first , spoken word verse and the first chorus , starting instead with the guitar melody line that occurs in the album version at 1 minute and 8 seconds . The rest of song is identical to the album version although it does not include the brief keyboard noises at the very end . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 Reaction to the track was generally positive with several critics hailing " Lazer Beam " as a " return to form " including BBC Wales who claimed the track was " SFA 's best single release since 2001 's " Juxtapozed with U " " . musicOMH thought " Lazer Beam " to be an " absolute powerhouse of a song " and the Sunday Herald saw the track as one of the few " great moments on Love Kraft " . 
 However , Cokemachineglow described the song as " one of [ the band 's ] weakest singles to date " : 
 Two years after the song 's release the NME described " Lazer Beam " as " the worst Furries song ever " in their review of the band 's eighth album Hey Venus ! . 
 The " psychedelic " nature of the track was commented on by several reviewers with Mojo describing it as " acid @-@ carnivalesque " , The Times stating that it is a " kids TV theme heard through an acid @-@ pop filter " , The Observer claiming it sounded like " a Jesus Christ Superstar outtake gone delightfully right " , and BBC Wales calling it " cosmic funk " .

 The " Tron @-@ inspired " Palumbo & Coch directed video starts with the camera rushing across a fluorescent blue sea , then a road towards " a cityscape which looks like something between downtown Tokyo and a graphic equalizer " . Gruff Rhys appears on a floating electronic billboard singing the first verse and is joined by other members of the band playing along with the track . 
 At 33 seconds a neon monster , with the ' SFA ' logo on his chest , appears amongst the translucent buildings . More shots of the band and the computer generated city follow before the monster reappears during the second chorus , this time with electric bolts shooting from his body . As the track reaches its middle 8 a multicoloured neon spacecraft appears . 
 More shots of the band , cityscape and ' SFA ' monster follow until the final verse , when the view returns to the road from the beginning of the video . The camera then flies up inside a skyscraper made entirely of small images of a mouth singing the along with the track . As the song finishes the view again returns to the road . Small spaceships ( similar to the one from the middle 8 ) gather at either side as the city is left behind and the road gradually disappears . 
 = = = Aurelien and Florian Marrel video = = = 
 The Aurelien and Florian Marrel directed video begins with a shot of the band reflected in a television screen then cuts to the start screen of a fictional video game called ' Lazer Beam ' which claims to have been made by the <unk> Corporation in 2005 . ' Arcade mode ' is selected then two characters are chosen from a menu featuring four Super Furry Animals band member lookalikes before a brief ' How to play ' screen is shown . 
 An introduction screen is then shown featuring a villain with folded arms towering over several skyscrapers with the legend " Evil is reigning over this city " before panning down to see the four men from the character selection screen with the subtitle " A band is here to change things " . Next a " Final Fight style overlay map " appears with the ' City ' ( ' Stage 01 ' ) section flashing . 
 On 33 seconds the ' game ' itself begins with the two player characters walking from left to right down a deserted street . As the first chorus begins several zombies enter from the right and are shot by the player characters . After 53 seconds the villain from the introduction appears and laughs before disappearing as the playing area is filled with zombies . The view changes to a cut scene showing close @-@ ups of the two players sunglasses then pans out to show a spaceship illuminating the area with yellow light . 
 The video then cuts to a shot of the band playing the game before returning to the map screen as ' Docks ' or ' Stage 02 ' flashes . The second level begins in much the same way as the first with the two characters shooting zombies who appear from the right . The villain again stands in front of the players , laughing before disappearing . A boat / submarine then enters from the right and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams . Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns to a hangar in the sea with ' Evil ' written above the entrance . The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water , now with mechanical claws attached , and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game . 
 The map is shown for the last time showing the third level , ' ? ? ? ' , flashing . The villain attacks the characters from above with his flying vehicle and is hit several times by lasers as he tries to hit the players with the machine 's claws . A further cut scene then begins as one of the characters is seen activating a handset which calls the spaceship seen at the end of ' Stage 01 ' . The spaceship fires at the villain who flees his exploding vehicle stating " I 'll be back " as he flies away . 
 The ' zombies ' from levels 1 and 2 , now looking perfectly fine , are shown lining the banks of a river , singing along to the tracks final verse . Balloons and rainbows are shown behind them and a whale jumps out of the water before the screen goes black and the words ' Game over ' appear . More live action footage of the band follows with Huw Bunford raising his hands in triumph at completing the game and Guto Pryce being zapped by a laser . The final screen features the legend " F.B.I. winners don 't use drugs ! "
