 In 1930 , in response to the 1929 riots , the British Government appointed a commission " to determine the rights and claims of Muslims and Jews in connection with the Western or Wailing Wall " , and to determine the causes of the violence and prevent it in the future . The League of Nations approved the commission on condition that the members were not British . 
 The Jews requested that the Commission take the following actions : 
 To give recognition to the immemorial claim that the Wailing Wall is a Holy Place for the Jews , not only for the Jews in Palestine , but also for the Jews of the whole world . 
 To decree that the Jews shall have the right of access to the Wall for devotion and for prayers in accordance with their ritual without interference or interruption . 
 To decree that it shall be permissible to continue the Jewish services under the conditions of decency and decorum characteristic of a sacred custom that has been carried on for many centuries without infringement upon the religious rights of others . 
 To decree that the drawing up of any regulations that may be necessary as to such devotions and prayers , shall be entrusted to the Rabbinate of Palestine , who shall thus re @-@ assume full responsibility in that matter , in discharge of which responsibility they may consult the Rabbinate of the world . 
 To suggest , if the Commissioners approve of the plan , to the Mandatory Power that it should make the necessary arrangements by which the properties now occupied by the <unk> Waqf might be vacated , the Waqf authorities accepting in lieu of them certain new buildings to be erected upon some eligible site in Jerusalem , so that the charitable purpose , for which this Waqf was given , may still be fulfilled . 
 The Commission noted that ' the Jews do not claim any proprietorship to the Wall or to the Pavement in front of it ( concluding speech of Jewish Counsel , Minutes , page 908 ) .' 
 David Yellin , Head of the Hebrew Teachers Seminary , member of the Ottoman parliament , and one of the first public figures to join the Zionist movement openly , testified before the Commission . He stated : 
 " Being judged before you today stands a nation that has been deprived of everything that is dear and sacred to it from its emergence in its own land – the graves of its patriarchs , the graves of its great kings , the graves of its holy prophets and , above all , the site of its glorious Temple . Everything has been taken from it and of all the witnesses to its sanctity , only one vestige remains – one side of a tiny portion of a wall , which , on one side , borders the place of its former Temple . In front of this bare stone wall , that nation stands under the open sky , in the heat of summer and in the rains of winter , and pours out its heart to its God in heaven . " 
 The Commission concluded that the wall , and the adjacent pavement and Moroccan Quarter , were solely owned by the Muslim waqf . However , Jews had the right to " free access to the Western Wall for the purpose of devotions at all times " , subject to some stipulations that limited which objects could be brought to the Wall and forbade the blowing of the shofar , which was made illegal . Muslims were forbidden to disrupt Jewish devotions by driving animals or other means . Yitzchak Orenstein , who held the position of Rabbi of the Kotel , recorded in April 1930 that " Our master , Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld came to pray this morning by the <unk> and one of those present produced a small chair for the Rav to rest on for a few moments . However , no sooner had the Rav sat down did an Arab officer appear and pull the chair away from under him . " During the 1930s , at the conclusion of Yom Kippur , young Jews persistently flouted the shofar ban each year and blew the shofar resulting in their arrest and prosecution . They were usually fined or sentenced to imprisonment for three to six months . The Shaw commission determined that the violence occurred due to " racial animosity on the part of the Arabs , consequent upon the disappointment of their political and national aspirations and fear for their economic future . "

 During the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War the Old City together with the Wall was controlled by Jordan . Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement provided for Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall . However , for the following nineteen years , despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international bodies to attempt to enforce the armistice agreement , Jordan refused to abide by this clause . Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories . An exception was made for Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem . Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan ( which was not an option for Israelis ) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports . Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there . A vantage point on Mount Zion , from which the Wall could be viewed , became the place where Jews gathered to pray . For thousands of pilgrims , the mount , being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control , became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals .

 During the Jordanian rule of the Old City , a ceramic street sign in Arabic and English was affixed to the stones of the ancient wall . Attached 2 @.@ 1 metres ( 6 ft 11 in ) up , it was made up of eight separate ceramic tiles and said Al Buraq Road in Arabic at the top with the English " Al @-@ Buraq ( Wailing Wall ) Rd " below . When Israeli soldiers arrived at the wall in June 1967 , one attempted to scrawl Hebrew lettering on it . The Jerusalem Post reported that on June 8 , Ben @-@ Gurion went to the wall and " looked with distaste " at the road sign ; " this is not right , it should come down " and he proceeded to dismantle it . This act signaled the climax of the capture of the Old City and the ability of Jews to once again access their holiest sites . Emotional recollections of this event are related by David ben Gurion and Shimon Peres . 
 = = = Israeli rule 1967 – present = = = 
 Following Israel 's victory during the 1967 Six @-@ Day War , the Western Wall came under Israeli control . Brigadier Rabbi Shlomo Goren proclaimed after its capture that " Israel would never again relinquish the Wall " , a stance supported by Israeli Minister for Defence Moshe Dayan and Chief of Staff General Yitzhak Rabin . Rabin described the moment Israeli soldiers reached the Wall : 
 " There was one moment in the Six @-@ Day War which symbolized the great victory : that was the moment in which the first paratroopers — under Gur 's command — reached the stones of the Western Wall , feeling the emotion of the place ; there never was , and never will be , another moment like it . Nobody staged that moment . Nobody planned it in advance . Nobody prepared it and nobody was prepared for it ; it was as if Providence had directed the whole thing : the paratroopers weeping — loudly and in pain — over their comrades who had fallen along the way , the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall 's stones after 19 years of silence , tears of mourning , shouts of joy , and the singing of " Hatikvah " " . 
 Forty @-@ eight hours after capturing the wall , the military , without explicit government order , hastily proceeded to demolish the entire Moroccan Quarter which stood 4 metres ( 13 ft ) from the Wall . The Sheikh Eid Mosque , which was built over one of Jerusalem 's oldest Islamic schools , the <unk> , named after one of Saladin 's sons , was pulled down to make way for the plaza . It was one of three or four that survived from Saladin 's time . 650 people consisting of 106 Arab families were ordered to leave their homes at night . When they refused , bulldozers began to demolish the structures , causing casualties . One old woman was buried under the houses as the bulldozer razed the area . 
 According to Eyal Weizman , Chaim Herzog , who later became Israel 's sixth president , took much of the credit for the destruction of the neighbourhood : 
 When we visited the Wailing Wall we found a toilet attached to it ... we decided to remove it and from this we came to the conclusion that we could evacuate the entire area in front of the Wailing Wall ... a historical opportunity that will never return ... We knew that the following Saturday , June 14 , would be the Jewish festival of Shavuot and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then . 
 The narrow pavement , which could accommodate a maximum of 12 @,@ 000 per day , was transformed into an enormous plaza which could hold in excess of 400 @,@ 000 . 
 Several months later , the pavement close to the wall was excavated to a depth of two and half meters , exposing an additional two courses of large stones . 
 A complex of buildings against the wall at the southern end of the plaza , that included Madrasa <unk> and the house that the Abu al @-@ Sa 'ud family had occupied since the 16th century , were spared in the 1967 destruction , but demolished in 1969 . The section of the wall dedicated to prayers was thus extended southwards to double its original length , from 28 to 60 metres ( 92 to 197 ft ) , while the 4 metres ( 13 ft ) space facing the wall grew to 40 metres ( 130 ft ) . 
 The dusty plaza stretched from the wall to the Jewish Quarter . The small , approximately 120 square metres ( 1 @,@ 300 sq ft ) pre @-@ 1967 area in front of the wall grew to 2 @,@ 400 square metres ( 26 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , with the entire Western Wall Plaza covering 20 @,@ 000 square metres ( 4 @.@ 9 acres ) . 
 The new plaza created in 1967 is used for worship and public gatherings , including Bar mitzvah celebrations and the swearing @-@ in ceremonies of newly full @-@ fledged soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces . Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the wall on the Jewish holidays , and particularly on the fast of Tisha B 'Av , which marks the destruction of the Temple and on Jerusalem Day , which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands . 
 Conflicts over prayer at the national monument began little more than a year after Israel ’ s victory in the Six @-@ Day War once again made site accessible to Jews . In July 1968 the World Union for Progressive Judaism , which had planned the group 's international convention in Jerusalem , appealed to the Knesset after the Ministry of Religious Affairs prohibited the organization from hosting mixed @-@ gender services at the Wall . The Knesset committee on internal affairs backed the Ministry of Religious Affairs in disallowing the Jewish convention attendees , who had come from over 24 countries , from worshiping in their fashion . The Orthodox hold that services at the Wall should follow traditional Jewish law for segregated seating followed in synagogues , while the non @-@ Orthodox perspective was that " the Wall is a shrine of all Jews , not one particular branch of Judaism . " 
 = = = = Robinson 's Arch = = = = 
 At the southern end of the Western Wall , Robinson 's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount . Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs , the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men 's and women 's prayer areas against the Wall . 
 The need for such an area became apparent when in 1989 , after repeated attacks by <unk> , activists belonging to a group called Women of the Wall petitioned to secure the right of women to pray at the wall without restrictions . In a 2003 directive , Israel 's Supreme Court disallowed any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional prayer shawls at the plaza itself , but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson 's Arch to host such events . The site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups , as well as services by the Women of the Wall . In May 2013 a judge ruled that the 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the wall should not be deemed as disturbing the public order . 
 In November 2010 , the government approved a NIS <unk> ( $ <unk> ) scheme to improve access and infrastructure at the site . 
 The Isaiah Stone , located under Robinson 's Arch , has a carved inscription in Hebrew from Isaiah 66 : 14 : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " And when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb " ) . 
 In April 2013 , Jewish Agency for Israel leader <unk> <unk> spearheaded a concept that would expand and renovate the Robinson 's Arch area into an area where people may " perform worship rituals not based on the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish tradition . " On 25 August 2013 , a new 4 @,@ 480 square foot prayer platform named " Azarat Yisrael Plaza " was completed as part of this plan , with access to the platform at all hours , even when the rest of the area 's archeological park is closed to visitors . After some controversy regarding the question of authority over this prayer area , the announcement was made that it would come under the authority of a future government @-@ appointed " pluralist council " that would include non @-@ Orthodox representatives . In January 2016 , the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate . Women of the Wall welcomed the decision , although Sephardic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar of Jerusalem said creating a mixed @-@ gender prayer section was paramount to destroying it . The Chief rabbinate said it would create an alternate plan .

 In 2005 , the Western Wall Heritage Foundation initiated a major renovation effort under Rabbi @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch . Its goal was to renovate and restore the area within Wilson 's Arch , the covered area to the left of worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza , in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer . 
 The restoration to the men 's section included a Torah ark that can house over 100 Torah scrolls , in addition to new bookshelves , a library , heating for the winter , and air conditioning for the summer . A new room was also built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall . New construction also included a women 's section , overlooking the men 's prayer area , so that women could use this separate area to " take part in the services held inside under the Arch " for the first time . 
 On July 25 , 2010 , a Ner <unk> , an oil @-@ burning " eternal light , " was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson 's Arch , the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall . According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation , requests had been made for many years that " an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza , as is the custom in Jewish synagogues , to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple , " especially in the closest place to those ancient flames . 
 A number of special worship events have been held since the renovation . They have taken advantage of the cover , temperature control , and enhanced security . However , in addition to the more recent programs , one early event occurred in September 1983 , even before the modern renovation . At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service — the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control — that included men and women sitting together . The ten @-@ minute service included the Priestly Blessing , recited by Resnicoff , who is a Kohen . A Ministry of Religions representative was present , responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet .

 Rabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical King Solomon from the time of the First Temple . A Midrash compiled in Late Antiquity refers to a western wall of the Temple which " would never be destroyed " , and Lamentations Rabbah mentions how Rome was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival . Another Midrash quotes a 4th @-@ century scholar : " Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall " , and the Zohar similarly writes that " the Divine Presence rests upon the Western Wall " . 
 Some medieval rabbis claimed that today 's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it , lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity . Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount 's Western Wall , which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness . Most secular scholars believe however that these traditions originally pertained to a western wall of the Temple itself , and since the 1500s , were gradually applied to the surviving retaining Western Wall of the Mount . 
 Rabbi Zvi Hirsch <unk> discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word kotel when discussing the significance of praying against a wall . He cites the Zohar which writes that the word kotel , meaning wall , is made up of two parts : " Ko " , which has the numerical value of God ’ s name , and " Tel " , meaning mount , which refers to the Temple and its Western Wall . 
 Eighteenth @-@ century scholar Jonathan <unk> writes that " after the destruction of the Temple , God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour " . It is told that great Jewish sages , including Isaac Luria and the <unk> , experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall . 
 = = = = Sanctity of the Wall = = = = 
 Most Jews attach sanctity to the Wall , while others do not . Many contemporary Orthodox scholars rule that the area in front of the Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect . This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall . As such , men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall , and to dress appropriately . When departing , the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall . On Saturdays , it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices , including cameras , which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath . 
 Some Orthodox Jewish <unk> warn against inserting fingers into the cracks of the Wall as they believe that the breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness , while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area . 
 In the past , some visitors would write their names on the Wall , or based upon various scriptural verses , would drive nails into the crevices . These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall . Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento . In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper <unk> in 1898 . It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted , the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration . More recently the <unk> Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall , although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet , as they contain no holiness . Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a <unk> point of view . <unk> graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away . 
 There was once an old custom of removing one 's shoes upon approaching the Wall . A 17th @-@ century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that " upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes , bow and recite ... " . Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote that " it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution , kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite " This is nothing other than the House of God and here is the gate of Heaven . " When within four cubits of the Wall , one should remove their footwear . " Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased , as there is no need to remove one 's shoes when standing by the Wall , because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount . 
 In Judaism , the Western Wall is venerated as the sole remnant of the Holy Temple . It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews , as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism , namely the Even ha @-@ <unk> or Foundation Stone , which lies on the Temple Mount . According to one rabbinic opinion , Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by <unk> . While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone , some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall , near the El @-@ kas fountain . This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood . 
 = = = = Mourning the Temple 's destruction = = = = 
 According to Jewish Law , one is obligated to grieve and rend one 's garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple . Bach ( 17th century ) instructs that " when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall , which is the wall King David built , he should recite : Her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the nations : the law is no more ; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord " . Some scholars write that rending one 's garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control . Others disagree , pointing to the fact that the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim waqf and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress . If one hasn 't seen the Wall for over 30 days , the prevailing custom is to rend one 's garments , but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals . According to <unk> Epstein , a person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite : " Our Holy Temple , which was our glory , in which our forefathers praised You , was burned and all of our delights were destroyed " . 
 = = = = Prayer at the Wall = = = = 
 The Sages of the Talmud stated that anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem , " it is as if he has prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is situated there and it is open to hear prayer . " Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem , the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies , as God 's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot . It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies . Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger writes " since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall , it is understandable that all Israel 's prayers ascend on high there ... as one of the great ancient <unk> Rabbi Joseph <unk> said , when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem , from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall . " A well @-@ known <unk> ( efficacious remedy ) for finding one 's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall , a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher . 
 The Scroll of Ahimaaz , a historical document written in 1050 CE , distinctly describes the Western Wall as a place of prayer for the Jews . In around 1167 CE during the late Crusader Period , Benjamin of Tudela wrote that " In front of this place is the western wall , which is one of the walls of the Holy of Holies . This is called the Gate of Mercy , and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court " . In 1625 " arranged prayers " at the Wall are mentioned for the first time by a scholar whose name has not been preserved . Scrolls of the Law were brought to the Wall on occasions of public distress and calamity , as testified to in a narrative written by Rabbi <unk> of <unk> who went to Jerusalem in 1699 . 
 The writings of various travellers in the Holy Land , especially in the 18th and 19th centuries , tell of how the Wall and its environs continued to be a place of devotion for the Jews . Isaac <unk> , a prominent member of the Sephardic community in Jerusalem recalled how men and women used to gather in a circle at the Wall to hear sermons delivered in Ladino . His great @-@ grandmother , who arrived in Palestine in 1841 , " used to go to the Western Wall every Friday afternoon , winter and summer , and stay there until candle @-@ lighting time , reading the entire Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs ... she would sit there by herself for hours . " In the past women could be found sitting at the entrance to the Wall every Sabbath holding fragrant herbs and spices in order to enable worshipers to make additional blessings . In the hot weather they would provide cool water . The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall . Throughout the ages , the Wall is where Jews have gathered to express gratitude to God or to pray for divine mercy . On news of the Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 thousands of Jews went to the Wall to offer prayers for the " success of His Majesty ’ s and Allied Forces in the liberation of all enemy @-@ occupied territory . " On October 13 , 1994 , 50 @,@ 000 gathered to pray for the safe return of kidnapped soldier <unk> <unk> . August 10 , 2005 saw a massive prayer rally at the Wall . Estimates of people protesting Israel 's unilateral disengagement plan ranged from 50 @,@ 000 to 250 @,@ 000 people . Every year on Tisha B 'Av large crowds congregate at the Wall to commemorate the destruction of the Temple . In 2007 over 100 @,@ 000 gathered . During the month of <unk> 2009 , a record 1 @.@ 5 million people visited the site .

 While during the late 19th century , no formal segregation of men and women was to be found at the Wall , conflict erupted in July 1968 when members of the World Union for Progressive Judaism were denied the right to host a mixed @-@ gender service at the site after the Ministry of Religious Affairs insisted on maintaining the gender segregation customary at Orthodox places of worship . The progressives responded by claiming that " the Wall is a shrine of all Jews , not one particular branch of Judaism . " In 1988 , the small but vocal Women of the Wall launched a campaign for recognition of non @-@ Orthodox prayer at the Wall . Their form and manner of prayer elicited a violent response from some Orthodox worshippers and they were subsequently banned from holding services at the site . In response to the repeated arrest of women , including Anat Hoffman found flouting the law , the Jewish Agency observed ' the urgent need to reach a permanent solution and make the Western Wall once again a symbol of unity among the Jewish people , and not one of discord and strife . " Some commentators called for the closure of the site unless an acceptable solution to the controversy was found . In 2003 Israel 's Supreme Court upheld the ban on non @-@ Orthodox worship at the Wall and the government responded by allocating Robinson 's Arch for such purposes . But in 2012 , critics still complained about the restrictions at the Western Wall , saying Israel had " turned a national monument into an ultra @-@ Orthodox synagogue , " and in April 2013 the Jerusalem District Court ruled that as long as there was no other appropriate area for pluralistic prayer , prayer according to non @-@ Orthodox custom should be allowed at the Wall . This led to the expansion and renovation of the Robinson 's Arch prayer area which would be placed under the authority of a <unk> Council . In August 2013 , a platform named " Azarat Yisrael Plaza " was completed to facilitate non @-@ Orthodox worship .

 There is a much publicised practice of placing slips of paper containing written prayers into the crevices of the Wall . The earliest account of this practice is attributed to Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar , ( d . 1743 ) .

 Islamic reverence for the site is derived from the belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem . Various places have been suggested for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered , but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al @-@ Buraq mosque , which is just inside the wall at the south end of the present Western Wall plaza . The mosque is located above an ancient passageway , which once came out through the long @-@ sealed Barclay 's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate . 
 When a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re @-@ pave the ground in front of the Western Wall , the governor of Syria wrote : 
 It is evident from the copy of the record of the deliberations of the Consultative Council in Jerusalem that the place the Jews asked for permission to pave adjoins the wall of the Haram al @-@ Sharif and also the spot where al @-@ Buraq was tethered , and is included in the endowment charter of Abu <unk> , may God bless his memory ; that the Jews never carried out any repairs in that place in the past . ... Therefore the Jews must not be enabled to pave the place . 
 Carl <unk> , who was charged with compiling a list of place names for Charles Wilson 's Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1865 , reported that the street leading to the Western Wall , including the part alongside the wall , belonged to the Hosh ( court / enclosure ) of al <unk> , " not Obrâk , nor <unk> " . In 1866 , the Prussian Consul and Orientalist Georg Rosen wrote that " The Arabs call Obrâk the entire length of the wall at the wailing place of the Jews , southwards down to the house of Abu Su 'ud and northwards up to the substructure of the <unk> [ Shariah court ] . Obrâk is not , as was formerly claimed , a corruption of the word <unk> ( Hebrews ) , but simply the neo @-@ Arabic pronunciation of <unk> , ... which , whilst ( Muhammad ) was at prayer at the holy rock , is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above . " 
 The name Hosh al Buraq appeared on the maps of Wilson 's 1865 survey , its revised editions of 1876 and 1900 , and other maps in the early 20th century . In 1922 , it was the street name specified by the official Pro @-@ Jerusalem Council .

 Some scholars believe that when Jerusalem came under Christian rule in the 4th century , there was a purposeful " transference " of respect for the Temple Mount and the Western Wall in terms of sanctity to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , while the sites around the Temple Mount became a refuse dump for Christians . However , the actions of many modern Christian leaders , including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI , who visited the Wall and left prayer messages in its crevices , have symbolized for many Christians a restoration of respect and even veneration for this ancient religious site .

 Most Jews , religious and secular , consider the wall to be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple . They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19 @-@ year gap . There are , however , some <unk> Jews who hold opposing views . Most notable are the adherents of the <unk> <unk> dynasty who retain the views espoused by their Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum , who would not approach the Wall after the 1967 conquest , although he did visit the site during his visits to the Holy Land in the 1920s . 
 In 1994 , Shlomo Goren wrote that the tradition of the wall as a Jewish prayer site was only 300 years old , the Jews being compelled to pray there after being forbidden from assembling on the mount itself .

The Jews began praying at this wall only in the nineteenth century , when they began to develop [ national ] aspirations . " A year later he stated : 
 " There is not a single stone in the Wailing Wall relating to Jewish History . The Jews cannot legitimately claim this wall , neither religiously nor historically . The Committee of the League of Nations recommended in 1930 , to allow the Jews to pray there , in order to keep them quiet . But by no means did it acknowledge that the wall belongs to them . " 
 In 2006 , Dr. Hassan Khader , founder of the Al Quds Encyclopedia , told PA television that the first connection of the Jews to the Wall is " a recent one which began in the 16th century ... not ancient ... like the roots of the Islamic connection " . 
 In November 2010 , an official paper published by the PA Ministry of Information denied Jewish rights to the Wall . It stated that " Al @-@ Buraq Wall is in fact the western wall of Al @-@ Aksa Mosque " and that Jews had only started using the site for worship after the 1917 Balfour Declaration . 
 Yitzhak Reiter writes that " the Islamization and de @-@ <unk> of the Western Wall are a recurrent motif in publications and public statements by the heads of the Islamic Movement in Israel . "

 While recognizing the difficulties inherent in any ultimate peace agreement that involves the status of Jerusalem , the official position of the United States includes a recognition of the importance of the Wall to the Jewish people , and has condemned statements that seek to " delegitimize " the relationship between Jews and the area in general , and the Western Wall in particular . For example , in November 2010 , the Obama administration " strongly condemned a Palestinian official 's claim that the Western Wall in the Old City has no religious significance for Jews and is actually Muslim property . " The U.S. State Department noted that the United States rejects such a claim as " factually incorrect , insensitive and highly provocative . "

 Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe , 455 U.S. 130 ( 1982 ) , was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States holding that an Indian tribe has the authority to impose taxes on non @-@ Indians that are conducting business on the reservation as an inherent power under their tribal sovereignty . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = History = = = 
 The Jicarilla Apache Tribe is a Native American ( Indian ) tribe in northwestern New Mexico on a reservation of 742 @,@ 315 acres ( 3 @,@ 004 @.@ 04 km2 ; 1 @,@ 159 @.@ 867 sq mi ) . The reservation was established by an Executive Order of President Grover Cleveland in 1887 and clarified by the Executive Orders of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt in 1907 and William Howard Taft in 1912 . The tribe adopted a formal constitution under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act , 25 U.S.C. § 461 et <unk> that provided for the taxation of members of the tribe and non @-@ members of the tribe doing business on the reservation . If the tribe enacted a such tax ordinance on non @-@ members , the ordinance had to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior . 
 Beginning in 1953 , the tribe entered into agreements with oil companies , including the plaintiffs Merrion and Bayless , to provide oil and gas leases . The leases were approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs ( now the Bureau of Indian Affairs , or BIA ) in accordance with 25 U.S.C. § § <unk> – <unk> . As was the usual practice at the time , the oil companies negotiated directly with BIA , who then presented the contracts to the tribal council . While the oil and gas was from reservation land , Merrion paid severance taxes to the state of New Mexico under the provisions of 25 U.S.C. § <unk> , where Congress had authorized such taxation in 1927 . The leases provided for royalties to be paid to the tribe , but the BIA was lax in collecting them . In 1973 , tribal attorneys wrote to the BIA to demand the collection of royalties , and after a year delay , the BIA would only state that they were " looking into it . " In 1976 , the BIA approved a tribal ordinance that also provided for a severance tax . This tax was set at 29 cents ( U.S. ) per barrel of oil and at 5 cents per million British thermal units ( BTU ) for natural gas . 
 = = = District court = = = 
 Merrion did not want to pay a severance tax to both New Mexico and the tribe , and filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico , along with such major companies as Atlantic Richfield ( now part of BP ) , Getty Oil , Gulf Oil , and Phillips Petroleum ( now ConocoPhillips ) , among others . The case was not filed until 15 days before the severance tax was due . In the hearing on the temporary injunction on June 17 , 1977 , Merrion argued that the tribe 's severance tax was unconstitutional , violating both the Commerce clause and Equal protection clause , and that it was both taxation without representation and double taxation . In addition , the plaintiffs argued against the entire concept of tribal sovereignty , stating that it had been a " legal fiction for decades . " U.S. District Judge H. <unk> Payne granted the temporary injunction and set the hearing on the permanent injunction for August 29 , 1977 . The oil companies showed up with approximately 40 @-@ 50 attorneys , compared to 2 or 3 lawyers for the tribe . Both sides made essentially the same arguments as for the temporary injunction . Following the hearing , District court ruled that the tribe 's tax violated the Commerce clause of the Constitution and that only state and local authorities had the ability to tax mineral rights on Indian reservations . The court then issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the collection of the tax by the tribe . 
 = = = Circuit court = = = 
 The case then went to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals . The western states of Utah , New Mexico , Montana , North Dakota and Wyoming filed amici curiae briefs in support of the oil companies , while the Navajo Nation , the Arapahoe Nation , the Shoshone Indian Tribe , the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes , the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation , and the National Congress of American Indians all filed briefs in support of the <unk> tribe . The case was heard on May 29 , 1979 by a three @-@ judge panel consisting of Chief Judge Oliver Seth and Circuit Judges William Holloway , Jr. and Monroe G. McKay . The arguments were the same as at the district court level , with the oil companies stating that tribal sovereignty did not apply to taxation of non @-@ Indians conducting business on the reservation . In an unusual move , no written decision was issued , and the attorneys were told to <unk> the case en banc . McKay stated that as he recalls , he and Holloway were in disagreement with Seth , who favored a limited view of the tribe 's authority to tax the oil companies . 
 On September 12 , 1979 , the case was <unk> before the entire panel . Following that hearing , in a 5 @-@ 2 decision , the Tenth Circuit reversed the District Court , holding that the tribe had the inherent power under their tribal sovereignty to impose taxes on the reservation . The court also held that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause nor place an undue burden on the oil companies .

 = = = Initial arguments = = = 
 The oil companies immediately appealed and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case . This appeal came shortly after the Supreme Court had decided Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe , 435 U.S. 191 ( 1978 ) , which had stated that an Indian tribe did not have the authority to try a non @-@ Indian for a crime committed on the reservation . The Oliphant case was a major blow against tribal sovereignty , and was a case used by the oil companies in their briefs . The oil companies argued that Oliphant , currently limited to criminal cases , should be expanded to civil matters as well . The attorneys for the tribe argued that this case was no different than Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation , 447 U.S. 134 ( 1980 ) , which stated that tribes had the authority to impose a cigarette tax on both tribal members and non @-@ Indians alike . Amici briefs were filed by Montana , North Dakota , Utah , Wyoming , New Mexico , Washington ( state ) , the Mountain States Legal Foundation , the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District , Shell Oil , and Westmoreland Resources in support of the oil companies . The Council of Energy Resource Tribes and the Navajo Nation filed briefs supporting the tribe . 
 Arguing for <unk> and Bayless was Jason W. Kellahin , for Amoco and Marathon Oil was John R. Cooney ( originally a separate case , but which was consolidated with this case ) , for the tribe was Robert J. Nordhaus , and on behalf of the tribe for the Solicitor General was Louis F. Claiborne . Kellahin argued that tribal sovereignty only extended to members of the tribe , citing both Oliphant and Montana v. United States , 450 U.S. 544 ( 1981 ) , both cases involving the jurisdiction of a tribal court over non @-@ Indians . Kellahin stated that those cases that allowed a tribe to tax non @-@ Indians were not due to tribal sovereignty , but were connected with the authority of the tribe to regulate who could enter the reservation , in the same manner as a landlord controlled their property . Cooney argued that the tax was a violation of the Commerce Clause , in that Congress divested the tribes of that authority when they enacted 25 U.S.C. § <unk> granting the states the right to impose a severance tax on reservation lands . Nordhaus , in arguing for the tribe , pointed out that there was first , no Congressional preemption of the tribal authority to tax , and that second , taxation was an inherent power of tribal sovereignty . Claiborne first distinguished Montana , noting that it dealt with non @-@ Indians on fee land owned by non @-@ Indians that happened to be within the boundaries of the reservation , something that was completely unrelated to the current case . 
 = = = Re @-@ argument = = = 
 Following the oral argument , the Chief Justice assigned Justice John Paul Stevens to write the majority opinion and Justice William J. Brennan , Jr. asked Justice Thurgood Marshall to write the minority or dissenting opinion , based on the initial count of the justices ' views . Since Justice Potter Stewart did not participate in the case , it would take a 5 @-@ 3 vote to overturn the decision of the Circuit Court . Stevens circulated a memorandum stating that his decision would be to invalidate the tax - Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice William Rehnquist immediately stated they would join his opinion . Justice Byron White stated that he would wait and see what the dissent said , and then indicated he would join the dissent in part . It also appeared that Justice Harry Blackmun was also going to write a separate dissent , but he also stated that he would wait to see Marshall 's opinion . At this point , the tribe had the votes to win on a 4 @-@ 4 vote , but the Court was close to being adjourned for the summer recess . On July 3 , 1981 , the Court notified the parties to <unk> the case on November 4 , 1981 . 
 In the meantime , the Court had changed . Justice Stewart retired , and President Ronald Reagan had appointed Sandra Day O 'Connor to replace him . During the re @-@ argument , Kellahin began with the fact the New Mexico was acquired via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo and that neither Spain or Mexico recognized Indian title and claimed that the tax was a veiled attempt to increase royalty payments . Cooney argued that there was no authority in statute for the Secretary of the Interior to approve a tribal tax and that the 1927 statute preempted the tribes authority in favor of the states being empowered to apply a severance tax on reservations . Nordhaus stated that the argument about the Treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo did not apply , since no branch of the federal government had ever differentiated between these tribes and other tribes . The case was then submitted to the court . 
 = = = Majority opinion = = = 
 Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the court . Marshall noted that the tribe had a properly formed constitution , approved by the Secretary of the Interior , and that it included that the tribal council may impose taxes on non @-@ members doing business on the reservation . He noted that the tribe had executed oil and gas leases for about 69 % of the reservation and that the leases provided for royalties to be paid to the tribe . Marshall further noted that the tribe followed the proper process to enact a severance tax , obtaining the approval of the BIA as part of the process . The first argument of the oil companies that the power to tax only arose from the power of the tribe to exclude persons from the reservation . Marshall disagreed , stating that the power to tax is an inherent attribute of a tribe 's sovereignty . Tribal government includes the need to provide for services , not only to the tribe , but to anyone doing business on the reservation . He noted that the oil companies benefited from police protection and other governmental services . Citing Colville , he stated that the tribe 's interest in raising " revenues for essential governmental programs . . . is strongest when the revenues are derived from value generated on the reservation by activities involving the Tribes and when the taxpayer is the recipient of tribal services . " Marshall noted that Congress was able to remove this power , but had not done so , and had acknowledged in 1879 the power of the Cherokee Nation to tax non @-@ Indians . 
 Marshall further noted the oil companies ' arguments that a lease would prevent a governmental body from later imposing a tax would denigrate tribal sovereignty , and that tribal sovereignty was not limited by contractual arrangements . Only the Federal government has the authority to limit the powers of a tribal government , and a non @-@ Indian 's consent is not needed ( by contract or otherwise ) to exercise its sovereignty , to the contrary , the tribe may set conditions and limits on the non @-@ Indian as a matter of right . " To presume that a sovereign forever waives the right to exercise one of its sovereign powers unless it expressly reserves the right to exercise that power in a commercial agreement turns the concept of sovereignty on its head . " 
 Marshall then addressed the Commerce Clause issues , and the argument of the Solicitor General that the section of the Commerce Clause that dealt directly with Indians applied rather than the argument of the oil companies that the section dealing with interstate commerce applied . First , Marshall noted that the case history of the Indian Commerce Clause was to protect the tribes from state infringement , not to approve of Indian trade without constitutional restraint . He saw of no reason to begin now , especially since he did not find that the tribe 's severance tax did not have negative implications on interstate commerce . In a 6 @-@ 3 decision , Marshall found that the tribe had the right to impose such a tax on non @-@ Indians . 
 = = = Dissent = = = 
 Justice John Paul Stevens , joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist , dissented from the majority opinion . Stevens noted that over its own members , a tribe has virtually unlimited sovereignty . Over non @-@ Indians , a tribe had no power , but many tribes were granted the authority to exclude non @-@ Indians from their reservations . Stevens also noted that the various statutes that were passed in regards to mineral rights and leases were silent as to the authority of a tribe to impose taxes . Therefore , authority must come from one of three sources , federal statutes , treaties , and inherent tribal sovereignty . He noted that in matters involving their own members , the tribe could act in manners that the federal government could not , such as discriminating against females in citizenship cases ( citing Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez , 436 U.S. 49 ( 1978 ) ) . Tribal authority over non @-@ members was always severely limited , in both a civil and criminal context , and he viewed both Oliphant and Montana as controlling in this area also . He viewed the authority to tax as merely an adjunct to the tribe 's right to exclude individuals from the reservation . Since the leases were entered into by the tribe voluntarily , the tribe cannot enact later taxes without the consent of the oil companies . Stevens would have reversed the Circuit Court . 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 Almost immediately after the decision , the BIA , on directions from Assistant Secretary of the Interior Kenneth Smith , proposed federal regulations that would have severely limited the ability of the tribes to impose severance taxes . Following numerous complaints from the tribes , the BIA abandoned that plan . The Jicarilla tribe has also purchased the Palmer Oil Company , becoming the first Indian tribe to have 100 % ownership of an oil production firm . The case is a landmark case in Native American case law , having been cited in approximately 400 law review articles as of July 2010 . Almost all tribes that have mineral deposits now impose a severance tax , based on the Merrion decision and has been used as the basis for subsequent decisions supporting tribal taxing authority . Numerous books also mention the case , whether in regards to tribal sovereignty or taxation . 
 = History of Stoke City F.C. = 
 Stoke City Football Club was formed in 1863 under the name of " Stoke Ramblers " by former pupils of Charterhouse School whilst they were apprentices at the North Staffordshire Railway . The club dropped the Ramblers from their name and in 1888 they were founding members of the Football League . In 1928 , the club 's name was changed for the final time to Stoke City Football Club when Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent was granted city status . 
 The club moved in 1997 to the Britannia Stadium , a 28 @,@ 383 all @-@ seater stadium ; having spent 119 years at the Victoria Ground . In the 2007 – 08 season , Stoke won promotion from the Football League Championship , the second tier of English football , and as of 2008 – 09 are playing in the top flight ( currently Premier League ) for the first time since the 1984 – 85 season , when they were relegated with a total of 17 points , a record low unsurpassed for 21 years . Stoke 's only major trophy was the 1972 Football League Cup , won when they beat Chelsea 2 – 1 in the final at Wembley Stadium before a crowd of 97 @,@ 852 . The club have also won the Football League Trophy twice , in 1992 and 2000 . In terms of league achievement the closest Stoke have come to winning the title was in the 1946 – 47 season where a final day defeat cost Stoke top spot .

 It is claimed that Stoke Ramblers was formed in 1863 when former pupils of Charterhouse School formed a football club while apprentices at the North Staffordshire Railway works in Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent . However , Stoke Ramblers ' first documented match was five years later , on 17 October 1868 , at the club 's original home , the Victoria Cricket Club ground and any earlier history is based on supposition . Played against an E.W. May XV club , the 15 @-@ a @-@ side match ended in a 1 – 1 draw . In the game , the club 's first goal was scored by Henry Almond , Stoke 's founder and captain . Stoke played four further fixtures in 1868 , recording their first victory with a 2 – 0 win against Newcastle @-@ under @-@ Lyme . In 1875 , to cope with rising attendances , the club switched to a ground at <unk> Field , not far from the Victoria Cricket Ground . At this time , the only fixtures were friendly matches ; this changed in 1877 when the Staffordshire Football Association was formed and created a new competition , the County Cup , which Stoke won in the inaugural season , beating Talke Rangers 1 – 0 in the final . In an earlier round , Stoke had recorded what is still the club 's record victory , a 26 – 0 triumph over Mow Cop . Stoke retained the County Cup in the following season with a 2 – 1 win over <unk> and established themselves as the largest club in the area . 
 In 1878 , the club merged with Stoke Victoria Athletic Club and became known as Stoke Football Club . They moved from <unk> Field to the Athletic Club ground , which soon became known as the Victoria Ground . It was around this time that the club adopted their red and white striped kit . Stoke entered the newly formed Birmingham Association Cup in 1881 , although they were beaten 8 – 0 by Aston Villa in the first round . In the 1882 – 1883 season , Stoke reached the final of the Staffordshire Senior Cup but were beaten 3 – 2 by West Bromwich Albion . The club decided to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the 1883 – 84 season ; the competition itself had been founded 12 years earlier . 
 The threat of a rival football association , the British FA , forced the Football Association to legalise professionalism in 1885 ; Stoke subsequently turned professional in August of that year . The club were defeated again in the FA Cup in 1885 – 86 after a replay defeat to Crewe Alexandra . The club 's first victory in the competition came in the 1886 – 87 season with a 10 – 0 win over Caernarfon Wanderers at the Victoria Ground . 
 Stoke became one of the twelve founding members of the Football League in 1888 . Stoke 's manager , Harry Lockett , represented the club at a meeting in London , where the league 's formation was discussed . Lockett played an instrumental role in its inception and became the league 's first secretary ; however he resigned from his role of manager in August 1890 , in order to concentrate on his league responsibilities . Stoke struggled in their first two seasons in the league , 1888 – 89 and 1889 – 90 , finishing in last place on both occasions . The club failed to secure re @-@ election to the league at the end of its second season , instead being replaced by Sunderland . As a consequence , Stoke started 1890 – 91 in the Football Alliance ; they finished the season as champions . The Football League was expanded to include fourteen clubs in 1891 – 92 , which ensured Stoke were re @-@ elected to the league , where they remained for the rest of the decade . In 1897 , Stoke appointed Horace <unk> , who in 1899 became the first manager to lead the club to the semi @-@ final of the FA Cup . 
 Stoke suffered financial problems around 1900 , which ultimately led to the loss of the club 's Football League status in 1908 . " Historical Football Kits " says that , " In 1908 , having finished in mid @-@ table , Stoke went into liquidation and resigned from the League . Ironically this galvanised local businessmen , the clergy ( the Victoria Ground was owned by the Church of England ) and supporters to form a new limited company and purchase the old club 's assets . " The club moved to the Birmingham & District League after its demotion . In 1909 , the club opted to field two teams , one in the Birmingham & District League and the other in the Southern League ( West Division ) ; Stoke won the latter in their first year in the competition . Stoke continued to participate in both leagues until 1915 , when their application for election back into the Football League was approved . However , the outbreak of the First World War meant the league was suspended for four years ; it recommenced in August 1919 . During this time , Stoke entered the Lancashire Primary and Secondary leagues . 
 The club became owners of the Victoria Ground in 1919 . The Butler Street stand was constructed shortly afterward , increasing the overall capacity of the ground to 50 @,@ 000 . Following the restart of the Football League , Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in the 1921 – 22 season under the stewardship of Arthur Shallcross , although this was followed by relegation in the 1922 – 23 season . Unable to prevent the club 's bad form , Shallcross resigned in March 1923 . Tom Mather was appointed manager later in 1923 , although Stoke were unable to mount another promotion challenge . They were instead relegated from the Second Division four years later in the 1925 – 26 season . The club 's stay in Third Division North was brief , as Stoke won the championship during their first season in that league . In 1925 , Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent was granted city status , and this led the club to change its name to Stoke City Football Club in 1928 . 
 = = 1930 – 1960 = = 
 The 1930s saw the début of the club 's most celebrated player , Stanley Matthews . Matthews , who grew up in Hanley , was an apprentice at the club and made his first appearance , aged 17 , in March 1932 against Bury . By end of the decade , Matthews had established himself as an England international and one of the best footballers of his generation . Matthews won his first England cap in 1934 , making him the first Stoke player in 30 years to play for England . Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in the 1932 – 33 season as champions , but Matthews only featured in 15 games , although he did score his first goal for the club in a 3 – 1 win against local rivals Port Vale . 
 By 1934 , the club 's average attendance had risen to over 23 @,@ 000 , which allowed the club manager , Tom Mather , more transfer funds . Despite this , the core of the side consisted of young local players , such as Matthews , Tommy Sale and Freddie Steele . Mathers resigned from his post in May 1935 to take the managerial job at Newcastle United , ending his 12 @-@ year tenure . Bob McGrory was appointed as the club 's manager shortly afterward ; he had previously played for the club for 14 years . In the 1935 – 36 season , the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division , nine points adrift of champions Sunderland . This was followed by two successive mid @-@ table finishes , in 1936 – 37 and 1937 – 38 . The club recorded its record league win , 10 – 3 , over West Bromwich Albion in February 1937 , in which Steele scored five goals . In April of that year , the club achieved its largest league crowd — 51 @,@ 373 against Arsenal . Steele 's 33 league goals in the 1936 – 37 season remains a club record in 2007 . 
 By 1938 , rumours purported that Stanley Matthews wanted to leave Stoke to further his career . This led to a meeting at Kings Hall , attended by three thousand people with a further thousand outside . Matthews opted to stay with Stoke and helped the club to finish in seventh place in the 1938 – 39 season . 
 The outbreak of the Second World War prevented further progress as the league was suspended for six years . After resumption of the FA Cup , 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a sixth round away game against Bolton Wanderers when the crush barriers gave way on the terraces . 
 At this time , the side was predominantly composed of local players who had come through the club 's youth system , including Matthews , Sale , Steele and John McCue , all in their prime , as well as the newly discovered Neil Franklin , regarded as the country 's best centre @-@ half . In the 1946 – 47 season , Stoke mounted a serious title challenge : the club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title , but a 2 – 1 defeat to Sheffield United gave the title to Liverpool . Stanley Matthews left the club three games before the end of the 1946 – 47 season to join Blackpool at the age of 32 for a fee of £ 11 @,@ 500 . The team subsequently failed to mount a title challenge in the following two seasons , 1947 – 48 and 1948 – 49 , finishing 15th and 11th respectively . 
 The 1950s did not start well for the club ; having avoided relegation in the 1950 – 51 and 1951 – 52 seasons , Stoke succumbed in 1952 – 53 , finishing second from bottom . Bob McGrory resigned as the club 's manager in February 1952 after 17 years in the role . His successor , Frank Taylor , consolidated the club 's position in the Second Division but was unable to mount a sustained challenge for promotion , although Stoke came close in the 1954 – 55 season , missing by two points . Taylor 's failure to deliver promotion led to his dismissal in June 1960 , after a 17th @-@ place finish in the 1959 – 60 season . 
 = = 1960 – 1977 : The Waddington years = = 
 By 1960 Stoke were struggling to attract supporters to the Victoria Ground , with the average attendance dropping below 10 @,@ 000 for the first time in 40 years . Tony Waddington was appointed as the club 's manager in June 1960 . He joined the club in 1952 as a coach , before being promoted to assistant manager in 1957 . In his first season in charge , 1960 – 61 , Stoke finished 18th in the Second Division . Crowds were still low ; a match against Preston North End attracted 8 @,@ 409 in 1961 . However , Waddington pulled off a significant coup by enticing Stanley Matthews — now 46 years old — back to the club , 14 years after he had left . A crowd of 35 @,@ 974 witnessed Matthews ' return to the club , only a fortnight after the poor crowd against Preston . The return of Matthews helped Stoke to rise to eighth position in 1961 – 62 . Promotion was achieved in the next season , when Stoke finished as champions . In their first season back in the First Division , 1963 – 64 , Waddington guided Stoke to a mid @-@ table finish . Matthews remained influential , as he helped the club to the Football League Cup final in 1964 , although this ended in defeat to Leicester over two legs . 
 Waddington relied upon experience ; Dennis Viollet , Jackie Mudie , Roy Vernon , Maurice Setters and Jimmy McIlroy were players signed in the later stages of their careers . Matthews was awarded a knighthood for services to football in the 1965 New Year 's Honours list . This was followed by his 701st , and final , league appearance for the club against Fulham in February 1965 , shortly after his 50th birthday . It ended a career spanning 33 years , including 19 years ' service to his home town club . 
 Gordon Banks , England 's 1966 World Cup winning goalkeeper , joined Stoke from Leicester in 1967 for £ 52 @,@ 000 . Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world , Banks proved to be a shrewd signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division . However , Banks was forced to quit top @-@ level football in 1972 , after losing an eye in a road accident . 
 The club won its first significant trophy on 4 March 1972 , in the League Cup Final . Stoke beat favourites Chelsea 2 – 1 in the final at Wembley Stadium before a crowd of 97 @,@ 852 spectators . Before this victory , Stoke had progressed through 11 games to reach the final . This included four games with West Ham United in the semi @-@ final ; the two @-@ legged match was played twice . Stoke fared well in the FA Cup ; the club progressed to the semi @-@ final stage in both the 1970 – 71 and 1971 – 72 seasons . However , on both occasions Stoke lost to Arsenal in a replay . 
 Waddington was presented with a dilemma as both George Eastham and Peter Dobing retired not long after the club 's League Cup win . Waddington responded by paying £ 240 @,@ 000 to Chelsea for the services of Alan Hudson in early 1974 . This was followed by Geoff Salmons ' arrival from Sheffield United for £ 160 @,@ 000 , in the same year . Waddington later paid a world record fee for a goalkeeper , £ 325 @,@ 000 , to sign Peter Shilton from Leicester City . The new personnel brought added impetus to Waddington 's side , and Stoke were close to winning the League title in 1974 – 75 , but an end of season slump led to a fifth @-@ place finish , four points off the champions , Derby . 
 The 1970s also saw Stoke compete at European Level for the first time in its history . Stoke qualified for the UEFA Cup in 1972 – 73 as a result of their League Cup triumph . In the first round , Stoke played Kaiserslautern of Germany : Stoke won the first leg 3 – 1 at the Victoria Ground , with a crowd of over 22 @,@ 000 . However , the club lost the second leg 4 – 0 , therefore losing 5 – 3 on aggregate . Stoke qualified for the UEFA Cup two years later , due to their fifth @-@ place finish in the First Division in the 1973 – 74 season . In the 1974 – 75 competition , Stoke were again knocked out at the first stage . Stoke drew both legs against Dutch side Ajax , 1 – 1 and 0 – 0 respectively , but went out due to the away goals rule . 
 The Butler Stand roof was blown off in a storm in January 1976 . The ground damage meant the club 's next home game against Middlesbrough had to be played at Vale Park , the home of local rivals Port Vale . The repair bill , in the region of £ 250 @,@ 000 , put the club in financial trouble , which was eased by the sale of Alan Hudson , Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff for a combined sum of £ 440 @,@ 000 . With the team depleted , relegation proved inevitable in the 1976 – 77 season . Waddington , after a spell of 17 years in charge , left the club after a 1 – 0 home defeat in March 1977 .

 George Eastham , who had previously been Waddington 's assistant , was appointed as manager in March 1977 , but the club 's slide into the Second Division in 1976 – 77 season proved unstoppable . Eastham did not last long , leaving in January 1978 after only 10 months in charge . The club 's misery was compounded by a defeat to non @-@ league Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup shortly afterwards . Alan Durban , arriving from Shrewsbury Town , was selected as the club 's new manager in February 1978 . Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in his first full season , 1978 – 79 , with a third @-@ place finish . After consolidating the club 's position in the First Division , Durban left for Sunderland in 1981 . 
 Richie Barker , Durban 's successor , was appointed manager in 1981 . He signed Mickey Thomas from Brighton and Hove Albion and Mark Chamberlain from Port Vale , as he set about building a side for the 1982 – 83 season . Thomas was signed for £ 200 @,@ 000 and made over 60 appearances for the club , but was sold to Chelsea for £ 75 @,@ 000 in 1984 . Winger Chamberlain , a £ 135 @,@ 00 signing , proved successful as he made eight appearances for England during his stay at Stoke . Barker 's spell in charge was short @-@ lived ; he was sacked in his second season , 1983 – 84 . The club 's new manager , Bill Asprey , decided to bring back veteran Alan Hudson , and the decision paid off as Stoke improved during the second half of the 1983 – 84 season and avoided relegation on the final day . 
 The next season , referred to as The Holocaust Season by fans , proved to be disastrous . Stoke finished the season with only 17 points and just three wins , which would be the lowest points total in the top flight of English football ( under the " three points for a win " system ) for 21 years until the record was broken by Sunderland in the 2005 – 06 season . Mick Mills was appointed player @-@ manager for the 1985 – 86 season , following Asprey 's departure in April 1985 due to ill health . His first task was to consolidate following the club 's relegation in the previous season , which he achieved with a mid @-@ table finish in the Second Division . The team reached fourth place in 1986 – 87 , his second season in charge , including a 7 – 2 win over Leeds United , but the team 's form tailed off towards the end of the season , culminating in an eighth @-@ place finish . Mills was unable to sustain a challenge for promotion and was sacked in November 1989 , following a poor start to the 1989 – 90 season after spending £ 1m on players . His successor , Alan Ball , became the club 's fifth manager in 10 years . Peter Coates became the club 's chairman in 1989 , following numerous changes of chairmanship during the 1980s . 
 Ball struggled in his first season in charge , 1989 – 90 , and his Stoke side were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division . The start of the 1990 – 91 season in the Third Division marked the first time Stoke had played at this level in 63 years . Ball kept his job for the start of this campaign but departed in February 1991 in the midst of an indifferent season that saw Stoke finish 15th . This remains the club 's lowest league position , as of 2007 . 
 Ball 's successor , Lou Macari , was appointed in May 1991 , prior to the start of the 1991 – 92 season . The improvement was immediate , as Stoke narrowly missed out on promotion in his first season in charge , finishing fourth in the Third Division . He also clinched a trophy for the club ; the Associate Members ' Cup ( at the time known as the <unk> trophy for sponsorship reasons ) was won with a 1 – 0 victory against Stockport County at Wembley ; Mark Stein scored the only goal of the game . The following season , 1992 – 93 , promotion was achieved from the third tier , now known as Division Two , with Stoke finishing as league champions . Stein , a £ 100 @,@ 000 purchase from Oxford United , scored 26 goals during the season as Stoke amassed a total of 93 points . Macari left in October 1993 to take over as manager of Scottish side Celtic , and Stein also departed in a £ 1.5m move to Chelsea . 
 Joe Jordan 's tenure in charge was short ; he left the club less than a year after joining . Following Jordan 's departure , Stoke opted to reappoint Lou Macari only 12 months after he had left . Despite the optimism surrounding his return , only a mid @-@ table finish was attained in the 1994 – 95 season . The 1995 – 96 season started poorly , but the signing of striker Mike Sheron turned around the club 's campaign . Stoke eventually finished fourth but were defeated in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final by Leicester City . The following season , 1996 – 97 , saw Mark Stein return from Chelsea on loan , partnering Sheron in attack . The season started well , with Stoke in fourth place at Christmas , but a poor second half of the season saw the club drop to an eventual 12th place . Sheron was sold in 1997 for a club record fee of £ <unk> Macari left the club at the end of the season , his last game in charge the final league game at the Victoria Ground in a match against West Bromwich Albion .

 The 1997 – 98 season saw Stoke move to its new ground , the 28 @,@ 000 all @-@ seater Britannia Stadium , after 119 years at the Victoria Ground , the longest time spent at a ground by any team in Britain . Chic Bates , Macari 's assistant , was appointed manager for the club 's inaugural season in the new ground . Bates struggled as his side slipped from a play @-@ off place towards the relegation zone , with the club 's bad run culminating in a 7 – 0 home defeat to Birmingham City . Bates was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998 . Kamara could not improve the club 's fortunes , and he left in April . Alan Durban , Stoke 's manager two decades earlier , took charge for the remainder of season . Durban was unable to keep the club up , with a 23rd @-@ place finish consigning Stoke to relegation from Division One . 
 Brian Little , formerly manager of Aston Villa , took charge for the 1998 – 99 season , and Stoke began the season impressively , holding first place until December with six straight wins . The team 's form tailed off in the latter stages of the season , leading to Little 's departure at the end of the season . His successor , Gary Megson , was only in the job for four months . Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by Stoke Holding , an Icelandic consortium that purchased a 66 percent share in Stoke City F.C. for £ <unk> The club 's new owners appointed the club 's first foreign manager , Icelander Gudjon Thordarson , in November 1999 . 
 Stoke won the Football League Trophy in the 1999 – 2000 season with a 2 – 1 win over Bristol City in April 2000 before a crowd of 75 @,@ 057 at Wembley . Disappointment followed a month later , as Stoke were defeated against Gillingham in the play @-@ off semi @-@ finals , consigning themselves to another year in Division Two . They reached the play @-@ offs again in the 2000 – 01 season with a fifth @-@ place finish , but this time Walsall halted Stoke 's progress at the semi @-@ final stage . Thordarson achieved promotion at the third attempt in 2001 – 02 ; another fifth @-@ place finish ensured a play @-@ off spot . Cardiff City were defeated in the semi @-@ final before a 2 – 0 win against Brentford at the Millennium Stadium secured promotion . Despite achieving the goal of promotion , Thordarson was sacked by Gunnar <unk> , only five days after the club won the play @-@ off final . A campaign calling for Thordarson 's reinstatement was organised by fans , but it proved unsuccessful . 
 Steve Cotterill was drafted in as Thordarson 's replacement before the start of the 2002 – 03 season . Cotterill quit in October 2002 , after only four months in charge , to take the role of Howard Wilkinson 's assistant at Sunderland . The club were close to unveiling George Burley as their new manager after Cotterill 's departure ; however , a last minute charge of heart led the former Ipswich manager to decline the club 's offer . The club acted swiftly and Tony Pulis was appointed as Stoke 's new manager shortly afterwards . Pulis steered Stoke clear of relegation with a 1 – 0 win over Reading on the final day of the season that kept the club in the Championship . The club 's position in the league was consolidated in 2003 – 04 . Pulis was sacked at the end of the 2004 – 05 season , following a disagreement between himself and the club 's owners . Dutch manager Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis ' successor on 29 June 2005 , only a day after Pulis was sacked . Boskamp broke the club 's transfer record in signing <unk> <unk> for a fee in the region of £ 1m . Another significant addition was the signing of Belgium international Carl <unk> , who subsequently won the Fans ' Player of the Year Award for the 2005 – 06 season . Despite his spending on new players , Boskamp 's side was inconsistent and only a mid @-@ table finish was achieved . The season was marred by a feud between Boskamp and the club 's director of football , John Rudge , which escalated to the point where Boskamp threatened to quit . Boskamp left at the end of the 2005 – 06 season , amidst a takeover by former chairman Peter Coates . 
 On 23 May 2006 , Coates completed his takeover of Stoke City , marking the end of Gunnar <unk> 's chairmanship of the club . Coates chose former manager Tony Pulis as Boskamp 's successor in June 2006 . Pulis took Stoke close to a play @-@ off place , however an eventual eighth @-@ place finish was achieved in the 2006 – 07 season . In June 2007 , chairman Peter Coates purchased the Britannia Stadium outright from the City Council for a fee in the region of £ 6m .

 On 4 May 2008 , Stoke City won promotion to the top flight of English football after a 23 @-@ year absence , and as of 2008 – 09 are playing in the Premier League for the first time . On 18 July 2008 , the club broke their transfer record to purchase striker Dave Kitson for £ 5 @.@ 5 million from Reading . The following weekend , the Britannia Stadium hosted its first ever top @-@ flight game , against Aston Villa , with a home win courtesy of <unk> Sidibe 's injury @-@ time goal from a Rory Delap throw @-@ in , giving Stoke City their first ever Premier League points . The club went on to record a 12th @-@ place finish in their first season back in the Premier League . A much cited aspect of the team 's style of play has been the utilisation of Rory Delap 's long throw to create goal @-@ scoring opportunities . Pulis signed Robert Huth and Tuncay <unk> from Middlesbrough for a combined fee in the region of £ 10 million , in a bid to establish the club in the Premier League prior to the 2009 – 2010 season . This feat was achieved comfortably as the club finished in 11th place , thereby securing a third season in the Premier League . Pulis bolstered his squad for 2010 – 11 season with the club record £ 8 million signing of Kenwyne Jones . 
 A 3 – 0 win over West Bromwich Albion in the 2010 – 11 season gave Stoke two new records : The largest away win in the Premier League and largest top division away win since 1982 and also the first time since the 1983 – 84 season Stoke have won three top @-@ flight matches in a row . Manager Pulis hailed the new records as " A Fantastic Achievement " . For the second season running Stoke made it to the quarter final of the FA Cup after overcoming Cardiff City , Wolverhampton Wanderers and Brighton & Hove Albion . They met West Ham United in the quarters and won 2 – 1 thus earning a place in the FA Cup Semi @-@ final for only the fourth time in their history . It was also be their first trip to the New Wembley Stadium when they took on Bolton Wanderers for a place in the final . Stoke comfortably beat Bolton 5 – 0 clinching a first FA Cup Final appearance in their 148 @-@ year history . However , they lost the final 1 – 0 to Manchester City . By reaching the final , Stoke qualified for the 2011 – 12 UEFA Europa League . Despite a strong season , with an 8th @-@ place finish in sight , defeat at home to Wigan Athletic in the final game meant that Stoke finished 13th in the 2010 – 11 season . 
 On 28 July 2011 , Stoke beat <unk> Split 2 – 0 over two legs in the third qualifying round of the Europa League . It was Stoke 's first appearance in Europe in 37 years . Stoke would go on progress past FC Thun in the Play @-@ off round gaining entrance into the group stage where Stoke were handed a tough draw against <unk> , Dynamo Kyiv and Maccabi Tel Aviv . Stoke finished second in the group and were handed a glamour tie against Spanish giants Valencia in the round of 32 , following the draw manager Pulis stated that he is relishing the prospect of taking on one of Europe 's top clubs . Stoke lost both legs 1 – 0 to end their European campaign . Pulis received criticism from some supporters after he fielded a weakened team in the second leg . Stoke ended the 2011 – 12 season in 14th position in what was perceived to be a disappointing season . The 2012 – 13 season saw Stoke make little progress , finishing in 13th position . Pulis subsequently left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013 . 
 He was replaced by another Welsh manager , Mark Hughes . Hughes led Stoke to a ninth @-@ place finish in 2013 – 14 , their highest position in the Premier League and best finish since 1974 – 75 . Stoke again finished in ninth position in 2014 – 15 , which ended with a 6 – 1 victory against Liverpool . Despite breaking their transfer record twice ( on <unk> <unk> and then Giannelli <unk> ) , in 2015 – 16 , Stoke did not make any progression and finished in ninth position for a third season running .

 = William Etty = 
 William Etty ( 10 March 1787 – 13 November 1849 ) was an English artist best known for his history paintings containing nude figures . He was the first significant British painter of nudes and still lifes . Born in York , he left school at the age of 12 to become an apprentice printer in Hull . He completed his apprenticeship seven years later and moved to London , where in 1807 he joined the Royal Academy Schools . There he studied under Thomas Lawrence and trained by copying works by other artists . Etty earned respect at the Royal Academy of Arts for his ability to paint realistic flesh tones , but had little commercial or critical success in his early years in London . 
 Etty 's Cleopatra 's Arrival in Cilicia , painted in 1821 , featured numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim . Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes . All but one of the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure , and he acquired a reputation for indecency . Despite this , he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed , and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician , at the time the highest honour available to an artist . Although he was one of the most respected artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life , a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists . In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture , and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes . He continued to paint both male and female nudes , which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press . 
 An extremely shy man , Etty rarely socialised and never married . From 1824 until his death he lived with his niece Betsy ( Elizabeth Etty ) . Even in London he retained a keen interest in his native York , and was instrumental in the establishment of the town 's first art school and the campaign to preserve York city walls . While he never formally converted from his Methodist faith , he was deeply attached to the Roman Catholic Church and was one of the few non @-@ Catholics to attend the 1838 opening of Augustus Pugin 's chapel for St Mary 's College , Oscott . 
 Etty was prolific and commercially successful throughout the 1840s , but the quality of his work deteriorated throughout this period . As his health progressively worsened he retired to York in 1848 . He died in 1849 , shortly after a major retrospective exhibition . In the immediate aftermath of his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums . Changing tastes meant his work later fell out of fashion , and imitators soon abandoned his style . By the end of the 19th century the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices , and outside his native York he remained little known throughout the 20th century . Etty 's inclusion in Tate Britain 's landmark Exposed : The Victorian Nude exhibition in 2001 – 02 , the high @-@ profile restoration of his The Sirens and Ulysses in 2010 and a major retrospective of his work at the York Art Gallery in 2011 – 12 led to renewed interest in his work . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the late 18th and early 19th centuries , British painting was strongly influenced by Joshua Reynolds ( 1723 – 1792 ) , the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts ( RA ) . Reynolds believed the purpose of art was " to conceive and represent their subjects in a poetical manner , not confined to mere matter of fact " , and that artists should emulate Renaissance painters such as Rubens , Paolo Veronese and Raphael and make their subjects close to perfection . After Reynolds 's death his Discourses on Art , which extolled the notion of an artist 's duty to paint idealised subjects , remained Britain 's primary theoretical work on art . The Royal Academy dominated British art , with the annual Royal Academy Summer Exhibition the most important event in the calendar . The Academy controlled the prestigious Academy art schools , an effective monopoly on the training of new artists , and preoccupied with technique . While painters such as J. M. W. Turner ( a strong supporter of the Royal Academy ) were beginning to move away from the influence of the Old Masters to create uniquely British styles , they adhered to principles established by Reynolds . 
 In the opinions then current at the Royal Academy and among critics , the most prestigious form of painting was considered history painting , in which an artwork illustrated a story . It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time , as well as to the Old Masters . Other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles , as they did not give the artist as much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality . Nonetheless , even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting , as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects or their families , providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist ; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy ( Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence ) had made their names as portrait painters . Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings , by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline . 
 = = Childhood and apprenticeship ( 1787 – 1805 ) = = 
 William Etty was born in <unk> , York , on 10 March 1787 , the seventh child of Matthew and Esther Etty , née Calverley . Although Matthew Etty was a successful miller and baker , he bore a large family and was never financially secure . Esther Calverley 's brother unexpectedly inherited the title of Squire of Hayton in 1745 , nine years before Esther 's birth , but disowned her following her marriage to Matthew as he considered him beneath her station . The family were strict Methodists and the young William was raised as such , although he disliked the spartan appearance of the Methodist chapel and liked to attend his Anglican parish church or York Minster when able . 
 The young William showed artistic promise from an early age , drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father 's shop . From the age of four he attended local schools in York , before being sent at the age of 10 to Mr. Hall 's Academy , a boarding school in nearby Pocklington , which he left two years later . On 8 October 1798 , at the age of 11 , William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull , publisher of the Hull Packet . While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant , he continued to draw in his spare time , and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books . It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise for the first time that it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting . 
 On 23 October 1805 Etty 's seven @-@ year indenture with Peck expired , an event greeted with great happiness as he intensely disliked the job . He remained in Hull for a further three weeks as a journeyman printer . He moved to London " with a few pieces of chalk @-@ crayons in colours " , to stay with his older brother Walter in Lombard Street . Walter was working for the successful gold lace manufacturer Bodley , Etty and Bodley , in which their father 's brother , also named William Etty , was partner . He arrived in London on 23 November 1805 , with the intention of gaining admission to the Royal Academy Schools . 
 = = Training ( 1806 – 21 ) = = 
 Applicants to the Royal Academy Schools were expected to pass stringent ability tests , and on his arrival in London Etty set about practicing , drawing " from prints and from nature " . Aware that all successful applicants were expected to produce high quality drawings of classical sculptures , he spent much time " in a plaster @-@ cast shop , kept by Gianelli , in that lane near to Smithfield , immortalised by Dr. Johnson 's visit to see ' The Ghost ' there " , which he described as " My first academy " . 
 Etty obtained a letter of introduction from Member of Parliament Richard Sharp to painter John Opie . He visited Opie with this letter , and showed him a drawing he had done from a cast of Cupid and Psyche . Impressed by the quality of his work , Opie in turn recommended Etty to Henry Fuseli , who accepted Etty into the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer . Having satisfactorily completed drawings from casts of Laocoön and " the Torso of Michelangelo " , Etty was accepted as a full student on 15 January 1807 . 
 Shortly after Etty joined the RA , four major lectures on painting were delivered by John Opie in February and March 1807 . In them , Opie said that painting " brings into view the heroes , sages , and beauties of the earliest periods , the inhabitants of the most distant regions , and fixes and perpetuates the forms of the present day ; it presents to us the heroic deeds , the remarkable events , and the interesting examples of piety , patriotism and humanity of all ages ; and according to the nature of the action depicted , fills us with innocent pleasure , excites our abhorrence of crimes , moves us to piety , or inspires us with elevated sentiments " . Opie rejected Reynolds 's tradition of idealising the subjects of paintings , observing that he did not believe " that the flesh of heroes is less like flesh than that of other men " . Opie advised his students to pay great attention to Titian , whose use of colour he considered unsurpassed , advising students that " colouring is the sunshine of the art , that clothes poverty in smiles [ ... ] and doubles the charms of beauty . Opie 's opinions made a deep impression on the young Etty , and he would hold these views throughout his career . 
 = = = Thomas Lawrence = = = 
 By this time , Etty had developed a great admiration for the portrait painter Thomas Lawrence , and hoped to learn from him . After having arranged an introduction via Henry Fuseli , Etty 's uncle William met with Lawrence and paid him 100 guineas ( about £ 7 @,@ 500 in 2016 terms ) in return for his accepting the younger William as a private pupil for a year . 
 Under this arrangement Etty did not receive formal tuition from Lawrence . Instead , Lawrence set aside a room in his attic for Etty to copy from his pictures , and agreed to answer Etty 's questions when he was in a position to do so . Etty found the experience of trying to copy Lawrence 's work extremely frustrating , and in his own words " was ready to run away " , but he persisted and eventually taught himself to copy Lawrence 's work very closely . Although Etty found his year with Lawrence a frustrating experience , his development of the ability to copy other works served him in good stead in future when he came to copy elements from the Old Masters . 
 Once he had completed his year with Lawrence , Etty returned to the Royal Academy , drawing at the life class and copying other paintings , as well as undertaking commissions and doing occasional work for Lawrence to earn money . He was unsuccessful in all the Academy 's competitions , and every painting he submitted for the Summer Exhibition was rejected . 
 In 1809 Etty 's uncle William , with whom he had been staying , died . Etty was forced into an inconvenient transient lifestyle , moving from lodging to lodging . However , Etty had been left a significant sum in his uncle 's will , and his brother Walter now took over their uncle 's position at Bodley , Etty and Bodley , giving Walter the means to support the younger William 's work financially . In 1811 Etty 's persistence paid off . He finally had two of his paintings accepted for exhibition — Telemachus Rescues Antiope from the Fury of the Wild Boar at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition , and Sappho at the British Institution . The latter sold for the respectable sum of 25 guineas ( about £ 1 @,@ 600 in 2016 terms ) . Although from now on Etty would have at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year , he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years . By 1814 , Etty was becoming widely respected at the RA for his use of colour and in particular his ability to produce realistic flesh tones . 
 = = = France and Italy = = = 
 At the time , there were no public art galleries in England with permanent collections . In 1816 , in the face of his continued lack of success , Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections . He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815 , but other than this had never been abroad . The 28 @-@ year @-@ old Etty had fallen in love , and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause , and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country . In the event , the woman rejected him , and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816 . 
 Etty landed in Dieppe , and made his way to Paris via Rouen . Although he admitted to finding France a beautiful country , he was unhappy throughout his stay there , suffering from severe homesickness ; shortly after his arrival in Paris he wrote to his cousin Martha Bodley that " I hope I shall like Italy better than Paris , or I think I shall not feel resolution to stop a year . If I don 't , I shall content myself with seeing what I think worth while ; and then return . " He travelled onwards via Geneva , but found Switzerland frustrating ; although he had brought his own tea @-@ making equipment with him , in the remoter mountain villages he found it difficult to obtain milk for his tea . Travelling through the Simplon Pass to Piedmont revived his spirits somewhat ; he found the variety of colour in the landscapes of northern Italy fascinating , and in late September arrived in Florence . 
 Despite the grandeur of Florence , Etty was severely depressed , writing to his brother on 5 October that " I feel so lonely , it is impossible for me to be happy " and complaining of " the vermin in the bed , the dirt and the filth " which he considered " such as no Englishman can have any idea of , who has not witnessed it " . His emotional state made it impossible for him to study , and within a month of his arrival in Italy , he began the journey back to England , stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816 . In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean @-@ Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen , and he left after a week . While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux @-@ Arts , and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris . Still homesick , Etty left Paris , returning to London in November . 
 Notwithstanding his unhappiness , Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels . For the first time , his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition ( <unk> : a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne ) attracted a favourable review in the press , in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered <unk> " a fine classical invention " and Cupid as showing " splendid promise " . Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty 's potential , and continued to champion him throughout his career . In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza 's The Rape of Ganymede — at the time thought to be by Titian — in one of the Royal Academy 's painting competitions . Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition , Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home ; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student . Etty was disqualified from the competition , but the high quality of his work further raised his prestige within the Academy . Although his income was still low and he was surviving on gifts from his brother , at some point by 1818 Etty hired an assistant , George Henry Franklin . 
 = = = = The Coral Finder = = = = 
 At the 1820 Summer Exhibition , Etty exhibited two paintings : Drunken Barnaby and The Coral Finder : Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos . Drunken Barnaby is a scene of a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on ; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built , plump and rosy @-@ cheeked , a style in which Etty would continue to paint women throughout his career . The Coral Finder is strongly inspired by Titian , and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat , surrounded by scantily clad attendants . It was Etty 's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references for which he was to become famous . 
 The Coral Finder was sold at exhibition to piano manufacturer Thomas Tomkinson for £ 30 ( about £ 2 @,@ 200 in 2016 terms ) . Sir Francis Freeling had admired The Coral Finder at its exhibition , and on learning that it had already been sold he commissioned Etty to paint a similar picture on a more ambitious scale , for a fee of 200 guineas ( about £ 15 @,@ 100 in 2016 terms ) . Etty had for some time been musing on the possibility of a painting of Cleopatra , and took the opportunity provided by Freeling to paint a picture of her based loosely on the composition of The Coral Finder . 
 = = Recognition and travels ( 1821 – 23 ) = = 
 Cleopatra 's Arrival in Cilicia ( also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra ) is based loosely on Plutarch 's Life of Antony and Shakespeare 's Antony and Cleopatra , in which the Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general Mark Antony . While superficially similar to The Coral Finder , Cleopatra is more closely related to the style of Regnault , with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition . The individual figures are out of proportion to each other and the ship , while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting . As well as from Regnault , the work borrows elements from Titian , Rubens and classical sculpture . 
 When exhibited in 1821 , Cleopatra was generally extremely well received , and considered among the finest paintings of its kind , and its success inspired Etty to paint more works in a similar vein . The exhibition of Cleopatra , coupled with the exhibition in January 1822 of A Sketch from One of Gray 's Odes ( Youth on the Prow ) which also depicted nude figures on a boat , drew criticism of Etty for his treatment of female nudes . The Times in early 1822 chided Etty , remarking that " We take this opportunity of advising Mr. Etty , who got some reputation for painting " Cleopatra 's Galley " , not to be seduced into a style which can gratify only the most vicious taste . Naked figures , when painted with the purity of Raphael , may be endured : but nakedness without purity is offensive and indecent , and on Mr. Etty 's canvass is mere dirty flesh . " Unlike nude studies by other artists of the period , Etty made no attempt to idealise the female nudes in Cleopatra , but instead painted them in realistic poses and realistic flesh tones . Possibly alarmed by the criticism , Freeling persuaded Etty to paint clothes onto some of the figures in Cleopatra , although in 1829 he allowed Etty to return the figures to the state in which he had originally painted them . 
 The success of Cleopatra notwithstanding , Etty remained a student at the RA and continued with a rigorous programme of study . Now in his mid 30s , he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired , despite his unpleasant experiences the last time he left England . 
 = = = Travels in Europe = = = 
 Recalling his homesickness and loneliness the last time he had ventured abroad , for his next foreign trip Etty travelled in the company of Richard Evans , who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence . Despite warnings that Italy would be uncomfortably hot , the two men set out on 23 June 1822 with the aim of reaching Rome . Crossing to France by means of the recently developed steamboat , they arrived in Paris on 26 June . They stayed in Paris for two weeks , visiting Versailles and the city 's public art galleries ; they also visited the much @-@ reduced remaining exhibits of the Louvre . The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time , at which Etty felt a great dislike for the quality of portraiture in France , but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections , in particular Rubens 's Marie de ' Medici cycle , elements of which he would later reuse in many of his own works . 
 Travelling onwards through Dijon and Switzerland , Etty and Evans passed over the Simplon Pass and on to Milan , where they viewed Leonardo 's The Last Supper and visited the <unk> Gallery . After a sixteen @-@ day cabriolet ride through the gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer , the two men reached Florence , where they stayed for two days visiting the city 's galleries . On 10 August , the two men finally reached Rome . 
 Although Etty was somewhat disappointed by Rome , comparing the architecture of St. Peter 's unfavourably with that of St. Paul 's , he was highly impressed with Michelangelo 's " almost Venetian " use of colour in the Sistine Chapel . He also met with Antonio Canova , to whom he had been recommended by Lawrence , shortly before Canova 's death . Rome was at the time suffering badly from malaria , and after two weeks Etty decided to leave for Naples . Evans had contracted malaria and decided to stay in Rome , and so Etty travelled to Naples alone and returned to Rome in the company of actor William Macready , who happened to be making the same journey , and with whom he remained a good friend for the rest of his life . On his return to Rome , Etty toured the city 's museums , making copies of various artworks , particularly those of the Venetian artists such as Titian and Veronese whom he so admired . 
 = = = = Venice = = = = 
 Feeling unsettled , Etty left Rome for Venice , intending to remain there for 10 days and then return to England . Evans preferred to remain in Rome , so Etty travelled alone , pausing briefly in Florence and in Ferrara ( where he stopped to kiss the armchair of Ludovico Ariosto ) . The painter Charles Lock Eastlake , then resident in Rome , had provided Etty with a letter of introduction to Harry D 'Orville , British Vice consul in Venice ; D 'Orville was so impressed with Etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house , rather than in lodgings . Etty had long considered Venice his spiritual home and " the hope and idol of my professional life " , and had often wondered why , given its artistic importance , so few English travellers visited the city . He was not disappointed . Throughout the remainder of his life , he would look back on his visit to Venice with great fondness , writing shortly before his death that " Venezia , cara Venezia ! thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now ! " 
 Although Etty had only intended to stay for 10 days , he was so taken with Venice that he remained for over seven months . He fell into a routine of copying paintings in Venetian collections by day , and attending the life class of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts by night , producing around 50 oil paintings in total as well as numerous pencil sketches . He was extremely impressed with the high quality of the Venetian Academy ; the instructors in their turn were extremely impressed with the quality of Etty 's work , in particular his flesh tones . He acquired the nickname of " Il Diavolo " owing to the high speed at which he was able to paint , and watching him at work became something of a spectacle in its own right ; luminaries including Gioachino Rossini and Ladislaus <unk> ( then Patriarch of Venice ) came to watch him paint . So devoted was Etty to his studies in Venice that he exhibited no original work in 1823 , writing to his brother that " If one spent all the time in painting originals , one might as well , nay better , be at home " . The members of the Venetian Academy were so impressed by Etty that he was elected an Honorary Academician . 
 By 7 June 1823 , Etty felt that he had reached the limits of what he could accomplish in Venice , and was considering returning home . Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence , with the intention of creating a full @-@ size replica of Titian 's Venus of Urbino , considered one of the finest works of the Venetian school of painting . Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal , after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy . His contemporaries considered it among the finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy . In late July Etty began the journey home , pausing for a further two months in Venice . On 8 October 1823 Etty finally left Venice , travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris . 
 Etty had intended to travel to England , but instead remained in Paris , to resume copying works in Paris galleries , collecting prints and buying a lay figure and around 200 paintbrushes , both of which the French made to a higher standard than English manufacturers . In early January 1824 , Etty finally returned to London . 
 = = Success and controversy ( 1824 – 35 ) = = 
 As soon as he arrived home , Etty began to work on ensuring he had at least one picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition . He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820 , that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath . He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme , and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures . His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half @-@ finished , and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora , Vulcan and Venus . 
 Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is an unusual composition , painted to resemble a bas @-@ relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background . The figure of Pandora stands in the centre , with Vulcan to one side and Venus and Cupid to the other , each leaning away from her ; the figures of Vulcan and Venus , along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas , create a diamond shape around Pandora . The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame , a favourite device of Rubens ; elements of the picture 's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject , drawn by Etty 's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake . As with all Etty 's history paintings from this time on , he worked by painting the figures first , and only filling in the background once the figures were complete . 
 Although recognisably descended from earlier works such as The Coral Finder , Pandora was a far more accomplished work than those Etty exhibited prior to his travels . Although some critics were reluctant to accept Etty 's combination of realistic figures and an unrealistic setting ( Etty 's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr characterises the critical reaction to Pandora as " grudging admiration not unmixed with philistinism " ) , his fellow artists were extremely impressed with it , to the extent that Thomas Lawrence bought the painting at the 1824 Summer Exhibition . 
 In the wake of the success of Pandora , Etty moved to an apartment in Buckingham Street , near the Strand , where he was to reside for the remainder of his working life . Shortly afterwards he applied to become an Associate of the Royal Academy for the first time , and on 1 November was duly elected , beating William Allan by 16 votes to seven . ( The Times , at this time still hostile to Etty for his perceived indecency , sneered that " this cannot be as an honour conferred on Mr. Etty : if it were , he has deserved and should have obtained it long ago " . The same reviewer did concede that Etty 's copy of Tintoretto 's Esther Before <unk> was " the most important picture in the room " in their report on an exhibition held at the British Institution of significant copies of paintings . ) 
 = = = Betsy Etty = = = 
 In the years following his return from Italy , Etty had a very limited social life . In a typical day he would wake at 7 am , paint from around 9 or 10 am until 4 pm , after which he would have a meal . Following the meal he would take a walk , and attend life classes between 6 and 8 pm . On returning home he would drink two cups of tea , and go to bed at midnight . 
 Etty was considered extremely unattractive , described by his 1855 biographer Alexander Gilchrist — a great admirer — as " <unk> in attire , short and awkward in body — large head , large hands , large feet — a face marked with the small @-@ pox , made still more noticeable by length of jaw , and a quantity of sandy hair , long and wild : all , conspired to make him ' one of the oddest looking creatures ' in a Young Lady 's eyes — what she would call ' a sight ' ; one , not redeemed ( to her ) , by the massive brow , its revelation of energy and power , the sign @-@ manual of Genius there legible . " 
 One of his few close companions was his niece Betsy ( Elizabeth Etty ) , fifth daughter of his brother John . Betsy was unmarried and 14 years younger than William , and became his housekeeper in 1824 . She remained in his service for the rest of his life , and as he grew older William increasingly came to depend on her , suffering distress whenever they were apart and regularly writing to her in panic whenever he did not hear from her . She became his companion and acted as his assistant , alongside his official assistant George Franklin . 
 While he appears to have been attracted to young women throughout his life , and there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice , there is no suggestion that he ever had a sexual relationship with Betsy of any kind . He recorded in his diary in 1830 that " it is best I have not married because I have not noisy Children and can have nice Books , and Pictures etc " . He suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life , and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout , although he was popular with fellow artists and students . Etty rarely socialised , preferring to concentrate on his painting ; when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes , he indignantly replied that " it fills up a couple of hours in the evening , I should be at a loss how else to employ " . 
 As she grew older Betsy suffered from numerous illnesses , the exact natures of which are not recorded but which are known to have caused William great concern . William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service , in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him . In 1843 his older brother Charles , a successful planter in Java , returned to England after over 30 years abroad . William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles , a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine ; Charles returned to Java in 1845 . In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott , one of William 's regular customers who owned some of his pictures . Gillott was married with children , and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern . In 1848 , William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment ; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement . Betsy did eventually join him in York , and was present at his death . 
 = = = The Combat = = = 
 Spurred by the reception of Pandora , in 1825 Etty exhibited his most ambitious work to date , The Combat : Woman Pleading for the Vanquished . This was a huge canvas , 399 cm ( 13 ft 1 in ) across , showing a woman pleading for the life of a defeated soldier as another soldier prepares to kill him . Highly unusually for a history painting at the time , Etty did not base The Combat on an incident from literature , religion or history , but instead painted a scene entirely from his own imagination , based on an idea which had first occurred to him in 1821 . ( He was later to describe this type of painting as " that class of compositions called by the Romans Visions , not having their origin in history or poetry " . ) 
 The Combat was extremely well received , even by critics who had previously been hostile to Etty . In terms of composition and technique it was considered as equalling or even surpassing Titian and Veronese , and one critic considered it " one of the finest and most masterly works that ever graced the walls of the Royal Academy " , while those critics who had previously dismissed Etty for his supposed obscenity reconsidered their opinions in light of it . The Combat continued to be one of Etty 's best @-@ regarded works , and formed the basis of a successful 1848 engraving by George Thomas Doo . 
 Following the success of The Combat , Etty painted a further four very large paintings . One was on the well @-@ worn theme of the Judgement of Paris , exhibited in 1826 , and three were on the theme of Judith beheading Holofernes , the first of which was exhibited in 1827 . Unlike other artists who had painted this subject , Etty 's Judith paintings did not show the actual beheading , as he hoped to avoid " the offensive and revolting butchery , some have delighted and even revelled in " . The first Judith picture in particular was extremely well received critically . 
 = = = Royal Academician = = = 
 In February 1828 , shortly before his 41st birthday , Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician , at the time the highest honour available to an artist . By this time , complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface . All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure , and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity . 
 For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures ; The World Before the Flood , Venus , the Evening Star and Guardian <unk> . ( The latter was a portrait of the children of <unk> Ellis Agar , 2nd Earl of Normanton , and was the only non @-@ nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s . ) Although similar to his earlier works , they were technically more accomplished . Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums , although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood — a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes — drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman 's Magazine that it " will serve to accompany the private <unk> of that nobleman " . Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity , respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise , and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £ 100 in recognition of his talent . 
 As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over , Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece , without which he could not become a Royal Academician . This piece , Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs , was presented to the Academy in October , and in December 1828 Etty finally became a Royal Academician . 
 It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life , that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered ( if God approve ) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable and happy , which I hope if it please Him , to be able to do by the time I am fifty — by occasionally mixing with my historic pictures a Portrait or two , and to vary and extend my sphere — a classic Landscape or two so that if I can get about 100 a year I may be enabled to retire to my dear native city and spend my latter days in peace . 
 = = = = Life classes = = = = 
 Even after he had achieved status as a full Royal Academician , Etty regularly attended life classes ; fellow artist John Constable sarcastically wrote that " Etty [ sets ] an excellent example to the <unk> [ sic ] for regularity " . His contemporaries considered this at best peculiar and at worst extremely inappropriate , complaining that for someone in his senior position to attend classes as a student was both unprofessional and unnecessary , and that it damaged the standing of the position of Academician ; there were complaints that he had far outlasted the official student term of 10 years . Etty refused to give up attendance , offering to resign rather than give up his studies , and the Academy grudgingly allowed him to continue to attend classes . He divided his time between the RA 's own life classes and those at nearby St. Martin 's Lane . 
 Etty generally finished life studies during three evenings sittings . On the first evening he would sketch the model in charcoal or chalk , and then ink in the outline . On the second he used oil paints to fill in the figures . On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint . He usually painted on millboard , re @-@ using the reverse for fresh paintings . His female models were typically shop @-@ girls , prostitutes , actresses or poses plastiques models , while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks , who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique , or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses . 
 = = = = Hero and Leander = = = = 
 In the wake of Etty 's elevation to Academician , he exhibited two paintings at the Summer Exhibition in 1829 , Benaiah , David 's Chief Captain and Hero , Having Thrown Herself from the Tower at the Sight of Leander Drowned , Dies on his Body . Benaiah is on the same large scale as The Combat at 398 cm ( 13 ft 1 in ) wide , and is a very similar composition , although in place of the woman begging for mercy is the body of a dead soldier . Hero recycles the pose of the dead soldier from Benaiah as the dying Hero as she lies on the body of her dead lover . Unusually for Etty , Hero is painted in intentionally neutral tones rather than his usual Venetian colours , and the composition uses foreshortening of the bodies to create a single diagonal across the canvas . For the rest of his life , Etty considered Hero to be " the finest of my fine pictures " . 
 On 7 January 1830 Etty 's mentor Thomas Lawrence died , followed on 30 July by Etty 's mother . Etty was devastated by the loss , and was one of those considered to replace Lawrence as President of the Royal Academy , although in the event he did not stand for election . Possibly distracted by the death of Lawrence , Etty only submitted three paintings to the Summer Exhibition that year . One of these , Judith Going Forth , was an addition to Judith , which had been commissioned the previous year by that painting 's new owners , the Royal Scottish Academy . 
 = = = = Candaules = = = = 
 Of Etty 's two original works exhibited at the RA in 1830 , The Storm , inspired by Psalm 22 , attracted little interest and was dismissed by The Gentleman 's Magazine — typically a staunch supporter of Etty 's work — as " a sad failure " . The other painting exhibited was Candaules , King of Lydia , <unk> his Wife by Stealth to Gyges , One of his Ministers , as She Goes to Bed , which was to prove one of the most controversial works of Etty 's career . Candaules is based on a story from Herodotus in which king Candaules arranges for his servant Gyges to spy on his wife Nyssia undressing without her knowledge . Gyges is discovered and at Nyssia 's behest kills Candaules , marries Nyssia and rules the kingdom in his stead . The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia removes the last of her clothes . By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture , and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia , Etty aimed for the viewer to feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt , forced to spy on his master 's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge . 
 Etty felt that the work illustrated the moral that women are not chattels , and were entitled to punish men who violated their rights . He made little effort to explain this to his audience , and thus Candaules appeared morally highly ambiguous , inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules , the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges . From the moment it was unveiled Candaules was condemned as a cynical mix of a distasteful narrative and pornographic images , and there was near @-@ unanimous consensus that it was inappropriate for public exhibition . The piece remained controversial long after Etty 's death ; Alexander Gilchrist 's overwhelmingly flattering 1855 biography of Etty described it as " almost the only instance among Etty 's works , of an undeniably disagreeable , not to say objectionable subject " , while as late as 2011 Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote of Candaules that " it is perhaps hard to see the painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and <unk> " . Candaules was bought by wealthy collector Robert Vernon , who was in the process of building a major collection of British art and was to become one of Etty 's most important customers . 
 With the three paintings for the 1830 Summer Exhibition completed , Etty decided to pay another visit to Paris . Etty travelled via Brighton , arriving in Paris in early July 1830 . He found the atmosphere of the city had become unpleasantly hedonistic , writing to Betsy that " If I had a daughter , she should not be educated here . Pleasure and amusement are the idols . " 
 France was in constitutional crisis in 1830 , which reached a peak in late July as the July Revolution began and riots erupted across Paris . Although moved by the death and destruction taking place around him , Etty felt that the purpose of his visit was to study paintings , and continued to attend the Louvre to copy paintings as the violence raged in the surrounding streets . On 31 July he decided to abandon the trip ; abandoning his proposed onward journey to Brussels and Antwerp , he collected the five copies he had made in the Louvre and set off for London . 
 The works Etty painted following his return began to show a departure in style from his previous efforts . While the figures in his previous original paintings had been painted from sketches of models made in the studio or life classes , from now on he began to work from memory , and as a consequence his figures began to appear more idealised ; Farr ( 1958 ) describes his figures from now on as " [ conforming ] less to a particular aspect of the model than to a preconceived notion of what the model ought to look like " . 
 = = = = Youth and Pleasure and The Destroying Angel = = = = 
 In 1832 Etty returned to the theme of A Sketch from One of Gray 's Odes , exhibited in 1822 to such disdain from the press . The result was Youth on the Prow , and Pleasure at the Helm , which remains one of his best known works . Illustrating a passage from The Bard , a poem by Thomas Gray , Youth and Pleasure has been described as " a poetic romance " . It shows a gilded boat being propelled by the breath of a nude child on the sails ; one nude figure representing Pleasure languidly holds the helm of the boat . A nude child blows bubbles , which another nude on the prow of the ship , representing Youth , reaches to catch . Naiads , again nude , swim around and clamber onto the boat . 
 The Bard was about the English destruction of Welsh culture and the subsequent decline of the House of Plantagenet and its replacement by the Welsh House of Tudor , and there was a general feeling among critics that Etty had misunderstood the point of the metaphors used by Gray . Etty claimed that his unusual interpretation of the text was intended to create " a general allegory of Human Life , its empty vain pleasures — if not founded on the laws of Him who is the Rock of Ages " , and that the painting served as a moral warning about the pursuit of empty pleasure . This explanation appears to have left critics unconvinced . Even those critics most favourable towards Etty 's technical accomplishments in creating the picture found it hard to ascertain what the painting was supposed to represent ; other critics were more openly hostile , with The Morning Chronicle condemning it as " indulgence of what we once hoped a classical , but which are now convinced , is a lascivious mind " . Purchased for a huge sum by Robert Vernon on its exhibition , Youth and Pleasure remained controversial long after Etty 's death , with Farr 's 1958 biography describing it as " singularly inept " . 
 Also exhibited at the 1832 Summer Exhibition along with Youth and Pleasure was The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate , seen as a riposte by Etty to his critics . Another of what Etty deemed " visions " , depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than one from literature , mythology or history , The Destroying Angel shows an imaginary classical temple under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons . The human figures , intentionally painted in paler tones than usual to suggest death , each show their fear in a different way . Painted soon after his 1830 travels , it is thought that the heaped corpses and terrified crowds were directly inspired by events Etty had witnessed in Paris . 
 Unlike Youth and Pleasure , the critical response to The Destroying Angel was generally favourable even from those critics usually hostile to Etty . The painting generated favourable comparisons to Michelangelo and Rubens , and Etty 's early supporter William Carey ( writing under the name of " Ridolfi " ) considered it to be evidence of Etty 's " redeeming grace and spirit " . The painting was explicitly seen as a renunciation by Etty of his previous nude studies , with Fraser 's Magazine described it as " a sermon to [ Etty 's ] admirers ... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants , their revels being broken in upon , and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously , like that little gentleman Don Juan , by sundry grim @-@ looking brawny devils " . 
 At around this time Etty began to receive many unsolicited letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers . Myers was a huge admirer of Etty , and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as to appeal to the nobility ; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844 . Although eccentric and largely incoherent ( one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy ) , Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers 's suggestions seriously . 
 = = = Illness and recovery = = = 
 In mid @-@ 1833 Etty began a portrait of the daughters of Charles Watkin Williams @-@ Wynn , the long @-@ serving Conservative Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire , shown Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball . Etty was then little @-@ known for portraits , but had recently completed Elizabeth Potts , a portrait of the daughter of a family friend , which although poorly received by some critics was technically highly accomplished . He said at the time that he hoped his portrait of the Williams @-@ Wynn children would be " one of my best " . 
 In February 1834 , Etty became seriously ill , and was incapacitated for four months . Unable to paint , he exhibited only two already @-@ completed paintings in the 1834 Summer Exhibition , Elizabeth Potts and The Cardinal . In June of that year he left London to convalesce , renting a cottage in York . Weak and unable to concentrate , Etty painted very little , and spend the next few months visiting friends and touring the sights of Yorkshire . Gradually regaining his health , he returned to London in December 1834 , and resumed work on those paintings he had left incomplete on the onset of his illness . 
 Making up for lost time during illness , he completed several significant works over the next few months , and exhibited eight paintings at the 1835 Summer Exhibition . These included works now considered among his most significant . The Bridge of Sighs , Venice was based on sketches made by Etty during his visit to that city in the early 1820s . It shows the aftermath of an execution , as two men haul the body away to be thrown into the sea ; it was described as " poetry on canvas " by William Macready , who bought it from Etty . Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball was the portrait of the daughters of Charles Watkin Williams @-@ Wynn which Etty had begun in 1833 . Etty had put far more work into this than was usual for a portrait , remarking to the Williams @-@ Wynn family that he intended " to make a fine work of Art as well as a resemblance " . Showing Williams @-@ Wynn 's daughters Charlotte and Mary in elaborate Italian @-@ style costumes , it was critically well received as evidence that Etty was able to paint a major work that did not rely on nudity , as well as demonstrating that Etty could paint on commission for the elite , leading to further commissions . The Warrior Arming was a study of Godfrey de <unk> painted to satisfy the then @-@ current fad for medievalism . Etty had recently developed an interest in collecting pieces of armour , and The Warrior Arming is a technically adept study of the effects of lights from multiple sources shining on polished armour . 
 The most contentious of Etty 's 1835 RA exhibits was Venus and Her Satellites , a depiction of the Toilet of Venus . This was condemned in much of the press as pornographic , and was described as having a " total absence of soul " , with The Observer in particular extremely hostile , calling for the Archbishop of Canterbury to become involved in chastising Etty for his lack of taste . Despite this condemnation , Etty considered Venus and her Satellites one of his best works , and sold it to Rev. Edward Pryce Owen for the substantial sum of 300 guineas ( about £ 28 @,@ 000 in 2016 terms ) in August . 
 We must , indeed , be more serious with this gentleman [ Etty ] than is our wont , for the " Society for the Suppression of Vice " are not to be excused for their prosecutions in cases of obscene publications , and the Lord Mayor himself deserves at once to be sent to the tread @-@ mill for imprisoning a little Italian boy for hawking about the streets a naked Cupid , if such lascivious scenes , such gross insults to morality and decency , are allowed to be exhibited at the Roy . <unk> with impunity . A Brothel on fire , which had driven all the <unk> Nymphs out from their beds into the court @-@ yard , would be a modest exhibition compared to this — for they would at least exhibit en chemise . Several ladies , we know , were deterred from going into this corner of the room to see Leslie 's , Webster 's , and other pictures of great merit there , to avoid the offence and disgrace Mr. E. has conferred on that quarter ... Really , really , if Mr. E. , with all his power of colour , turn his drawings of the human figure to no <unk> purpose — if the absence of all taste and decency is to mark his Academical studies , it is high time that he had a hint from an authority which neither he nor the Council of the Academy will dare to treat slightly . The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of our Bishops are fond of the arts — what say they to them in this shape ? 
 In August 1835 Etty spent a brief holiday in Shropshire , where he delivered Venus and Her Satellites to Owen . While en route back he made a detour to Manchester to visit an art exhibition ; while there he made the acquaintance of wealthy cotton merchant Daniel Grant . 
 = = = Etty and York = = = 
 After Jonathan Martin 's arson attack on York Minster in 1829 caused major damage , there were proposals by the dean and chapter to take the opportunity of the destruction to restructure the interior of the building . Etty was prominent in the effort to resist the redesign and to restore the building to its original state . A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful , and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831 . 
 By the time of the Minster fire , the Corporation of York ( the body responsible for local government ) was already engaged in a debate about the future of the city 's defensive walls . The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain , and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous . The city gates ( " Bars " ) had become a public health hazard given the number of locals using them as toilets , and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable . The Bars restricted stagecoaches , meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London – Edinburgh route . Faced with the need to clear the city 's slums , in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of the walls . Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned , but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished . In the face of this a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824 , but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire . In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals , but distracted by the need to complete Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs was unable to take any action himself . By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls . 
 In February 1832 Etty began a campaign of writing to local York newspapers urging the preservation of the walls , and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention . Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation in light of the damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade , many locals — whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry — remained hostile to the preservation campaigns . A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to a railway station within the walls galvanised Etty , and he delivered two lectures on the preservation of the walls during visits to York in 1838 – 39 , and made four paintings of the Bars . Etty 's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls , much to his dismay , although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the running of trains to both north and south . While the walls were eventually saved in 1889 , many years after Etty 's death , Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation . It is open to debate how significant his part was . Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and the preservation of the walls was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers , while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like @-@ minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so . 
 In 1838 , Etty started lobbying for the establishment of an art school in York . He proposed that the Hospitium of St Mary 's Abbey be used for this purpose , with the lower floor becoming a museum of sculpture and the upper floor becoming a school and exhibition hall . The Hospitium scheme was abandoned , but the York School of Design duly opened on a different site in 1842 . Although the school was created by an artist who had built his reputation on nudes , nude art remained controversial . In 1847 , following a complaint from a female student about a display of replicas of Ancient Greek sculptures , " the master was requested to have the penis of each of the offending statues cut off [ ... ] a proceeding that called forth the indignation of the male students and the remonstrances of even the lady students " . 
 = = Later life ( 1836 – 49 ) = = 
 In 1836 architect John Harper arranged a small exhibition in York of works by modern artists , which included 11 Etty paintings . This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves , which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant . Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest , and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years . Harper did take the opportunity to buy Etty 's A Family of the Forest ( also known as Flowers of the Forest ) , which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition . A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony , dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain , misery or the need to work . The setting sun in the background and the man looking away from the woman and child , and instead into the distance , signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end . 
 By this time , Etty was becoming conflicted religiously . Although he had been raised as a Methodist , following Catholic emancipation in 1829 Etty became increasingly drawn to Roman Catholicism . Although he considered himself " in [ my ] heart 's core deeply and sincerely of the Ancient Faith " , he refused formally to convert to Catholicism owing to concerns that it would upset his family and friends , worries that he would be denied access to Anglican buildings such as York Minster , and a distaste for the concept of auricular ( spoken ) confession . He remained closely associated with Catholicism throughout his later life , and was one of the few non @-@ Catholics to attend the 1838 opening of Augustus Pugin 's chapel for St Mary 's College , Oscott , at the time the most important Roman Catholic building in England . 
 = = = The Sirens and Ulysses = = = 
 Also in 1836 Etty began work on The Sirens and Ulysses , which he considered among his greatest works , and which is his largest surviving painting . Measuring 442 @.@ 5 cm by 297 cm ( 14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in ) Sirens was based on a passage from Homer 's Odyssey in which sailors resist the irresistible song of the Sirens . The theme and scale of the painting were probably suggested to Etty by Thomas Myers , who had been encouraging Etty to paint very large canvases . Myers 's suggested theme appealed to Etty , who later wrote that it illustrated " the importance of resisting Sensual Delights " . Etty made every effort to ensure realism in the picture , going as far as to visit mortuaries to sketch corpses in varying stages of decay to ensure the accuracy of the cadavers on the beach . 
 When Etty completed Sirens in 1837 , it was one of the main attractions at the 1837 Summer Exhibition , the first to be held in the Royal Academy 's new building in Trafalgar Square ( now part of the National Gallery ) . The painting , with its juxtaposition of male and female nudity and decaying corpses , immediately divided opinion . Some critics considered it one of the finest artworks ever made , with The Gentleman 's Magazine particularly taken with the work , describing Sirens as " a historical work of the first class " and " by far the best that Mr. Etty ever painted " . Other critics were less kind ; The Spectator considered it " a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome <unk> — glowing in colour and wonderful in execution , but conceived in the worst possible taste " . 
 Possibly because of its size , The Sirens and Ulysses failed to sell at the Summer Exhibition . In October 1837 Etty met again with Daniel Grant who , without having seen the painting , offered £ 250 ( about £ 20 @,@ 000 in today 's terms ) for Sirens and for Samson and Delilah , also exhibited by Etty that year . Etty , poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio , sold both paintings to Grant for well below their true worth . Etty had used a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which flaked when dry , and as soon as it was complete Sirens began to deteriorate . It was shown at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition but then considered in too poor a condition for further public display , and placed in long @-@ term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor , the Manchester Art Gallery . In 2006 restoration began on it , and in May 2010 Sirens was returned to public display and is now one of the key works in the Manchester Art Gallery . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 After Sirens , Etty 's output remained as high as ever , with seven paintings exhibited at the 1838 Summer Exhibition , but the quality of his work is generally considered to have gone into decline . By 1838 critics began to comment that Etty 's paintings were no longer inventive but simply reworkings of his earlier paintings , while in June of that year William Makepeace Thackeray ( under the pen name of Michael Angelo <unk> ) wrote that " [ Etty ] is , like great men , lazy , or indifferent , perhaps , about public approbation " . By 1839 , criticisms of Etty were being raised in even those newspapers and journals which had previously championed his work . A new type of criticism of Etty also began to appear in 1839 , from a new generation led by The Art Union , who praised Etty 's technical abilities but saw his choice of subjects as out of touch and anachronistic , and " very frequently doing as little good for mankind as the priest who preaches his sermon in Latin " . 
 From around this time onwards , while Etty still held to his belief that the purpose of art is to illustrate moral lessons , he began to abandon the literary , religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work . He began to paint still lifes , beginning with Pheasant and Peach ( likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit ) ; in the 1840s he exhibited six in total , and painted many more . Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes , which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form . Also for the first time , he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings . Etty still continued to paint history paintings , but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures , those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received . Etty 's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers ; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty , and by 1844 had a near @-@ monopoly on his work . As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined , the new purchasers of art were industrialists ; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters , they preferred to buy works by then @-@ contemporary artists such as Etty , and relied on dealers to advise them . 
 In May 1840 , Etty finally made the trip to Brussels and Antwerp which he had been forced by revolution to abandon in 1830 . He intended to study the works of Rubens , but the briefness of his tour — in the company of Betsy Etty he visited Ostend , Bruges , Antwerp , Brussels , Aachen , Cologne , Bonn and Rotterdam in the course of ten days — meant he had little time for study . The following year he returned to Antwerp and Mechelen for a longer visit to visit St. Rumbold 's Cathedral and to study the substantial collections of Rubens paintings in the two cities . On this second journey he twice visited a Trappist monastery outside Antwerp , staying overnight on one visit , and bought a Trappist habit ; he also bought a Capuchin habit from a monastery in Bruges . These acquisitions prompted paintings on monastic themes over subsequent years . 
 Despite a perceived decline in his work 's quality , the 1840s were the most financially successful of Etty 's career . His income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class , and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared , Etty was in a position to invest money for the first time . By 1841 Etty had around £ 300 invested , rising to £ 8500 in 1845 and £ 17 @,@ 000 in 1849 . He continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than Betsy Etty , writing in his diary in 1843 that " being in sound Mind and Body I declare it to be my Firm Intention NEVER TO <unk> . In which resolution I pray GOD to help me that I may devote myself purely to my Art , my Country , and my GOD ! " 
 In May 1843 , Etty was one of eight artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes on the theme of Milton 's Comus for a new pavilion being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace . Etty was unhappy with his selection , as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience , but reluctantly did so , choosing to paint on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three . The result was a disaster . Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work , as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer , and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures . Etty 's fresco was deemed unsalvageable , and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected , and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco . Etty was paid only a token £ 40 fee . 
 The perceived lack of respect shown to one of England 's leading artists led to some outcry , and attacks in the press upon the then very unpopular Albert ; William Makepeace Thackeray wrote in 1845 : " Think of the greatest patronage in the world giving forty pounds for pictures worth four hundred — condescending to buy works from humble men who could not refuse , and paying for them below their value ! Think of august powers and principalities ordering the works of such a great artist as Etty to be hacked out of the palace @-@ wall ! That was a slap in the face to every artist in England . " 
 In August 1843 , during a break from his work on the fresco , Etty made what was to prove his final overseas journey . Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of Joan of Arc , and he wanted to visit places associated with her . Setting out on 16 August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen , Paris and Orléans associated with her life . Unlike Etty 's disastrous prior visits to France , this journey passed without incident , and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living . 
 = = = = Musidora and Joan of Arc = = = = 
 In the same year , Etty painted the first version of Musidora : The Bather ' At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed ' , an illustration from the poem Summer by James Thomson and arguably Etty 's last history painting painted while he still had all his powers . Musidora shows a scene in which the titular character , having removed the last of her clothes , steps into " the lucid coolness of the flood " to " bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream " , unknowing that she is being watched by her suitor Damon . Etty 's composition is shown from the viewpoint of Damon ; by so doing Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon 's dilemma as described by Thomson ; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate , or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away , in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as " a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome " . Musidora met with almost universal acclaim , compared favourably to Titian and Rembrandt , and described by The Critic as " a preeminent work " and " the triumph of the British school " . 
 By the time Musidora was exhibited , Etty 's health was in serious decline . Suffering severe asthma , it was not unusual for passers @-@ by to accuse him of drunkenness as he made his way wheezing through the London streets , and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York . Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable , he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out . This was on a huge scale , 28 ft ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) in total width and 9 ft 9 in ( 3 m ) high ; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country , Joan scattering the enemies of France , and Joan dying a martyr . 
 Etty sold the triptych for the huge sum of 2500 guineas ( about £ 220 @,@ 000 in 2016 terms ) to dealer Richard Colls and the engraver C. W. Wass . Colls and Wass had ambitious plans to recoup their money by selling engravings of the pictures and by taking the paintings on a tour of Britain and Europe . The paintings proved less popular than expected . Very few engravings were sold and the tours did not take place ; Wass declared bankruptcy in 1852 . The paintings were separated , and sold on to a series of buyers , with the third panel fetching just 71 ⁄ 2 guineas in 1893 as Etty 's popularity continued to wane . By the 1950s all three panels of Joan of Arc were believed lost or destroyed , although some preliminary studies survive . 
 = = = Retrospective and death = = = 
 Following the completion of Joan of Arc , Etty 's health continued to deteriorate . He continued to paint and exhibit , but his retirement plans grew firmer . In April 1846 he bought a house in Coney Street , central York , as a retirement home , and in December 1847 he formally resigned from the Council of the Royal Academy . Following structural alterations to give him a better view of the river , Etty moved into the house in June 1848 , completing the move in September of that year , although he retained his London apartments . His move from London caused some consternation among that city 's models , who were losing one of their most regular customers , as well as concerns from Etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in York . 
 He continued to exhibit , sending seven paintings to that year 's Summer Exhibition , but they drew little interest , although the lack of nudes was applauded by some reviewers . By this time , Robert Vernon 's bequest of his collection to the nation had led to eleven Etty paintings going on public display in the cellars of the National Gallery . In late 1848 he wrote a brief autobiography , published the following year in The Art Journal , in which he staunchly defended himself against the accusations of pornography which had been levelled at him throughout his life : 
 As a worshipper of beauty , whether it be seen in a weed , a flower , or in that most interesting form to humanity , lovely woman , in intense admiration of it and its Almighty Author , if at any time I have forgotten the boundary line that I ought not to have passed , and tended to voluptuousness , I implore His pardon ; I have never wished to seduce others from that path and practice of virtue , which alone leads to happiness here and hereafter ; and if in any of my pictures an immoral sentiment has been aimed at , I consent it should be burnt ; but I never recollect being actuated in painting my pictures by such sentiment . That the female form , in its fulness , beauty of colour , exquisite <unk> , may , by being portrayed in its nudity , awake like nature in some degree an approach to passion , I must allow , but where no immoral sentiment is intended , I affirm that the simple undisguised naked figure is innocent . " To the pure in heart all things are pure . " 
 In 1849 , the Royal Society of Arts decided to organise a retrospective exhibition of Etty 's work , the first since the minor York exhibition of 1836 . Etty agreed only on condition that all nine of his large works were included . The three Joan of Arc paintings were in London and easily accessible , and the Royal Scottish Academy was happy to lend The Combat , Benaiah and the Judith triptych , but the Royal Manchester Institution was deeply reluctant to lend The Sirens and Ulysses in light of concerns that transporting it would damage the fragile paintwork further . They were eventually persuaded to lend the piece after Etty and some of his friends visited Manchester to personally request they release it . The exhibition duly went ahead from 9 June to 25 August 1849 , bringing together 133 Etty paintings for the first time ; Etty hoped that it would raise public awareness of his abilities , writing to his friend Rev. Isaac Spencer " Please God , I will give them a taste of my quality " . The exhibition was well received and well attended ; even Etty 's old adversaries at the Morning Chronicle recommending that readers " lose no time in visiting this collection " . However , it was a financial disaster for the Royal Society of Arts , faced with the cost of transporting large numbers of delicate artworks from around the country . 
 During the exhibition Etty suffered a serious bout of rheumatic fever . Exhausted by illness and the stress of the exhibition , when the exhibition was complete he returned to York in very poor health . On 3 November 1849 he suffered a serious asthma attack , thought to have been made worse by his neglecting to wear his flannel undershirt the night before . His condition deteriorated rapidly , and by 10 November he was bedridden . On Tuesday 13 November , watching the sun set over the River Ouse , he was heard to say " Wonderful ! Wonderful ! This death ! " Later that night , Betsy Etty wrote to Joseph Gillott that " Uncle paid the last debt to nature at 1 ⁄ 4 past Eight <unk> tonight . I do not know what to do . I am almost broken hearted . I have lost my best friend . I now [ sic ] not what to do . I can say no more . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster , but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will . With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson , there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees , and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave 's Church , his local parish church . On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned , in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings ; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value . In the years following his death Etty 's work became highly collectable , his works fetching huge sums on resale . He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some , with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 " It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects , in very many instances , recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art ; while we may fully believe that he himself , thinking and meaning no evil , was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds " . 
 Six months after William 's death , Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington , a distant relation of the Etty family . She moved into his house in Haymarket , and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square , where she died in 1888 at the age of 87 . 
 While Etty did have admirers , the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement , now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre @-@ Raphaelite Brotherhood . William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais , two of the three founders of the Pre @-@ Raphaelites , were heavily influenced by Etty 's early works but recoiled from his later style . Holman Hunt recollected that " in my youth [ Etty ] had lost the robustness he once had [ ... ] the paintings of his advanced age <unk> the taste by their sweetness " . Millais had consciously modelled his style on Etty , and his works prior to the formation of the Pre @-@ Raphaelites are very similar in composition , but after 1848 the only similarity in style is the use of colour . As Pre @-@ Raphaelitism waned Millais 's style became more varied , and some of his later work such as The Knight Errant owes a strong debt to Etty 's influence . 
 During his life Etty had acquired followers such as Irish painters William Mulready and Daniel Maclise , but both rejected Etty 's preoccupation with nudes . Mulready painted nudes but became best known for domestic genre paintings , while Maclise chose to specialise in more traditional history paintings and exhibited only one nude work in his career . One of the few painters who consciously attempted to continue Etty 's style after his death was William Edward Frost , who had been an acquaintance of Etty 's since 1825 . In the early 1830s Frost painted on commission for Thomas Potts ( whose 1833 commission of Etty to paint his daughter Elizabeth 's portrait had been Etty 's first significant portrait commission ) , and later was commissioned on Etty 's recommendation to paint a portrait of Etty 's cousin Thomas Bodley . Frost successfully imitated Etty throughout his career , to the extent that his figure studies and Etty 's are often misattributed to each other . Although Frost eventually became a Royal Academician in 1870 , by this time Etty 's style of painting had badly fallen out of fashion . 
 Victorian painting had gone through radical changes , and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre @-@ Raphaelites had given way to the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement , abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject . Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting , these works were in a very different style to Etty 's . The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne @-@ Jones , Lawrence Alma @-@ Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity , rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world . By the end of the 19th century , the value of all of Etty 's works had fallen below their original prices . As the 20th century began , the increasingly influential Modernist movement , which came to dominate British art in the 20th century , drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th @-@ century British painting . 
 In 1911 the city of York belatedly recognised Etty . A statue of Etty by G. W. Milburn was unveiled on 1 February outside the York Art Gallery , and a retrospective of 164 Etty paintings was held at the gallery despite opposition from some of Etty 's descendants who refused to lend works for it . William Wallace Hargrove , proprietor of the York Herald , gave a speech recalling his memories of knowing Etty . Outside York , Etty generally remained little @-@ known , with the majority of those galleries holding his works , other than the Lady Lever Art Gallery , the Russell @-@ Cotes Museum and Anglesey Abbey , tending to keep them in storage . Minor Etty exhibitions in London in 1936 and 1938 had little impact , and likewise an exhibition of 30 Etty paintings in 1948 to mark the reopening of the York Art Gallery and another York exhibition of 108 paintings the following year to mark the centenary of his death . In 2001 – 02 four Etty paintings were included in Tate Britain 's landmark Exposed : The Victorian Nude exhibition , which did much to raise Etty 's profile , and established Etty as " the first British artist to paint the nude with both seriousness and consistency " . The restoration of The Sirens and Ulysses , completed in 2010 , led to increased interest in Etty , and in 2011 – 12 a major exhibition of Etty 's works was held at the York Art Gallery . The York Art Gallery continues to hold the largest collection of Etty 's works . 
 = King Charles Spaniel = 
 The King Charles Spaniel ( also known as the English Toy Spaniel ) is a small dog breed of the spaniel type . In 1903 , the Kennel Club combined four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title . The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim , Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels , each of which contributed one of the four colours available in the breed . 
 Thought to have originated in the Far East , toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century . They were made famous by their association with King Charles II of England ( 1630 – 1685 ) and have been linked with English royalty since the time of Queen Mary I ( 1516 – 1558 ) . Members of the breed have been owned by Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia , Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II . 
 The King Charles Spaniel and the other types of toy spaniels were crossbred with the Pug in the early 19th century to reduce the size of the nose , as was the style of the day . The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II 's time . These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . The Cavalier is slightly larger , with a flat head and a longer nose , while the King Charles is smaller , with a domed head and a flat face . 
 Historically the breeds that were merged into the King Charles Spaniel were used for hunting ; due to their stature they were not well suited . They have kept their hunting instincts , but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs . The modern breed is prone to several health problems , including cardiac conditions and a range of eye issues . 
 = = History = = 
 It is thought that the toy spaniels that eventually became the King Charles Spaniel originated in the Far East , primarily Japan . They may share a common ancestry with the Pekingese and Japanese Chin . Toy spaniels were given as gifts to European royalty . 
 The red and white variety of toy spaniel was first seen in paintings by Titian , including the Venus of Urbino ( 1538 ) , where a small dog is used as a symbol of female seductiveness . Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century . These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses , although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today . These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs . The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy @-@ sized spaniels . 
 The earliest recorded appearance of a toy spaniel in England was in a painting of Queen Mary I and King Philip . Mary , Queen of Scots ( 1542 – 1587 ) , was also fond of small toy dogs , including spaniels , showing the fondness of the British royalty for these types of dogs before Charles II . 
 King Henry III of France ( 1551 – 1589 ) owned a number of small spaniels , which were called <unk> . Although one of the translations of John Caius ' 1570 Latin work De Canibus <unk> talks of " a new type of Spaniel brought out of France , rare , strange , and hard to get " , this was an addition in a later translation , and was not in the original text . Caius did discuss the " <unk> @-@ gentle , or Comforter " though , which he classified as a delicate thoroughbred . This spaniel was thought to originate from Malta and was sought out only as a lapdog for " <unk> dames " . 
 Captain John Saris may have brought back examples of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613 , a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan on behalf of the United States in the mid ‐ 19th century . He noted that dogs were a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England . 
 = = = 17th century and Charles II = = = 
 In the 17th century , toy spaniels began to feature in paintings by Dutch artists such as Caspar <unk> and Peter Paul Rubens . Spanish artists , including Juan de Valdés Leal and Diego Velázquez , also depicted them ; in the Spanish works , the dogs were tricolour , black and white or entirely white . French naturalist Georges @-@ Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon would later describe these types of dogs as crosses between spaniels and Pugs . 
 Charles II of England was very fond of the toy spaniel , which is why the dogs now carry his name , although there is no evidence that the modern breeds are descended from his particular dogs . He is credited with causing an increase in popularity of the breed during this period . Samuel Pepys ' diary describes how the spaniels were allowed to roam anywhere in Whitehall Palace , including during state occasions . In an entry dated 1 September 1666 , describing a council meeting , Pepys wrote , " All I observed there was the silliness of the King , playing with his dog all the while and not minding the business . " Charles ' sister Princess Henrietta was painted by Pierre <unk> holding a small red and white toy @-@ sized spaniel . Judith Blunt @-@ Lytton , 16th Baroness Wentworth , writing in her 1911 work Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors , theorised that after Henrietta 's death at the age of 26 in 1670 , Charles took her dogs for himself . 
 = = = After Charles II = = = 
 Toy spaniels continued to be popular in the British court during the reign of King James II , through that of Queen Anne . Popular types included those of the white and red variety . Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II , the Pug was introduced into Britain which would eventually lead to drastic physical changes to the King Charles Spaniel . Comparisons between needlework pictures of English toy spaniels and the continental variety show that changes had already begun to take place in the English types by 1736 , with a shorter nose being featured and the breed overall moving away from the one seen in earlier works by Anthony van Dyck during the 17th century . 
 English toy spaniels remained popular enough during the 18th century to be featured frequently in literature and in art . On Rover , a Lady 's Spaniel , Jonathan Swift 's satire of Ambrose Philips 's poem to the daughter of the Lord Lieutenant , describes the features of an English toy , specifying a " forehead large and high " among other physical characteristics of the breeds . Toy spaniels and Pugs were featured in both group portraits and satirical works by William Hogarth . Toy spaniels were still popular with the upper classes as ladies ' dogs , despite the introduction of the Pug ; both Thomas Gainsborough 's portrait of Queen Charlotte from 1781 and George Romney 's 1782 Lady Hamilton as Nature feature toy spaniels with their mistresses . The toy spaniels of this century weighed as little as 5 pounds ( 2 @.@ 3 kg ) , although they were thought to be the dog breed most prone to becoming overweight , or " fattened " . 
 = = = 19th century and the Blenheim Spaniel = = = 
 The varieties of toy spaniel were occasionally used in hunting , as the Sportsman 's Repository reported in 1830 of the Blenheim Spaniel : " Twenty years ago , His Grace the Duke of Marlborough was reputed to possess the smallest and best breed of cockers in Britain ; they were invariably red – and – white , with very long ears , short noses , and black eyes . " During this period , the term " cocker " was not used to describe a Cocker Spaniel , but rather a type of small spaniel used to hunt woodcock . The Duke 's residence , Blenheim Palace , gave its name to the Blenheim Spaniel . The Sportsman 's Repository explains that toy spaniels are able to hunt , albeit not for a full day or in difficult terrain : " The very delicate and small , or ' carpet spaniels , ' have exquisite nose , and will hunt truly and pleasantly , but are neither fit for a long day or thorny covert . " This idea was supported by Vero Shaw in his 1881 work The Illustrated Book of the Dog , and by Thomas Brown in 1829 who wrote , " He is seldom used for field – sports , from his diminutive size , being easily tired , and is too short in the legs to get through swampy ground . " During the 19th century , the Maltese was still considered to be a type of spaniel , and thought to be the parent breed of toy spaniels , including both the King Charles and Blenheim varieties . 
 The breeds of toy spaniel often rivalled the Pug in popularity as lapdogs for ladies . The disadvantage of the breeds of toy spaniel was that their long coats required constant grooming . By 1830 , the toy spaniel had changed somewhat from the dogs of Charles II 's day . William Youatt in his 1845 study , The Dog , was not enamoured of the changes : " The King Charles 's breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse . The muzzle is almost as short , and the forehead as ugly and prominent as the <unk> bull @-@ dog . The eye is increased to double its former size , and has an expression of stupidity with which the character of the dog too accurately corresponds . " Youatt did concede that the breed 's long ears , coat and colouring were attractive . Due to the fashion of the period , the toy spaniels were crossed with Pugs to reduce the size of their noses and then selectively bred to reduce it further . By doing this , the dog 's sense of smell was impaired , and according to 19th century writers , this caused the varieties of toy spaniel to be removed from participation in field sports . Blunt @-@ Lytton proposed that the red and white Blenheim Spaniels always had the shorter nose now seen in the modern King Charles . 
 From the 16th century , it was the fashion for ladies to carry small toy @-@ sized spaniels as they travelled around town . These dogs were called " <unk> " and given the species biological classification of Canis <unk> by 19th @-@ century dog writers . By the 1830s , this practice was no longer in vogue , and these types of spaniels were becoming rarer . " Comforter " was given as a generic term to lapdogs , including the Maltese , the English Toy and Continental Toy Spaniels , the latter of which was similar to the modern <unk> . It was once believed that the dogs possessed some power of healing : in 1607 Edward Topsell repeated Caius ' observation that " these little dogs are good to <unk> the sickness of stomach , being oftentimes thereunto applied as a plaister preservative , or bourne in the <unk> of the diseased and weak person , which effect is performed by their moderate heat . " By the 1840s , " Comforter " had dropped out of use , and the breed had returned to being called Toy Spaniels . The first written occurrence of a ruby coloured toy spaniel was a dog named Dandy , owned by a Mr Garwood in 1875 . 
 The dogs continued to be popular with royalty . Queen Victoria 's first dog was a King Charles Spaniel named Dash . In 1896 , Otto von Bismarck purchased a King Charles Spaniel from an American kennel for $ 1 @,@ 000 . The dog weighed less than 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 9 kg ) , and had been disqualified from the Westminster Kennel Club the previous year on account of its weight . The average price was lower than that paid by Bismarck . In 1899 , the price ranged between $ 50 and $ 200 for a King Charles or Blenheim , with the Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniel ranging between $ 50 and $ 150 . 
 Anne Brontë 's " Flossy , " given to her by the Robinson children when she left her governorship of them , was a King Charles Spaniel .

 In 1903 , the Kennel Club attempted to amalgamate the King James ( black and tan ) , Prince Charles ( tricolour ) , Blenheim and Ruby spaniels into a single breed called the Toy Spaniel . The Toy Spaniel Club , which oversaw those separate breeds , strongly objected , and the argument was only resolved following the intervention of King Edward VII , who made it clear that he preferred the name " King Charles Spaniel " . In 1904 , the American Kennel Club followed suit , combining the four breeds into a single breed known as the English Toy Spaniel . The Japanese Spaniel was also considered a type of toy spaniel , but was not merged into the new breed and was recognised as a breed in its own right . 
 Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia owned a King Charles Spaniel at the time of the shooting of the Romanov family on 17 July 1918 . Eight days later , Nicholas Sokolov of the White Forces found a clearing where he believed the bodies of the Romanov family had been burnt , and discovered the corpse of a King Charles Spaniel at the site . In 1920s , the Duchess of Marlborough bred so many King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace that her husband moved out and later evicted the Duchess herself . 
 Blunt @-@ Lytton documented her attempts in the early 20th century to re @-@ breed the 18th @-@ century type of King Charles Spaniel as seen in the portraits of King Charles II . She used the Toy Trawler Spaniel , a curly haired , mostly black , small to medium @-@ sized spaniel , and cross @-@ bred these dogs with a variety of other breeds , including Blenheim Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels , in unsuccessful attempts to reproduce the earlier style . 
 The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel originated from a competition held by American Roswell Eldridge in 1926 . He offered a prize fund for the best male and female dogs of " Blenheim Spaniels of the old type , as shown in pictures of Charles II of England 's time , long face , no stop , flat skull , not inclined to be domed , with spot in centre of skull . " Breeders entered what they considered to be sub ‐ par King Charles Spaniels . Although Eldridge did not live to see the new breed created , several breeders banded together and created the first breed club for the new Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in 1928 , with the Kennel Club initially listing the new breed as " King Charles Spaniels , Cavalier type " . In 1945 , the Kennel Club recognised the new breed in its own right . The American Kennel Club did not recognise the Cavalier until 1997 . 
 Princess Margaret , Countess of Snowdon , continued the connection between royalty and the King Charles Spaniel , attending Princess Anne 's tenth birthday party with her dog Rolly in 1960 . Elizabeth II has also owned King Charles Spaniels in addition to the dogs most frequently associated with her , the Pembroke Welsh Corgi . 
 In 2008 , the BBC documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed was critical of the breeding of a variety of pedigree breeds including the King Charles Spaniel . The show highlighted issues involving syringomyelia in both the King Charles and Cavalier breeds . Mark Evans , the chief veterinary advisor for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) , said , " Dog shows using current breed standards as the main judging criteria actively encourage both the intentional breeding of deformed and disabled dogs and the inbreeding of closely related animals " ; this opinion was seconded by the Scottish SPCA . Following the programme , the RSPCA ended its sponsorship of the annual Crufts dog show , and the BBC declined to broadcast the event . 
 The King Charles Spaniel is less popular than the Cavalier in both the UK and the US . In 2010 , the Cavalier was the 23rd most popular breed , according to registration figures collected by the American Kennel Club , while the English Toy Spaniel was the 126th . In the UK , according to the Kennel Club , the Cavalier is the most popular breed in the Toy Group , with 8 @,@ 154 puppies registered in 2010 , compared to 199 registrations for King Charles Spaniels . Due to the low number of registrations , the King Charles was identified as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club in 2003 in an effort to help promote the breed . 
 = = Description = = 
 The King Charles has large dark eyes , a short nose , a high domed head and a line of black skin around the mouth . On average , it stands 9 to 11 inches ( 23 to 28 cm ) at the withers , with a small but compact body . The breed has a traditionally docked tail . It has the long pendulous ears typical of a spaniel and its coat comes in four varieties , trait it shares with its offshoot , the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . 
 The four sets of markings reflect the four former breeds from which the modern breed was derived . Black and tan markings are known as " King Charles " , while " Prince Charles " is tricoloured , " Blenheim " is red and white , and " Ruby " is a single @-@ coloured solid rich red . The " King Charles " black and tan markings typically consist of a black coat with mahogany / tan markings on the face , legs and chest and under the tail . The tricoloured " Prince Charles " is mostly white with black patches and mahogany / tan markings in similar locations to the " King Charles " . The " Blenheim " has a white coat with red patches , and should have a distinctive red spot in the center of the skull . 
 King Charles Spaniels are often mistaken for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels . There are several significant differences between the two breeds , the principal being the size . While the Cavalier weighs on average between 13 to 18 pounds ( 5 @.@ 9 to 8 @.@ 2 kg ) , the King Charles is smaller at 8 to 14 pounds ( 3 @.@ 6 to 6 @.@ 4 kg ) . In addition , their facial features , while similar , are distinguishable : the Cavalier 's ears are set higher and its skull is flat , while the King Charles ' is domed . Finally , the muzzle length of the King Charles tends to be shorter than the typical muzzle on a Cavalier . 
 The American Kennel Club has two classes , English Toy Spaniel ( B / PC ) ( Blenheim and Prince Charles ) and English Toy Spaniel ( R / KC ) , while in the UK , the Kennel Club places the breed in a single class . Under the Fédération Cynologique Internationale groups , the King Charles is placed in the English Toy Spaniel section within the Companion and Toy Dog Group , along with the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . 
 = = Temperament = = 
 The King Charles is a friendly breed , to the extent that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds , though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor . It is not a high energy breed , and enjoys the company of family members , being primarily a lapdog . Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them , it will not accept rough handling . It prefers not to be left alone for long periods . Known as one of the quietest toy breeds , it is suitable for apartment living . 
 The breed can tolerate other pets well , although the King Charles still has the hunting instincts of its ancestors and may not always be friendly towards smaller animals . It is intelligent enough to be used for obedience work and , due to its stable temperament , it can be a successful therapy dog for hospitals and nursing homes . 
 = = Health = = 
 A natural bobtail can be found in some members of the breed , which is not a mutation of the T @-@ box gene , and so is allowed under conformation show rules . Health @-@ related research on the breed has been limited , with no major studies conducted in Britain . However , it has been included in studies outside the UK , including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals ( OFA ) in the United States . The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs , and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds , as well as specific breed @-@ associated health conditions . The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years , and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally . 
 = = = Eye and heart conditions = = = 
 The eye problems associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts , corneal dystrophy , <unk> , entropion , microphthalmia , optic disc <unk> , and keratitis . Compared to other breeds , the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of <unk> ( where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye ) . Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions , with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy . 
 Heart conditions related to the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease , in which the mitral valve degrades , causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers of the heart and eventually leading to congestive heart failure . Patent ductus arteriosus , where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs , is also seen and can lead to heart failure . Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable . The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease , where of 105 breeds , the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst , with 2 @.@ 1 % of 189 dogs affected . 
 = = = Other common issues = = = 
 Being a brachycephalic breed , King Charles Spaniels can be sensitive to anesthesia . This is because in brachycephalic dogs , there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity , known as the pharynx , and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs ' narrow airways . These narrow airways can decrease the dogs ' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke . Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue , where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth ; diabetes mellitus , which may be associated with cataracts ; cleft palate and umbilical hernia . The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required , due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds . In another study conducted by the OFA , the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation ; of 75 animals tested , 4 % were found to have the ailment . However , surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years , ranging from 5 @.@ 3 % to 50 % . 
 There are several breed traits which may cause concern as health issues . They include skull issues such as an open fontanelle , where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull ; it is common in dogs under a year old . A complication from that condition is hydrocephalus , also known as water on the brain . This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised . Fused toes , where two or more of the dog 's toes are fused together , may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern . 
 = = Urban myth = = 
 An urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK , overriding " no dog except guide dogs " rules . A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament . This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . 
 The UK Parliament website states : " Contrary to popular rumour , there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster . We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it . " Similarly , there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK . A spokesman for the Kennel Club said : " This law has been quoted from time to time . It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn 't tracked it down . "

 = English embroidery = 
 English embroidery includes embroidery worked in England or by English people abroad from Anglo @-@ Saxon times to the present day . The oldest surviving English embroideries include items from the early 10th century preserved in Durham Cathedral and the 11th century Bayeux Tapestry , if it was worked in England . The professional workshops of Medieval England created rich embroidery in metal thread and silk for ecclesiastical and secular uses . This style was called Opus Anglicanum or " English work " , and was famous throughout Europe . 
 With the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century , the focus of English embroidery increasingly turned to clothing and household furnishings , leading to another great flowering of English domestic embroidery in the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras . The end of this period saw the rise of the formal sampler as a record of the amateur <unk> 's skills . Curious fashions of the mid @-@ 17th century were raised work or stumpwork , a pictorial style featuring detached and padded elements , and crewel work , featuring exotic leaf motifs worked in wool yarn . 
 <unk> , in which thread is stitched through a foundation fabric , and surface embroidery , in which the majority of the thread sits on top of the fabric , exist side @-@ by @-@ side in the English tradition , coming in and out of fashion over the years . In the 19th century , the craze for Berlin wool work , a canvaswork style using brightly coloured wool , contrasts with art needlework , associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement , which attempted to resurrect the artistic and expressive styles of medieval surface embroidery under the influence of the Gothic Revival and the Pre @-@ Raphaelites . 
 Although continental fashions in needlework were adopted in England , a number of popular styles were purely English in origin , including the embroidered linen jackets of the turn of the 17th century , stumpwork , and art needlework . 
 = = Medieval period = = 
 = = = Anglo @-@ Saxon = = = 
 Little physical evidence survives to reconstruct the early development of English embroidery before the Norman Conquest of 1066 . Stitches reinforcing the seams of a garment in the Sutton Hoo ship burial may have been intended as decoration , and so be classed as embroidery , and fragments of a scrolling border worked in stem stitch were recovered from a grave in Kempston , Bedfordshire . Some embroidered pieces of about 850 preserved in <unk> , Belgium , are generally assumed to be Anglo @-@ Saxon work based on their similarity to contemporary manuscript illustrations and sculptures of animals and interlace . 
 The documentary evidence is rather richer than the physical remains . Part of the reason for both these facts is the taste among the late Anglo @-@ Saxon elite for embroidering using lavish amounts of precious metal thread , especially gold , which both gave items a magnificence and expense worth recording , and meant that they were well worth burning to recover the bullion . Three old vestments , almost certainly Anglo @-@ Saxon , recycled in this way at Canterbury Cathedral in the 1370s , produced over £ 250 of gold – a huge amount . Richly embroidered hangings were used in both churches and the houses of the rich , but vestments were the most richly embellished of all , of a " particularly English " richness . Most of these were sent back to Normandy or burnt for their metal after the Norman conquest . An image of part of a huge gold acanthus flower on the back of a gold @-@ bordered chasuble , almost certainly depicting a specific real vestment , can be seen in the Benedictional of St. Æthelwold ( <unk> . <unk> ) . 
 Scholars agree that three embroidered items from the coffin of St Cuthbert in Durham are Anglo @-@ Saxon work , based on an inscription describing their commission by Queen Ælfflæd between 909 and 916 . These include a stole and maniple ornamented with figures of prophets outlined in stem stitch and filled with split stitch , with halos in gold thread worked with underside couching . The quality of this silk embroidery on a gold background is " unparalleled in Europe at this time . " 
 Scholarly consensus favours an Anglo @-@ Saxon , probably Kentish origin for the Bayeux tapestry . This famous narrative of the Conquest is not a true woven tapestry but an embroidered hanging worked in wool yarn on a tabby @-@ woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures , and couching or laid work for filling in figures . 
 = = = Opus Anglicanum = = = 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxon embroidery style combining split stitch and couching with silk and <unk> in gold or silver @-@ gilt thread of the Durham examples flowered from the 12th to the 14th centuries into a style known to contemporaries as Opus Anglicanum or " English work " . Opus Anglicanum was made for both ecclesiastical and secular use on clothing , hangings , and other textiles . It was usually worked on linen or dark silks , or later , worked as individual motifs on linen and applied to velvet . 
 Throughout this period , the designs of embroidery paralleled fashions in manuscript illumination and architecture . Work of this period often featured continuous light scrolls and spirals with or without foliations , in addition to figures of kings and saints in geometrical frames or Gothic arches . 
 Opus Anglicanum was famous throughout Europe . A " Gregory of London " was working in Rome as a gold @-@ <unk> to Pope Alexander IV in 1263 , and the Vatican inventory in Rome of 1295 records well over 100 pieces of English work . Notable surviving examples of Opus Anglicanum include Syon Cope and the Butler @-@ Bowden Cope of 1330 – 50 in the Victoria and Albert Museum , embroidered with silver and silver @-@ gilt thread and coloured silks on silk velvet , which was disassembled and later reassembled into a cope in the 19th century . 
 = = = Professional embroiderers = = = 
 By the 13th century , most English <unk> was made in London workshops , which produced ecclesiastical work , clothing and furnishings for royalty and the nobility , heraldic banners and horse @-@ trappings , and the ceremonial regalia for the great Livery Companies of the City of London and for the court . 
 The founding of the <unk> 's guild in London is attributed to the 14th century or earlier , but its early documents were lost in the Great Fire of London in the 17th century . An indenture of 23 March 1515 records the establishment of Broderers ' Hall in Cutter Lane in that year , and the guild was officially incorporated ( or reincorporated ) by Royal Charter under Elizabeth I in 1561 as the Worshipful Company of Broderers . Professional embroiderers were also attached to the great households of England , but it is unlikely that those working far from London were members of the Company . 
 From the middle of the 14th century , money that had previously been spent on luxury goods like lavish embroidery was redirected to military expenditure , and imported Italian figured silks competed with native embroidery traditions . Varieties of design in textiles succeeded each other very rapidly , and they were more readily available than the more leisurely produced needlework . The work produced by the London workshops was simplified to meet the demands of this deteriorating market . The new techniques required less work and smaller quantities of expensive materials . Surface couching replaced underside couching , and <unk> embroidery was replaced by individual motifs worked on linen and then applied to figured silks or silk velvets . Increasingly , designs for embroidery were derived directly from woven patterns , " thus losing not only their former individuality and richness , but also their former ... story @-@ telling interest . " 
 = = Renaissance to Restoration = = 
 The second great flowering of English embroidery , after Opus Anglicanum , took place in the reign of Elizabeth I. 
 Although the majority of surviving English embroidery from the medieval period was intended for church use , this demand decreased radically with the Protestant Reformation . In contrast , the bulk of the surviving embroidery of the Tudor , Elizabethan , and Jacobean eras is for domestic use , whether for clothing or household decoration . The stable society that existed between the accession of Elizabeth in 1558 and the English Civil War encouraged the building and furnishing of new houses , in which rich textiles played a part . Some embroidery was imported in this period , including the canvas work bed <unk> once thought to be English but now attributed to France , but the majority of work was made in England — and increasingly , by skilled amateurs , mostly women , working domestically , to designs by professional men and women , and later to published pattern books . 
 = = = Tudor and Jacobean styles = = = 
 A general taste for abundant surface ornamentation is reflected in both household furnishings and in fashionable court clothing from the mid @-@ 16th century through the reign of James I. A 1547 account of the wardrobe of Henry VIII shows that just over half of the 224 items were ornamented with embroidery of some kind , and embroidered shirts and accessories were popular New Year 's gift to the Tudor monarchs . Fine linen shirts , chemises , ruffs , collars , <unk> and caps were embroidered in monochrome silks and edged in lace . The monochrome works are classified as blackwork embroidery even when worked in other colours ; red , crimson , blue , green , and pink were also popular . 
 Outer clothing and furnishings of woven silk brocades and velvets were ornamented with gold and silver embroidery in linear or scrolling patterns , applied bobbin lace and <unk> , and small jewels . 
 Appliqué work was popular in the Tudor era , especially for large @-@ scale works such as wall hangings . In Medieval England , rich clothing had been bequeathed to the church to be remade into vestments ; following the dissolution of the monasteries at the Reformation , the rich silks and velvets of the great monastic houses were cut up and repurposed to make hangings and cushions for private homes . Shapes cut from opulent fabrics and small motifs or slips worked on fine linen canvas were applied a background fabric of figured silk , velvet , or plain wool and embellished with embroidery , in a style deriving from the later , simpler forms of Medieval work . 
 <unk> in which the linen ground was covered entirely by tent , <unk> , or cross stitches in wool or silk thread was often used for cushion covers and small bags . Notable examples like the Bradford carpet , a pictorial table cover , were likely the work of professionals in the Broderers ' Company . 
 Polychrome ( multicoloured ) silk embroidery became fashionable in the reign of Elizabeth , and from c . 1590 to 1620 a uniquely English fashion arose for embroidered linen jackets worn informally or as part of <unk> costume . These jackets usually featured scrolling floral patterns worked in a multiplicity of stitches . Similar patterns worked in 2 @-@ ply worsted wool called crewel on heavy linen for furnishings are characteristic of Jacobean embroidery . 
 = = = Pattern sources = = = 
 Pattern books for geometric embroidery and <unk> were published in Germany as early as the 1520s . These featured the stepped , angular patterns characteristic of early blackwork , ultimately deriving from medieval Islamic Egypt . These patterns , seen in the portraits of Hans Holbein the Younger , were worked over counted threads in a double running stitch ( later called Holbein stitch by English embroiderers ) . 
 The first pattern book for embroidery published in England was <unk> & <unk> renewed & <unk> very popular for Goldsmiths & <unk> by Thomas Geminus ( 1545 ) . <unk> or <unk> refers to Moorish or arabesque designs of spirals , scrolls , and zigzags , an important part of the <unk> of Renaissance ornament in many media . Scrolling patterns of flowers and leaves filled with geometric filling stitches are characteristic of blackwork from the 1540s through 1590s , and similar patterns worked in coloured silks appear from the 1560s , outlined in <unk> and filled with detached buttonhole stitch . 
 Additional pattern books for embroiderers appeared late in the century , followed by Richard <unk> 's A <unk> @-@ house for the Needle published in London in 1624 . Other sources for embroidery designs were the popular herbals and emblem books . Both domestic and professional embroiderers probably relied on skilled draughtsmen or pattern @-@ drawers to interpret these design sources and draw them out on linen ready to be stitched . 
 = = = Early samplers = = = 
 Printed pattern books were not easily obtainable , and a sampler or embroidered record of stitches and patterns was the most common form of reference . 16th @-@ century English samplers were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches . These band samplers were highly valued , often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations . These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles , threads , and ornament . 
 The earliest dated surviving sampler , housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum , was made by Jane <unk> who included her name and the date 1598 in the inscription , but the earliest documentary reference to sampler making goes back another hundred years , to the 1502 household expense accounts of Elizabeth of York , which record the purchase of an ell of linen to make a sampler for the queen . 
 From the early 17th century , samplers became a more formal and stylized part of a girl 's education , even as the motifs and patterns on the samplers faded from fashion . 
 = = = Pictorial embroidery and stumpwork = = = 
 Following the death of James I and the accession of Charles I , elaborately embroidered clothing faded from popularity under the dual influences of rising Puritanism and the new court 's taste for French fashion with its lighter silks in solid colours accessorised with masses of linen and lace . In this new climate , needlework was praised by moralists as an appropriate occupation for girls and women in the home , and domestic embroidery for household use flourished . <unk> pictures , mirror frames , <unk> , and other domestic objects of this era often depicted Biblical stories featuring characters dressed in the fashion of Charles and his queen Henrietta Maria , or after the Restoration , Charles II and Catherine of Braganza . 
 These stories were executed in canvaswork or in coloured silks in a uniquely English style called raised work , usually known by its modern name stumpwork . Raised work arose from the detached buttonhole stitch fillings and braided scrolls of late Elizabethan embroidery . Areas of the embroidery were worked on white or ivory silk grounds in a variety of stitches and prominent features were padded with horsehair or <unk> , or worked around wooden shapes or wire frames . Ribbons , spangles , beads , small pieces of lace , canvaswork slips , and other objects were added to increase the dimensionality of the finished work .

 Sets of bed hangings embroidered in crewel wools were another characteristic product of the Stuart era . These were worked on a new fabric , a natural twill weave from Bruges with a linen warp and cotton weft . <unk> wools of the 17th century were firmly twisted unlike the soft wools sold under that name today , and were dyed in deep rich shades of green , blue , red , yellow , and brown . Motifs of flowers and trees , with birds , insects , and animals , were worked at large scale in a variety of stitches . The origins of this work are in the polychrome embroidery on scrolling stems of the Elizabethan era , later blended with the Tree of Life and other motifs of Indian <unk> , introduced by the trade of the East India Company . 
 After the Restoration , the patterns became ever more fanciful and exuberant . " It is an almost impossible task to describe the large leaves , since they bear no resemblance to anything natural , they are , however , rarely angular in outline , rejoicing rather in sweeping curves , and drooping points , curled over to display the under side of the leaf , a device that gave opening for much ingenuity in the arrangement of the stitches . " 
 Although usually called " Jacobean embroidery " by modern <unk> , crewel has its origins in the reign of James I but remained popular through the reign of Queen Anne and into the early 18th century , when a return to the simpler forms of the earliest work became fashionable .

 The accession of William III and Mary II following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 triggered another change in needlework fashions . Associations of stumpwork with the reign of the deposed Stuarts combined with Mary 's Dutch taste ushered in new styles influenced by Indian <unk> . From the 1690s , household furnishings such as chair covers and <unk> were the focus of embroidery in the home .

 In the Georgian era , canvaswork was popular for chair coverings , <unk> , screens and card tables . <unk> pictures and upholstery both reflected the popular pastoral theme of men and women in the sheep @-@ cropped English countryside . Other recurring themes include exotic Tree of Life patterns influenced by earlier <unk> and chinoiserie with its fanciful imagery of an imaginary China , asymmetry in format and whimsical contrasts of scale . In contrast , <unk> in silks and wools produced naturalistic portraits and domestic scenes . 
 Embroidery was once again an important element of fashion in the early 18th century . <unk> , <unk> , hanging pockets , shoes , gowns , and men 's coats and waistcoats were all decorated with embroidery .

 By the 18th century , sampler making had become an important part of girls ' education in boarding and institutional schools . A commonplace component was now an alphabet with numerals , possibly accompanied by various crowns and coronets , all used in marking household linens . Traditional embroidered motifs were now rearranged into decorative borders framing lengthy inscriptions or verses of an " improving " nature and small pictorial scenes . These new samplers were more useful as a record of accomplishment to be hung on the wall than as a practical stitch guide .

 Tambourwork was a new <unk> embroidery fad of the 1780s influenced by Indian embroidered muslins . <unk> originally with a needle and later with a small hook , tambour takes its name from the round embroidery frame in which it was worked . Tambour was suited to the light , flowing ornament appropriate to the new muslin dresses of this period , and patterns were readily available in periodicals like the Lady 's Magazine which debuted in 1770 . 
 Tambourwork was copied by machine early in the Industrial Revolution . As early as 1810 , a " worked muslin cap ... done in tambour stitch by a steam @-@ engine " was on the market , and machine @-@ made netting was in general use as a background by the 1820s .

 The linen smock @-@ frocks worn by rural workers , especially shepherds and <unk> , in parts of England and Wales from the early eighteenth century featured fullness across the back , breast , and sleeves folded into " tubes " ( narrow unpressed pleats ) held in place and decorated by <unk> , a type of surface embroidery in a honeycomb pattern across the pleats that controls the fullness while allowing a degree of stretch . 
 Embroidery styles for smock @-@ frocks varied by region , and a number of motifs became traditional for various occupations : wheel @-@ shapes for carters and wagoners , sheep and crooks for shepherds , and so on . Most of this embroidery was done in heavy linen thread , often in the same color as the smock . 
 By the mid @-@ nineteenth century , wearing of traditional smock @-@ frocks by country laborers was dying out , and a romantic nostalgia for England 's rural past led to a fashion for women 's and children 's clothing loosely styled after smock @-@ frocks . These garments are generally of very fine linen or cotton and feature delicate <unk> embroidery done in cotton floss in contrasting colors ; <unk> garments with pastel @-@ colored embroidery remain popular for babies . 
 = = = Berlin work = = = 
 In the early 19th century , canvaswork in tent or petit point stitch again became popular . The new fashion , using printed patterns and coloured tapestry wools imported from Berlin , was called Berlin wool work . Patterns and wool for Berlin work appeared in London in 1831 . Berlin work was stitched to hand @-@ coloured or charted patterns , leaving little room for individual expression , and was so popular that " Berlin work " became synonymous with " canvaswork " . Its chief characteristic was intricate three @-@ dimensional looks created by careful shading . By mid @-@ century , Berlin work was executed in bright colours made possible by the new synthetic dyes . Berlin work was very durable and was made into furniture covers , cushions , bags , and slippers as well as for embroidered " copies " of popular paintings . The craze for Berlin work peaked around 1850 and died out in the 1870s , under the influence of a competing aesthetic that would become known as art needlework . 
 = = = Art needlework = = = 
 In 1848 , the influential Gothic Revival architect G. E. Street co @-@ wrote a book called Ecclesiastical Embroidery . He was a staunch advocate of abandoning faddish Berlin work in favour of more expressive embroidery techniques based on Opus Anglicanum . Street 's one @-@ time apprentice , the Pre @-@ Raphaelite poet , artist , and textile designer William Morris , embraced this aesthetic , resurrecting the techniques of freehand surface embroidery which had been popular from the Middle Ages to the 18th century . The new style , called art needlework , emphasized flat patterns with delicate shading in satin stitch accompanied by a number of novelty stitches . It was worked in silk or wool thread dyed with natural dyes on wool , silk , or linen grounds . 
 By the 1870s , Morris 's decorative arts firm Morris & Co. was offering both designs for embroideries and finished works in the art needlework style . Morris became active in the growing movement to return originality and mastery of technique to embroidery . Morris and his daughter May were early supporters of the Royal School of Art Needlework , founded in 1872 , whose aim was to " restore Ornamental Needlework for secular purposes to the high place it once held among decorative arts . " 
 Textiles worked in art needlework styles were featured at the various Arts and Crafts exhibitions from the 1890s to the Great War .

 Organizations whose origins date back as far as the Middle Ages remain active in supporting embroidery in Britain today . 
 The Worshipful Company of Broderers is now a charitable organization supporting excellence in embroidery . 
 The Royal School of Needlework is based at Hampton Court Palace and is engaged in textile restoration and conservation , as well as training professional embroiderers through a new 2 @-@ year Foundation Degree programme ( in conjunction with the University for the Creative Arts ) with a top @-@ up to full BA ( Hons ) being available for the first time in the 2011 / 12 academic year . Previously , apprentices were trained by an intensive 3 @-@ year in @-@ house programme . It is a registered charity and receives commissions from public bodies and individuals , including the Hastings embroidery of 1965 commemorating the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings the following year , and the Overlord embroidery of 1968 commemorating the D @-@ Day invasion of France during World War II , now in the D @-@ Day museum in Southsea , Portsmouth . 
 The <unk> ' Guild , also based at Hampton Court , was founded in 1906 by sixteen former students of the Royal School of Art Needlework to represent the interests of embroidery . It is active in education and exhibition . 
 = MP 40 = 
 The MP 40 was a submachine gun chambered for the 9 × 19mm Parabellum cartridge . It was developed in Nazi Germany and used extensively by the Axis powers during World War II . 
 Designed in 1938 by Heinrich Vollmer with inspiration from its predecessor the MP 38 , it was heavily used by infantrymen , paratroopers , platoon and squad leaders on the Eastern and Western Front . Its advanced and modern features made it a favorite among soldiers and popular in countries from various parts of the world after the war . It was often erroneously called " Schmeisser " by the Allies , despite Hugo Schmeisser 's non @-@ involvement in the weapon 's design and production . From 1940 to 1945 , an estimated 1 @.@ 1 million were produced by Erma Werke . 
 = = Development = = 
 The <unk> 40 ( " Machine pistol 40 " ) descended from its predecessor the MP 38 , which was in turn based on the MP 36 , a prototype made of machined steel . The MP 36 was developed independently by Erma Werke 's Berthold <unk> with funding from the German Army . It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer 's VPM 1930 and EMP . Vollmer then worked on Berthold <unk> 's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to answer a request from the <unk> ( Army Weapons Office ) for a new submachine gun , which was adopted as MP 38 . The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36 , and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38 , with certain cost @-@ saving alterations , most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts . 
 The MP 40 was often called the " Schmeisser " by the Allies , after the weapon designer Hugo Schmeisser . Schmeisser had designed the MP 18 , which was the first mass @-@ produced submachine gun in the world , and carried some resemblance to the MP 40 . He did not , however , have anything to do with the design or development of the MP 40 , although he held a patent on the magazine . 
 = = Design = = 
 The MP 40 submachine guns are open @-@ bolt , blowback @-@ operated automatic arms . The only mode of fire was fully automatic , but the relatively low rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls . The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide which serves as a pneumatic recoil buffer . The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s , but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s , the bolt handle was made as a separate part . It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening ; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked ( rear ) or <unk> ( forward ) position . The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop , used to hold the bolt in forward position . 
 The MP 38 receiver was made of machined steel , but this was a time @-@ consuming and expensive process . To save time and materials , and thus increase production , construction of the MP 40 receiver was simplified by using stamped steel and electro @-@ spot welding as much as possible . The MP 38 also features longitudinal grooving on the receiver and bolt , as well as a circular opening on the magazine housing . These features were eliminated on the MP 40 . 
 One unique feature found on most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum , steel , or bakelite resting bar or support under the barrel . This was used to steady the weapon when firing over the side of open @-@ top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half @-@ track . A handguard , made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite , was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip . The barrel lacked any form of insulation , which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned . The MP 40 also had a forward @-@ folding metal stock , the first for a submachine gun , resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded . However , this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use . 
 Although the MP 40 was generally reliable , a major weakness was its 32 @-@ round magazine . Unlike the double @-@ column , dual @-@ feed magazine insert found on the Thompson <unk> @-@ 28 variants , the MP 40 used a double @-@ column , single @-@ feed insert . The single @-@ feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips , occasionally resulting in feed failures ; this problem was exacerbated by the presence of dirt or other debris . Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold . This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move out of the line of feed , since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked . German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions . 
 = = Usage = = 
 At the outbreak of World War II , the majority of German soldiers carried either <unk> <unk> rifles or MP 40s , both of which were regarded as the standard weapons of choice for an infantryman . 
 However , later experience with Soviet tactics , such as the Battle of Stalingrad where entire Russian units armed with submachine guns outgunned their German counterparts in short range urban combat , caused a shift in tactics , and by the end of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were being issued to entire assault platoons on a limited basis . Starting in 1943 , the German Army moved to replace both the <unk> <unk> rifle and MP 40 with the new , revolutionary StG 44 . By the end of World War II ( which ended in 1945 ) , an estimated 1 @.@ 1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants .

 During and after the end of World War II , many MP 40s were captured or surrendered ( upwards of 200 @,@ 000 ) to the Allies and were then redistributed to the paramilitary and irregular forces of some developing countries .

 In 1943 , Schmeisser designed the MP 41 , which was in reality an MP 40 with a wooden rifle stock and a selector , identical to those found on the earlier MP 28 submachine gun .

 = Typhoon Nida ( 2004 ) = 
 Typhoon Nida , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Dindo , was the fourth tropical cyclone and second named storm of the 2004 Pacific typhoon season . Nida was the second super typhoon of the 2004 season , reaching a peak intensity of 160 miles per hour ( 260 km / h ) . Forming southeast of the Philippines , the storm strengthened as it moved northwest . The typhoon brushed the eastern Philippines causing heavy rains across the island archipelago . Nida later accelerated northeast , missing Japan to the east while becoming an extratropical cyclone . A total of $ 1 @.@ 3 million ( 2004 USD ) in damage occurred , and Nida left 31 fatalities .

 On May 12 , a persistent area of thunderstorms formed within a monsoon trough 220 miles ( 350 km ) southwest of Palau . Satellite imagery revealed a weak low @-@ level circulation . Initially , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) forecast the storm to not strengthen . The following day , forecasters saw that the storm was strengthening and upgraded the system to tropical depression status . Forecasters at the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration designated the storm as Tropical Depression Dindo . 
 At the time of formation , the depression was located 190 miles ( 310 km ) east of Palau as it moved west northwest at 3 mph ( 5 km / h ) . <unk> satellite imagery showed the depression 's winds were near 29 mph ( 46 km / h ) and increasing . Satellite imagery later the showed deep convection organizing over the low @-@ level circulation . The depression underwent rapid intensification as it became a tropical storm late in the morning on May 14 and was assigned the name Nida by the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) . Still intensifying , the storm turned northwest where it reached typhoon status later that night . 
 Curving west @-@ northwest at 7 mph ( 11 km / h ) , Typhoon Nida attained winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) , equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane . On May 16 , Nida became a super typhoon as its winds reached 165 mph ( 266 km / h ) . At its peak , its highest winds extended 35 miles ( 56 km ) from the center . Satellite imagery showed the storm developed a defined eye measuring 25 miles ( 40 km ) wide . On May 17 , the center of Nida passed over Catanduanes Island , Philippines . 
 After making landfall , Nida weakened and then turned more northward and slowed down . Re @-@ entering the warmer waters of the Western Pacific Ocean , Nida 's winds restrengthened to 150 mph ( 250 km / h ) . During the night of May 18 , the typhoon began to weaken . Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being obscured by high cirrostratus clouds , indicative of the weakening typhoon . The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast . 
 Nida accelerated northeast and its maximum sustained winds weakened to 90 mph ( 148 km / h ) . Interacting with an upper level low pressure system over Japan , the typhoon became elongated . Nida weakened below typhoon strength as the center passed 290 miles ( 467 km ) south of Tokyo , Japan . By May 21 , Nida transitioned to an extratropical cyclone . The JMA continued to track the remnants of Nida as it weakened northeast of northern Japan .

 Nida produced heavy rainfall across the eastern Philippines . Rainfall up to 10 @.@ 6 inches ( 270 mm ) was reported in <unk> while Naga City received 5 @.@ 9 inches ( 150 mm ) of rain . The rest of the Philippines received 104 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) to 372 millimetres ( 14 @.@ 6 in ) of rain . 31 fatalities ( 20 confirmed , 11 unaccounted for ) were reported during Nida 's landfall . In Camotes island , nine people drowned and five were declared missing when a ferry boat sank during the storm . Elsewhere offshore , 13 crewmen were rescued when their ship ran aground near Luzon . In all , the typhoon left $ 1 @.@ 3 million in damage across the eastern Philippines . 
 In Japan , heavy rains produced by the outer bands of Nida triggered flash flooding and landslides in Fukushima Prefecture . Several highways were shut down due to rising waters or debris and a few homes also were inundated . In Mito , Ibaraki , 360 homes were left without power after high winds knocked down electrical wires . A 10 m ( 33 ft ) section of highway in the city also collapsed . In addition to the structural damage caused by Nida , the poor weather conditions created during its passage resulted in several canceled flights by Japan Air Commuter . In Minamidaitō , Okinawa , a weather station operated by the WMO reported winds gusting to 71 mph ( 115 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 972 millibars ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) . Rainfall total at the station was 1 @.@ 25 inches ( 32 mm ) with the highest at 2 @.@ 79 inches ( 71 mm ) . There were no reports of damage . 
 = Ontario Highway 33 = 
 King 's Highway 33 , commonly referred to as Highway 33 , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . The route begins at Highway 62 in Bloomfield and travels east to the Collins Bay Road junction at Collins Bay in the city of Kingston , a distance of 60 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 37 @.@ 8 mi ) . The highway continues farther east into Kingston as Bath Road ( Kingston Road 33 ) , ending at the former Highway 2 , now Princess Street . Highway 33 is divided into two sections by the Bay of Quinte . The Glenora Ferry service crosses between the two sections just east of Picton , transporting vehicles and pedestrians for free throughout the year . 
 Originally , Highway 33 continued northeast through Trenton to the town of Stirling , ending at a junction with Highway 14 . This section was transferred to county governments by the beginning of 1998 . In 2009 , Highway 33 west of Picton became the site of the first modern roundabout on a provincial highway . 
 In 1984 , Queen Elizabeth commemorated Highway 33 between Trenton and Kingston as the Loyalist Parkway at a ceremony in Amherstview in honour of the settlers that landed there in 1784 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 33 , known as the Loyalist Parkway throughout its length , begins in the west at the southern terminus of Highway 62 , west of which the parkway continues as Prince Edward County Road 33 to Trenton . The route begins within the community of Bloomfield . To the east it crosses several creeks then intersects Prince Edward County Road 1 at the first modern provincially maintained roundabout . East of this , the highway enters into the city of Picton . 
 Within Picton , Highway 33 intersects the former Highway 49 , now Prince Edward County Road 49 . It exits the city and follows the southeastern shoreline of Picton Bay , passing the H.J. McFarland Conservation Area midway between the city and Glenora . 
 Highway 33 has two sections , which are joined by the Glenora Ferry , an auto ferry crossing the Bay of Quinte from Glenora to Adolphustown . The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) , which maintains Highway 33 , also provides the ferry service free of charge . The eastern section of the highway begins west of Adolphustown , where it passes by several Loyalist heritage sites . Now in the county of Lennox and Addington , the route remains close to the shores of the Bay of Quinte for the remainder of its journey towards Kingston . It divides the Greater Napanee communities of Conway , South Fredericksburg , Parma , Sandhurst Shores and Sandhurst , then enters the municipality of Loyalist opposite Amherst Island . The highway passes through Bath , after which it follows the Bath Road , one of the oldest roads in Ontario , built circa 1785 . At <unk> , a ferry service provides access to Amherst Island ; Highway 33 continues east and passes through Amherstview before crossing the county line into Frontenac County and the City of Kingston . 
 The short section of Highway 33 within Kingston travels as far east as Collins Bay Road , in the community of Collins Bay . From this point , the road continues east as Bath Road ( Kingston City Road 33 ) , ending at Princess Street , formerly Highway 2 . 
 Highway 33 is 60 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 37 @.@ 8 mi ) in length , excluding the length of the Glenora Ferry . Traffic volumes vary considerably throughout the length of the route . On an average day , over 5 @,@ 000 vehicles travel the section between Bloomfield and Picton . Between Picton and the Glenora Ferry , volumes drop to under 2 @,@ 000 . On the opposite shore , traffic volumes grow from over 6 @,@ 000 near Bath to over 11 @,@ 000 outside of Kingston . 
 = = History = = 
 Highway 33 , also known since 1984 as the Loyalist Parkway , follows a pioneer colonial route on which the first segments were built two hundred years prior . The route connects several historical settlement sites in Prince Edward County , continuing east through Bath to what is now Kingston . 
 In 1784 , following the American Revolution , the United Empire Loyalists began to arrive in Upper Canada , hoping to settle the frontier near Cataraqui ( now Kingston ) . With the help of the military , the loyalists blazed a trail west from Cataraqui to Bath , a distance of 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) . This trail would become a section of Highway 33 nearly 150 years later . 
 On June 5 , 1799 , Asa Danforth Jr. began construction eastward from Toronto on a road which was to extend the Governor 's Road through Port Hope and to the Trent River . That road , completed in 1801 , would be described by acting surveyor general William <unk> to be " good " for use in the dead of winter but " impassible " during the wet summers , when the path turned to a bottomless mud pit . It would be extended in 1802 to reach the Bay of Quinte at Stone Mills ( now Glenora ) and a ferry crossing established to Adolphustown . The Bath extension of the Danforth Road ( 1802 ) provided access to a key early colonial road , the Bath Road , which had long joined Bath to Kingston . 
 Sporadic privately operated ferry services between Adolphustown and Stone Mills ( Glenora ) were initially a primitive affair . In October 1835 a Mr. Clark from Cobourg tipped out of the bark canoe ferrying him to Glenora and was buried without an inquest ; a year earlier , a Rev. Mathew Miller from Cobourg had drowned after falling through the February ice . The road itself was no better , barely adequate for horse and rider but unfit to run stagecoach lines . 
 This road would serve as the initial mail road linking Kingston to Toronto , but was poorly maintained and soon allowed to fall into disrepair . By 1817 , the Kingston Road replaced or bypass much of Danforth 's Road , following a similar path to the Trent River ( with minor improvements in routing around Scarborough , Port Hope , Cobourg and Grafton ) but then blazing a more northerly route through Belleville and Napanee . Like the Danforth Road before it , this 1817 York Road was initially a muddy dirt road ; it would , however , suffice to establish reliable scheduled stagecoach runs by which mail and passengers could make the two @-@ day trip from Kingston to Toronto and permit enterprises ( such as the branches of the newly established Bank of Montreal ) safe and timely delivery of documents and valuables . By 1839 , the Napanee @-@ Kingston route was being improved for use as a gravel toll road . 
 While the area around Bath and the Bay of Quinte would remain a major agricultural region , the pattern of redirecting Kingston @-@ Toronto traffic further inland which started with construction of the Kingston Road ( 1817 ) would be repeated with the Grand Trunk Railway ( 1856 ) and ultimately Highway 401 ( 1964 ) . 
 Due to its historic role in early colonisation and its prime waterfront scenic location , the original route from Kingston westward through Bath and the Quinte Region would be commemorated in 1984 by Queen Elizabeth as the Loyalist Parkway . 
 Ironically , the first section of Highway 33 to be assumed as provincial highway is not part of the commemorated Loyalist Parkway . On July 9 , 1930 , the Department of Highways assumed the Trenton – Stirling Road as King 's Highway 33 , a distance of approximately 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) . In July 1934 , as part of a depression @-@ relief effort , the Carrying Place Trail through Prince Edward County and the United Counties of Lennox and Addington was assumed as an extension of Highway 33 . ( The section between Trenton and Glenora was assumed on July 4 , 1934 , the section between Adolphustown and Kingston on July 11 . ) The provincially operated ferries , as the first to operate without a toll on the route , entered service after 1936 . 
 In 1984 , Queen Elizabeth toured the Kingston area as part of its two hundredth anniversary , attending several events and ceremonies through her visit . On her final day in the region , she dedicated the Loyalist Parkway in honour of the settlers that landed there in 1784 . The ceremony was held in Amherstview on September 27 , 1984 . 
 In 1998 , all portions of Highway 33 west of Ontario Highway 62 , Bloomfield or east of Collins Bay Road , Kingston were decertified as provincial highway and downloaded as county or city roads . 
 In 2009 , intersection of Highway 33 and Prince Edward County Road 1 ( <unk> Road ) near Picton saw the introduction of a traffic roundabout , the first ever constructed on a provincial highway in the province , to replace the at @-@ grade intersection . The MTO felt that the area had reached its operational threshold due to high tourist and recreational activity , particularly during the busy summer months , and so felt a traffic roundabout was needed . 
 The engineering and consulting firm Morrison <unk> was retained to undertake the detail design for the realignment and reconfiguration of the existing intersection at Highway 33 and Country Road 1 into a single lane roundabout with a central island and truck apron . The assignment included highway engineering , drainage and hydrology engineering , electrical engineering , public consultation , and traffic engineering . The roundabout was officially opened on July 17 , 2009 .

 = Ralphie the Buffalo = 
 Ralphie is the name of the live mascot of the University of Colorado Buffaloes . Ralphie has been called one of the best live mascots in sports , and she is often erroneously labeled male . 
 The University of Colorado Boulder has a unique mascot among those of intercollegiate athletics , a live buffalo mascot named Ralphie . Ralphie , with a team of varsity student @-@ athletes called Ralphie Handlers , is a symbol of Buff pride and is best known for leading the football team onto the field on game day . As one of the most exclusive sights in college or professional sports , even opposing teams are excited to watch her round the end zone and fly by their sideline . 
 In their most famous appearances , a team of varsity student @-@ athletes , Ralphie Handlers , run the buffalo around Folsom Field in a horse shoe pattern with the football team behind them at both the start of the game and the start of the second half . Five Ralphie Handlers run her around the field , four on either side of her to help guide her around the field and one in the back to control her speed . The rest of the team guides her from a distance , showing her the route . Ralphie and her Handlers can reach speeds of 25 miles per hour . Ralphie and her Handlers also make special appearances throughout the year talking to fans and educating Colorado Athletics , Ralphie , and buffalo in general . 
 Ralphie has always been a female bison because of their size and temperament . Males can be almost twice the size , although any gender of bison comes with some risk . Because Ralphie is a live animal , whether or not she runs at a football game is at the sole discretion of the Program Manager , who may cancel it if she is unusually nervous . Additionally , Ralphie ’ s run may also be canceled in field conditions are unsafe for either Ralphie or the Handlers .

 In 1934 a contest in the Silver & Gold newspaper determined the school mascot to be the buffaloes . For the final football game of the 1934 season , a group of students paid $ 25 to rent a buffalo calf to stand on the sidelines . Along with a real cowboy caretaker , it took four students to keep the calf , the son of “ Killer , ” a famed bison at Trails End Ranch in Fort Collins , calm on the sidelines . As far as luck though , Thanksgiving Day . 
 Prior to 1934 , CU athletic teams were referred to as the Silver and Gold , Silver Helmets , Yellow Jackets , Hornets , <unk> , Big Horns , Grizzlies , and Frontiersmen . The student newspaper decided to sponsor a national contest in the summer of 1934 , with a $ 5 prize to go to the author of the winning selection . Over 1 @,@ 000 entries arrived from almost every state in the Nation . Athletic Director Harry Carlson , Graduate Manager Walter Franklin , and Kenneth Bundy of the Silver and Gold were the judges . 
 Local articles first reported that Claude Bates of New Madrid , Missouri , and James Proffitt of Cincinnati , Ohio , were co @-@ winners for the prize as both submitted “ Buffaloes ” as their entry . However , a few days later , the newspaper declared Boulder resident Andrew Dickson the winner , after a follow @-@ up investigation revealed his submission of “ Buffaloes ” had actually arrived several days before those of the original winners . Through the years , synonyms which quickly came into use included “ Bisons , ” “ Buffs , ” “ Golden Avalanche , ” and “ Golden Buffaloes . ” 
 Live buffaloes made appearances at Colorado games on and off throughout the early years , usually in a pen on the field or sometimes driven around in a trailer . In the 1940s , the school kept a baby buffalo in a special pen at the University Riding Academy . The first named buffalo was “ Mr. Chips , ” who appeared for the for by a men ’ s honorary society . 
 The original “ Ralphie ” was donated to Colorado in 1966 . It was the duty of the five sophomore class officers to run the buffalo around the outside of the stadium with fans participating in the " Buffalo Stomp , " shaking the ground at Folsom Field . However , that tradition was halted because of the actual physical damage “ the stomp ” was causing . 
 Around that same time , head football coach Eddie Crowder was approached with the idea of the buffalo charging out on the field before the game , the team closely following . Crowder thought it was a great idea , and the debut of this great tradition took place on October 28 , 1967 , Colorado ’ s homecoming game against Oklahoma State . Though OSU won the game 10 @-@ 7 , the greatest mascot tradition in college athletics was born . 
 The Ralphie Live Mascot Program has since evolved , becoming a prestigious athletic endeavor for 15 student athletes and buffalo enthusiasts . It is currently under the direction of Program Manager John Graves , longtime Coach Benny Frei , and Assistant Coach Taylor Stratton , all of whom were Handlers when they were students at Colorado .

 In 1966 , John Lowery , the father of a Colorado freshman from Lubbock , Texas , donated a six @-@ month old buffalo calf from Sedgewick , Colorado to the University . Lowery bought the calf from rancher Art <unk> . Bill Lowery ( John ’ s son ) , John McGill , Don <unk> , and Vic <unk> were the original Ralphie Handlers who trained Ralphie I. The original Handlers say she was named “ Ralph ” after the class president at the time , while another story says she was named “ Ralph ” after the sound she made while running . After it was noted that the buffalo was a female and Ralph was a male ’ s name , the name was changed to Ralphie . 
 The initial tradition was for five sophomore class officers to run the buffalo around the outside of the stadium in a full loop . At the conclusion of the tiring activities , the fans would break into the “ Buffalo Stomp , ” which would literally shake the stadium in deafening fashion as the team took the field . However , Colorado officials soon had the tradition stopped because of the actual physical damage it was causing . Ralphie first attended a game on October 1 , 1966 when Colorado played Kansas State . She did not run at that game , but stood on the sideline . Colorado won the game 10 @-@ 0 . 
 Around that same time , head coach Eddie Crowder was approached with the idea of charging the buffalo out onto the field before the game , the team following closely behind . Crowder thought it was a great idea , and the debut of this great tradition took place on October 28 , 1967 , Colorado ’ s Homecoming game against Oklahoma State . Though Oklahoma State won the game 10 @-@ 7 , the tradition was here to stay . Ralphie ’ s first bowl game was the Bluebonnet Bowl on December 23 , 1967 , where Colorado beat Miami ( FL ) 31 @-@ 21 . The five sophomores that ‘ handled ’ her appointed themselves as the board of directors of a fundraising effort to bring Ralphie to Houston , raising the necessary money through marketing Ralphie ’ s potentially appearance . 
 In 1976 , the President of The Bank of Boulder , Steve Bosley , proposed to Crowder they would do a fundraiser to send Ralphie to the Orange Bowl game with Ohio State . When a reporter asked Bosley how Ralphie would travel to Miami , he explained that the information was top secret since Colorado was concerned that Ohio State students would try to kidnap , or “ buffalo @-@ nap ” Ralphie . The story of the potential “ buffalo @-@ napping ” made newspapers nationwide , featuring a picture of Ralphie in full charge with her Handlers . The story stimulated over $ 25 @,@ 000 in donations . Ralphie ’ s trip to the Orange Bowl cost $ 2 @,@ 500 , and the balance was put into a fund for Ralphie ’ s future care . 
 Ralphie I attended every Colorado home football game for 13 years , including all bowl games , and retired at the end of the 1978 season . The team matured too , selecting and training knowledgeable Handlers . Colorado ’ s first Ralphie achieved nationally celebrity status , and was even kidnapped in 1970 by some Air Force Academy students , as well as being named Colorado ’ s 1971 Homecoming Queen at the height of the anti @-@ establishment era . 
 During the football season Ralphie lived at the Green Meadows Riding Stable , located near present day East Campus of the University , owned by C.D. “ Buddy ” Hays . Hays not only cared for and trained Ralphie , he was also the coach of the Colorado Rodeo Club . The Ralphie Handlers would also practice and work with Ralphie in the arena of Green Meadows Riding Stable . In the off @-@ season Ralphie lived on the pastures at Hidden Valley Ranch , where Hays also kept his herd of buffalo , located north of Boulder . Ralphie I lived at Hidden Valley Ranch until 1981 when she moved to the McKenzie Ranch located in North Boulder . Ralphie traveled in a modified steel , brown 4 @-@ horse trailer , donated by Hays . She used a custom harness and headstall made by Ray Cornell out of Boulder , Colorado that lead ropes were attached to allow the Handlers to run with and help guide her around the field . 
 Ralphie I also had four calves . In October 1970 , Ralphie ’ s first calf unfortunately died during a strong snowstorm . In May 1972 , <unk> , named by Colorado students , was born , but died from pneumonia in the fall of 1973 . In April 1974 , her third calf , <unk> , was born , but died from an accident on the ranch . Her fourth and final calf was Spirit who was born in August 1975 . Spirit made her public debut at the 1975 homecoming parade . She was sold to a local rancher shortly after , and never ran at a football game . Ralphie I ’ s final game was on November 4 , 1978 against Oklahoma . Colorado lost 7 @-@ 28 . Ralphie I died on May 13 , 1982 , she was 17 years old .

 In 1978 , when Ralphie I became ill , Steve Bosley organized a search for a new buffalo headed by Buddy Hays . Hays discovered a calf named Moon , short for Moonshine , owned by Gregg C. Mackenzie . Bosley , The Bank of Boulder , and bank Director Robert <unk> bought Moonshine from Mackenzie and donated her to Colorado . Since “ Ralphie ” had become the well @-@ known name of the buffalo , Athletic Director Eddie Crowder made it permanent . Mackenzie continued to train Ralphie II . Ralphie II lived at Hidden Valley Ranch until 1981 , when she moved to the McKenzie Ranch located in North Boulder . In 1985 Johnnie and <unk> Parker took over the program and the training of Ralphie II as well as housed her at the Parker Ranch in Hudson , Colorado . 
 Ralphie II made her debut on November 18 , 1978 , the final home game of the season , and last game for head coach Bill Mallory . Colorado lost 16 @-@ 20 to Iowa State . But the Ralphie Program and name became a tradition . In 1985 Colorado selected the homecoming theme of “ Ralphie goes to Hollywood . ” In 1986 Ralphie made the trip to Oklahoma and ran at the Colorado vs Oklahoma State game and stayed at OSU ’ s veterinary clinic . Students from Oklahoma State University broke into the clinic that night and spray painted “ OSU ” in orange letters . Ralphie II was transported around in the same modified steel , brown 4 @-@ horse trailer that Ralphie I used . Initially Ralphie II used the same custom leather harness that Ralphie I used , but used a different headstall . The harness was modified to fit Ralphie II ’ s bigger size than Ralphie I ’ s . In 1986 a new harness and headstall was used by Ralphie , this one was built by Carl W. Pike Saddlery out of Boulder , Colorado , the same company who modified the original harness to fit Ralphie II . The new headstall featured the iconic brass “ CU ” emblem on the front of the headstall . While always a part of the Athletic Department , it was not until 1987 when Ralphie Handlers first earned a Varsity Letter for their participation . 
 She was expected to retire at the end of the 1987 season . However , at the age of 12 , and after serving the Buffs for 10 years , Ralphie II died on September 19 , 1987 , following a 31 @-@ 17 Colorado win over Stanford .

 In June 1985 Chuck Brackenbury was out mending fences on the Joe Miller Ranch outside of Laramie , Wyoming , when he noticed a buffalo giving birth early in the morning . He checked back later that night and discovered the mom had died during labor , but the calf was still alive just standing there all alone . He brought the calf back to his ranch where she was bottle @-@ fed and raised with horses and a goat . Brackenbury eventually sold her to Bob Renaud , a buffalo rancher in Hudson , Colorado . In 1987 , Johnnie and <unk> Parker bought the 2 @-@ year old buffalo from Renaud and donated her to Colorado . Parker also trained and housed her . Ralphie III was a lot bigger and faster than her two predecessors . 
 Ralphie III was brought into action earlier than anticipated , making her debut on November 7 , 1987 at a home game against Missouri . Originally named " Tequila , " Ralphie III was being trained for the 1988 season , as Ralphie II was to retire following the 1987 season . When Ralphie II died earlier than anticipated , and after only five weeks of training , Ralphie III finished the 1987 season . The Buffs welcomed her with a 27 @-@ 10 victory over Missouri . 
 In 1991 , Ted Davis joined the program as a coach . In 1995 , Gail Pederson began helping with the Ralphie Program behind the scenes , overseeing all the logistics , scheduling , and planning for the program . Ralphie III was initially transported in the same modified steel , brown 4 @-@ horse trailer that carried Ralphie I and II , but in 1996 , a new custom steel , black stock trailer was purchased for Ralphie through a donation from Coors Brewing Company . Initially she used the same harness and headstall that was used by Ralphie II . In 1989 a new harness and headstall was used , again with a large brass “ CU ” on the front of the headstall . The new harness and headstall was built by M. King Saddlery out of Boulder , Colorado . 
 Ralphie III led the Buffaloes on the field in 72 games , including 62 times in Boulder , eight bowl games , and two times in Fort Collins . After over 10 years of service , she died in January 1998 , at the age of 11 . Her final game was against Nebraska on November 28 , 1997 . Colorado lost 24 @-@ 27 . 
 After Ralphie 's death , the Colorado State Senate passed State Resolution 98 – 10 by Senator Elsie Lacy , a tribute to Ralphie III the University of Colorado bison mascot , stating : " That the University of Colorado and fans alike have lost a most beloved mascot and are saddened by the occasion of Ralphie III 's death .

 Ralphie IV was born in April 1997 on the Flying D Ranch in Gallatin Gateway , Montana , a part of Turner Ranches , the largest buffalo ranching operation in the United States . Named “ Rowdy ” by ranch hands , she was separated from her mother when she was about a month old and was literally found in the jaws of a coyote with bite marks around her neck . She survived the attack and was bottle @-@ fed by the ranch hands for four months . She was released back to the herd , but would not bond with them . She was then donated to Colorado as a yearling in the early spring of 1998 . Johnnie Parker , who trained and housed both Ralphie II and III , brought her back to Colorado from Montana and supervised all of her early training . 
 Parker retired from the program in May 1999 , after 15 years of working with the program , and housing and training Ralphie II , III , and IV . Longtime Colorado supporters Dale and Lynn Johnson housed Ralphie for the following year and coach Ted Davis assumed the program duties for the 2000 season . In the summer of 2001 , two former Ralphie Handlers and Colorado graduates , Benny Frei and Kevin Priola , took over the program including the housing of Ralphie . Priola still houses Ralphie IV . Ralphie IV was transported in the same custom steel , black stock trailer that carried Ralphie III . She also used the same harness and headstall that was used by Ralphie III . 
 Ralphie IV weighs in at about 1 @,@ 100 pounds , over three times her weight when she made her debut against Colorado State University at Mile High Stadium in Denver on September 5 , 1998 . Colorado won 42 @-@ 14 . Her final game was also against Colorado State University on August 31 , 2008 . Colorado won that game 38 @-@ 17 .

 The newest addition to the Colorado mascot family is Ralphie V. Like Ralphie IV , Ralphie V was donated to Colorado from a Ted Turner buffalo ranch . She was born in October 2006 on the <unk> Park Ranch in northern New Mexico . As the darkest calf in the herd , she was named " Blackout " by ranch hands . Ralphie Program Directors Benny Frei and Kevin Priola worked with Barney <unk> , the Bison Manager at <unk> Park Ranch , to bring Ralphie V to Colorado . Frei continues to house Ralphie V. 
 Ralphie V was introduced to Buffs fans at " Ralphie ’ s Salute to a New Era " on November 17 , 2007 . A little over one @-@ year @-@ old , she weighed in at only 450 pounds . Her debut game run came against Eastern Washington on September 6 , 2008 . Colorado won that game 31 @-@ 24 . Ralphie V is by far the fastest and largest of all the previous buffaloes . 
 Ralphie V has now reached maturity , weighing approximately 1 @,@ 200 pounds and standing about 5 feet tall at her hump . Her growing has stopped , but not her speed . She currently completes her run around Folsom Field , nearly two football fields in length , in approximately 25 seconds . 
 At the end of the 2008 season , Priola retired from the program , and John Graves , a former Ralphie Handler , was brought on as the Assistant Director . In the summer of 2015 Graves was promoted to Program Manager , replacing Gail Pederson who retired after 20 years of helping the program . Graves now oversees the day to day activities of the program and the training of the Handlers and Ralphie . In the spring of 2016 Taylor Stratton , also a former Ralphie Handler , was brought on as the new Assistant Coach . 
 Ralphie V was initially transported in the same custom steel , black stock trailer that carried Ralphie III and IV . In 2012 a new highly customized aluminum stock trailer was purchased through donations made to the program , which is now used to transport Ralphie V. In 2016 , a new black leather harness and headstall was used for Ralphie , built by Bill <unk> Saddlery out of Longmont , Colorado . The new harness kept the iconic brass “ CU ” located on the front of her headstall , and the leather color was switched from brown to black . The brass CU logo was made by Ray “ Butch ” Cornell , the son of Ray Cornell who built the first Ralphie harness . The previous harness that she wore was also worn by Ralphie III and IV . 
 Ralphie V makes many appearances throughout the school year to support Colorado and the University . During football seasons , she attends Ralphie ’ s Corral pre @-@ game party on campus . One hour before kickoff , Ralphie stands on the northeast sideline , ready to welcome the Buffs onto the field .

 The Ralphie Handlers are varsity student @-@ athletes who run with Ralphie , take her to appearances , and care for her year round . On an average week during football season , Ralphie Handlers will volunteer 20 – 30 hours to the program in training , practicing , appearances , and caring for the beloved mascot . In the off season they still put forth 20 hours a week toward the program , always caring for Ralphie and staying in top shape to be able to run with Ralphie . 
 <unk> & Practice 
 Ralphie Handlers have a specially @-@ designed workout that they do twice a week , created and supervised by Program Manager John Graves . They work on overall strength and speed , as well perform Olympic lifts to focus on quick and explosive movements with heavy weight . 
 Ralphie and her Handlers practice two times a week . In Folsom Field , Ralphie runs in a traditional right hand turn “ horseshoe ” run . Handlers primarily practice this run , working on the depth and width of the run , as well as the turn and , of course , speed . They also practice running with Ralphie in a straight line , as used for her trips to Mile High Stadium for the Rocky Mountain Showdown , and in an “ L ” shape for her annual soccer game run . Ralphie and her Handlers also practice a non @-@ traditional left hand “ horseshoe ” run , which is used when they run at the National Western Stock Show . 
 For special occasions , the Handlers can run in patterns that appear like a “ ribbon ” or “ tear drop . ” These runs help the team and Ralphie be flexible to accommodate any event venue where they may run . 
 Appearances with Ralphie 
 Ralphie Handlers also do appearances with Ralphie throughout the year to promote the University and the Athletic Department , as well as to educate the public about buffalo in general . Appearances are pre @-@ determined by the Athletic Department . 
 Ralphie of course runs at all Colorado home football games , bowl games , conference championship games , and very occasionally makes a special trip to a regular season away game . She also makes an appearance and runs at one soccer game a year , at the National Western Stock Show in Denver , and at the Fourth of July celebration held at Folsom Field . Ralphie and her Handlers also attend other Colorado athletic sporting events to support other varsity sports . 
 Special appearances can be arranged with donations to the program that will go to the program to help cover costs of Ralphie ’ s care and other expenses associated with keeping this great tradition going . 
 The Team 
 The Ralphie Live Mascot Program is under the direction of Program Manager John Graves , longtime Coach Benny Frei , and Assistant Coach Taylor Stratton . John , Benny , and Taylor were Ralphie Handlers when they were students at Colorado . They provide the training for Ralphie and her Handlers , and coordinate the care for Ralphie . The team consists of approximately 15 student @-@ athletes made up of both males and females . The Handlers earn a varsity letter for each year they are on the team . Handlers first started earning varsity letters in 1987 . Even though the Handlers do not fall under NCAA jurisdiction , the Athletic Department still holds them to the same standards as all other varsity athletes in the department , including minimum GPA requirements , full course load , and other rules . The first female Handler joined the team in 1993 . Females have had a strong presence in the Program ever since . 
 Originally the students who ran with Ralphie were called “ The Men Who Run with Ralphie . ” In the 1970 ’ s the term for the students changed to Ralphie Runners , as a direct representation of the feat that they did with Ralphie at each game . As the team and the program became more formalized and regulated , the term for the students became Ralphie Handlers in the early 1990 ’ s . The responsibilities and duties for the students that were on the team increase from just running with Ralphie , to also assisting in her overall care and maintenance , the reasoning behind changing their name from Ralphie Runners to Ralphie Handlers . 
 = = Traditions = = 
 Ralphie runs at all home football games , as well as bowl games , and conference championship games . Over the years of the program , Ralphie has made a handful of special trips to lead the team onto the field at away games as well . Colorado is one of only a few schools where the home team comes out team does not get in the way of Ralphie running . 
 Ralphie sometimes displays a custom @-@ made banner that reads " GO CU " on one side , and " Beat [ the opposing team ] " on the other side , such as " Beat CSU . " 
 Ralphie travels to home games and appearances in a highly customized aluminum stock trailer , purchased in 2012 through generous donations . Ralphie and her trailer are pulled through the infamous University Hill neighborhood before games to excite student fans on her way to the stadium . 
 Each year the Ralphie Handlers take a yearly trip to a buffalo ranch to learn more about buffalo , and see just how big male bison can get . 
 Ralphie is held in a secret location so that she will not be harassed or harmed , keeping her and the public safe .

 = The Boat Race 1849 ( March ) = 
 The 9th Boat Race took place on the River Thames on 29 March 1849 . Typically held annually , the event is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge . The race was won by Cambridge who triumphed over Oxford " easily " . As a result of the nature of the defeat , Oxford challenged Cambridge to a second race that year , which was to be held in December , the first and only time the Boat Race was competed for twice in a calendar year . Every member of the Cambridge crew came from Trinity College .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Cambridge went into the race leading overall with six victories to Oxford 's two . They had beaten Oxford in the previous race , held in 1845 , by three lengths . 
 Cambridge used an <unk> boat built by Searle , 62 feet 9 inches ( 19 @.@ 1 m ) in length and 26 inches ( 66 cm ) in width , while the Dark Blues ' boat was constructed by Hall of Oxford . The umpire for the race was J. C. Fellowes while the starter was Edward Searle . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11 st 2 @.@ 5 lb ( 70 @.@ 8 kg ) , just under 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 9 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Every rower from Cambridge was studying at Trinity College but all were new to the event ; not one Blue returned from the 1846 race . F. Blomfield was replaced as the Light Blue cox by George Booth as a result of an accident . Oxford welcomed back E. C. Burton at number four and their cox , <unk>

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station . Just prior to the race , Oxford had suggested a foreshortening of the course , in order to avoid both crews having to pass through the narrow arches of Barnes Bridge ; this was rejected by Cambridge and the conventional course was rowed . After a close start , Oxford pulled ahead and held a half @-@ length lead by the time they passed the Star and Garter pub . By Hammersmith Bridge , the Oxford crew began to slow , their cox made an error in steering and Cambridge began to reduce the deficit . At Chiswick Eyot the crews were level once again , and Cambridge started to draw away . Several lengths ahead by Barnes Bridge , Cambridge won by around 60 seconds . The result meant that Cambridge led overall with seven victories to Oxford 's two . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 Three main factors were attributed with Oxford 's substantial defeat . Firstly their stroke , and boat club president , William Rich had set such a high rating , he and his crew were unable to sustain it for the duration of the race , becoming quickly tired . Secondly , Rich himself suggested that Oxford 's vessel was inadequate , calling it " a bad boat " . Finally , poor steering had allowed Cambridge to pass them " like a shot " . 
 Given the nature of the defeat , Oxford sent out a challenge in October 1849 to Cambridge for a re @-@ row . For the first and only time in the history of the Boat Race , a second race was held in the same calendar year , this time in December . 
 = SMS Cöln ( 1909 ) = 
 SMS Cöln ( " His Majesty 's Ship Cologne " ) was a Kolberg @-@ class light cruiser of the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) during the First World War . She had three sister ships , SMS Kolberg , Mainz , and Augsburg . She was built by the Germaniawerft ; her hull was laid down in 1908 and she was launched in June 1909 . Cöln was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in June 1911 . She was armed with a main battery of twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns and had a top speed of 25 @.@ 5 kn ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) . After her commissioning , she served with the II Scouting Group , part of the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet . 
 Cöln was assigned to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914 , as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass . At the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914 , the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces , including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers . Cöln was initially stationed in support of the forces on the patrol line . She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces , and encountered Vice Admiral David Beatty 's battlecruisers . She was hit several times by the battlecruisers ' large @-@ caliber guns , but managed to escape in the haze . She inadvertently turned back toward them , however , and was quickly disabled when the battle resumed . The crew abandoned Cöln , but German vessels did not search the area for three days , and only one man survived . 
 = = Design = = 
 Cöln was 130 @.@ 5 meters ( 428 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 14 m ( 46 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 73 m ( 18 @.@ 8 ft ) forward . She displaced 4 @,@ 915 t ( 4 @,@ 837 long tons ; 5 @,@ 418 short tons ) at full combat load . Cöln was initially to be powered by two sets of Zoelly steam turbines manufactured by Escher Wyss & Cie. in Zürich . Her propulsion system was revised and instead consisted of two sets of Germaniawerft steam turbines driving four propellers . They were designed to give 19 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 14 @,@ 000 kW ) . These were powered by fifteen coal @-@ fired Marine water @-@ tube boilers . These gave the ship a top speed of 25 @.@ 5 knots ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) . Cöln carried 960 t ( 940 long tons ; 1 @,@ 060 short tons ) of coal that gave her a range of approximately 3 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 500 km ; 4 @,@ 000 mi ) at 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . 
 Cöln had a crew of eighteen officers and 349 enlisted men . The ship was armed with twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , eight were located amidships , four on either side , and two were side by side aft . She also carried four 5 @.@ 2 cm SK L / 55 anti @-@ aircraft guns . She was also equipped with a pair of 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes submerged in the hull . She could also carry 100 mines . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the deck was covered with up to 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick armor plate . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Cöln was ordered under the contract name Ersatz Schwalbe and was laid down on 25 May 1908 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel . She was launched on 5 June 1909 and christened by the mayor of Cöln , Max Wallraf , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . During the builders ' sea trials , the Zoelly turbines were found to be poor quality and they were replaced with Germaniawerft @-@ produced models . This work significantly delayed her completion . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 16 June 1911 , and she began her acceptance trials . These were interrupted by a fleet parade for Kaiser Wilhelm II on 5 September . On 10 October , she was assigned to the II Scouting Group , which screened for the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group . She participated in the normal peacetime routine of individual , squadron , and fleet exercises and cruises over the next two years without incident . Fregattenkapitän Hans Zenker served as her commander from October 1911 to September 1913 . 
 From 28 August to 21 September , she served as the flagship for Konteradmiral ( Rear Admiral ) Franz von Hipper , then the deputy commander of the reconnaissance forces , while Hipper was temporarily displaced from his usual flagship , the battlecruiser Von der Tann . Hipper left briefly , but returned on 26 September and remained aboard through the following year . During the autumn fleet maneuvers in September 1913 , Cöln attempted to warn the crew of zeppelin L 1 of the deteriorating weather conditions , but they did not receive the message . As a result , the zeppelin crashed off the island of Helgoland . After the conclusion of the maneuvers , Hipper lowered his flag , and he was replaced by Kommodore ( Commodore ) Leberecht Maass . The year 1914 began with the normal training routine , but as tensions rose following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June forced the cancellation of the planned fleet exercises for the end of July . Starting on 30 July , as war loomed , Cöln was stationed in the German Bight to monitor maritime traffic . 
 After the outbreak of World War I at the beginning of August 1914 , she and several other cruisers were tasked with patrol duties in the Heligoland Bight . The cruisers were divided with the torpedo boat flotillas , and assigned to rotate through nightly patrols into the North Sea . From 1 to 7 August , Cöln lay in the Schillig roadstead . She thereafter went to the mouth of the Weser , where she was joined by the cruiser Hamburg and the IV Torpedo @-@ boat Flotilla . As part of the patrol operations , Cöln conducted a sortie on the night of 15 August with Stuttgart and the I and II Torpedo @-@ boat Flotillas , without incident .
