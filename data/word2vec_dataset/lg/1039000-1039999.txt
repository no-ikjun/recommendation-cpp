 Mapenor was the son of Robert de <unk> and his wife Matilda , who lived in Herefordshire at Hampton , Herefordshire near Leominster . Where or how he was educated is unknown , but he was given the title of magister , which implies he studied at some school and attained a degree of education . 
 Mapenor served William de Braose as a clerk from 1189 to 1196 , and then served William 's son Giles de Braose , Bishop of Hereford . He occupied the office of Dean of Hereford before 29 September 1202 . During his time at Hereford , he was the subject of the Prose <unk> Questions , which compared his sexual powers to three other clerks . He also served as a judge for the papacy and defended the cathedral chapter in two disputes over the chapter 's rights . 
 When the Braose family fled England in 1208 , with Giles going to France and William going to Ireland , Mapenor left also , going to Ireland where he appears as a witness on documents of William de Braose 's . It is unclear when he returned to England , but by January 1212 Mapenor was once more in Hereford . 
 = = Bishop of Hereford = = 
 Mapenor was elected to the see of Hereford on 3 February 1216 . Mapenor was elected by the cathedral chapter in spite of the fact that his name was not on the list of possible candidates given the chapter by King John of England . The king objected to the election , and took the case to Pope Honorius III , but the king died before the case was decided . John had objected because he claimed the cathedral chapter , who elected Mapenor , was excommunicate when they met for the election of the new bishop , which would have made the election invalid . His election had been overseen by the papal legate Guala Bicchieri , who was also assigned the case by the papacy after John objected . Bicchieri decided the case shortly after the death of John on the night of 18 – 19 October 1216 , in Mapenor 's favour . Mapenor gave Stephen Langton , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and Mapenor 's ecclesiastical superior , a declaration of obedience on 27 October 1216 , and was consecrated on 18 December 1216 by Sylvester the Bishop of Worcester . 
 Although Mapenor 's time as bishop was short – just over two years – over 20 of his charters survive . These include a number for Leominster Priory and Reading Abbey . He also dealt with a dispute over the rights of a Norman abbey , Lyre Abbey , over churches it possessed in the diocese of Hereford , settling it by making the churches part of a prebend in Hereford Cathedral held by the abbot of <unk> . Mapenor supported the new king Henry III in his efforts to suppress the rebellion begun under Henry 's father , King John . Mapenor was with the forces of the king before the Battle of Lincoln in May 1217 . The bishop was also present when the king and Llywelyn of Gwynedd , a Welsh prince , concluded a peace treaty at Worcester in March 1218 . The king employed Mapenor in April as a diplomatic escort , ordering the bishop to bring some of the southern Welsh princes to Woodstock to swear fealty to Henry III . In June of that year , Mapenor attended the consecration of the new Worcester Cathedral . He was the recipient of one of a series of writs sent to bishops to stop the persecution of Jews . These writs may have resulted from a decision of the king 's council to oppose some acts of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 , which placed restrictions on Jews . 
 = = Death = = 
 Mapenor died in April 1219 , probably on the 16th , although older sources give a date of the 13th . He had issued a charter as recently as 14 April 1219 . He was buried in Hereford Cathedral . One of his surviving charters documents a licence given to Leominster Priory as alms for the souls of his parents and his predecessor as bishop , Giles de Braose . 
 = Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru = 
 Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru ( マリア様がみてる , lit . The Virgin Mary is Watching or Maria Watches Over Us ) , often shortened to <unk> ( <unk> ) , is a Japanese light novel series written by <unk> Konno with illustrations by Reine Hibiki . Originally written as a short story in 1997 , Shueisha published 39 light novel volumes from April 1998 to April 2012 . The story focuses on a group of teenage girls attending the Catholic Lillian Girls ' Academy in Tokyo , Japan . Its storyline largely revolves around the lives and close relationships of the school 's student council known as the Yamayuri Council . 
 A manga adaptation was published by Shueisha in Margaret and its sister magazine The Margaret . Between 2004 and 2009 , the series was adapted by Studio Deen into three 13 @-@ episode anime television series and a five @-@ episode original video animation ( OVA ) series . The anime adaptations have been released in North America by Nozomi Entertainment under the title Maria Watches Over Us . A live @-@ action film adaptation was released in Japan in November 2010 . Several audio dramas and music albums were also published . 
 Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru received generally positive reviews by critics . It has been described as representative of yuri novels , and has been credited with starting " the modern yuri trend , " in addition to reviving the Class S genre . Critics have praised the series for its strong characterization , even among peripheral characters , and for its emphasis on romance and emotion over sexuality . The dramatization , however , has been criticized as being overly dramatic at times , but the lack of malicious characters has been described as reducing the chance for more drama . The extensive use of French titles has also been criticized as being distracting and initially difficult to follow . Over 5 @.@ 4 million copies of the light novels have been published . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting and themes = = = 
 The setting for Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru is Lillian Girls ' Academy ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a fictional Catholic school founded in 1901 in Musashino , Tokyo , Japan ; the school is depicted as an elegant , clean , pure , and very prestigious institution . Among the facilities of Lillian , aside from the classrooms , there is a church , a greenhouse , a kendo dojo , an auditorium , a park , and the Rose Mansion , where the Yamayuri Council meet . The students are very respectable and in good standing . The uniform at the school is a long , black Japanese school uniform with a white collar . 
 The school uses the fictional sœur system where any second- or third @-@ year student , the grande sœur ( " big sister " ) , might pick a younger girl who will become her " sœur " ( sister in French ) . The grande sœur gives her the petite sœur ( " little sister " ) a rosary and promises to look after her and guide her . The basic etiquette demands the petite sœur to call her grande sœur " <unk> @-@ sama " ( older sister in Japanese ) . Aside from being used in prayer , the rosary is the instrument that certifies the sœur union and relationship between two students . There is an implicit code of behavior between sœurs , especially in the Yamayuri Council — the student council of the school : quietness , measure and respect towards each other ; values deeply attached to traditional Japanese education . 
 French is occasionally used throughout the story ; for example , the series is given the French subtitle La Vierge Marie vous regarde , which means " The Virgin Mary is watching you " . In keeping with the tone of the series , formal language is used : <unk> 'yō ( <unk> ) is a strictly formal and respectful greeting in Japanese , and is used both to greet and to bid farewell . By custom , this greeting is used often in the Lillian School ; this has been one of the distinguishable and popular phrases of the series , and it is used to begin or to finish each volume . The Animax English @-@ language version translates the word as " good day to you " . 
 The Lillian Girls ' Academy uses the lily symbolism as the white lily is the flower of the Virgin Mary . The white lily is a Christian symbol of virginity and purity . This lily imagery is also used as a reference to yuri : the story has some elements of romance between female characters ; the use of lilies reinforces this in subtext , as do the names of the student council and of the school itself . The series is only explicit about a romantic relationship once in a flashback , but many of the sisters have romantic friendships . 
 The musical choices of the Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru anime adaptations are generally classical music @-@ inspired . The Christian hymn " Maria @-@ sama no Kokoro " ( <unk> , The Virgin Mary 's Heart ) is often referred to in the series . In the context of the series , it is a children 's song taught to the students at Lillian . 
 = = = Story and characters = = = 
 Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru 's story revolves around the students of the Lillian Girls ' Academy and is character @-@ driven , focusing on interactions between the characters rather than any sort of ongoing plot or goal to attain . When the story begins , Yumi Fukuzawa , a first @-@ year student at Lillian , is praying in front of the Virgin Mary statue near the school entrance when she is suddenly approached by a cold second @-@ year student named Sachiko Ogasawara who straightens Yumi 's uniform neckerchief . This seemingly simple act of kindness stays with Yumi the rest of the day , and she speaks of her meeting with Sachiko to her friends during class and lunch . 
 After school is over , Yumi 's classmate Tsutako <unk> meets with Yumi to show her that she took a photograph of Yumi 's meeting with Sachiko earlier that morning . Yumi asks if she can have the photo , but Tsutako says she will give her the snapshot under two conditions : one being that Tsutako can display it at the upcoming school festival , and two being that Yumi get Sachiko 's permission to do so as well . Yumi agrees to this , which sets in motion a series of events involving the entire Yamayuri Council . A few weeks after first meeting Sachiko , Yumi accepts Sachiko 's rosary and therefore agrees to become her petite sœur . This officially inducts Yumi into the Yamayuri Council where she assists them in school matters alongside Yoshino Shimazu and <unk> <unk> — the petite sœurs of Rei Hasekura and Sei Satō , respectively . Through her activities in the Yamayuri Council , Yumi becomes closer to the other members and generally finds her experiences with the group to be enjoyable . 
 = = = = Yamayuri Council = = = = 
 Much of the story of Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru revolves around the Yamayuri Council ( <unk> , <unk> , lit . " Mountain Lily Council " ) , which acts as the student council . The Yamayuri Council meet in a building called the Rose Mansion ( <unk> , Bara no <unk> ) . Located within the school , it consists of two stories , including a meeting room on the second story . The Yamayuri Council itself consists of three offices , named after roses : Rosa <unk> ( ロサ ・ <unk> , Rosa <unk> ) , Rosa <unk> ( ロサ ・ <unk> , Rosa <unk> ) , and Rosa Chinensis ( ロサ ・ <unk> , Rosa <unk> ) . These are also referred to by their colors ; the Yellow Rose ( <unk> , <unk> ) is Rosa <unk> , the White Rose ( <unk> , <unk> ) is Rosa <unk> , and the Red Rose ( <unk> , <unk> ) is Rosa Chinensis . 
 Due to the high importance the three Rose families have in the development of the student activities within school , those who become petites sœurs of any of the mentioned families receive a functional " inheritance " through the grandes sœurs teachings , to adopt a position given certain circumstances . In this way , there are patrons recognized through the generations of the members of the Rose families . Still , after graduating , the grandes sœurs of the Yamayuri Council may continue with a fair participation in the events concerning their families , as shown in the novels . 
 A Rose ( <unk> , Bara ) , or Rosa ( ロサ ) , is one of three senior members of the Yamayuri Council , although it is also possible to generally speak of all the members of the Yamayuri Council as roses . A Rose makes the important decisions within this group , since she has control over the student council . Candidates for the position , which lasts through the school year , are chosen through an election . Any student can run to become a Rose , although the position is usually given to the en boutons , the Roses ' petite sœurs . 
 The petite sœur of a Rosa is called an en bouton ( <unk> ・ <unk> , an <unk> ) , otherwise known as a " rose bud " ( <unk> , bara no <unk> ) . En bouton is French for " in bud " — as used in the example Rosa Chinensis en bouton — and is unofficially considered part of the Yamayuri Council , as is the petite sœur of the en bouton , if she has one . The en boutons must be in a lower year than their Rosa , and generally the en boutons execute the plans discussed by the Roses , like assistants . Although the Rosa positions of the Yamayuri Council are traditionally passed to the en bouton on the graduation of the current holder , they are nonetheless elected offices which anyone may run for . 
 The petite sœur of the en bouton is called en bouton petite sœur ( <unk> ・ <unk> ・ <unk> ・ <unk> , an <unk> <unk> <unk> ) — as used in the example Rosa Chinensis en bouton petite sœur — and is otherwise known as the " younger sister of a rose bud " ( <unk> , bara no <unk> no <unk> ) . She must be in a lower year than her en bouton and performs small duties , such as attending to the Roses ' en boutons , cleaning the Rose Mansion , and making tea and snacks for the Yamayuri Council . This lasts a school year , and the following year , when their en bouton is elected as Rosas , the petite sœurs become en boutons automatically .

 After writing her debut novel series Yume no Miya ( <unk> , Palace of Dreams ) for three years starting in March 1994 , <unk> Konno published a short story called " Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru " in the February 1997 issue of the shōjo magazine Cobalt with illustrations by Yuma Aoi . In 1993 , Konno had previously won both Cobalt 's Novel Award and Readers ' Award for Yume no Miya , and by February 1997 , nine volumes had been released . 
 In the afterword of the first Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru light novel volume , Konno admitted that Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru was very different from her usual genre of story @-@ telling in Yume no Miya , which she described as an " imperial story " set in a fictionalized classical Japan . For the basis of Lillian Girls ' Academy , Konno drew from her own experiences attending an all @-@ girl high school , and some of the scenery of Lillian was also taken from this , such as a ginkgo pathway which stretched out from the main gate . The laid @-@ back atmosphere of the school was also incorporated into Lillian , although Konno 's school did not have a sœur system and it was not a Catholic school . Konno had been exposed to Christianity from a young age : she attended a completely Christian kindergarten which had a sanctuary and cloister in the middle of the school . Konno notes that she put her own questions about the Virgin Mary 's heart into the story via Yumi . Konno ultimately mixed together various sources and ended up with Lillian Girls ' Academy .

 It was reported in April 2010 that 5 @.@ 4 million copies of the original light novels have been published . Reception to the Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru anime series has been generally positive , although Anime News Network ( ANN ) noted that the series leaves itself " wide open to cynical sniggering . " Carlos Ross from Them Anime regarded it as " one of the most beautiful and graceful anime " series , adding that the animation is sometimes of questionable quality but overall " very appealing " . Andrew Shelton from AMR found the series to be " fairly unique " compared to other shōjo works , explaining that although the story is " a little basic " and " overly dramatic " , what is most important is the " response and actions of the character on who the story is focused . " Stig Høgset , also from Them Anime , commented that the third season was criticized for being too short , but he personally did not feel " like it was lacking something . " Jason Thompson credits Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru with starting " the modern yuri trend . " Newer anime titles that Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru is compared to include Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru , Strawberry Panic ! , Best Student Council , and Aria . Carlos Ross , writing about the first novel in the series , felt the story was a " classic rags @-@ to @-@ riches tale , " but that it was " also sweet , touching and witty when it needs to be . " He criticized the lack of teachers and schoolwork in the series , which led to the plot being filled with extracurricular activities , which are common to high school series . He also criticized Yumi 's low self @-@ esteem . 
 A characteristic element of the series is the extensive use of French titles , which Carlos Ross has criticized as " distracting " . Mania.com criticized the early anime episodes as being " difficult " , and saying that the first episode " throws a lot of terms and names at you " . On the other hand , Ross compared the " atmosphere " presented by the series ' artwork with those from other anime titles of similar setting , including the bright and vivid Revolutionary Girl Utena . Another reviewer from Them Anime also compared Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru with <unk> e ... , but noted that the former is much less dramatic . Marc Hairston commented on the unusual character designs compared to other series , and said they are " ordinary students . " ANN also noted the " clear , expressive eyes and character designs that are gifted with an understated mobility , " praising the casting choices , and noting that even " peripheral " characters are " fully realized . " Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime described the relationships between the characters as " intensely platonic " and " pseudo @-@ gay " for the most part . 
 ANN noted that the second anime season tends to <unk> , especially in the last three episodes . ANN also describes the second season as " more embarrassing and shoujo @-@ ai oriented " than the first season , but that the solid characterization is still a strength of the series . Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime appreciated the focus on characters other than Yumi and Sachiko for the second season , regarding <unk> 's loss of Sei and befriending Noriko as being " one of the more moving " arcs of Printemps . ANN regarded the OVA season as the best of the first three seasons , citing the improved production standards and the less melodramatic storylines . ANN notes that the fourth season is " a return to dramatic form " after the relaxation of the OVA series , but it is not as melodramatic as the second season , due to the increased maturity of the cast . Chris Beveridge , writing for Mania.com , found it odd that Yumi and Sachiko did not spend so much time together in the fourth season , and felt that the series needed an epilogue , but enjoyed seeing Yumi taking on some " adult responsibilities . " 
 Andrew Shelton has suggested that Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru 's " reduced capacity for epic drama " is due to the lack of malicious characters ; he considers the series " pure shōjo " , mostly due to its character @-@ driven storyline . Japanese reviewers for their part regard the story as a revival of the Class S genre , and specifically a modern @-@ day equivalent of Nobuko Yoshiya 's Hana Monogatari . Hairston notes that Maria @-@ sama ga Miteru emphasizes romance and emotion over sexuality , and it has a respectful treatment of its homoerotic themes . He describes the series as " one of the most interesting and touching anime series of the last two years " , adding that it is " about self @-@ discovery and self @-@ acceptance . " 
 A Pizza Hut tie @-@ in campaign for the fourth anime series started on January 7 , 2008 . The Rose Mansion from the story was recreated in the Second Life virtual world and opened on February 8 , 2008 .

 The film has a handful of differences from Rubel 's original work . Many character names were changed for the film , including Cliff Monroe to Steven Monroe , Puff Gordon to Ed Gordon , and Nancy <unk> to Nancy Richards . Additionally , the majority of the characters in the film were nameless in the book . The ending was also tweaked . In the novel , Monroe professes his love for Nancy <unk> and they happily marry in Painted Springs . In the film , this does not happen , and Monroe just leaves the area .

 The film marked the first entry of the Medico film series by Columbia Pictures . The following two films in the series were Thunder Over the Prairie ( July 1941 ) and Prairie Stranger ( September 1941 ) . However , they were not based on Rubel 's works . More sequels to The Medico of Painted Springs were planned for production , but were never greenlit after the dismal box office performance of the two released sequels . All three films had Charles Starrett playing the role of Dr. Steven Monroe . 
 = Johann Jakob von Wunsch = 
 Johann Jakob von Wunsch ( 1717 – 1788 ) was soldier of fortune and Prussian general of infantry , and a particularly adept commander of light infantry . The son of a Württemberg furrier , he served in several armies in the course of his lengthy career . 
 Shortly after he turned 18 , his father enrolled him in Württemberg service . In the Württemberg Regiment , he supported the Austrians against the Ottoman Empire in 1737 . Later , he served in Bavarian army during the War of the Austrian Succession . In 1748 he came to the notice of Prince Henry , and enter Prussian service for the Seven Years ' War , where he led an autonomous corps in many raids and skirmishes that wrought havoc on the Austrian forces . His incursion over Prussia 's border with Bohemia in 1778 was the opening action of the War of the Bavarian Succession . 
 In peace time , he devoted his efforts to training light infantry , developing an autonomous corps of skirmishers . Frederick the Great 's successor , Frederick Wilhem II , promoted him to general of infantry and raised him to the Prussian nobility . 
 = = Family and early military career = = 
 Wunsch was born on 22 December 1717 in Heidenheim , Württemberg to a furrier and died at Prenzlau , in the Kingdom of Prussia on 18 October 1788 . His grandfather served in the Austrian military , and his father had served for a few years in the Bavarian military . He received schooling locally , and on his eighteenth year , his father sent him to Officer Cadet training in the Duke of Württemberg 's Regiment . While with this regiment in Vienna , he married Josephine le Roi , the daughter of a Habsburg War Commissary . They had one son . 
 = = Early military career = = 
 The Duke of Württemberg 's regiment supported the Austrian military in its wars with the Ottoman Empire . Between 1737 and 1739 , Wunsch participated in several battles in the vicinity of Banja Luka , in modern @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina . By 1739 , he realized he had prospects in neither Austrian nor Württemberg service and he entered Bavarian service as the oldest second lieutenant in the Hussar Regiment Frangipani . 
 Upon the death of Charles VII , Holy Roman Emperor , the new Duke of Bavaria , Maximilian III Joseph , agreed to forgo any imperial aspirations . Wunsch 's Bavarian regiment went into the service in the Netherlands , where it eventually liberated Brussels from the French in 1745 . In the course of this service , Wunsch advanced to the rank of Rittmeister , or captain of cavalry . At the conclusion of the war in 1749 , Rittmeister Wunsch acquired a staff position and a pension and remained in the Netherlands with his wife and son . When it became apparent that there would be another war , in 1756 he offered his services to Frederick the Great and became the oldest captain in Prussian service . His unit came under the command of Prince Henry of Prussia , an officer who understood the value of the new military formation of light troops for skirmishing and raids . 
 = = = Seven Years ' War = = = 
 Throughout the Seven Years ' War , Wunsch operated successfully as a light troops officer . After the Battle of Prague in 1757 , he was promoted to major . He followed this up with stellar action near Torgau in September , and the following day his troops overran Leipzig . The subsequent Prussian successes at the battles of Breslau and Leuthen led to his promotion , this time by Frederick himself , to lieutenant colonel . The King also gave him command of an independent battalion and awarded him the Order Pour le Mérite . Wunsch made a brief journey to his home town of Heidenheim and returned to his unit in Bohemia . Wunsch 's raids were so successful that , in 1758 , Frederick promoted him to the rank of colonel and gave him his own regiment of light troops to command . Two days later , at the Battle of <unk> , the Prussian army was nearly destroyed . Frederick barely escaped with his life , assisted by his remaining cavalry . Wunsch 's small force remained intact and provided the rear guard for Frederick 's escape . In Berlin , Wunsch commanded the city 's defenses . 
 From April to November 1759 , he led his regiment on a series of raids and skirmishes in Silesia , Bohemia , Franconia , and Thuringia , such as the Battle of <unk> ( Silesia ) in August 1759 . Wunsch took the pass of <unk> from the Austrians , skirmished with them at <unk> and attacked and beat a small force of Austrians by Weinberg . He acquired two cannons in the engagement . He successfully raided various towns and cities held by Austria and her allies in Franconia , Saxony , and Bohemia , capturing supplies and cannons and frequently taking many prisoners . His son was a lieutenant in his regiment during these raids . 
 Following this action , Frederick sent Wunsch into Saxony with a corps of 10 @,@ 000 – 12 @,@ 000 men in his first independent command . There he participated in the Battle of Hoyerswerda with General Frederick August Finck . Prince Henry , in overall command of the army , surprised von Daun at Hoyerswerda by punching a hole in the Austrian defensive line . This success gave Frederick the first good news he had had in weeks and confirmed to Frederick that Wunsch had been worthy of the trust placed in him . 
 After two months of skirmishing in Bohemia , in November Wunsch participated in the Battle of <unk> . There , Count Leopold Joseph von Daun 's army isolated and captured Finck . Subsequently , Wunsch led both his corps and Finck 's until they too were surrounded : Daun 's army was three times the size of Finck 's and Wunsch 's combined force . Wunsch capitulated on 21 November 1759 and spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner in Innsbruck . 
 After the war , Frederick reorganized his army , placing nine of his generals under command of General Hans Joachim von Zieten . An additional eight were placed under command of Finck . Wunsch remained the only general with an independent corps , further unusual in that he was not Prussian . 
 = = Late military career = = 
 Wunsch used the ensuing years of peace in garrison at Prenzlau to reorganize the light corps of Frederick 's army . In 1778 , he patrolled the border of Austrian Bohemia during the tense negotiations surrounding Bavarian Succession crisis . His entry into Bohemia in early July of that year was the first action of the War of the Bavarian Succession . There were no major engagements in the war , only a series of raids in which both sides tried to deny each other access to food and fodder . After his initial foray at the Silesia border , he and his command remained at the County of Glatz , guarding the military commissary and the bakery . 
 In 1787 , Frederick Wilhelm II , Frederick the Great 's successor , named Wunsch a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle for his excellent service . After a lengthy illness , Wunsch died of a pneumonia in Prenzlau on 18 October 1788 .

 = Northern Woods and Water Route = 
 The Northern Woods and Water Route is a 2 @,@ 400 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @,@ 500 mi ) route through northern British Columbia , Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba . As early as the 1950s community groups came together to establish a northern travel route ; this was proposed as the Northern Yellowhead Transportation Route . The Northern Woods and Water Route Association was established in 1974 , and encouraged promotion of the route with the promise of an increase in tourist travel . The route was designated in 1974 and is well signed throughout the connector highways . The route starts at Dawson Creek at the British Columbia Spirit River Highway 49 and ends at Winnipeg , Manitoba , running through the northern region of the western provinces . The Northern Woods and Water Route ( NWWR ) includes connector routes from west to east including British Columbia Highway 49 , Alberta Highway 49 , AB Hwy 2A , AB Hwy 2 , AB Hwy 55 , Saskatchewan Highway 55 , SK Hwy 9 , Manitoba Provincial Road 283 , Manitoba Highway 10 , MB PTH 5 , MB PTH 68 , MB PTH 6 . The halfway point of the NWWR is approximately at <unk> , Saskatchewan 
 Fur traders and early settlers utilised the rivers and Red River cart roads such as Long Trail until the early 20th century when the railroad and bush planes supplemented travel to this northern boreal transition area . Corduroy roads provided a means for early land vehicles to cross over muskeg and swamp . Horse drawn ploughs filled low areas , settlers hauled gravel and cleared bush for the road ways surveyed along high elevations following lake and river shore lines . Municipalities would grade and gravel roads providing transportation between trading centres . The all weather road arrived alongside of the NWWR association 's impetus for a travel and tourism corridor along the northern area of the western provinces . Traffic volume along the route is a major factor to determine highway classification , surface type , and construction upgrades .

 = = History = = 
 The Long Trail followed the Peace River 100 miles ( 160 km ) 530 across northern AB . As the flow of traffic increased due to the fur trade industry along the Long Trail , stopping places developed providing rest and food for travelers . In 1923 , the three routes out of Lac La Biche were to the west , which corresponds to the route of AB Hwy 55 along the south shores of Lesser Slave Lake . Edmonton or Saddle Lake trail departed to the south , which would be the initial stages of AB Hwy 55 out of Lac La Biche . Heart Lake trail traveled northeast from Lac La Biche , which would form a base for secondary AB Hwy 858 . Work was done on the Athabaska Trail to make it passable for motor traffic as many roads had been graded . Before stopping places developed , caches were set up at stopping points along the way . Before the arrival of rails the waterways such as the Lesser Slave Lake near Athabasca , Alberta and the Saskatchewan River near Prince Albert were traversed by long boat , canoe , and steamship . The rail did not reach the northern areas until the early twentieth century due to the geological hurdles of mountains , muskeg , swamp , boreal forest , and river systems to traverse . A huge flood in 1899 near The Pas left no ground to walk upon , yet the railway track construction work began in 1906 , with more continuing in 1911 . In 1928 , the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) surveyed their line across the Saskatchewan River near Prince Albert , and contractors started work on the bridge . The upper deck served the train , and the lower deck was built for highway traffic opening for vehicles in 1932 . In 1929 , travel was overland on trails , and rivers were forded in many places . 
 As early as 1896 oil wells were drilled at Athabasca supplementing the rich soils and grain growing economy . There was a rush of settlers to the area in the early 20th century , at this time transportation for goods was freighted on Lesser Slave Lake to connecting river routes or via early rail lines overland . Fortune seekers during the gold rush of 1896 traveled north through Edmonton or took the rail as far north as Prince Albert . The westerly route proceeded from Prince Albert to Green Lake , and from there to the Long Trail by following the Beaver River to the Churchill River , Athabaska , Slave and Mackenzie rivers until bearing north following the rivers of the Yukon to Dawson City . 
 The first garage to service McLaughlin cars opened in High River as early as 1909 . In 1912 travelers could stop here at a filling station for their automobiles . This same year the speed limit through town was not over ten miles per hour ( 16 km / h ) and not over five miles per hour ( 8 km / h ) upon approaching another horse or pedestrian , the fine was not more than C $ 50 @.@ 00 . The Pas , Manitoba saw its first car arrive in 1916 , yet it had been active with fur trading posts and explorers in the area since 1741 . 
 Settlers would not only haul gravel for the new roadways , but they also cleared brush for the road allowance . Early roads did not follow the road allowances of the Dominion Land Survey , but rather kept to higher ground , however due to the nature of the Boreal transition ecoregion , <unk> and swamps still needed to be traversed . The first pioneers filled these watery areas with branches and brush and proceeded along their trip . Later corduroy roads were built across these areas were traffic got mired in the mud . A corduroy road consisted of logs laid across the road as a rail tie is across the rail line , however the logs were placed one against another and mud filled between the logs for a smoother surface . One log provided about 6 inches ( 15 cm ) of roadway , so only the worst areas were constructed in this fashion . 
 Debden , Saskatchewan had a horse and caboose taxi for settlers as early as 1912 providing regular trips to Prince Albert and taking children to school . In 1945 , the taxi service was provided by automobile . Bush planes arrived in the 1920s to the northern bus areas providing communication in an era where travel was limited when the snow fell , or the water froze . In 1968 , High Prairie was looking forward to hard surface construction for AB Hwy 2 which would supplement the economic trading base with tourism . A new bridge across the Saskatchewan River at Prince Albert was erected in 1974 , and caused re @-@ routing of the highway by one and a half miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) . Community groups came together as early as the 1950s to establish a northern travel route . 
 The early name proposed for these travel corridor was the Northern Yellowhead Transportation Route . The Northern Woods and Water Route Association was established in 1974 , their further promotion of the route was to increase tourist travel . George R. Stephenson ( 1916 – 2003 ) , of McLennan was one of the first facilitators to organise the Northern Woods and Water Route across Western Canada in 1974 . Henry Andres was chairman of the Northern Woods and Water Association for eight years wherein the association worked on placing NWWR signs both on provincial highways and maps . <unk> promoting tourism were printed , and the association sponsored more than five cavalcades where wagons would traverse the route between Winnipeg and Dawson Creek promoting tourism and the creation of the travel corridor . On August 21 , 1975 , one of these Northern Woods and Water <unk> stopped at Nipawin Regional Park and toured Nipawin . 
 Current engineering concerns would be to determine maintenance of the current travel corridor and construction upgrades . The route does contain a variety of road surfaces ranging from asphalt concrete , thin membrane surface ( TMS ) , granular pavements and gravel highway . Insight into current surface texture , traffic volume , traffic speed , percentage of loaded trucks , climate variations , construction costs and time as well as available materials will affect upgrade procedures . The entire route is paved except for a Class 4 gravel highway segment between Nipawin and the Manitoba border . Here the traffic volume declines to 80 and 85 vpd and two checkpoints near the Manitoba border .

The 610 Office is the implementation arm of the Central Leading Group on Dealing with the Falun Gong ( CLGDF ) , also known as the Central Leading Group on Dealing with Heretical Religions . 
 The central 610 Office has traditionally been headed by a high @-@ ranking member of the Communist Party 's Politburo Standing Committee , and it frequently directs other state and party organs in the anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign . It is closely associated with the powerful Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China . Local 610 Offices are also established at provincial , district , municipal and neighborhood levels , and are estimated to number approximately 1 @,@ 000 across the country . 
 The main functions of the 610 Offices include coordinating anti @-@ Falun Gong propaganda , surveillance and intelligence collection , and the punishment and " reeducation " of Falun Gong adherents . The office is reportedly involved in the extrajudicial sentencing , coercive reeducation , torture , and sometimes death of Falun Gong practitioners . 
 Since 2003 , the 610 Office 's mission has been expanded to include targeting other religious and qigong groups deemed heretical or harmful by the Communist Party ( CCP ) , though Falun Gong remains its main priority . 
 = = Background = = 
 Falun Gong , also known as Falun Dafa , is a form of spiritual qigong practice that involves meditation , energy exercises , and a moral philosophy drawing on Buddhist tradition . The practice was introduced by Li Hongzhi in Northeast China in the spring of 1992 , towards the end of China 's " qigong boom . " 
 Falun Gong initially enjoyed considerable official support during the early years of its development , and amassed a following of millions . By the mid @-@ 1990s , however , Chinese authorities sought to rein in the influence of qigong practices , enacting more stringent requirements on the country ’ s various qigong denominations . In 1996 , possibly in response to the escalating pressure to formalize ties with the party @-@ state , Falun Gong filed to withdraw from the state @-@ run qigong association . Following this severance of ties to the state , the group came under increasing criticism and surveillance from the country ’ s security apparatus and propaganda department . Falun Gong books were banned from further publication in July 1996 , and state @-@ run news outlets began criticizing the group as a form of " feudal superstition , " whose " theistic " orientation was at odds with the official ideology and national agenda . 
 On April 25 , 1999 , over 10 @,@ 000 Falun Gong adherents demonstrated quietly near the Zhongnanhai government compound to request official recognition and an end to the escalating harassment against them . Security czar and politburo member Luo Gan was the first to draw attention to the gathering crowd . Luo reportedly called Communist Party general secretary Jiang Zemin , and demanded a decisive solution to the Falun Gong problem . 
 A group of five Falun Gong representatives presented their demands to then @-@ Premier Zhu Rongji and , apparently satisfied with his response , the group dispersed peacefully . Jiang Zemin was reported to have been deeply angered by the event , however , and expressed concern over the fact that a number of high @-@ ranking bureaucrats , Communist Party officials , and members of the military establishment had taken up Falun Gong . That evening , Jiang disseminated a letter through Party ranks ordering that Falun Gong must be crushed . 
 = = Establishment = = 
 On 7 June 1999 , Jiang Zemin convened a meeting of the Politburo to address the Falun Gong issue . In the meeting , Jiang described Falun Gong as a grave threat to Communist Party authority — " something unprecedented in the country since its founding 50 years ago " — and ordered the creation of a special leading group within the party 's Central Committee to " get fully prepared for the work of disintegrating [ Falun Gong ] . " 
 On 10 June , the 610 Office was formed to handle day @-@ to @-@ day coordination of the anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign . Luo Gan was selected to helm of the office , whose mission at the time was described as studying , investigating , and developing a " unified approach … to resolve the Falun Gong problem . " The office was not created with any legislation , and there are no provisions describing its precise mandate . Nonetheless , it was authorized “ to deal with central and local , party and state agencies , which were called upon to act in close coordination with that office , ” according to UCLA professor James Tong . 
 On 17 June 1999 , the 610 Office came under the newly created Central Leading Group for Dealing with Falun Gong , headed by Politburo Standing Committee member Li <unk> . Four other deputy directors of the Central Leading Group also held high @-@ level positions in the Communist Party , including minister of the propaganda department , Ding <unk> . The leaders of the 610 Office and CLGDF were " able to call on top government and party officials to work on the case and draw on their institutional resources , " and had personal access to the Communist Party general secretary and the Premier . 
 Journalist Ian Johnson , whose coverage of the crackdown on Falun Gong earned him a Pulitzer Prize , wrote that the job of the 610 Office was " to mobilize the country 's pliant social organizations . Under orders from the Public Security Bureau , churches , temples , mosques , newspapers , media , courts and police all quickly lined up behind the government 's simple plan : to crush Falun Gong , no measures too excessive . Within days a wave of arrests swept China . By the end of 1999 , Falun Gong adherents were dying in custody . ” 
 = = Structure = = 
 The 610 Office is managed by top echelon leaders of the Communist Party of China , and the CLGDF that oversees the 610 Office has , since its inception , been helmed by a senior member of the Politburo Standing Committee . A list of 610 Office Chiefs , including their time in that position , includes Li <unk> ( 1999 – 2003 ) , Luo Gan ( 2003 – 2007 ) , Zhou Yongkang ( 2007 – 2012 ) , Li <unk> ( 2013 ) , Liu <unk> ( 2013 @-@ 2015 ) , Fu Zhenghua ( 2015 @-@ 2016 ) , and most recently Huang Ming ( 2016 ) . 
 The practice of appointing top @-@ ranked Party authorities to run the CLGDF and 610 Office was intended to ensure that they outranked other departmental officials . According to James Tong , the 610 Office is situated " several administrative strata " above organizations such as the State Administration of Radio , Film , and Television , Xinhua News Agency , China Central Television , and the News and Publications Bureau . The 610 Office plays the role of coordinating the anti @-@ Falun Gong media coverage in the state @-@ run press , as well influencing other party and state entities , including security agencies , in the anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign . 
 Cook and Lemish speculate that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state @-@ based security system for several reasons : first , a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong , leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised ; second , there was a need for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign ; third , the creation of a top @-@ level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign was a priority ; and finally , CPC leaders did not want the anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions , and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially . 
 Soon after the creation of the central 610 Office , parallel 610 Offices were established at each administrative level wherever populations of Falun Gong practitioners were present , including the provincial , district , municipal , and sometime neighborhood levels . In some instances , 610 Offices have been established within large corporations and universities . Each office takes orders from the 610 Office one administrative level above , or from the Communist Party authorities at the same organizational level . In turn , the local 610 Offices influence the officers of other state and party bodies , such as media organizations , local public security bureaus , and courts . 
 The structure of the 610 Office overlaps with the Communist Party ’ s Political and Legislative Affairs Committee ( PLAC ) . Both Luo Gan and Zhou Yongkang oversaw both the PLC and the 610 Office simultaneously . This overlap is also reflected at local levels , where the 610 Office is regularly aligned with the local PLAC , sometimes even sharing physical offices . 
 The individual 610 Offices at local levels show minor variations in organizational structure . One example of how local offices are organized comes from <unk> city in Hunan province . There , the 610 Office consisted in 2008 of a " composite group " and an " education group . " The education group was in charge of " propaganda work " and the " transformation through reeducation " of Falun Gong adherents . The composite group was in charge of administrative and logistics tasks , intelligence collection , and the protection of confidential information . 
 James Tong wrote that the Party 's decision to run the anti @-@ Falun Gong campaign through the CLGDF and the 610 Office reflected " a pattern of regime institutional choice " to use " ad hoc committees rather than permanent agencies , and invested power in the top party echelon rather than functional state bureaucracies . " 
 = = = Recruitment = = = 
 Relatively little is known about recruiting processes for local 610 Offices . In rare instances where such information is available , 610 officers appeared to have been drawn from other party or state agencies ( such as the Political and Legislative Committee staff or Public Security Bureaus ) . Hao Fengjun , a defector and former officer with the 610 Office in Tianjin City , was one such officer . Hao had previously worked for the Public Security Bureau in Tianjin , and was among the officers selected to be seconded to the newly created 610 Office . According to Hao , few officers volunteered for a position in the 610 Office , so selections were made through a random draw . Some 610 Offices conduct their own recruiting efforts to bring in staff with university degrees . 
 = = = Responsibility system = = = 
 In order to ensure compliance with the Party 's directives against Falun Gong , the 610 offices implemented a responsibility system that extended down to the grassroots levels of society . Under this system , the local officials were held accountable for all Falun Gong @-@ related outcomes under their jurisdiction , and a system of punitive fines were imposed on regions and officials who failed to adequately persecute Falun Gong . " This showed that , instead of creating a modern system to rule China , the government still relied on an ad hoc patchwork of edicts , orders and personal connections , " wrote Johnson . 
 An example of this responsibility system was shown in the handling of protesters traveling to Beijing in the early years of the persecution . After the persecution of Falun Gong began in 1999 , hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveled daily to Tiananmen Square or to petitioning offices in Beijing to appeal for their rights . In order to stem the flow of protesters in the capital , the central 610 Office held local authorities responsible for ensuring that no one from their region went to Beijing . " The provincial government fined mayors and heads of counties for each Falun Gong practitioner from their district who went to Beijing , " wrote Johnson . The mayors and county leaders then fined the heads of their local 610 offices or PLAC branches , who in turn fined the village chiefs , who fined the police . The police administered punishment to the Falun Gong practitioners , and regularly demanded money from them to recoup the costs . Johnson wrote that " The fines were illegal ; no law or regulation has ever been issued in writing that lists them . " Government officials announced them only orally in meetings . " There was never to be anything in writing because they didn 't want it made public , " one official told Johnson . 
 = = Functions = = 
 = = = Surveillance and intelligence = = = 
 Surveillance of Falun Gong practitioners and intelligence collection is among the chief functions of 610 Offices . At the local levels , this involves monitoring workplaces and residences to identify Falun Gong practitioners , making daily visits to the homes of known ( or " registered " ) Falun Gong practitioners , or coordinating and overseeing 24 @-@ hour monitoring of practitioners . The 610 Office does not necessarily conduct the surveillance directly ; instead , it orders local authorities to do so , and has them report at regular intervals to the 610 Office . Basic @-@ level 610 Offices relay the intelligence they have collected up the operational chain to the 610 Office above them . In many instances , the surveillance is targeted towards Falun Gong practitioners who had previously recanted the practice while in prison or labor camps , and is intended to prevent " recidivism . " 
 The 610 Office 's intelligence collection efforts are bolstered through he cultivation of paid civilian informants . 610 Offices at local levels have been found to offer substantial monetary rewards for information leading to the capture of Falun Gong practitioners , and 24 @-@ hour hotlines have been created for civilians to report on Falun Gong @-@ related activity . In some locales , ' responsibility measures ' are enacted whereby workplaces , schools , neighborhood committees and families are held accountable for monitoring and reporting on Falun Gong practitioners within their ranks . 
 In addition to domestic surveillance , the 610 Office is allegedly involved in foreign intelligence . Hao Fengjun , the former 610 officer @-@ turned defector from Tianjin , testified that his job at the 610 Office involved collating and analyzing intelligence reports on overseas Falun Gong populations , including in the United States , Canada and Australia . 
 In 2005 , a Chinese agent working with the Chinese embassy in Berlin recruited a German Falun Gong practitioner Dr. Dan Sun to act as an informant . The agent reportedly arranged a meeting for Sun with two men who purported to be scholars of Chinese medicine interested in researching Falun Gong , and Sun agreed to pass information to them , ostensibly hoping to further their understanding of the practice . The men were in fact high @-@ ranking agents of the 610 Office in Shanghai . Sun maintained that he had no knowledge the men he was corresponding with were Chinese intelligence agents , but because he cooperated with them , he was nonetheless convicted of espionage in 2011 . According to Der Spiegel , the case demonstrated " how important fighting [ Falun Gong ] is to the [ Chinese ] government , " and " points to the extremely offensive approach that is sometimes being taken by the Chinese intelligence agencies . " 
 = = = Propaganda = = = 
 Propaganda is among the core functions of the 610 Office , both at the central and local levels . The CLGDF includes high @-@ ranking members of the Communist Party 's propaganda department , including the minister of propaganda and deputy head of the Central Leading Group on Propaganda and Ideological Work . This , coupled with the 610 Office 's organizational position above the main news and propaganda organs , gives it sufficient influence to direct the anti @-@ Falun Gong propaganda efforts at the central level . 
 Tong notes that the first " propaganda assaults " on the Falun Gong were launched in the leading state @-@ run newspapers in late June , 1999 — shortly after the establishment of the 610 office , but before the campaign against Falun Gong had been officially announced . The effort was overseen by Ding <unk> in his capacity as the deputy leader of the Central Leading Group for Dealing with Falun Gong and the country 's propaganda chief . The initial media attacks contained only veiled , indirect references to Falun Gong , and their content aimed to deride " superstition " and extol the virtues of atheism . In the weeks leading up to the official launch of the campaign , the CLGDF and the 610 Office set to work preparing a large number of books , editorials , and television programs denouncing the group , which were made public after 20 July 1999 when the campaign against Falun Gong officially began . 
 In the months following July 1999 , David Ownby writes that the country 's media apparatus " was churning out hundreds of articles , books , and television reports against Falun Gong . The Chinese public had not witnessed such overkill since the heyday of the Cultural Revolution . " State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong 's worldview was in " complete opposition to science " and communism ; the People 's Daily asserted on 27 July 1999 , that it " was a struggle between theism and atheism , superstition and science , idealism and materialism . " Other rhetoric appearing in the state @-@ run press centered on charges that Falun Gong had misled followers and was dangerous to health . To make the propaganda more accessible to the masses , the government published comic books , some of which compared Falun Gong ’ s founder to Lin Biao and Adolf Hitler . 
 The Central 610 Office also directs local 610 Offices to carry out propaganda work against Falun Gong . This includes working with local media , as well as conducting grassroots campaigns to " educate " target audiences in schools and universities , state @-@ run enterprises , and social and commercial enterprises . In 2008 , for instance , the central 610 Office issued a directive to engage in propaganda work intended to prevent Falun Gong from " interfering with " the Beijing Olympics . The campaign was referenced on government web sites in every Chinese province . 
 = = = <unk> and detention = = = 
 610 Offices work with local security agencies to monitor and capture Falun Gong adherents , many of whom are then sentenced administratively to reeducation @-@ through @-@ labor camps ( RTL ) , or , if they continue to practice and advocate for Falun Gong , sentenced to prison . The number of Falun Gong adherents detained in China is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands ; in some facilities , Falun Gong practitioners are in the majority . 
 610 Offices throughout China maintain an informal network of " transformation @-@ through @-@ reeducation " facilities . These facilities are used specifically for ideological reprogramming of Falun Gong practitioners , whereby they are subjected to physical and mental coercion in an effort to have them renounce Falun Gong . In 2001 , the central 610 Office began ordering " all neighborhood committees , state institutions and companies " to begin using the transformation facilities . No Falun Gong practitioners were to be spared , including students and the elderly . The same year , the 610 Office reportedly relayed orders that those who actively practice Falun Gong must be sent to prisons or labor camps , and those who did not renounce their belief in Falun Gong were to be socially isolated and monitored by families and employers . 
 In 2010 , the central 610 Office initiated a three @-@ year campaign to intensify the " transformation " of known Falun Gong practitioners . Documents from local 610 Offices across the country revealed the details of the campaign , which involved setting transformation quotas , and required local authorities to forcefully take Falun Gong practitioners into transformation @-@ through @-@ reeducation sessions . If they failed to recant their practice , the practitioners would be sent to labor camps . 
 In addition to prisons , labor camps and transformation facilities , the 610 Office can arbitrarily compel mentally healthy Falun Gong practitioners into psychiatric facilities . In 2002 , it was estimated that approximately 1 @,@ 000 Falun Gong adherents were being held against their will in mental hospitals , where reports of abuse were common . 
 = = = Interference in legal system = = = 
 The majority of detained Falun Gong practitioners are sentenced administratively to reeducation @-@ through @-@ labor camps , though several thousand have been condemned to longer sentences in prisons , often under the charge of " using a heretical organization to undermine the implementation of the law " — a vaguely worded provision that often carries sentences exceeding ten years . 
 Chinese human rights lawyers have charged that the 610 Office regularly interferes with legal cases involving Falun Gong practitioners , subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently . Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices , rather than through recourse to legal standards . In November 2008 , two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents . Other lawyers , including Gao Zhisheng , Guo <unk> and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court . 
 Official documents support the allegation of interference by the 610 Office . In 2009 , two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province described how legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners must be approved and / or audited by the 610 Office . The 610 Office 's organizational proximity to the CPC 's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise influence with the Supreme People 's Court and Ministry of Justice , both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels . 
 = = Allegations of torture and killing = = 
 Several sources have reported 610 officers as being involved in or ordering the torture of Falun Gong adherents in custody . In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005 , prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners : “ of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard , of all the records of the government ’ s inhuman torture of its own people , what has shaken me most is the routine practice on the part of the 6 – 10 Office and the police of assaulting women ’ s genitals , ” wrote Gao . Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar . The event helped catalyze Hao 's decision to defect to Australia . The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 Ian Johnson of the Wall Street Journal reported in 2000 that Falun Gong practitioners were tortured to death in " transformation @-@ through @-@ reeducation " facilities that are run by the 610 Office . The central 610 Office had informed local authorities that they could use any means necessary to prevent Falun Gong practitioners from traveling to Beijing to protest the ban — an order that reportedly resulted in widespread abuse in custody . 
 = = Expanded functions = = 
 In 2003 , the name of the Central Leading Group for Dealing with Falun Gong was changed to the " Central Leading Group on Dealing with Heretical Religions . " The same year , its mandate was expanded to include disposing of 28 other " heretical religions " and " harmful qigong practices " . Although Falun Gong continues to be the 610 Office 's primary concern , there is evidence of local offices targeting members of other groups , some of which identify as Buddhist or Protestant denominations . This include carrying out surveillance against members , engaging in propaganda efforts , and detaining and imprisoning members . 
 In some cases , the 610 Office performs functions unrelated to the monitoring and persecution of unrecognized religions . For instance , the Economist reported that 610 officers were involved in enforcing the house arrest of Chen Guangcheng , a blind human rights lawyer best known for his opposition to forced abortions and compulsory sterilizations . 
 In 2008 , a new set of " leading groups " appeared with the mandate of " maintaining stability . " Corresponding local offices were established in every district in major coastal cities , being tasked with " ferreting out " anti @-@ Communist Party elements . The branch offices for Maintaining Stability overlap significantly with local 610 Offices , sometimes sharing offices , staff , and leadership . 
 Cook and Lemish write that the increased reliance on ad hoc committees such as the 610 Office and stability maintenance offices may indicate a sense among Communist Party leaders that the existing state security services are ineffective in meeting its needs . " That these officials are increasingly relying on more arbitrary , extra @-@ legal , and personalized security forces to protect their hold on power does not only bode badly for China 's human rights record . It also threatens the stability of internal CCP politics should 610 Office work become politicized , " they write . 
 = Death of Benito Mussolini = 
 The death of Benito Mussolini , the deposed Italian fascist dictator , occurred on 28 April 1945 , in the final days of World War II in Europe , when he was summarily executed by Italian Communists in the small village of Giulino di Mezzegra in northern Italy . The " official " version of events is that Mussolini was shot by Walter Audisio , a communist partisan who used the nom de guerre of " Colonel Valerio " . However , since the end of the war , the circumstances of Mussolini 's death , and the identity of his killer , have been subjects of continuing confusion , dispute and controversy in Italy . 
 In 1940 , Mussolini took his country into World War II on the side of Nazi Germany but soon met with military failure . By the autumn of 1943 , he was reduced to being the leader of a German puppet state in northern Italy and was faced with the Allied advance from the south and an increasingly violent internal conflict with the partisans . In April 1945 , with the Allies breaking through the last German defences in northern Italy and a general uprising of the partisans taking hold in the cities , Mussolini 's situation became untenable . On 25 April he fled Milan , where he had been based , and tried to escape to the Swiss border . He and his mistress , Claretta Petacci , were captured on 27 April by local partisans near the village of Dongo on Lake Como . Mussolini and Petacci were shot the following afternoon , two days before Adolf Hitler 's suicide . 
 The bodies of Mussolini and Petacci were taken to Milan and left in a suburban square , the Piazzale Loreto , for a large angry crowd to insult and physically abuse . They were then hung upside down from a metal girder above a service station on the square . Initially , Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave but , in 1946 , his body was dug up and stolen by fascist supporters . Four months later it was recovered by the authorities who then kept it hidden for the next eleven years . Eventually , in 1957 , his remains were allowed to be interred in the Mussolini family crypt in his home town of Predappio . His tomb has become a place of pilgrimage for neo @-@ fascists and the anniversary of his death is marked by neo @-@ fascist rallies . 
 In the post @-@ war years , the " official " version of Mussolini 's death has been questioned in Italy ( but , generally , not internationally ) in a way that has drawn comparison with the John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories . Journalists , politicians and historians , doubting the veracity of Audisio 's account , have put forward a wide variety of theories and speculation as to how Mussolini died and who was responsible . At least twelve different individuals have , at various times , been claimed to be the killer . These have included Luigi Longo and Sandro Pertini who subsequently became Secretary @-@ General of the Italian Communist Party and President of Italy respectively . Several writers believe that Mussolini 's death was part of a British special forces operation . The aim was supposedly to retrieve compromising " secret agreements " and correspondence with Winston Churchill that Mussolini had allegedly been carrying when he was captured . However , the " official " explanation , with Audisio as Mussolini 's executioner , remains the most credible narrative . 
 = = Preceding events = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Mussolini had ruled Italy as its fascist leader since 1922 ( and as dictator with the title Il Duce from 1925 ) and had taken the country into World War II on the side of Nazi Germany in June 1940 . Following the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 , Mussolini was deposed and put under arrest ; Italy then switched sides and joined the Allies . Later that year , he was rescued from prison in the Gran Sasso raid by German special forces and Hitler installed him as leader of the Italian Social Republic , a German puppet state set up in northern Italy and based at the town of Salò near Lake Garda . By 1944 , the " Salò Republic " , as it came to be called , was threatened not only by the Allies advancing from the south but also internally by Italian anti @-@ fascist partisans , in a brutal conflict that was to become known as the Italian civil war . 
 Slowly fighting their way up the Italian peninsula , the Allies took Rome and then Florence in the summer of 1944 and later that year they began advancing into northern Italy . With the final collapse of the German army 's Gothic Line in April 1945 , total defeat for the Salò Republic and its German protectors was imminent . 
 From mid @-@ April Mussolini based himself in Milan , and he and his government took up residence in the city 's Prefecture . At the end of the month , the partisan leadership , the Comitato di <unk> Nazionale Alta Italia ( CLNAI ) , declared a general uprising in the main northern cities as the German forces retreated . With the CLNAI 's assumption of control in Milan and the German army in northern Italy about to surrender , Mussolini fled the city on 25 April and attempted to escape north to Switzerland . 
 On the same day as Mussolini left Milan , the <unk> declared : 
 The members of the fascist government and those fascist leaders who are guilty of having suppressed constitutional guarantees , destroyed the people 's freedoms , created the fascist regime , compromised and betrayed the country , bringing it to the current catastrophe are to be punished with the penalty of death . 
 = = = Capture and arrest = = = 
 On 27 April 1945 , Mussolini and his mistress Claretta Petacci , together with other fascist leaders , were travelling in a German convoy near the village of Dongo on the north western shore of Lake Como . A group of local communist partisans led by Pier Luigi Bellini delle Stelle and Urbano Lazzaro attacked the convoy and forced it to halt . The partisans recognised one Italian fascist leader in the convoy , but not Mussolini at this stage , and made the Germans hand over all the Italians in exchange for allowing the Germans to proceed . Eventually Mussolini was discovered slumped in one of the convoy vehicles . Lazzaro later said that : 
 his face was like wax and his stare glassy , but somehow blind . I read utter exhaustion , but not fear ... Mussolini seemed completely lacking in will , spiritually dead . 
 The partisans arrested Mussolini and took him to Dongo , where he spent part of the night in the local barracks . In all , over fifty fascist leaders and their families were found in the convoy and arrested by the partisans . Aside from Mussolini and Petacci , sixteen of the most prominent of them would be summarily shot in Dongo the following day and a further ten would be killed over two successive nights . 
 Fighting was still going on in the area around Dongo . Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters , the partisans drove them , in the middle of the night , to a nearby farm of a peasant family named de Maria ; they believed this would be a safe place to hold them . Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the following day there . 
 On the evening of Mussolini 's capture , Sandro Pertini , the Socialist partisan leader in northern Italy , announced on Radio Milano : 
 The head of this association of delinquents , Mussolini , while yellow with rancour and fear and trying to cross the Swiss frontier , has been arrested . He must be handed over to a tribunal of the people so it can judge him quickly . We want this , even though we think an execution platoon is too much of an honour for this man . He would deserve to be killed like a <unk> dog . 
 = = = Order to execute = = = 
 Differing accounts exist of who made the decision that Mussolini should be summarily executed . <unk> Togliatti , the Secretary @-@ General of the Communist Party , claimed that he had ordered Mussolini 's execution prior to his capture . Togliatti said he had done so by a radio message on 26 April 1945 with the words : " Only one thing is needed to decide that they [ Mussolini and the other fascist leaders ] must pay with their lives : the question of their identity " . He also claimed that he had given the order as deputy prime minister of the government in Rome and as leader of the Communist Party . <unk> <unk> , the prime minister , later denied that this was said with his government 's authority or approval . A senior communist in Milan , Luigi Longo , said that the order came from the General Command of the partisan military units " in application of a CLNAI decision " . Longo subsequently gave a different story : he said that when he and Fermo <unk> , a member of the Action Party ( which was part of the CLNAI ) , heard the news of Mussolini 's capture they immediately agreed that he should be summarily executed and Longo gave the order for it to be carried out . 
 According to Leo <unk> , the Action Party representative on the CLNAI , the decision to execute Mussolini was taken on the night of 27 / 28 April by a group acting on behalf of the CLNAI comprising himself , Sandro Pertini , and the communists Emilio Sereni and Luigi Longo . The CLNAI subsequently announced , on the day after his death , that Mussolini had been executed on its orders . 
 In any event , Longo instructed a communist partisan of the General Command , Walter Audisio , to go immediately to Dongo to carry out the order . According to Longo , he did so with the words " go and shoot him " . Longo asked another partisan , Aldo Lampredi , to go as well because , according to Lampredi , Longo thought Audisio was " impudent , too inflexible and rash " . 
 = = Execution = = 
 Although several conflicting versions and theories of how Mussolini and Petacci died were put forward after the war , the account of Walter Audisio , or at least its essential components , remains the most credible and is sometimes referred to in Italy as the " official " version . 
 It was largely confirmed by an account provided by Aldo Lampredi and the " classical " narrative of the story was set out in books written in the 1960s by Bellini delle Stelle and Urbano Lazzaro , and the journalist Franco Bandini . Although each of these accounts vary in detail , they are consistent on the main facts . 
 Audisio and Lampredi left Milan for Dongo early on the morning of 28 April to carry out the orders Audisio had been given by Longo . On arrival in Dongo , they met with Bellini delle Stelle , who was the local partisan commander , to arrange for Mussolini to be handed over to them . Audisio used the nom de guerre of " Colonel Valerio " during his mission . In the afternoon , he , with other partisans , including Aldo Lampredi and Michele Moretti , drove to the de Maria 's farmhouse to collect Mussolini and Petacci . After they were picked up , they drove a short distance to the village of Giulino de Mezzegra . The vehicle pulled up at the entrance of the Villa Belmonte on a narrow road known as via XXIV maggio and Mussolini and Petacci were told to get out and stand by the villa 's wall . Audisio then shot them at 4 : 10 pm with a submachine gun borrowed from Moretti , his own gun having jammed . 
 There were differences in Lampredi 's account and that of Audisio . Audisio presented Mussolini as acting in a cowardly manner immediately prior to his death whereas Lampredi did not . Audisio said he read out a sentence of death , whereas Lampredi omitted this . Lampredi said that Mussolini 's last words were " aim at my heart " . In Audisio 's account , Mussolini said nothing immediately prior to or during the execution . 
 Differences also exist with the account given by others involved , including Lazzaro and Bellini delle Stelle . According to the latter , when he met Audisio in Dongo , Audisio asked for a list of the fascist prisoners that had been captured the previous day and marked Mussolini 's and Petacci 's names for execution . Bellini delle Stelle said he challenged Audisio as to why Petacci should be executed . Audisio replied that she had been Mussolini 's adviser , had inspired his policies and was " just as responsible as he is " . According to Bellini delle Stelle no other discussion or formalities concerning the decision to execute them took place . 
 Audisio gave a different account . He claimed that on 28 April he convened a " war tribunal " in Dongo comprising Lampredi , Bellini delle Stelle , Michele Moretti and Lazzaro with himself as president . The tribunal condemned Mussolini and Petacci to death . There were no objections to any of the proposed executions . Urbano Lazzaro later denied that such a tribunal had been convened and said : 
 I was convinced Mussolini deserved death ... but there should have been a trial according to law . It was very barbarous . 
 In a book he wrote in the 1970s , Audisio argued that the decision to execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the <unk> 's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War . However , the lack of a judge or a <unk> di Guerra ( required by the ordinance to be present ) casts doubt on this assertion . 
 = = Subsequent events = = 
 During his dictatorship , representations of Mussolini 's body — for example pictures of him engaged in physical labour either bare @-@ chested or half @-@ naked — formed a central part of fascist propaganda . His body remained a potent symbol after his death , causing it to be either revered by supporters or treated with contempt and disrespect by opponents , and assuming a broader political significance . 
 = = = Piazzale Loreto = = = 
 In the evening of 28 April , the bodies of Mussolini , Petacci , and the other executed Fascists were loaded onto a van and trucked south to Milan . On arriving in the city in the early hours of 29 April , they were dumped on the ground in the Piazzale Loreto , a suburban square near the main railway station . The choice of location was deliberate . Fifteen partisans had been shot there in August 1944 in retaliation for partisan attacks and Allied bombing raids , and their bodies had then been left on public display . At the time , Mussolini is said to have remarked " for the blood of Piazzale Loreto , we shall pay dearly " . 
 Their bodies were left in a heap , and by 9 am a considerable crowd had gathered . The corpses were pelted with vegetables , spat at , urinated on , shot at and kicked ; Mussolini 's face was disfigured by beatings . An American eye witness described the crowd as " sinister , depraved , out of control " . After a while , the bodies were hoisted up on to the metal girder framework of a half @-@ built Standard Oil service station , and hung upside down on meat hooks . This mode of hanging had been used in northern Italy since medieval times to stress the " infamy " of the hanged . However , the reason given by those involved in hanging Mussolini and the others in this way was to protect the bodies from the mob . Movie footage of what happened appears to confirm that to be the case . 
 = = = Morgue and autopsy = = = 
 At about 2 pm , the American military authorities , who had arrived in the city , ordered that the bodies be taken down and delivered to the city morgue for autopsies to be carried out . A US army cameraman took photographs of the bodies for publication , including one with Mussolini and Petacci positioned in a macabre pose as though they were arm @-@ in @-@ arm . 
 On 30 April , an autopsy was carried out on Mussolini at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Milan . One version of the subsequent report indicated that he had been shot with nine bullets , while another version specified seven bullets . Four bullets near the heart were given as the cause of death . The calibres of the bullets were not identified . Samples of Mussolini 's brain were taken and sent to America for analysis . The intention was to prove the hypothesis that syphilis had caused insanity in him , but nothing resulted from the analysis ; no evidence of syphilis was found on his body either . No autopsy was carried out on Petacci . 
 = = = Interment and theft of corpse = = = 
 After his death and the display of his corpse in Milan , Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave in the <unk> cemetery , to the north of the city . On Easter Sunday 1946 , Mussolini 's body was located and dug up by a young fascist , Domenico Leccisi , and two friends . Over a period of sixteen weeks it was moved from place to place — the hiding places included a villa , a monastery and a convent — while the authorities searched for it . Eventually , in August , the body ( with a leg missing ) was tracked down to the Certosa di Pavia , a monastery not far from Milan . Two Franciscan friars were charged with assisting Leccisi hide the body . 
 The authorities then arranged for the body to be hidden at a Capuchin monastery in the small town of Cerro Maggiore where it remained for the next eleven years . The whereabouts of the body was kept a secret , even from Mussolini 's family . This remained the position until May 1957 , when the newly appointed Prime Minister , Adone Zoli , agreed to Mussolini 's re @-@ interment at his place of birth in Predappio in Romagna . Zoli was reliant on the far right ( including Leccisi himself , who was now a neo @-@ fascist party deputy ) to support him in Parliament . He also came from Predappio and knew Mussolini 's widow , <unk> , well . 
 = = = Tomb and anniversary of death = = = 
 The re @-@ interment in the Mussolini family crypt in Predappio was carried out on 1 September 1957 , with supporters present giving the fascist salute . Mussolini was laid to rest in a large stone sarcophagus . The tomb is decorated with fascist symbols and contains a large marble head of Mussolini . In front of the tomb is a register for visitors paying their respects to sign . The tomb has become a neo @-@ fascist place of pilgrimage . The numbers signing the tomb 's register range from dozens to hundreds per day , with thousands signing on certain anniversaries ; almost all the comments left are supportive of Mussolini . 
 The anniversary of Mussolini 's death on 28 April has become one of three dates neo @-@ fascist supporters mark with major rallies . In Predappio , a march takes place between the centre of town and the cemetery . The event usually attracts supporters in the thousands and includes speeches , songs and people giving the fascist salute . 
 = = Post @-@ war controversy = = 
 Outside of Italy , Audisio 's version of how Mussolini was executed has largely been accepted and is uncontroversial . However , within Italy , the subject has been a matter of extensive debate and dispute since the late 1940s to the present and a variety of theories of how Mussolini died has proliferated . At least 12 different individuals have been identified at various times as being responsible for carrying out the shooting . Comparisons have been made with the John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories , and it has been described as the Italian equivalent of that speculation . 
 = = = Reception of Audisio 's version = = = 
 Until 1947 , Audisio 's involvement was kept a secret , and in the earliest descriptions of the events ( in a series of articles in the Communist Party newspaper L 'Unità in late 1945 ) the person who carried out the shootings was only referred to as " Colonnello Valerio " . 
 Audisio was first named in a series of articles in the newspaper Il Tempo in March 1947 and the Communist Party subsequently confirmed Audisio 's involvement . Audisio himself did not speak publicly about it until he published his account in a series of five articles in L 'Unità later that month ( and repeated in a book that Audisio later wrote which was published in 1975 , two years after his death ) . Other versions of the story were also published , including , in the 1960s , two books setting out the " classical " account of the story : Dongo , la fine di Mussolini by Lazzaro and Bellini delle Stelle and Le <unk> 95 ore di Mussolini by journalist Franco Bandini . 
 Before long , it was noted that there were discrepancies between Audisio 's original story published in L 'Unità , subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others . Although his account most probably is built around the facts , it was certainly embellished . The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations , coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes , led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue . 
 In 1996 , a previously unpublished private account written in 1972 by Aldo Lampredi for the Communist Party 's archives , appeared in L 'Unità . In it , Lampredi confirmed the key facts of Audisio 's story but without the embellishments . Lampredi was undoubtedly an eyewitness and , because he prepared his narrative for the private records of the Communist Party – and not for publication – it was perceived that he had no motivation other than to tell the truth . Furthermore , he had had a reputation for being reliable and trustworthy ; he was also known to have disliked Audisio personally . For all these reasons it was seen as significant that he largely confirmed Audisio 's account . After Lampredi 's account was published , most , but not all , commentators were convinced of its veracity . The historian Giorgio <unk> commented that " it sweeps away all the bad novels constructed over 50 years on the end of the Duce of fascism ... There was no possibility that the many ridiculous versions put about in these years were true ... The truth is now unmistakably clear " . 
 = = = Claims by Lazzaro = = = 
 In his 1993 book Dongo : half a century of lies , the partisan leader Urbano Lazzaro repeated a claim he had made earlier that Luigi Longo and not Audisio , was " Colonnello Valerio " . He also claimed that Mussolini was inadvertently wounded earlier in the day when Petacci tried to grab the gun of one of the partisans , who killed Petacci and Michele Moretti then shot dead Mussolini . 
 = = = The " British hypothesis " = = = 
 There have been several claims that Britain 's wartime covert operations unit , the Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) , was responsible for Mussolini 's death , and that it may have even been ordered by the British prime minister , Winston Churchill . Allegedly , it was part of a " cover up " to retrieve " secret agreements " and compromising correspondence between the two men , which Mussolini was carrying when he was captured by partisans . It is said that the correspondence included offers from Churchill of peace and territorial concessions in exchange for Mussolini persuading Hitler to join the western Allies in an alliance against the Soviet Union . Proponents of this theory have included historians such as Renzo De Felice and Pierre <unk> and journalists including Peter Tompkins and Luciano Garibaldi ; however , the theory has been dismissed by many . 
 In 1994 Bruno Lonati , a former partisan leader , published a book in which he claimed that he had shot Mussolini and he was accompanied on his mission by a British army officer called " John " , who shot Petacci . Journalist Peter Tompkins claimed to have established that " John " was Robert <unk> , a British SOE agent who had Sicilian ancestry . According to Lonati , he and " John " went to the de Maria farmhouse in the morning of 28 April and killed Mussolini and Petacci at about 11 : 00 am . In 2004 , the Italian state television channel , RAI , broadcast a documentary , co @-@ produced by Tompkins , in which the theory was put forward . Lonati was interviewed for the documentary and claimed that when he arrived at the farmhouse : 
 Petacci was sitting on the bed and Mussolini was standing . " John " took me outside and told me his orders were to eliminate them both , because Petacci knew many things . I said I could not shoot Petacci , so John said he would shoot her himself , while making it quite clear that Mussolini however , had to be killed by an Italian . 
 They took them out of the house and , at the corner of a nearby lane they were stood against a fence and shot . The documentary included an interview with Dorina Mazzola who said that her mother had seen the shooting . She also said that she herself had heard the shots and that she " looked at the clock , it was almost 11 " . The documentary went on to claim that the later shootings at the Villa Belmonte were subsequently staged as part of the " cover up " . 
 The theory has been criticised for lacking any serious evidence , particularly on the existence of the correspondence with Churchill . Commenting on the RAI television documentary in 2004 , Christopher Woods , researcher for the official history of the SOE , dismissed these claims saying that " it 's just love of conspiracy @-@ making " . 
 = = = Other " earlier death " theories = = = 
 Some , including most persistently the journalist Giorgio <unk> , have claimed that Mussolini and Petacci were shot earlier in the day near the de Maria farmhouse and that the execution at Giulino de Mezzegra was staged with corpses . The first to put this forward was Franco Bandini in 1978 . 
 = = = Other theories = = = 
 Other theories have included allegations not only that Luigi Longo , subsequently leader of the Communist Party in post @-@ war Italy , but also Sandro Pertini , a future President of Italy , carried out the shootings . Others have claimed that Mussolini ( or Mussolini and Petacci together ) committed suicide with cyanide capsules .

 = Ashot Nadanian = 
 Ashot Nadanian ( sometimes transliterated as <unk> ; Armenian : <unk> <unk> ; born September 19 , 1972 ) is an Armenian chess International Master ( 1997 ) , chess theoretician and chess coach . 
 His highest achievements have been in opening theory and coaching . Two opening variations are named after him : the Nadanian Variation in the Grünfeld Defence and the Nadanian Attack in the Queen 's Pawn Opening . He began coaching at the age of 22 and has brought up three grandmasters . He has coached the national teams of Kuwait and Singapore and was awarded the titles Honoured Coach of Armenia in 1998 and FIDE Trainer in 2007 . Since 2011 , he has been a permanent second of Levon Aronian . 
 Although a strong player who competed in the 1996 Chess Olympiad and narrowly failed to qualify for the 1999 FIDE World Chess Championship , he has never fulfilled his potential . According to Valery Chekhov , Nadanian " possesses enormous chess potential , but he was not able to find enough time to work professionally on his chess . " Levon Aronian said that due to the situation in Armenia , Nadanian " was not able to display even one @-@ tenth of his playing talent . " 
 Due to his imaginative attacking style , Nadanian has been described as a " brilliant eccentric " , the " Armenian Tal " and " Kasparov 's half @-@ brother " . The sixth chapter of Tibor Karolyi 's 2009 book Genius in the Background is devoted to Nadanian . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Nadanian was born on 19 September 1972 in Baku , Azerbaijan SSR , which then was part of the Soviet Union , to Sergei and Irina , both hairdressers . He was taught to play chess by his father when he was seven . His early coach was Rafael <unk> , who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku . In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects , that when he was nine or ten there were almost no chess tournaments in which young players could play with seniors and therefore he often went to the park near his house to play chess with older chess lovers . He remembers that in one of these park @-@ battles he played against a mysterious , silent stranger who turned out to be the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov . In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under @-@ sixteen Azerbaijani championship . With the beginning of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War in 1988 , his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia . 
 = = Chess career = = 
 Nadanian played in the Soviet Union Junior Chess Championships of 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , in the Armenian Chess Championships of 1997 , 1998 and 1999 ( 7th – 8th places ) , in the 32nd Chess Olympiad in Yerevan 1996 , in the 13th European Chess Club Cup 1997 , in the Zonal tournament in <unk> 1998 , where he shared 7th – 11th places out of 72 participants , in the European Individual Chess Championships of 2000 and 2014 and in the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Championships 2013 in Khanty @-@ Mansiysk . In 2014 , playing board 4 , he helped his team <unk> Yerevan to a silver medal in the Armenian Team Chess Championship . 
 His other performances : 
 = = Playing strength and style = = 
 Nadanian reached his best Elo rating in July 1997 with <unk> Elo points . His best single performance was at Moscow Aeroflot Open , 2002 , where he scored five of nine possible points ( 56 % ) , exceeding his first grandmaster norm by half a point . His second norm came at Moscow 2004 , where he scored eight points out of eleven with a performance rating of <unk> . 
 Nadanian has an imaginative and adventurous style of playing , and even his mistakes , according to Tibor Karolyi , " contain elements of creativity " . He likes to create fresh , atypical positions straight from the opening , often employing bizarre maneuvers to achieve his goals . Uncommon chess openings have always been a part of his repertoire ( e.g. Sokolsky Opening , Budapest Gambit ) . 
 Kingpin magazine called him " a brilliant eccentric " . Tibor Karolyi devoted a chapter to him in his 2009 book Genius in the Background and jokingly called him " Kasparov 's Half @-@ Brother " , as Kasparov and Nadanian were both coached by Alexander <unk> , and there were similarities in their playing styles . In particular , Karolyi emphasizes their ability to implement effective ideas on the edge of the board , attributing this to the influence of their common chess " father " . As an example of flank pawn advances versus a solid centre , John L. Watson in his 2003 book Chess Strategy in Action brings attention to the game Nadanian – Ponomariov , Kiev 1997 and calls it " almost satire on rule @-@ breaking " , as nine of White 's first thirteen moves have been pawn moves and only one of those has been with a central pawn , yet Black 's position was extremely difficult . 
 The 2005 World Cup winner Levon Aronian said of Nadanian : " His passion for beauty , his devotion to the romantic chess school has always been inspiring . " Grandmaster Valery Chekhov noted that " along with his positive qualities like very subtle understanding of dynamic positions , very good sense of initiative and quick thinking , Ashot ’ s play has a few negative facets like weak opening repertoire , bad defence , and the psychological element of the game as well . " 
 = = Chess theoretician = = 
 Nadanian has contributions to opening theory , with two variations named after him : the Nadanian Variation in the Grünfeld Defence ( after the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 <unk> Nxd5 <unk> ) and the Nadanian Attack in the Queen 's Pawn Opening ( after the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 h6 3.c4 g5 ) . The first variation has been used by many strong GMs such as Viktor Korchnoi , Bu <unk> , Walter Browne , Smbat Lputian , Jonathan Rowson , Andrei <unk> , Bogdan Lalić , Igor <unk> , while the second has never enjoyed popularity among top @-@ flight players . 
 Described by John Donaldson as " the ever inventive creator of novelties " , he has made a number of other notable innovations , including :

 Nadanian has contributed analysis to many chess publications throughout the world including the Chess Informant , New In Chess Yearbook , 64 , <unk> and <unk> Chess . He is a columnist for the <unk> website and has also written for ChessBase and the Armenian Chess Academy website .

 After Nadanian graduated from the Armenian State Institute of Physical Culture in 1994 , he became a chess trainer . At 26 he became the youngest Honoured Coach of Armenia . Among his students are Grandmasters Gabriel Sargissian , <unk> Akobian and Davit G. Petrosian . He has also occasionally helped GM Tigran L. Petrosian . 
 From December 1999 until August 2001 , Nadanian worked as the National Team Coach of Kuwait . Between 2005 and 2010 , he was the National Coach of Singapore Men 's Team . In 2007 , he was awarded the title of FIDE Trainer . 
 At the " Full English Breakfast " website ( <unk> , podcast # 7 Part 1 ) , Levon Aronian refers to Nadanian as his friend and second . Unable to accompany Aronian to the 2011 Wijk aan Zee tournament , they maintained daily contact online . During the entire month of February 2011 , Nadanian , together with a team of five grandmasters — Wang Hao , <unk> , Sargissian , <unk> and <unk> — held training camp in <unk> , helping Aronian to prepare for the Candidates Tournament of the World Chess Championship 2012 cycle . At the 2011 <unk> KC @-@ Conference Aronian noted : " Lots of players are involved in my team , but Ashot Nadanian is absolutely irreplaceable . Besides the work he does himself he manages the whole process , while also planning training sessions . " During the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2012 in Wijk aan Zee Aronian referred to Nadanian as his permanent assistant . 
 Nadanian once said in an interview that one of the joyful events of his life was the ending of the Turin Olympiad in 2006 , when his student Sargissian became Olympic champion with the Armenian team and his other student Akobian won bronze with the U.S. team . At the next Olympiad in Dresden the story repeated itself : Sargissian won team gold medal and Akobian won team bronze .

 = = = Other chess activities and hobbies = = = 
 One of Nadanian 's hobbies along with reading , watching classical piano performances and writing aphorisms is chess composition . His first puzzle appeared in 1986 and since that time he has composed about fifty studies and puzzles , of which he considers only ten or twelve to be good . He is particularly attracted by the problems , where in a final position White wins with a king and knights only . Whilst two knights cannot force checkmate against a lone king , they can do so in some exceptional cases when the defender has pawns or other pieces . This idea is most clearly embodied in the highly original Nadanian 's problem with seven knights ( see diagram ) . In December 2009 , ChessBase published three of Nadanian 's puzzles on " knights theme " , calling him " a <unk> chess composer " . 
 A chess book collector , Nadanian has a private library of more than a thousand volumes . He also plays correspondence chess . 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Nadanian lives in Yerevan . He married Evelina <unk> since 1999 , and they have a daughter Kiti ( born 2004 in Moscow ) and a son Vigen ( born 2010 in Singapore ) .

Kiti and Vigen are more important to me than all my chess achievements put together . "

 = Wressle Castle = 
 Wressle Castle is a ruined palace @-@ fortress in the East Riding of Yorkshire , England , built for Thomas Percy in the 1390s . It is privately owned and not open to the public . Wressle Castle originally consisted of four ranges built around a central courtyard ; there was a tower at each corner , and the structure was entered through a gatehouse in the east wall , facing the village . 
 After Thomas Percy was executed for rebelling against Henry IV , Wressle Castle passed into royal control . With occasional periods when it was granted to other people , the castle was mostly under royal control until 1471 when it was returned to the Percy family . Henry Percy , 5th Earl of Northumberland , refurbished the castle and gardens , bringing them to the standard of royal properties . 
 The castle was embedded within an ornamental landscape , with two gardens laid out at the same time as the castle was founded and a third created later . Wressle was intended as a high @-@ status residence rather than a fortress and was never besieged . However , it was held by Parliament during the English Civil War and demolished in 1646 – 50 . Nearly 150 years later , it was further damaged by fire and all that remains above ground of the building is the south range . 
 = = History = = 
 In the later Middle Ages , the Percy family was one of four major land @-@ owning dynasties in Yorkshire . The 14th century saw their properties spread into Northumberland , though Yorkshire remained important . The Percys held the manor of Wressle from the early 14th century , and it was granted to Thomas Percy in 1364 . Wressle Castle was first documented in 1402 , but was probably built in the 1390s . By 1390 , Thomas Percy had spent nearly ten years abroad as either a soldier or on diplomatic errands . From then on he was active in the royal sphere and friends of both Richard II and Henry IV . According to archaeologist and architectural historian Anthony Emery Wressle Castle was built “ as a residence reflecting [ the Earl ’ s ] pedigree and distinguished state service ” . 
 Though Henry IV gave Thomas Percy influence in south Wales , relations between the two deteriorated due partly to delays in payment . Thomas ’ nephew , Henry Percy , rose in armed rebellion in July 1403 and Thomas joined him . The rebellion culminated in the battle of Shrewsbury in which Thomas Percy was captured . Two days later , on 23 July , he was beheaded and his property – including Wressle Castle – was subsequently confiscated by the crown . Between 1403 and 1471 ownership of the castle swapped between the crown and those the reigning monarch chose to grant it to , though only for short periods . In 1471 , Wressle Castle was given to Henry Percy , 4th Earl of Northumberland , returning it to the Percy family . His son , Henry Algernon Percy , 5th Earl of Northumberland , undertook an extensive programme of refurbishment at Wressle Castle , refurbishing the interior and updating the gardens . At the time he was one of the richest men in England . The Northumberland Household Book was compiled around this time and details day @-@ to @-@ day domestic activities at the castles of Wressle and Leconfield , and is used by historians to study the late medieval household . 
 Percy died at Wressle in 1527 and was succeeded by his son , Henry Algernon Percy , 6th Earl of Northumberland . The Pilgrimage of Grace was a popular revolt against the rule of Henry VIII in 1536 partly in response to the dissolution of the monasteries . The rebels in Yorkshire were led by Robert Aske and in October he sought the support of the Percy family . Aske travelled to Wressle Castle and tried to persuade Henry Algernon Percy , who at the time was suffering from illness , to join the rebellion . Though initially opposed to Aske , Percy eventually gave him control of Wressle Castle . Percy had fallen out with his younger brothers , and when he died in 1537 his one surviving brother did not inherit because he was imprisoned for his role in the Pilgrimage of Grace . In 1537 , the crown again resumed control of Wressle Castle , and Henry VIII visited for three nights in 1541 . 
 Antiquarian John Leland visited Wressle Castle in about 1540 . He wrote in his Itinerary that the castle was " one of the most proper beyond the Trent , and seemeth as newly made ... The castle is all of very fair and great squared stone , both within and without " . He also gave the first surviving description of the castle gardens , noting that they were " exceedingly fair " and with orchards beyond the moat . 
 The castle was garrisoned by parliamentarians during the English Civil War during which time it was badly damaged . At the time it was estimated that the damaged to the castle and surrounding area would take £ 1 @,@ 000 to repair . Wressle Castle was slighted ( partially demolished ) on several occasions in 1646 – 50 . The 1648 demolition work was focused on the castle ’ s battlements , with a contemporary letter noting that “ [ Parliament ’ s ] agents would show no care in preserving any of the materials , but pitched of [ f ] the stones from the battlements to the ground ” Destruction was more extensive two years later , when Algernon Percy , 10th Earl of Northumberland , was ordered to demolish everything that remain except the south range of the castle . The earl would be allowed to use the surviving range as a manor house . The damage was not confined to the castle buildings , and probably affected the ornamental landscape . 
 The castle remained with the Percy family until the mid @-@ 18th century when it passed to the earls of Egremont . The lands and castle were then inherited by Elizabeth Seymour who assumed the name Percy and was later Duchess of Northumberland . Wressle Castle was occupied by a tenant farmer who on 19 February 1796 caused a fire which gutted the castle ’ s remaining wing . He had had been trying to clear the chimney . A report three months later in The Gentleman 's Magazine noted that “ This loss was of truly national significance " . The farm continued to be leased to tenants , and the farmhouse which still stands was built c . 1810 . By 1880 the castle was partially covered in ivy . In 1957 the castle and farm were sold to the <unk> family who own the site today . 
 Wressle Castle is now a Grade I listed ruin and a scheduled <unk> remains include earthworks indicating the moat , and some parts of the castle : the remains of the two towers of the south range ; and a building fragment , thought to have been a bakehouse . According to Historic England , the site was first investigated archaeologically in 1993 , when Humberside Archaeology Unit held a watching brief . The state of the site deteriorated to the point at which in 1999 Wressle Castle was included on the Heritage at Risk register . Historic England , Natural England and the Country Houses Foundation invested £ 500 @,@ 000 in repairing the castle and in 2015 Wressle was no longer considered ‘ at risk ’ and was removed from the register . This included architectural and landscape surveys carried out by Ed Dennison Archaeological Services , with funding from the Castle Studies Trust for the landscape survey .

 A quadrangular castle , Wressle Castle was laid out with four ranges in a square around a courtyard . At each corner was a tower , and in the centre of the east side was a five @-@ storey gatehouse . Clockwise from north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower ( where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived ) , the Chapel Tower , the Lord ’ s Tower , and the Kitchen Tower . Opposite the gatehouse , in the castle 's west range , was the great hall and the Lord 's Tower in the south west contained the owner 's accommodation and private rooms . 
 Based on architectural similarities with the castles of Sheriff Hutton , Bolton , and Lumley , historian Eric John Fisher suggested that Wressle Castle was built in the last quarter of the 14th century . This coincides with the career of John Lewyn , who designed the great tower at Warkworth Castle and worked at Lumley , both Percy properties . Archaeologist Malcolm Hislop suggests that Lewyn also designed Wressle , and that " it is difficult to believe that [ Lumley and Wressle ] were designed independently of each other . "

 The village of Wressle pre @-@ dates the castle , and was recorded in the Domesday Book . The castle was built at the west end of the settlement on one of the two main roads through Wressle . It is unclear whether this was a manorial centre before the castle was built , or whether it was an entirely new site . The castle was given multiple gardens which likely resulted in some parts of the village being built over . The River Derwent flows north – south about 590 feet ( 180 m ) west of the castle . 
 The gardens at Wressle Castle were probably created at the same time as the castle was built . Documentary evidence indicates that by the late @-@ 15th century Wressle Castle had two gardens , both located to the south of the castle . One was probably between the south moat and the castle ( the Moat Garden ) and the other was south of the moat ( the Old Garden ) . A third garden ( the New Garden ) was laid out north of the castle around 1472 – 1517 . The Old and New Gardens covered about 1 acre ( 4 @,@ 000 m2 ) each ; the former had a brick wall while the later was enclosed by a wet moat . The Old Garden contained an orchard and alleys for bowling and walking , popular pastimes of the nobility from the 16th century onwards . It also contained a two @-@ storey 15th @-@ century building known as the ‘ School House ’ where Henry Percy , 5th Earl of Northumberland , would read . 
 A banqueting house was built just inside the south @-@ west corner of the moat . Though it was probably built in the 16th century , it was in a dilapidated state by 1577 . A base court ( an enclosed area ) was added in front of the castle ’ s gatehouse after the main complex was built , but it unclear when . Wetland areas south and east of the castle may have been used to emulate a mere , a type of broad shallow lake . As well as this , there were two fishponds , but their dating is uncertain . During Wressle Castle ’ s heyday in the 16th century , the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings , possibly even rivalling gardens at royal properties .

 In March 2010 , it was announced that Badler had joined the cast of Neighbours as " super @-@ bitch " Diana Marshall . Badler said that when she met with the writers , they told her that they are big fans of V and so they wrote the part of Diana with her in mind . They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in V. The writers did not know that Badler was living in the county until a chance meeting brought them together . Badler revealed that the guitarist in her band managed to connect her to Neighbours ' executive producer , Susan Bower and when she tried to get her music featured on the show , she was asked to play Diana instead . Badler said that she still had to audition for the role , which she said was " depressing " as she hates auditioning . However , she said it was fun as the part was for a bad girl , which is the kind of role she enjoys playing . She added " Now I 'm happy that I had to earn the role ; I feel as though it was made for me . " 
 Badler had a four @-@ month guest contract with the show and she began filming her first scenes in April which were due to air in June 2010 .

 Before Diana made her first appearance , she was being described as being a " mega bitch " , an " Erinsborough villainess " and a " manipulative businesswoman . " Diana is a dangerous femme fatale , who is " beautiful , sexy and strong " . TV Soap said she is a woman on a mission . Badler described her character 's background saying she had a dysfunctional upbringing , which made her strong and a fighter . Diana has had to fight for everything in her life , so she works hard in order to survive . Badler added in an interview with Network Ten that Diana is highly ambitious and very driven , which makes her kind of like a man . Diana is one of the chiefs of Lassiter 's International , but she knows that she will not get to the top of the company because Paul Robinson ( Stefan Dennis ) is the heir to the Robinson fortune . 
 Diana arrives in Erinsborough from New York , on a business trip and she decides that she wants to try to take control of the company . Diana clashes with a lot of the other Erinsborough residents and she is not well liked because she is abrupt and does not hide her ambition to bring people down . Diana can be very charming and this hides the fact that she is looking after herself and her interests .

" To go with her job and personality , Diana has a glamourous wardrobe , which Badler said is the complete opposite of hers . Badler explained that Diana is more conservative as she wears a lot of beige , silver and grey , with Cartier watches . She added " There are many power suits and stilettos ! " 
 = = = Relationship with Paul Robinson = = = 
 As well as trying to take over Lassiter 's , Diana also wants to " settle a score with Paul Robinson " . Paul stands in her way of achieving her goal as his place within the company is secure for life as Diana 's boss , Rosemary Daniels ( Joy Chambers ) , is Paul 's aunt . Badler explained that Diana resents Paul as she is not part of his family and knows that she cannot ever be at the top . Further to that , Paul and Diana were once lovers and Diana fell in love with him , but he walked out on her and broke her heart . Stefan Dennis said that Paul and Diana 's relationship came at a time when Paul was " a philandering playboy and didn 't care . " Paul became one of a few men that Diana has ever fallen in love with and because he treated her badly , she decides to bring him down . Badler said that Diana has been keeping an eye on Paul and knows everything about what he has been up to . Following her arrival , Diana begins to make Paul 's life " a nightmare " and Badler said " Diana 's back to force him to fall in love with her again , or destroy him – whichever comes first " . 
 Diana uses Paul 's son and stepson to help her plan along . Declan Napier ( Erin Mullally ) gives Diana inside info about Paul embezzling as he believes he is doing the right thing .

Badler said " There is all this history between Paul and Diana and now they seem to be dancing around each other . There 's every chance they could catch fire again . Diana is so charming and when people meet her they think she is lovely – but she really is not . And that 's what makes her even more of a <unk> . " 
 Diana asks Paul to prove to her how far he is prepared to go to create an alliance between them and to prove his loyalty he proposes that they sleep together . Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine , but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as " collateral damage . " Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option he has got to keep her on side . Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when he takes off his wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca . Badler said that the situation is an " ego thing " for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed . Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is " fantastic " and that she felt comfortable with him . She said " I kind of felt like it was a well @-@ played tennis match – every time you zing him something , he <unk> it right back . He 's right there for you , so I absolutely loved working with him .

Badler said it was " great " to be involved in the storyline and said she was largely featured in the 6000th episode . Diana becomes a suspect in the attempt on Paul 's life because he jilts her " in the boardroom and the bedroom " . Paul then humiliates Diana and sends her packing from Lassiter 's .

And she still has friends in high places ! " Diana is seen placing a call asking for something to be taken care of and she hands money over to a stranger just before Paul is pushed . Following the attempt on Paul 's life , Diana 's earring is found at the scene and the police manage to catch her at the airport before she returns to America .

 Badler 's co @-@ star , Mullally , praised her appearance in Neighbours . He said that " she has so much intensity on screen and sometimes she 'll throw in some interesting comedy as well " . He added " She is great to work with , so beautiful , really happy and chirpy . And when she goes on screen she plays this callous , powerful , intimidating persona and her eyes just go straight through you ! " TV Week said that they have been " desperate " to see Neighbours cast a new female villain and that their prayers had been answered when Badler joined the cast as Diana . 
 Television critic , Andrew Mercado , said that Neighbours had made its " best casting decision in years " when they asked Badler to join the show . He hoped that she would be around for a while and he added the show " desperately needs a bitch right now " . Mercado later compared Diana and Paul to Australia 's Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her predecessor Kevin Rudd . He said " Arrogant men rarely see wily women sneaking up from behind to stab them in the back . Kevin Rudd has just been forced to stand aside as Australian Prime Minister to avoid an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Deputy Leader Julia Gillard and now Neighbours ' Paul Robinson could be the next to go with a celebrated 80 's <unk> infiltrating Ramsay Street " . Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture said Diana was a " fabulous plot device " . 
 = Jay Cooke & Company = 
 Jay Cooke & Company was a U.S. bank that operated from 1861 to 1873 . Headquartered in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , with branches in New York City and Washington , D.C. , the bank helped underwrite the Union Civil War effort . It was the first " wire " brokerage house , pioneering the use of telegraph messages to confirm securities transactions with clients . The bank became overextended in the building of the Northern Pacific Railway and failed during the Panic of 1873 .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Jay Cooke founded the bank in 1861 with William E. C. Moorhead , the ownership split two @-@ thirds to one @-@ third . Later partners included Cooke 's brothers , Henry and Pitt , then H. C. Fahnestock and Edward Dodge , who would hold the bank 's seat on the New York Stock Exchange after 1870 . 
 During the Civil War , Cooke & Company sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Union government bonds . Its reputation among investors around the world enabled the bank to sell these bonds when other brokerages could not . Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase asked Cooke to try to sell the government 's new $ 500 million issue of 5 @-@ 20 bonds . These paid six percent interest ( in gold ) and matured in 20 years , but were <unk> in five years . Cooke used numerous agents from a variety of professions — small bankers , insurance agents , and real estate professionals — to sell these bonds to support the Union war effort . Cooke & Company 's innovative use of the telegraph to confirm sales allowed selling throughout the country to be coordinated in Philadelphia . 
 = = = After the war = = = 
 After the war , Cooke & Company continued to fund its investments through the sale of US treasuries . After the Black Friday scare , however , it became apparent that Cooke & Company would have to find other sources of capital . The firm turned to investing in railroads . In 1870 , the Northern Pacific Railroad made Cooke & Company its exclusive bond agent . But Cooke had difficulty marketing the bonds to investors , wound up owning 75 percent of the company , and overextended his bank . As this liability became public , investors began withdrawing money from Cooke & Company . 
 Cooke & Company wrote liabilities against expected returns from the sale of its Northern Pacific Railroad bonds , but ultimately could not sell enough bonds to meet its obligations . A run on the bank ensued , and its operations were suspended . When the New York Stock Exchange heard the announcement , equities plummeted , causing a chain reaction of bank runs and failures throughout the United States that signaled the arrival of the Panic of 1873 to American shores . 
 Bankruptcy commenced soon after the collapse . Many of the junior partners at Cooke did not suffer when the bank collapsed because they anticipated the failure and had divested from assets that would crumble if Cooke became insolvent . The government seized most of Cooke 's larger estates while Cooke moved to one of his smaller properties . Many of Cooke 's allies in the banking business soon collapsed , including Livermore , Clews & Co. and Fisk & Hatch . 
 In 1880 , a former executive of Jay Cooke refused to testify before Congress and was found in contempt and detained . The U.S. Supreme Court declined to release him in Kilbourn v. Thompson .

 = Nighthawk ( roller coaster ) = 
 Nighthawk is a steel flying roller coaster from Vekoma located at Carowinds amusement park . Originally opening as Stealth at California 's Great America on April 1 , 2000 , the roller coaster was the first flying roller coaster model in the world . In 2003 , Paramount decided to relocate the roller coaster to Carowinds . It reopened as Borg Assimilator – the first coaster in the world to be themed to Star Trek – on March 20 , 2004 . After Cedar Fair purchased Carowinds in 2006 , Paramount themes were soon removed from the park , and the ride was renamed Nighthawk . It is one of only three Flying Dutchman models still in existence from Vekoma .

 On June 22 , 1999 , Paramount 's Great America announced Stealth as " the world 's first true flying coaster . " For Stealth to be installed , the lower flume of Logger 's Run had to be altered and the Yankee Clipper had to be removed . The ride officially opened to the public on April 1 , 2000 . On August 21 , 2003 , it was announced Stealth would close on September 1 to make room for a new water park , Boomerang Bay . The station and several footers are still located in the water park today .

 On August 21 , 2003 , Carowinds announced a new flying roller coaster that would be relocated from California 's Great America . The ride 's name was not announced at the time . On January 15 , 2004 , it was announced the new roller coaster would be named Borg Assimilator and would be the first Star Trek themed roller coaster . Regarding the design of the attraction , Dale <unk> , Vice President of marketing and Assistant General Manager , said : 
 Nighthawk subsequently replaced the Carolina <unk> Riverboat , a paddle boat ride that took riders around the seven themed areas of the park . It officially opened to the public on March 20 , 2004 . 
 Cedar Fair Entertainment Company purchased Carowinds in 2006 and did not own the rights to several licenses used by the park . In 2008 , the park renamed several attractions including Borg Assimilator . It was renamed to Nighthawk and the Star Trek theming was removed , including the black sphere that was in the pond underneath the ride . In 2009 , Nighthawk was painted with dark blue supports and yellow track . 
 = = Ride experience = = 
 = = = Track = = = 
 The steel track is approximately 2 @,@ 766 feet ( 843 m ) in length and the height of the lift is approximately 115 feet ( 35 m ) . While at California 's Great America , the track was painted red and white with steel gray supports . When the ride was relocated to Carowinds , the track was repainted black and green and the supports remained gray . After the name was changed in 2008 , the ride was once again repainted with yellow track and blue supports . 
 Nighthawk has a total of five inversions . It features one vertical loop , a double corkscrew , two " Lie to Fly " and two " Fly to Lie " elements . Each " Lie to Fly " and " Fly to Lie " element is counted as a half inversion . A " Lie to Fly " element is when riders are on their backs , facing the sky and they are flipped and face the ground . A " Fly to Lie " element is the opposite .

 Once riders are seated and restrained , the train tilts backwards into a ' lay @-@ down ' position and dispatched . The train travels backwards out of the station , turns left and travels up the 115 @-@ foot ( 35 m ) lift hill . Once the train reaches the top of the lift hill , it dips down into a twist ( called a " Lie @-@ to @-@ Fly " ) that turns the trains upside down into a flying position where riders face the ground . After the twist , the train travels down the first drop , reaching speeds of 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) . Riders then go through an over banked Horseshoe Curve element . Following the Horseshoe , the train enters a " Fly @-@ to @-@ Lie " element that turns riders back to a lay @-@ down position . After the banked turn , the ride enters the 66 @-@ foot ( 20 m ) tall vertical loop , where riders experience 4 @.@ 3 G 's . The train then goes into another " Lie @-@ to @-@ Fly " element . Following the loop , riders go through another turn into the final " Fly @-@ to @-@ Lie " element before entering two consecutive corkscrews before making a right turn onto the brake run . 
 = = = Theme = = = 
 While the ride was located at California 's Great America , there was no theme for the ride . When it was relocated to Carowinds in 2004 , it was built as the first Star Trek themed roller coaster in the world . It was renamed Borg Assimilator and the story was that " Borg crash @-@ landed in the middle of Carowinds and their ship – a giant gray and black sphere – has come to rest near the park 's new flying roller coaster . " There was a gray and black sphere located in the pond underneath the ride that the Borg crashed in . In addition to other theming , a voice was played surrounding the ride saying Borg quotes . After Cedar Fair bought the park , all the Star Trek theming was removed and the name was changed for the 2008 season . 
 = = = Trains = = = 
 Nighthawk currently operates with two trains . Each train has six cars that have four seats in a single row for a total of 24 riders . Riders are restrained by an over the shoulder restraint and a lap bar . Riders can put on the over the shoulder restraint but a ride operator will push down the lap bar . While in the station , the trains will recline back to the laying down position .

 On March 17 , 2007 , seven employees received minor injuries when their seats changed position during a test run of the roller coaster . An inspection discovered that the ride operator accidentally pushed a button controlling the seat positions while the ride was in motion . That button was later modified to only work when the ride is stopped . 
 = Tropical Storm Arlene ( 2005 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Arlene was an unusually large and early @-@ forming tropical storm forming during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season . It was the first storm of the season , which would become the most active on record . Tropical Storm Arlene formed near Honduras on June 8 and moved northwards . It crossed western Cuba on June 10 and strengthened to just under hurricane strength before making its final landfall on the Florida Panhandle the next day . The storm weakened as it continued to move north over the United States , becoming extratropical on June 13 . Arlene was responsible for only one death and minor damages . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Early in the season — nearly two months earlier than the first storm formation in 2004 — a low @-@ pressure area formed and persisted north of Honduras . Despite significant shear , the low managed to become Tropical Depression One on June 8 just north of Honduras . The depression began to head north towards western Cuba that day , but as it was a very large and poorly organized system under the influence of heavy shear , the official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center emphasized that the route the storm would take was uncertain . Despite this uncertainty , the official forecasts were highly accurate in predicting the storm 's track . 
 As the shear dropped , the depression strengthened further and it became Tropical Storm Arlene on June 9 . It produced precipitation over a very wide area ; the Cayman Islands reported tropical storm @-@ force winds and heavy rain over 150 statute miles ( 240 km ) east of the center . Arlene crossed the western tip of Cuba on the morning of June 10 with 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) winds . Tropical Storm Arlene had an unusual structure throughout its life , with a large circulation containing numerous small centers rotating about a larger gyre , as opposed to an inner convective core . 
 Tropical Storm Arlene then entered the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened further to its peak strength with 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) winds . The official forecast at this time called for further intensification to minimal hurricane strength . This did not occur however and Arlene instead weakened as result of dry air entering the circulation . The storm made landfall just west of Pensacola , Florida in the afternoon of June 11 with 57 @.@ 5 mph ( 95 km / h ) winds . As most of the precipitation and wind of the storm were located north and east of the center , most of the effects of the storm were on land long before it made landfall . 
 Arlene was the most intense landfalling June storm since Hurricane Allison hit the same location as a strong tropical storm during the 1995 season . Arlene weakened into a tropical depression later that day , but managed to persist as a tropical system as it moved north over the United States . The system finally became extratropical on June 13 just northeast of Flint , Michigan and was absorbed by a larger system the next day . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Tropical storm warnings were issued for western Cuba , the Caymans , and the Dry Tortugas before the landfall on Cuba on June 10 . While Arlene was over Cuba a tropical storm watch was issued for the Gulf Coast from Morgan City , Louisiana to Indian Pass , Florida . A tropical storm warning was issued for a stretch of coast slightly further east than the area covered by the preceding watch , and a hurricane watch was issued for the central section of this region . This turned into a hurricane warning from Pearl River , Louisiana to Indian Pass due to fears of a strengthening to hurricane strength . The warnings were reduced and were then canceled eight hours after the second landfall . 
 Florida Governor Jeb Bush issued a state of emergency two days before the storm 's final landfall . Recovery teams were also deployed for the area . An evacuation order was issued for all areas south of the Gulf Coast Highway , including Pensacola Beach , Perdido Key , and <unk> Point . Walton County officials issued a voluntary evacuation for low line areas and mobile homes . Walton County also opened a shelter in Freeport , and four shelters and one special needs shelter were opened in Escambia County . 
 Two days prior to landfall , 36 oil platforms and 16 rigs were evacuated . The cumulative production loss caused from the evacuation of the storm totalled 0 @.@ 109 % of the yearly production , approximately 575 million barrels . The stopped rigs also accounted for 3 @.@ 87 % of the daily production on June 13 .

 Between June 9 and 10 , Tropical Storm Arlene produced heavy rains over western areas of Cuba , leading to school closures and several cities . The area impacted by the rainfall was previously suffering from a severe drought and moisture brought in by Arlene helped to alleviate the dry conditions . Upwards of 10 in ( 250 mm ) of rain was expected to fall due to the storm , possibly triggering flooding and mudslides .

 In the Florida Keys , Arlene produced wind gusts of up to 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , causing wind damage to four homes in Lower Matecumbe Key . The storm caused a storm surge of 1 @.@ 25 feet ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) above normal . Waves on top of the surge caused flooding on roads in Key West . Damage in the Florida Keys totaled to $ 90 @,@ 000 ( 2005 USD ) . 
 In the Florida Panhandle , the storm dropped heavy rainfall , peaking at 8 @.@ 51 inches ( 216 mm ) in Plantation Bay , Florida in Flagler County . Upon making landfall , Arlene caused a storm surge of up to 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in Walton County . Moderate beach erosion also occurred . The storm surge and strong waves caused moderate to severe damage to roads along the panhandle . Strong winds caused power outages to 500 people in Walton , Washington and Bay counties . The storm spawned a weak tornado in Navarre , Florida , causing minor damage on its 0 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 2 @-@ km ) path . Damage on the panhandle totaled to $ 3 @.@ 5 million ( 2005 USD ) , $ 2 @.@ 5 million of which was in Fort Pickens alone .

 Upon making landfall , the storm produced storm tides of up to 3 @.@ 9 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in height . Minor beach erosion occurred as well . Arlene dropped moderate to heavy rainfall throughout Alabama , with higher totals of up to eight inches ( 200 mm ) to the west of Interstate 65 . Four to six inches ( 152 mm ) of rain fell in a three @-@ hour period in the Mobile area . Several roads were temporarily impassable from the flooding , and one road was completely washed away . Wind speeds were around 20 to 30 mph ( 30 to 50 km / h ) , while wind gusts of over 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) existed . The winds downed several trees and power lines , leaving thousands without power for several hours . With the storm following a path similar to Hurricane Ivan just nine months earlier , many trees damaged from Ivan were downed completely . In addition , several homes experienced light wind damage . The outer bands of the storm also caused numerous funnel clouds , though no tornadoes were reported . Overall , damage was light , amounting to $ 1 @.@ 7 million ( 2005 USD ) .

 Heavy rainfall in Towns County , Georgia forced multiple residents to evacuate from rising flood water . Numerous creeks and rivers in the northern portion of the state overflowed . 
 Tropical Storm Arlene caused light rainfall across southeastern Mississippi , typically between 1 and 2 inches ( 25 to 50 mm ) . Effects were generally minimal . 
 In Indiana , the remnants of Arlene dropped heavy rainfall , peaking at 4 @.@ 44 inches ( 112 @.@ 8 mm ) in Evansville . In Indianapolis , 3 @.@ 04 inches ( 75 mm ) fell at the International Airport . Rainfall from the storm was 85 % of the typical June rainfall level . Arlene also spawned two tornadoes . An F1 tornado developed to the southwest of Hayden on June 12 . The tornado damaged several buildings and trees on its 5 @.@ 3 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 5 @-@ km ) path , with total damage amounting to $ 100 @,@ 000 ( 2005 USD ) . Outer rainbands also developed an F0 tornado just south of Indianapolis , downing a few tree limbs . 
 The remnants of Arlene combined with a non @-@ tropical system caused heavy rainfall across New York , with some locations reporting 6 to 7 inches ( 150 to 175 mm ) of precipitation in a 2 @-@ hour period . The rainfall collected into streams and rivers , with some officials calling it a 1 in 500 year flood . The flash flooding caused at least one mudslide , and damaged several roads . The flooding forced at least 20 to evacuate from their homes , and numerous houses were damaged . Strong winds also downed trees and power lines , causing scattered power outages . Damage totaled to $ 6 @.@ 5 million ( 2005 USD ) . 
 = SummerSlam ( 1994 ) = 
 SummerSlam ( 1994 ) was the seventh annual SummerSlam , a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) on August 29 , 1994 , at the newly opened United Center in Chicago , Illinois , which had opened eleven days earlier . 
 The pay @-@ per @-@ view had two main events . The first pitted Owen Hart against his brother Bret Hart in a steel cage match . Bret won the match , but the storyline feud escalated after Owen and his brother @-@ in @-@ law Jim Neidhart attacked Bret after the match . The other main event was a match between the real Undertaker ( portrayed by Mark Calaway ) and an impostor Undertaker ( portrayed by Brian Lee ) . The real Undertaker won the match , and the impostor did not appear in the WWF again . 
 The undercard included a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Diesel and Razor Ramon , which Ramon won to regain the title . The other major angle going into SummerSlam was a feud in which Tatanka accused Lex Luger of joining the Million Dollar Corporation , a stable of heel wrestlers . This storyline turned out to be a swerve , as Tatanka was revealed to have secretly joined the corporation .

 Kwang and Adam Bomb were both managed by Harvey Wippleman . On May 28 , 1994 , a King of the Ring qualifying match between Bomb and the 1 – 2 – 3 Kid was televised on WWF Superstars . The angle saw The Kid win after Kwang attempted to interfere on Bomb 's behalf . Kwang accidentally spat green mist in Bomb 's face , allowing the Kid to get the victory . Wippleman had Bomb and Kwang work as a tag team , but problems continued to develop between the two . The pair split after an argument cost them the match when they faced the team of the 1 – 2 – 3 Kid and " Sparky " Thurman Plugg . Bomb and Kwang faced each other on house shows leading up to their dark match at SummerSlam 1994 . 
 One of the WWF 's main storylines in 1994 was Ted DiBiase 's creation of a stable known as the Million Dollar Corporation . That summer , DiBiase purchased the rights to Bam Bam Bigelow 's contract from Bigelow 's kayfabe girlfriend , Luna Vachon . Irwin R. Schyster , DiBiase 's former partner in Money Inc. also joined the stable . Bigelow and Schyster were paired together to challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship . The night before SummerSlam , The Headshrinkers dropped the belts to Diesel and Shawn Michaels . The match took place as scheduled , but the title was not on the line . 
 In early 1994 the WWF brought back the WWF Women 's Championship , which had been deactivated in 1990 , and pushed Alundra Blayze to win a championship tournament and defeat all challengers . Luna Vachon was brought in to challenge Blayze in a series of matches but was defeated each time . The storyline then saw Vachon bring in Bull Nakano , a Japanese female wrestler , to gain revenge and challenge Blayze . 
 Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since being pushed to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship in late 1993 . After defeating Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania X , Ramon dropped the belt to Diesel , Michaels ' bodyguard . A rematch was scheduled for SummerSlam 1994 . Ramon brought in NFL Hall of Famer Walter Payton to be his cornerman and help prevent Michaels from interfering . 
 On the July 11 , 1994 edition of Monday Night Raw , a major worked storyline began when Ted DiBiase announced that he had convinced Lex Luger to join the Million Dollar Corporation . Leading up to the pay @-@ per @-@ view , Tatanka confronted Lex Luger on several occasions , criticizing him for " selling out " to DiBiase . This led to a kayfabe admission from Luger that he had met with DiBiase , but Luger repeatedly denied having joined the corporation . He agreed to face Tatanka at SummerSlam to settle the argument . 
 Jeff Jarrett and Mabel had no real feud going into SummerSlam . Jarrett played the role of an aspiring country music singer , and Mabel portrayed a rapper . As a result , the WWF promoted the match as part of a " rap versus country " rivalry . There was little buildup for the match until Mabel was booked to confront Jarrett on Monday Night Raw the week before SummerSlam . He tried to provoke Jarrett into a fight , but Jarrett walked away through the crowd to avoid Mabel . 
 The biggest storyline at SummerSlam began at the 1993 Survivor Series when Owen Hart was eliminated from the “ Hart Brothers vs. Shawn Michaels and His Knights ” elimination match due to miscommunication within the Hart team . Bret Hart was walking along the ring apron when Owen ran into him , causing Owen to lose his focus and be pinned by Michaels . After the match , Owen interrupted his brothers ’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret . The brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays and focused on challenging The Quebecers for the World Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994 . During the match , Bret kayfabe injured his knee , which eventually caused the referee to stop the match . Owen then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring . Bret <unk> to Owen in the opening match at WrestleMania X but defeated Yokozuna later in the pay @-@ per @-@ view to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . Jim Neidhart , Bret and Owen 's real @-@ life brother @-@ in @-@ law , became involved at King of the Ring 1994 by aligning himself with Owen Hart . To settle the feud , Bret and Owen were booked to face each other in a Steel cage match at SummerSlam . 
 After losing a Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble , The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for several months . In reality , he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal . The WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker . Eventually , DiBiase , who introduced The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990 , claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the <unk> but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase ’ s Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker . This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting The Undertaker against The Undertaker . In the buildup to the match , Leslie Nielsen perform short segments trying to solve the mystery of how two Undertakers could exist in a spinoff of his roles on Police Squad ! and The Naked Gun films .

 In a dark match before the pay @-@ per @-@ view broadcast , Adam Bomb pinned Kwang . As the broadcast opened , the commentators , Vince McMahon ( fresh off his federal trial acquittal , one month earlier ) and Jerry Lawler , announced that The Headshrinkers had dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Shawn Michaels , and that the belts would not be on the line at SummerSlam . Throughout the broadcast , Nielsen and his co @-@ star from The Naked Gun , George Kennedy , appeared backstage in skits trying to solve the mystery of the two Undertakers . 
 In the first televised match , The Headshrinkers were accompanied by managers Afa and Captain Lou Albano , and Bigelow and I.R.S. came to the ring with Ted DiBiase . Bigelow began the match by overpowering Fatu , but The Headshrinkers gained the advantage when Bigelow missed an Avalanche attempt . Schyster tagged in , and Bigelow pulled down the ropes to allow I.R.S. to throw Samu out of the ring . Outside the ring , Bigelow attacked Fatu with Schyster 's briefcase . Samu performed a diving headbutt , but he was unable to get the pinfall . Ted DiBiase distracted the referee , which prompted Albano to protest . Meanwhile , Afa entered the ring to attack Bigelow . The referee saw Afa in the ring and awarded the match to Bigelow and Schyster as the result of a disqualification . 
 The following match saw Nakano challenging Blayze for the Women 's Championship . Nakano used her size to perform such moves as leg drops and several submission holds . Blayze countered with aerial maneuvers like a hurricanrana and a spinning heel kick . Vachon got involved by choking Blayze while Nakano distracted the referee . The match ended when Nakano missed a diving leg drop , allowing Blayze to pin her for the win . 
 Early in the next match , Diesel threw Razor Ramon out of the ring , allowing Michaels to remove the turnbuckle padding . Payton argued with Michaels about his interference , drawing the referee 's attention . Michaels seized the opportunity to attack Ramon behind the referee 's back . Diesel used two big boots and a series of submission holds to maintain the advantage . When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected turnbuckle , Payton pointed out the missing padding to the referee , who stood in the way to prevent the move . Soon after , Diesel tried to ram Ramon into the turnbuckle , but Ramon escaped and pushed Diesel into the turnbuckle . Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog , a scoop slam , and a superplex . When Michaels tried to get involved again , Payton chased him around the outside of the ring . While the referee was distracted , Michaels entered the ring and tried to perform a superkick while Diesel held Ramon . Ramon moved , causing Michaels to kick Diesel instead . Ramon pinned Diesel to win the match and regain the Intercontinental Championship . 
 The match between Tatanka and Lex Luger began with the two wrestlers arguing . Luger relied on his power by punching and performing a <unk> . Tatanka focused on wearing Luger down with a wristlock and an armbar . After Luger performed a vertical suplex , Tatanka recovered and powerslammed Luger . Eventually , DiBiase came to ringside with a bag of money . As Luger yelled at DiBiase , Tatanka performed a schoolboy roll @-@ up for the victory . After the match , Tatanka revealed that he had joined DiBiase 's corporation . Tatanka attacked Luger and used the Million Dollar Dream , DiBiase 's signature move , on Luger before leaving with DiBiase . 
 Mabel used his weight advantage to gain the early advantage in his match with Jeff Jarrett . Jarrett gained momentum when he tripped Mabel and performed a fist drop and two double axe handles from the ropes . On two occasions , Jarrett jumped on Mabel 's back to perform sleeper holds , but Mabel backed him into the corner to escape both times . Mabel attempted to perform a splash from the second rope but missed . Jarrett attempted a sunset flip , which Mabel tried to counter by sitting on him . Jarrett moved out of the way and quickly pinned Mabel to win the match . In a reference to the 1994 Major League Baseball strike , Abe " <unk> " Schwartz was shown picketing in the crowd with an " I 'm on strike ! " sign . 
 As Owen Hart entered the steel cage for his championship match with his brother Bret , he immediately attacked Bret . Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT . Owen kicked Bret in the head and tried to escape from the cage . The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times , but neither would let the other escape . The match consisted mainly of brawling , including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope . Owen climbed over the cage , but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen 's hair . Owen performed a piledriver on Bret , but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage . As Owen tried to escape , Bret suplexed him back into the ring from the top of the cage . Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret , but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen . The match ended after Bret threw Owen 's head into the steel cage and Owen 's leg became trapped between the cage 's bars . Bret climbed over the top of the cage and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title . After the match , Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith , another brother @-@ in @-@ law of the Hart brothers . Owen padlocked the cage , and he and Neidhart attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene . 
 The second main event match had Bearer 's Undertaker fighting DiBiase 's Undertaker . After DiBiase 's Undertaker walked to the ring , Bearer appeared by himself while pushing a casket to the ring . He reached inside the casket and pulled out an urn , which had a light inside it when Bearer removed its lid . Bearer 's Undertaker came to the ring and confronted DiBiase 's Undertaker . Both wrestlers were wearing identical costumes , but Bearer 's Undertaker wore purple while DiBiase 's wore grey . Bearer 's Undertaker kicked his opponent out of the ring , where DiBiase 's Undertaker tried to attack Bearer . DiBiase 's Undertaker attempted to perform an arm twist ropewalk chop , but Bearer 's Undertaker stopped him and performed the move . DiBiase 's Undertaker then performed a chokeslam and a Tombstone piledriver . As he tried for another Tombstone piledriver , Bearer 's Undertaker reversed it and performed the move . Bearer 's Undertaker then performed two more Tombstone <unk> before getting the pinfall victory . A group of people dressed as druids came to ringside , put DiBiase 's Undertaker in the casket , and took the casket away . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 DiBiase continued to manage his corporation until he left the WWF in 1996 , but none of his wrestlers won a championship under his management . Tatanka and Luger continued to feud until they faced each other as part of an elimination match at the 1994 Survivor Series . Bigelow was later " fired " from the stable , leading to a feud with DiBiase 's wrestlers . 
 Nakano was booked to win the Women 's Championship on November 27 , 1994 . After Blayze won it back the following spring , Nakano disappeared from the WWF without mention and joined World Championship Wrestling . 
 Bret Hart was scheduled to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994 . The stipulations stated that the only way to win was to force the person in your opponent 's corner to throw a towel into the ring . Davey Boy Smith was in Bret 's corner , while Owen Hart was in Backlund 's corner . Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury , leaving nobody to throw in Bret 's towel . As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret , Owen pretended to show remorse . He convinced his mother , Helen , to throw in Bret 's towel . After Backlund was awarded the belt , Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title .

 = The Oval ( Belfast ) = 
 The Oval is a football stadium in Belfast , Northern Ireland , which has been home to Glentoran F.C. since 1892 . The Oval was bombed during the Belfast blitz of World War II , and was out of use until 1949 when it was rebuilt by the club along with supporters , who had jointly formed the ' Back to the Oval ' committee . During their exile , the club played games at the ground of fellow Belfast club , Distillery - Grosvenor Park . It had a new stand built in 2000 but requires consistent maintenance to fulfill health and safety requirements and its capacity is currently restricted to 6 @,@ 050 . The Oval has occasionally hosted the final of the Irish Cup as well as hosting the final of the County Antrim Shield and the Setanta Cup . 
 = = History = = 
 From 1882 to 1886 , Glentoran used <unk> Park as their home ground . They moved to Westbourne in <unk> for six years until 1892 . They then moved to The Oval . Initially it was on Dee Street , however in 1903 The Oval 's pitch was rotated 90 degrees to its current location . During the early 20th century , the land on which The Oval stood was given in perpetuity to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast , Daniel Dixon . 
 In 1941 the Oval was bombed in the Belfast blitz , destroying both grandstands and leaving a crater in the pitch . As a result , the ground was flooded repeatedly by the <unk> River ; the water pumps were insufficient to drain the pitch . Grosvenor Park was used as a temporary home for Glentoran , until August 1949 . In 1953 the main grandstand was built . 
 In September 1995 , Glentoran had an advertising board with " <unk> " in white letters on a black background erected at The Oval . This became known as the " Jesus sign " . It remained at the ground until 2010 ; Glentoran officials removed it , saying that they needed the space to sell advertising because of the club 's financial troubles and because the sign had garnered no income for Glentoran for several years . In 2000 The Oval received funding for the refurbishment of the railway stand , by bolting seats on to the old terracing to create a 1 @,@ 600 @-@ person @-@ capacity stand . It was funded by a small grant as part of the much bigger £ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 investment in Northern Irish sports announced by the Northern Ireland sports minister Michael <unk> . Other than new floodlights and a small section of terracing refurbishment , the ground has received no public investment since . During this time , in excess of £ 50 million of public money has been spent on 15 other football grounds in Northern Ireland . 
 In 2005 , after a match between Glentoran and rival team Linfield , Linfield fans broke down a gate in The Oval to access the pitch and throw objects at Glentoran fans in the main stand after both sets of fans had been throwing missiles at each other beforehand . Two people were charged with rioting . 
 In 2008 , The Oval was the site of a protest by the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster against a decision by the Irish Football Association to allow football matches to be played on Sundays , a first in Northern Ireland due to traditional <unk> . The protesters were concerned that regular Sunday matches would attract churchgoers away from attending church . The protest was led by Reverend David <unk> , who said " Fundamentally , it is a desecration of God 's day . " In October 2010 the British National Party ( BNP ) , who were trying to gain electoral support , held a rally outside The Oval . Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) Member of the Legislative Assembly , Robin Newton described the BNP 's presence outside The Oval as " nauseous " . In July 2011 , an incendiary bomb was discovered outside The Oval requiring evacuation of surrounding streets . In October 2011 during an Irish Cup match between Glentoran and Portadown , a Portadown fan threw fireworks onto the pitch , injuring Glentoran 's assistant manager Pete Batey and goalkeeping coach Davy McClelland . 
 In the 21st century , the Oval has been dilapidated and has required constant repairs to fulfill Health and Safety requirements for Glentoran to host its home matches there . In 2009 , Glentoran 's Irish Cup match against <unk> United was abandoned after the stadium 's floodlight pylons started shaking in the high winds and the referee deemed it too dangerous for the match to continue . In 2012 , after considering selling naming rights to The Oval , Glentoran unveiled plans to move the club to a new stadium in the Titanic Quarter of Belfast . The Oval was sold to property developers in March 2003 for £ 4 million . Glentoran 's chairman suggested that the Oval might be redeveloped into social housing . 
 = = Location and design = = 
 The Oval is located near the Port of Belfast , and Harland and Wolff 's Samson and Goliath cranes are visible from inside the stadium . It is viewed as a historic ground by football fans because of its concrete terraces and steel fencing . This limits its capacity in UEFA @-@ sanctioned matches to the 3 @,@ 000 seats in the two main stands as terracing has not been permitted in UEFA matches since 1998 . 
 The stadium 's capacity is 26 @,@ 556 , but was estimated in 2010 by the Northern Ireland Assembly to have a safe capacity of 5 @,@ 056 under safety legislation . However , since 2011 , the safe capacity permitted by Health and Safety authorities is 5 @,@ 300 ; before 2010 the stadium could hold more than 8 @,@ 000 . Linfield 's manager David Jeffrey criticised these restrictions and said that they were " murdering local football . " The main stand holds 2 @,@ 720 and the Railway stand holds 2 @,@ 070 . The Oval 's record attendance is 55 @,@ 000 for a European Cup Winners Cup match against Rangers on 27 September 1966 . 
 The design of the main stand is very similar to the one at Springfield Park , former home of Wigan Athletic . This was also built in 1953

 In previous years , the Oval was used to host the final of the Irish Cup as one of Northern Ireland 's biggest stadiums along with Windsor Park , with the location of the final often being decided on a coin toss . During the 1985 Irish Cup final , Glentoran supporters released a cockerel and a pig that had been painted blue onto the pitch to antagonize Linfield supporters . The Oval was used to host the final of the County Antrim Shield in 2012 . The Oval has also been used to host the Setanta Cup final . It hosted the 2012 final between Belfast 's Crusaders representing the IFA Premiership , and County Londonderry based Derry City , representing the League of Ireland . The 2015 Irish Cup Final between Glentoran and Portadown was played at The Oval . 
 = James Rowland ( RAAF officer ) = 
 Air Marshal Sir James Anthony ( Jim ) Rowland , AC , KBE , DFC , AFC ( 1 November 1922 – 27 May 1999 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , serving as Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) from 1975 to 1979 . He later held office as Governor of New South Wales from 1981 to 1989 , and was Chancellor of the University of Sydney from 1990 to 1991 . Born in rural New South Wales , Rowland cut short his aeronautical engineering studies at the University of Sydney to join the RAAF in 1942 . He was posted to Britain and served as a bomber pilot with the Pathfinders in the air war over Europe , earning the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1944 . The following year he was forced to bail out over Germany following a collision with another Allied aircraft , and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner . 
 After repatriation and demobilisation , Rowland gained his engineering degree and rejoined the RAAF . He became a test pilot , serving with and later commanding the Aircraft Research and Development Unit in the 1950s , and also a senior engineering officer , being closely involved in preparations for delivery to Australia of the Dassault Mirage III supersonic fighter in the 1960s . In 1972 he was promoted to air vice marshal and became Air Member for Technical Services , holding this post until his elevation to air marshal and appointment as CAS in March 1975 . He was the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF , and the first man to personally command it in a legal sense , following abolition of the Australian Air Board in 1976 . Knighted in 1977 , Rowland retired from the Air Force in 1979 and became Governor of New South Wales in January 1981 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1987 . Retiring from the Governorship in 1989 , he held a place on several boards as well as the Chancellorship of the University of Sydney . He died in 1999 . 
 = = Early life and World War II = = 
 Rowland was born in Armidale , New South Wales , on 1 November 1922 . He was the son of Louis Rowland , a commander in the Royal Australian Navy , and his wife Elsie . He evinced a fascination with aviation from an early age , carving model aeroplanes out of wood . Growing up with his three brothers on the family 's 3 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 1 @,@ 200 ha ) rural property , he was schooled via correspondence before completing his secondary education at Cranbrook , Sydney . At 17 , he entered the University of Sydney to study aeronautical engineering , but left in May 1942 to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as a pilot under the Empire Air Training Scheme . He was commissioned as a pilot officer in July 1943 and posted to Britain , where he converted to Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers . 
 Rowland was posted to the Pathfinder Force that marked targets for other aircraft on strategic bombing missions over Europe . Considered an exceptional pilot , he became a master bomber with No. 635 Squadron RAF in 1944 . As a master bomber , his role was to arrive ahead of the main Allied force , check that flares marking the target were in place , and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately . No. 635 Squadron operated Lancasters , a type that , Rowland recalled , " would forgive <unk> pilots doing the most outrageous things to it , and would even bring them home with quite large bits shot off it " . 
 Having been promoted to acting flight lieutenant , he was on a sortie to attack Düsseldorf in December 1944 when he lost one of his engines . He nevertheless continued on to the target where , owing to his lower @-@ than @-@ normal altitude , his aircraft was seriously damaged by anti @-@ aircraft fire before and after he dropped his bombs . Nursing his plane back to base , he was recommended for the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) in recognition of his " great determination and devotion to duty " ; the award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 16 February 1945 . In January 1945 , Rowland 's Lancaster collided with a Canadian bomber over Frankfurt , and he had to bail out with his surviving crew . Captured and held by the Gestapo in solitary confinement , he was scheduled to be executed but was saved by two Luftwaffe officers who had learned of his situation . They took him to a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp , where he remained until being repatriated at the end of hostilities . 
 = = Post @-@ war RAAF career = = 
 Rowland 's commission was terminated in November 1945 . Returning to Australia , he resumed his studies at the University of Sydney and completed his degree , before rejoining the RAAF as a member of its newly formed Technical Branch in 1947 . He was posted to Britain in 1949 to attend the Empire Test Pilots ' School . In 1952 , he was appointed chief test pilot with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit ( ARDU ) at RAAF Base Laverton , Victoria . Rowland led trial programs that involved many of the Air Force 's early jets such as the Gloster Meteor , De Havilland Vampire , English Electric Canberra , and CAC Sabre . Promoted to squadron leader , he earned the Air Force Cross ( AFC ) for his test flying achievements ; the award was gazetted on 1 January 1955 . He married Faye Doughton on 20 April 1955 ; the couple had a daughter , Anni . 
 Rowland attended RAAF Staff College , Point Cook , in 1956 . Promoted to wing commander , he took charge of ARDU from November 1956 until June 1959 . In 1957 , he raised concerns that the supersonic Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighter , touted as a multi @-@ role replacement for the Sabre , was ill @-@ suited for any purpose except interception . Defence Minister Sir Philip McBride had reached a similar conclusion , and kept the Sabre in frontline service until a more suitable aircraft could be chosen , namely the Dassault Mirage III delta @-@ wing fighter . From 1961 to 1964 Rowland was based in Paris , as Technical Staff Officer on the RAAF team preparing for the Mirage 's acceptance into Australian service . In contrast to most of the team members , he displayed a talent for language and by his second year was chairing meetings with Dassault engineers in French . After returning to Australia , he was posted to the Directorate of Aircraft Engineering at the Department of Air , Canberra , responsible for ongoing technical oversight of the Mirage . 
 In December 1966 Rowland became commanding officer of No. 3 Aircraft Depot ( No. 3 AD ) at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , with the acting rank of group captain ; his promotion was made substantive in November 1967 . After completing his tenure at No. 3 AD in January 1969 , Rowland was appointed Senior Engineering Staff Officer at Headquarters Operational Command in Glenbrook , New South Wales . In 1971 he was posted to Britain to attend the Royal College of Defence Studies , London . Returning to Australia , he was Director @-@ General of Aircraft Engineering before being promoted to air vice marshal to serve as Air Member for Technical Services ( AMTS ) , the RAAF 's senior engineering position , in November 1972 . The AMTS occupied a seat on the Australian Air Board , the service 's controlling body that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) . In March 1975 Rowland was raised to air marshal and took over from Air Marshal Charles Read as CAS , becoming the first appointee to the position who had joined the RAAF after the commencement of World War II . He was also the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF , and was selected over a more senior air vice marshal through the personal influence of the Defence Secretary , Sir Arthur Tange . The CAS was nevertheless required to be a member of the Air Force 's aircrew stream so Rowland , still a qualified pilot , had to transfer from the Technical Branch to the General Duties Branch . Soon afterwards , the stipulation for the CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed . 
 In 1976 , Rowland became the first CAS to personally command the RAAF in a legal sense , following dissolution of the Air Board , a consequence of defence reorganisation in the wake of the 1973 " Tange report " that recommended departmental rationalisation . A new Chief of the Air Staff Advisory Committee ( <unk> ) was set up , but there was no requirement for the CAS to accept its advice . According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens , Rowland considered that the " collective wisdom " engendered by the Air Board had been generally beneficial to the RAAF , and believed the new arrangements led to " ' paralysis and arrogation of decision making ' , and empire building in the Public Service component " . Though known as a strong committee member who enjoyed a good argument , he " found that the sheer time involved in attending meetings made it very difficult for him to run the Air Force ' the way [ he ] wanted to ' " . To help facilitate the cross @-@ fertilisation of ideas on air power between senior officers , he inaugurated an annual CAS Symposium . During his period as CAS , Rowland reoriented the RAAF 's priorities in line with the Defence of Australia policy , which had been adopted by the government in the early 1970s . As a result , he placed the strongest emphasis on protecting Australia from air attack , followed by conducting air strikes on targets in other countries , and supporting the Army and Navy . 
 On 11 June 1977 , Rowland was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the military division ( KBE ) . In July the same year , he was awarded the National Medal with First Clasp , given " for diligent long service to the community " . Rowland 's original three @-@ year term as CAS was extended by a year . He retired from the Air Force in March 1979 , and was succeeded by his deputy and former classmate at RAAF Staff College , Air Vice Marshal Neville McNamara . 
 = = Governorship and later life = = 
 After leaving the Air Force , Rowland continued to live in Canberra , consulting part @-@ time for French arms concern <unk> . In late 1980 he was recommended by the government of Premier Neville Wran to serve as the next Governor of New South Wales , replacing Sir Roden Cutler . Rowland admitted that he did not have " the faintest idea " why he was chosen , and thought that " there must be a lot of people who could do it a lot better than I could " . He saw the role as the monarch 's representative in New South Wales as helping to provide " a valuable link with an older part of the world " . Wran , for his part , was understood to have chosen Rowland largely on the basis of his engaging personality ; it was also said that the Premier preferred military men for vice @-@ regal office because " they knew how to take orders " . Rowland was duly appointed by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 January 1981 . Upon taking office , he declared that he wished to be seen as a " man of the people " . To this end , he opened Government House to the public on a more frequent basis , and also extended invitations for official functions to a broader range of society than was previously the case . 
 As Governor of New South Wales and therefore the senior state governor , Rowland held a dormant commission to serve as Administrator of the Commonwealth and Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Australian Defence Force during absences by the Governor General , and did so six times while in office . On one such occasion he was required to dismiss an old colleague , Air Vice Marshal James Flemming , from his position as director of the Australian War Memorial , Canberra , after the Government lost faith in Flemming 's ability to properly manage the Memorial . Rowland had served as one of Flemming 's referees when he applied to head the Memorial in 1982 . The journalist and public servant Evan Williams also credited Rowland with being " the first Viceregal whistleblower " for alerting the Wran government to an unusual number of early release requests for prisoners that he was being asked to sign by Corrective Services Minister Rex Jackson . The inquiries set in motion by Rowland 's queries revealed that Jackson was receiving money from criminals for misusing the early release scheme . Forced to resign , Jackson was later charged with corruption and imprisoned . 
 Rowland was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Engineering by the University of Sydney in 1983 , and also appointed a Knight of the Order of St John . On 26 January 1987 , he was invested as a Companion of the Order of Australia ( AC ) for " service to the Crown and to the people of New South Wales " . At Sydney Town Hall on 3 October that year , he took the salute of Vietnam veterans during their official " Welcome Home March " . His governorship coincided with Australian Bicentenary celebrations in 1988 . A popular Governor , Rowland was considered by his Labor premiers to be " a safe pair of hands " . His original four @-@ year term was extended twice , each time for two years , by the Wran and Unsworth administrations . On 27 April 1988 , Rowland opened the Forty @-@ Ninth New South Wales Parliament with a new premier , Nick Greiner , whose Liberal Party had defeated Labor in the March elections . That November , he took a turn at flying one of the RAAF 's recently acquired F / A @-@ 18 Hornets piloted by Wing Commander ( later Air Vice Marshal ) John Kindler . He was succeeded on 20 January 1989 by Rear Admiral Sir David Martin . After retiring from the Governorship , Rowland served as President of the Royal Humane Society , Chancellor of the University of Sydney from 1990 to 1991 , and as a member of the Police Board from 1989 to 1992 . He was also a member of the boards of several private companies , including Angus & Coote and Thomson @-@ CSF Pacific Holdings , and Chairman of the Aerospace Foundation of Australia from 1992 until his death in Sydney on 27 May 1999 . Sir James Rowland was survived by his wife and daughter , and accorded a state funeral . 
 = Maya civilization = 
 The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples , and noted for its hieroglyphic script — the only known fully developed writing system of the pre @-@ Columbian Americas — as well as for its art , architecture , mathematics , calendar , and astronomical system . The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico , all of Guatemala and Belize , and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador . This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatán Peninsula , and the highlands of the Sierra Madre , running from the Mexican state of Chiapas , across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador , and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain . 
 The Archaic period , prior to 2000 BC , saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages . The Preclassic period ( c . 2000 BC to 250 AD ) saw the establishment of the first complex societies in the Maya region , and the cultivation of the staple crops of the Maya diet , including maize , beans , squashes , and chili peppers . The first Maya cities developed around 750 BC , and by 500 BC these cities possessed monumental architecture , including large temples with elaborate stucco façades . Hieroglyphic writing was being used in the Maya region by the 3rd century BC . In the Late Preclassic a number of large cities developed in the Petén Basin , and Kaminaljuyu rose to prominence in the Guatemalan Highlands . Beginning around 250 AD , the Classic period is largely defined as when the Maya were raising sculpted monuments with Long Count dates . This period saw the Maya civilization develop a large number of city @-@ states linked by a complex trade network . In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals , Tikal and Calakmul , became powerful . The Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan in Maya dynastic politics . In the 9th century , there was a widespread political collapse in the central Maya region , resulting in internecine warfare , the abandonment of cities , and a northward shift of population . The Postclassic period saw the rise of Chichen Itza in the north , and the expansion of the aggressive K 'iche ' kingdom in the Guatemalan Highlands . In the 16th century , the Spanish Empire colonised the Mesoamerican region , and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of Nojpetén , the last Maya city in 1697 . 
 Classic period rule was centred on the concept of the " divine king " , who acted as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm . Kingship was patrilineal , and power would normally pass to the eldest son . A prospective king was also expected to be a successful war leader . Maya politics was dominated by a closed system of patronage , although the exact political make @-@ up of a kingdom varied from city @-@ state to city @-@ state . By the Late Classic , the aristocracy had greatly increased , resulting in the corresponding reduction in the exclusive power of the divine king . The Maya civilization developed highly sophisticated artforms , and the Maya created art using both perishable and non @-@ perishable materials , including wood , jade , obsidian , ceramics , sculpted stone monuments , stucco , and finely painted murals . 
 Maya cities tended to expand haphazardly , and the city centre would be occupied by ceremonial and administrative complexes , surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts . Different parts of a city would often be linked by causeways . The principal architecture of the city consisted of palaces , pyramid @-@ temples , ceremonial ballcourts , and structures aligned for astronomical observation . The Maya elite were literate , and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing that was the most advanced in the pre @-@ Columbian Americas . The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in <unk> books , of which only three uncontested examples remain , the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish . There are also a great many examples of Maya text found on stelae and ceramics . The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars , and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest instances of the explicit zero in the world . As a part of their religion , the Maya practised human sacrifice . 
 = = Mesoamerica = = 
 The Maya civilization developed within the Mesoamerican cultural area , which covers a region that spreads from northern Mexico southwards into Central America . Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide . The Mesoamerican area gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included complex societies , agriculture , cities , monumental architecture , writing , and calendrical systems . The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge , blood and human sacrifice , and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions , each with different attributes , and a three @-@ way division of the world into the celestial realm , the earth , and the underworld . 
 By 6000 BC , the early inhabitants of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants , a process that eventually led to the establishment of sedentary agricultural societies . The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops , but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize , beans , and squashes . All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology ; after c . 1000 AD copper , silver and gold were worked . Mesoamerica lacked draft animals , did not use the wheel , and possessed few domesticated animals ; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe . Mesoamericans viewed the world as hostile and governed by unpredictable deities . The ritual Mesoamerican ballgame was widely played . Mesoamerica is linguistically diverse , with most languages falling within a small number of language families – the major families are Mayan , Mixe – Zoquean , <unk> , and Uto @-@ Aztecan ; there are also a number of smaller families and isolates . The Mesoamerican language area shares a number of important features , including widespread loanwords , and use of a vigesimal number system . 
 The territory of the Maya covered a third of Mesoamerica , and the Maya were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the Olmecs , <unk> , Teotihuacan , the Aztecs , and others . During the Early Classic period , the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond the Maya area into the highlands of central Mexico . At around the same time , there was a strong Maya presence at the <unk> compound of Teotihuacan . Centuries later , during the 9th century AD , murals at Cacaxtla , another site in the central Mexican highlands , were painted in a Maya style . This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still @-@ powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands , or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants . The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant Toltec capital of Tula had an especially close relationship . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Maya civilization occupied a wide territory that included southeastern Mexico and northern Central America . This area included the entire Yucatán Peninsula and all of the territory now incorporated into the modern countries of Guatemala and Belize , as well as the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador . Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline . 
 The Petén region consists of densely forested low @-@ lying limestone plain ; a chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Petén . To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands . Dense forest covers northern Petén and Belize , most of Quintana Roo , southern Campeche , and a portion of the south of Yucatán state . Farther north , the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub . 
 The littoral zone of Soconusco lies to the south of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas , and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre . The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala , reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes . The major pre @-@ Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys , such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley in the southern highlands , a belt of volcanic cones running parallel to the Pacific coast . The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz , and gradually descend to the east . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of Maya civilization is divided into three principal periods : the Preclassic , Classic , and Postclassic periods . These were preceded by the Archaic Period , during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged . Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology , rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline . Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century , depending on the author . 
 = = = Preclassic period ( c . 2000 BC – 250 AD ) = = = 
 The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period . Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began . Maya occupation at Cuello ( modern @-@ day Belize ) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC . Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast , and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize , beans , squash , and chili pepper . This period was characterised by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines . 
 During the Middle Preclassic Period , small villages began to grow to form cities . Nakbe in the Petén department of Guatemala is the earliest well @-@ documented city in the Maya lowlands , where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC . The northern lowlands of Yucatán were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic . By approximately 400 BC , early Maya rulers were raising stelae . A developed script was already being used in Petén by the 3rd century BC . In the Late Preclassic Period , the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) . Although not as large , Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC . 
 In the highlands , Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic . Takalik Abaj and Chocolá were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain , and <unk> grew to become an important site in northern Yucatán . The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned ; the cause of this collapse is unknown . 
 = = = Classic period ( c . 250 – 900 AD ) = = = 
 The Classic period is largely defined as the period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar . This period marked the peak of large @-@ scale construction and urbanism , the recording of monumental inscriptions , and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development , particularly in the southern lowland regions . The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of Renaissance Italy or Classical Greece , with multiple city @-@ states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities . The largest cities had populations numbering 50 @,@ 000 to 120 @,@ 000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites . 
 During the Early Classic , cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico . In AD 378 , Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities , deposed their rulers , and installed a new Teotihuacan @-@ backed dynasty . This intervention was led by Siyaj K 'ak ' ( " Born of Fire " ) , who arrived at Tikal in early 378 . The king of Tikal , Chak Tok Ich 'aak I , died on the same day , suggesting a violent takeover . A year later , Siyaj K 'ak ' oversaw the installation of a new king , Yax Nuun <unk> I. The installation of the new dynasty led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands . 
 Tikal 's great rival was Calakmul , another powerful city in the Petén Basin . Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive systems of allies and vassals ; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top @-@ tier city , and maintained peaceful relations with other members of the same network . Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other . At various points during the Classic period , one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival , resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline . 
 In 629 , B 'alaj Chan K 'awiil , a son of the Tikal king K 'inich Muwaan Jol II , was sent to found a new city at Dos Pilas , in the Petexbatún region , apparently as an outpost to extend Tikal 's power beyond the reach of Calakmul . For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal . In 648 , king Yuknoom Ch 'een II of Calakmul captured Balaj Chan K 'awiil . Yuknoom Ch 'een II then reinstated Balaj Chan K 'awiil upon the throne of Dos Pilas as his vassal . He thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul . 
 In the southeast , Copán was the most important city . Its Classic @-@ period dynasty was founded in 426 by K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' . The new king had strong ties with central Petén and Teotihuacan . Copán reached the height of its cultural and artistic development during the rule of Uaxaclajuun Ub 'aah K 'awiil , who ruled from 695 to 738 . His reign ended catastrophically when he was captured by his vassal , king K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá . The captured lord of Copán was taken back to Quiriguá and was decapitated in a public ritual . It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul , in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal . Palenque and Yaxchilan were the most powerful cities in the Usumacinta region . In the highlands , Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by 300 . In the north of the Maya area , Coba was the most important capital . 
 = = = = Classic Maya collapse = = = = 
 During the 9th century AD , the central Maya region suffered major political collapse , marked by the abandonment of cities , the ending of dynasties , and a northward shift in activity . No universally accepted theory explains this collapse , but it likely had a combination of causes , including endemic internecine warfare , overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation , and drought . During this period , known as the Terminal Classic , the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal showed increased activity . Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments . 
 Classic Maya social organisation was based on the ritual authority of the ruler , rather than central control of trade and food distribution . This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes , because the ruler 's actions were limited by tradition to such activities as construction , ritual , and warfare . This only served to exacerbate systemic problems . By the 9th and 10th centuries , this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership . In the northern Yucatán , individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages . In the southern Yucatán and central Petén , kingdoms declined ; in western Petén and some other areas , the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities . Within a couple of generations , large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned . Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years . One by one , cities stopped sculpting dated monuments ; the last Long Count date was inscribed at Toniná in 909 . Stelae were no longer raised , and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces . Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén . 
 = = = Postclassic period ( c . 950 – 1539 AD ) = = = 
 Although much reduced , a significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities ; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources . Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region , abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic . Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands ; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands , because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths . Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century , and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse . After the decline of Chichen Itza , the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of Mayapan in the 12th century . New cities arose near the Caribbean and Gulf coasts , and new trade networks were formed . 
 The Postclassic Period was marked by changes from the preceding Classic Period . The once @-@ great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2 @,@ 000 years . Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast , long @-@ occupied cities in exposed locations were relocated , apparently due to a proliferation of warfare . Cities came to occupy more @-@ easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines , with ditch @-@ and @-@ wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain . One of the most important cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was Q 'umarkaj , the capital of the aggressive K 'iche ' kingdom . The government of Maya states , from the Yucatán to the Guatemalan highlands , was often organised as joint rule by a council . However , in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler , while the other members served him as advisors . 
 Mayapan was abandoned around 1448 , after a period of political , social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the southern Maya region . The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare , disease and natural disasters in the Yucatán Peninsula , which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511 . Even without a dominant regional capital , the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces . During the Late Postclassic , the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organisation . On the eve of the Spanish conquest , the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states . The K 'iche ' had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain . However , in the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K 'iche ' . 
 = = = Contact period and Spanish conquest ( 1511 – 1697 AD ) = = = 
 In 1511 , a Spanish caravel was wrecked in the Caribbean , and about a dozen survivors made landfall on the coast of Yucatán . They were seized by a Maya lord , and most were sacrificed , although two managed to escape . From 1517 to 1519 , three separate Spanish expeditions explored the Yucatán coast , and engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants . After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish in 1521 , Hernán Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado to Guatemala with 180 cavalry , 300 infantry , 4 cannons , and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico ; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523 . The K 'iche ' capital , Q 'umarkaj , fell to Alvarado in 1524 . Shortly afterwards , the Spanish were invited as allies into Iximche , the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya . Good relations did not last , due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute , and the city was abandoned a few months later . This was followed by the fall of Zaculeu , the Mam Maya capital , in 1525 . Francisco de Montejo and his son , Francisco de Montejo the Younger , launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the Yucatán Peninsula in 1527 , and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546 . This left only the Maya kingdoms of the Petén Basin independent . In 1697 , Martín de Ursúa launched an assault on the Itza capital Nojpetén and the last independent Maya city fell to the Spanish . 
 = = = Persistence of Maya culture = = = 
 The Spanish conquest stripped away most of the defining features of Maya civilization . However , many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority , and for the most part continued to manage their own affairs . Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day @-@ to @-@ day life . The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued , although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools . Traditional crafts such as weaving , ceramics , and basketry continued to be practiced . Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest . At times , the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles , although these were usually made to European specifications . Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change , despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries . The 260 @-@ day tzolk 'in ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas , and millions of Mayan @-@ language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization . 
 = = = Investigation of Maya civilization = = = 
 The agents of the Catholic Church wrote detailed accounts of the Maya , in support of their efforts at evangelisation , and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire . This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America . In 1839 , American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood . Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest , and brought the Maya to the attention of the world . The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of <unk> accounts of the Maya , and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs . 
 The final two decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern scientific archaeology in the Maya region , with the meticulous work of Alfred Maudslay and Teoberto Maler . By the early 20th century , the Peabody Museum was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula . In the first two decades of the 20th century , advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar , and identifying deities , dates , and religious concepts . Since the 1930s , archaeological exploration increased dramatically , with large @-@ scale excavations across the Maya region . 
 In the 1960s , the distinguished Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson promoted the ideas that Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest , and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer @-@ priests . These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century , pioneered by Heinrich Berlin , Tatiana Proskouriakoff , and Yuri Knorozov . With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s , the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings , and the view of the Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported . Detailed settlement surveys of Maya cities revealed the evidence of large populations , putting an end to the vacant ceremonial centre model . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Unlike the Aztecs and the Incas , the Maya political system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area into a single state or empire . Rather , throughout its history , the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both states and chiefdoms . These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships with each other and were engaged in a complex web of rivalries , periods of dominance or submission , vassalage , and alliances . At times , different polities achieved regional dominance , such as Calakmul , Caracol , Mayapan , and Tikal . The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC . During the Late Preclassic , the Maya political system coalesced into a <unk> form , where elite ideology justified the ruler 's authority , and was reinforced by public display , ritual , and religion . The divine king was the centre of political power , exercising ultimate control over the administrative , economic , judicial , and military functions of the polity . The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilise both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects , apparently with no police force or standing army . Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration , and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives . Within a polity , mid @-@ ranking population centres would have played a key role in managing resources and internal conflict . 
 The Maya political landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain economic and social advantage over neighbours . In the Late Classic , some cities established a long period of dominance over other large cities , such as the dominance of Caracol over Naranjo for half a century . In other cases , loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city . Border settlements , usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals , often switched allegiance over the course of their history , and at times acted independently . Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres . Political power was reinforced by military power , and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture . An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas , which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities . 
 = = Society = = 
 From the Early Preclassic , Maya society was sharply divided between the elite and commoners . As population increased over time , various sectors of society became increasingly specialised , and political organisation became increasingly complex . By the Late Classic , when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies , the wealthy segment of society multiplied . A middle class may have developed , that included artisans , low ranking priests and officials , merchants , and soldiers . Commoners included farmers , servants , labourers , and slaves . According to indigenous histories , land was held communally by noble houses or clans . Such clans held that the land was the property of the clan ancestors , and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds . 
 = = = King and court = = = 
 Classic Maya rule was centred in a royal culture that was displayed in all areas of Classic Maya art . The king was the supreme ruler , and held a semi @-@ divine status that made him the mediator between the mortal realm and that of the gods . From very early times , kings were specifically identified with the young maize god , whose gift of maize was the basis of Mesoamerican civilization . Maya royal succession was patrilineal , and royal power only passed to queens when doing otherwise would result in the extinction of the dynasty . Typically , power was passed to the eldest son . A young prince was called a ch 'ok ( " youth " ) , although this word later came to refer to nobility in general . The royal heir was called b 'aah ch 'ok ( " head youth " ) . Various points in the young prince 's childhood were marked by ritual ; the most important was a bloodletting ceremony at age five or six years . Although being of the royal bloodline was of utmost importance , the heir also had to be a successful war leader , as demonstrated by taking of captives . The enthronement of a new king was a highly elaborate ceremony , involving a series of separate acts that included enthronement upon a jaguar @-@ skin cushion , human sacrifice , and receiving the symbols of royal power , such as a headband bearing a jade representation of the so @-@ called " jester god " , an elaborate headdress adorned with quetzal feathers , and a sceptre representing the god K 'awiil . 
 Maya political administration , based around the royal court , was not bureaucratic in nature . Government was hierarchical , and official posts were sponsored by higher @-@ ranking members of the aristocracy ; officials tended to be promoted to higher levels of office during the course of their lives . Officials are referred to as being " owned " by their sponsor , and this relationship continued even after the death of the sponsor . The Maya royal court was a vibrant and dynamic political institution . There was no universal structure for the Maya royal court , instead each polity formed a royal court that was suited to its own individual context . A number of royal and noble titles have been identified by epigraphers translating Classic Maya inscriptions . Ajaw is usually translated as " lord " or " king " . In the Early Classic , an ajaw was the ruler of a city . Later , with increasing social complexity , the ajaw was a member of the ruling class and a major city could have more than one , each ruling over different districts . Paramount rulers distinguished themselves from the extended nobility by prefixing the word k 'uhul to their ajaw title . A k 'uhul ajaw was " divine lord " , originally confined to the kings of the most prestigious and ancient royal lines . <unk> was a royal title , whose exact meaning is not yet deciphered , but it was held only by the most powerful kings of the strongest dynasties . It indicated an overlord , or high king , and the title was only in use during the Classic period . By the Late Classic , the absolute power of the k 'uhul ajaw had weakened , and the political system had diversified to include a wider aristocracy , that by this time may well have expanded disproportionately . 
 A sajal was ranked below the ajaw , and indicated a subservient lord . A sajal would be lord of a second- or third @-@ tier site , answering to an ajaw , who may himself have been subservient to a <unk> . A sajal would often be a war captain or regional governor , and inscriptions often link the sajal title to warfare ; they are often mentioned as the holders of war captives . <unk> meant " feared one " . The titles of ah tz <unk> and ah ch 'ul hun are both related to scribes . The ah tz <unk> was a royal scribe , usually a member of the royal family ; the ah ch 'ul hun was the Keeper of the Holy Books , a title that is closely associated with the ajaw title , indicating that an ajaw always held the ah ch 'ul hun title simultaneously . Other courtly titles , the functions of which are not well understood , were <unk> k <unk> ' ( " Lord of Fire " ) , ti <unk> and ti <unk> . These last two may be variations on the same title , and Mark <unk> has suggested that the holder of this title may have been the spokesman for the ruler . Courtly titles are overwhelmingly male @-@ oriented , and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman , they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty . Titled elites were often associated with particular structures in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Classic period cities , indicating that such office holders either owned that structure , or that the structure was an important focus for their activities . A lakam was possibly the only non @-@ elite post @-@ holder in the royal court . The lakam was only found in larger sites , and they appear to have been responsible for the taxation of local districts . 
 Different factions may have existed in the royal court . The k 'uhul ahaw and his household would have formed the central power @-@ base , but other important groups were the priesthood , the warrior aristocracy , and other aristocratic courtiers . Where ruling councils existed , as at Chichen Itza and Copán , these may have formed an additional faction . Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out . In such a setting , public performance was vital . Such performances included ritual dances , presentation of war captives , offerings of tribute , human sacrifice , and religious ritual . 
 = = = Commoners = = = 
 Commoners are estimated to have comprised over 90 % of the population , but relatively little is known about them . Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials , and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record . Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms , and these can be identified , but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not . Such low @-@ status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote @-@ sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain . The range of commoners was broad ; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth , and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions . Commoners engaged in essential production activities , including that of products destined for use by the elite , such as cotton and cacao , as well as subsistence crops for their own use , and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools . Commoners took part in warfare , and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors . Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game . It is likely that hard @-@ working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society . 
 = = Warfare = = 
 Warfare was prevalent in the Maya world . Military campaigns were launched for a variety of reasons , including the control of trade routes and tribute , raids to take captives , scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state . Little is known about Maya military organisation , logistics , or training . Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period , and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions . Unfortunately , the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war , or the form it took . In the 8th – 9th centuries , intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén . The rapid abandonment of Aguateca by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry in situ . Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD , who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace . The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured , and never returned to collect their abandoned property . The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after . This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a Maya state , rather than subjugate it . Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite . 
 From as early as the Preclassic period , the ruler of a Maya polity was expected to be a distinguished war leader , and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt . In the Classic period , such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king 's belt , but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives . Right up to the end of the Postclassic period , Maya kings led as war captains . Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured , tortured , and sacrificed . The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books . 
 The outcome of a successful military campaign could vary in its impact on the defeated polity . In some cases , entire cities were sacked , and never resettled , as at Aguateca . In other instances , the victors would seize the defeated rulers , their families , and patron gods . The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned , or sacrificed . At the least severe end of the scale , the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor . 
 = = = Warriors = = = 
 During the Contact period , it is known that certain military positions were held by members of the aristocracy , and were passed on by patrilineal succession . It is likely that the specialised knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor , including strategy , ritual , and war dances . Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined , and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills ; every able @-@ bodied adult male was available for military service . Maya states did not maintain standing armies ; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed <unk> . There were also units of full @-@ time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders . Most warriors were not full @-@ time , however , and were primarily farmers ; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare . Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder . 
 There is some evidence from the Classic period that women provided supporting roles in war , but they did not act as military officers with the exception of those rare ruling queens . By the Postclassic , the native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle . 
 = = = Weapons = = = 
 The atlatl ( spear @-@ thrower ) was introduced to the Maya region by Teotihuacan in the Early Classic . This was a 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) long stick with a notched end to hold a dart or javelin . The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone . Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior . Commoners used blowguns in war , which also served as their hunting weapon . The bow and arrow is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting . Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period , its use as a weapon of war was not favoured ; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic . The Contact period Maya also used two @-@ handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian , similar to the Aztec macuahuitl . Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it ; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region . Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins . 
 = = Trade = = 
 Trade was a key component of Maya society , and in the development of the Maya civilization . The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods , or portage routes . Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Q 'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands , and Chalchuapa in El Salvador , variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history . The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt . In the Postclassic , the Maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider Mesoamerica . 
 The Maya engaged in long distance trade across the Maya region , and across greater Mesoamerica and beyond . Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area , trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast . In the Early Classic , Chichen Itza was at the hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from Colombia and Panama , and turquoise from Los Cerrillos , New Mexico . Long distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family . Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city 's ruler , and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies . An Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan , in central Mexico . 
 Trade routes not only supplied physical goods , they facilitated the movement of people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica . Shifts in trade routes occurred with the rise and fall of important cities in the Maya region , and have been identified in every major reorganisation of the Maya civilization , such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization , the transition to the Classic , and the Terminal Classic collapse . Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity ; for example , the Contact period Manche Ch 'ol traded the prestige crops of cacao , annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz . 
 = = = Merchants = = = 
 Little is known of Maya merchants , although they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress . From this , it is known that at least some traders were members of the elite . During the Contact period , it is known that Maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions . The majority of traders were middle class , but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was the preserve of the elite . The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the underworld ; the patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks . When merchants travelled , they painted themselves black , like their patron gods , and went heavily armed . 
 The Maya had no pack animals , so all trade goods were carried on the backs of porters when going overland ; if the trade route followed a river or the coast , then goods were transported in canoes . A substantial Maya trading canoe was encountered off Honduras on Christopher Columbus 's fourth voyage . It was made from a large hollowed @-@ out tree trunk and had a palm @-@ covered canopy . The canoe was 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) broad and was powered by 25 rowers . Trade goods carried included cacao , obsidian , ceramics , textiles , food and drink for the crew , and copper bells and axes . Cacao was used as currency ( although not exclusively ) , and its value was such that counterfeiting occurred by removing the flesh from the pod , and stuffing it with dirt or avocado rind . 
 = = = Marketplaces = = = 
 Marketplaces are difficult to identify archaeologically . However , the Spanish reported a thriving market economy when they arrived in the region . At some Classic period cities , archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade @-@ style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls . A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at <unk> . Unusually high levels of zinc and phosphorus at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity . The calculated density of market stalls at <unk> strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic . Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at an increasing number of Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis . When the Spanish arrived , Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas , with officials on hand to settle disputes , enforce rules , and collect taxes . 
 = = Art = = 
 Maya art is essentially the art of the royal court . It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world . Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non @-@ perishable materials , and served to link the Maya to their ancestors . Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created , it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas . Maya art has many regional styles , and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text . The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period . 
 The Maya exhibited a preference for the colour green or blue @-@ green , and used the same word for the colours blue and green . Correspondingly , they placed high value on apple @-@ green jade , and other greenstones , associating them with the sun @-@ god K 'inich <unk> . They sculpted artefacts that included fine tesserae and beads , to carved heads weighing 4 @.@ 42 kilograms ( 9 @.@ 7 lb ) . The Maya nobility practised dental modification , and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth . Mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade , such as that of K 'inich Janaab ' Pakal , king of Palenque . 
 Maya stone sculpture emerged into the archaeological record as a fully developed tradition , suggesting that it may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood . Because of the <unk> of wood , the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared . The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three @-@ dimensional sculptures , and hieroglyphic panels . Stone Maya stelae are widespread in city sites , often paired with low , circular stones referred to as altars in the literature . Stone sculpture also took other forms , such as the limestone relief panels at Palenque and Piedras Negras . At Yaxchilan , Dos Pilas , Copán , and other sites , stone stairways were decorated with sculpture . The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text , and consists of 2 @,@ 200 individual glyphs . 
 The largest Maya sculptures consisted of architectural façades crafted from stucco . The rough form was laid out on a plain plaster base coating on the wall , and the three @-@ dimensional form was built up using small stones . Finally , this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form ; human body forms were first modelled in stucco , with their costumes added afterwards . The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted . Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic , and such decoration continued into the Classic period . 
 The Maya had a long tradition of mural painting ; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo , dating to between 300 and 200 BC . Walls were coated with plaster , and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish . The majority of such murals have not survived , but Early Classic tombs painted in cream , red , and black have been excavated at Caracol , Río Azul , and Tikal . Among the best preserved murals are a full @-@ size series of Late Classic paintings at <unk> . 
 Flint , chert , and obsidian all served utilitarian purposes in Maya culture , but many pieces were finely crafted into forms that were never intended to be used as tools . Eccentric flints are among the finest lithic artefacts produced by the ancient Maya . They were technically very challenging to produce , requiring considerable skill on the part of the artisan . Large obsidian eccentrics can measure over 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) in length . Their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human , animal and geometric forms associated with Maya religion . Eccentric flints show a great variety of forms , such as crescents , crosses , snakes , and scorpions . The largest and most elaborate examples display multiple human heads , with minor heads sometimes branching off from larger one . 
 Maya textiles are very poorly represented in the archaeological record , although by comparison with other pre @-@ Columbian cultures , such as the Aztecs and the Andean region , it is likely that they were high @-@ value items . A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists , but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media , such as painted murals or ceramics . Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths , generally these would have been cotton , but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown . 
 Ceramics are the most commonly surviving type of Maya art . The Maya had no knowledge of the potter 's wheel , and Maya vessels were built up by coiling rolled strips of clay into the desired form . Maya pottery was not glazed , although it often had a fine finish produced by burnishing . Maya ceramics were painted with clay slips blended with minerals and coloured clays . Ancient Maya firing techniques have yet to be replicated . A quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from Late Classic tombs on Jaina Island , in northern Yucatán . They stand from between 10 to 25 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 to 9 @.@ 8 in ) high and were hand modelled , with exquisite detail . The Ik @-@ style polychrome ceramic corpus , including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels , originated in Late Classic Motul de San José . It includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks . One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life . The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD , such as diplomatic meetings , feasting , bloodletting , scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war . 
 Bone , both human and animal , was also sculpted ; human bones may have been trophies , or relics of ancestors . The Maya valued Spondylus shells , and worked them to remove the white exterior and spines , to reveal the fine orange interior . Around the 10th century AD , metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America , and the Maya began to make small objects in gold , silver and copper . The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads , bells , and disks . In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest , the Maya began to use the lost @-@ wax method to cast small metal pieces . 
 One poorly studied area of Maya folk art is graffiti . Additional graffiti , not part of the planned decoration , was incised into the stucco of interior walls , floors , and benches , in a wide variety of buildings , including temples , residences , and storerooms . Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites , particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche , and the Chenes region of northwestern Yucatán . At Tikal , where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded , the subject matter includes drawings of temples , people , deities , animals , banners , litters , and thrones . Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly , with drawings overlapping each other , and display a mix of crude , untrained art , and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic @-@ period artistic conventions . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Maya produced a vast array of structures , and have left an extensive architectural legacy that places the Maya civilization as one of the great preindustrial civilizations of the world . Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts . Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialisation in Maya society , centralised organisation and the political means to mobilise a large workforce . It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copán required an estimated 10 @,@ 686 man @-@ days to build , which compares to 67 @-@ man @-@ days for a commoner 's hut . It is further estimated that 65 % of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying , transporting , and finishing of the stone used in construction , and 24 % of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestone @-@ based plaster . Altogether , it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copán , using between 80 and 130 full @-@ time labourers . A Classic @-@ period city like Tikal was spread over 20 square kilometres ( 7 @.@ 7 sq mi ) , with an urban core covering 6 square kilometres ( 2 @.@ 3 sq mi ) . The labour required to build such a city was immense , running into many millions of man @-@ days . The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period . Craft specialisation would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by the Late Preclassic , and would have required planners and architects . 
 = = = Urban design = = = 
 Maya cities were not formally planned , and were subject to irregular expansion , with the haphazard addition of palaces , temples and other buildings . Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core , and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture . Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes . The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts , sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls . These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities , such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes . Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty . City centres also featured plazas , sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools . Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city . Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city , which served as sacred centres for non @-@ royal lineages . The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages . The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art . 
 The ceremonial centre of the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived , and where the administrative functions of the city were performed , together with religious ceremonies . It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities . Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre , while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre . Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters . 
 = = = Building materials and methods = = = 
 The Maya built their cities with Neolithic technology ; they built their structures from both perishable materials and from stone . The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources , and this also affected the building style . Across a broad swathe of the Maya area , limestone was immediately available . The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut , but hardens with exposure . There was great variety in the quality of limestone , with good @-@ quality stone available in the Usumacinta region ; in the northern Yucatán , the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality . Volcanic tuff was used at Copán , and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone . In <unk> , where suitable stone was not available locally , fired bricks were employed . Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement , plaster , and stucco . Lime @-@ based cement was used to seal stonework in place , and stone blocks were fashioned using rope @-@ and @-@ water abrasion , and with obsidian tools . The Maya did not employ a functional wheel , so all loads were transported on litters , barges , or rolled on logs . Heavy loads were lifted with rope , but probably without employing pulleys . 
 Wood was used for beams , and for lintels , even in masonry structures . Throughout Maya history , common huts and some temples continued to be built from wooden poles and thatch . Adobe was also applied ; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven @-@ stick walls of huts . Like wood and thatch , adobe was used throughout Maya history , even after the development of masonry structures . In the southern Maya area , adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available . 
 = = = Principal construction types = = = 
 The great cities of the Maya civilization were composed of pyramid temples , palaces , ballcourts , <unk> ( causeways ) , patios and plazas . Some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls . The exteriors of most buildings were painted , either in one or multiple colours , or with imagery . Many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs . 
 = = = = Palaces and acropoleis = = = = 
 These complexes were usually located in the site core , beside a principal plaza . Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a <unk> range structure . The term acropolis , in a Maya context , refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height . Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds . They generally extended horizontally as opposed to the towering Maya pyramids , and often had restricted access . Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported roof combs . Rooms often had stone benches , used for sleeping , and holes indicate where curtains once hung . Large palaces , such as at Palenque , could be fitted with a water supply , and sweat baths were often found within the complex , or nearby . During the Early Classic , rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex . Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms ; in the royal palace of Palenque there were a number of throne rooms that were used for important events , including the inauguration of new kings . 
 Palaces are usually arranged around one or more courtyards , with their façades facing inwards ; some examples are adorned with sculpture . Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers . There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences , and that a range of courtly activities took place in them , including audiences , formal receptions , and important rituals . 
 = = = = Pyramids and temples = = = = 
 Temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as k 'uh nah , meaning " god 's house " . Temples were raised on platforms , most often upon a pyramid . The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms . By the Late Preclassic period , their walls were of stone , and the development of the corbel arch allowed stone roofs to replace thatch . By the Classic period , temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art . The temple shrine contained between one and three rooms , and were dedicated to important deities . Such a deity might be one of the patron gods of the city , or a deified ancestor . In general , freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors . 
 = = = = E @-@ Groups and observatories = = = = 
 The Maya were keen observers of the sun , stars , and planets . E @-@ Groups were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region ; they take their names from Group E at Uaxactun . They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure , and were used to mark the solstices and equinoxes . The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period . The Lost World complex at Tikal started out as an E @-@ Group built towards the end of the Middle Preclassic . Due to its nature , the basic layout of an E @-@ Group was constant . A structure was built on the west side of a plaza ; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions . It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side . From the west pyramid , the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and equinoxes . E @-@ Groups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium ; not all were properly aligned as observatories , and their function may have been symbolic . 
 As well as E @-@ Groups , the Maya built other structures dedicated to observing the movements of celestial bodies . Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies , including the planet Venus , and various constellations . The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi @-@ level edifice , with a conical superstructure . It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus . At Copán , a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position of the setting sun at the equinoxes . 
 = = = = Triadic pyramids = = = = 
 Triadic pyramids first appeared in the Preclassic . They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward @-@ facing buildings , all mounted upon a single basal platform . The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin ; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV , the largest pyramid at Tikal . The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform . No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known , but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E @-@ Group complexes . The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic . Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites . At Nakbe , there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature . At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures . Examples of the triadic form are even known from <unk> in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula , and Q 'umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala . The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built ; it continued in use into the Classic Period , with later examples being found at Uaxactun , Caracol , Seibal , Nakum , Tikal and Palenque . The Q 'umarkaj example is the only one that has been dated to the Postclassic Period . The triple @-@ temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 The ballcourt is a distinctive pan @-@ Mesoamerican form of architecture . Although the majority of Maya ballcourts date to the Classic period , the earliest examples appeared around 1000 BC in northwestern Yucatán , during the Middle Preclassic . By the time of Spanish contact , ballcourts were only in use in the Guatemalan Highlands , at cities such as Q 'umarkaj and Iximche . Throughout Maya history , ballcourts maintained a characteristic form consisting of an ɪ shape , with a central playing area terminating in two transverse end zones . The central playing area usually measures between 20 and 30 metres ( 66 and 98 ft ) long , and is flanked by two lateral structures that stood up to 3 or 4 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 or 13 @.@ 1 ft ) high . The lateral platforms often supported structures that may have held privileged spectators . The Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza is the largest in Mesoamerica , measuring 83 metres ( 272 ft ) long by 30 metres ( 98 ft ) wide , with walls standing 8 @.@ 2 metres ( 27 ft ) high . 
 = = = Regional architectural styles = = = 
 Although Maya cities shared many common features , there was considerable variation in architectural style . Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials , climate , topography , and local preferences . In the Late Classic , these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles . 
 = = = = Central Petén = = = = 
 The central Petén style of architecture is modelled after the great city of Tikal . The style is characterised by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb , and accessed by a single doorway . Additional features are the use of stela @-@ altar pairings , and the decoration of architectural façades , lintels , and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods . One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I. Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include <unk> Ha , Calakmul , <unk> , Ixkun , Nakum , Naranjo , and Yaxhá . 
 = = = = Puuc = = = = 
 The exemplar of Puuc @-@ style architecture is Uxmal . The style developed in the Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán ; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula . Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement , resulting in stronger walls , and also strengthened their corbel arches ; this allowed Puuc @-@ style cities to build freestanding entrance archways . The upper façades of buildings were decorated with <unk> stones mosaic @-@ fashion , erected as facing over the core , forming elaborate compositions of long @-@ nosed deities such as the rain god <unk> and the Principal Bird Deity . The motifs also included geometric patterns , lattices and spools , possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca , outside the Maya area . In contrast , the lower façades were left undecorated . Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites . 
 = = = = Chenes = = = = 
 The Chenes style is very similar to the Puuc style , but predates the use of the mosaic façades of the Puuc region . It featured fully adorned façades on both the upper and lower sections of structures . Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities , identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm . Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels . The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula , although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula . Examples of Chenes sites include <unk> , <unk> , Santa Rosa <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = = = Río Bec = = = = 
 The Río Bec style forms a sub @-@ region of the Chenes style , and also features elements of the Central Petén style , such as prominent roof combs . Its palaces are distinctive for their false @-@ tower decorations , lacking interior rooms , with steep , almost vertical , stairways and false doors . These towers were adorned with deity masks , and were built to impress the viewer , rather than serve any practical function . Such false towers are only found in the Río Bec region . Río Bec sites include <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = = = Usumacinta = = = = 
 The Usumacinta style developed in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage . Cities took advantage of the hillsides to support their major architecture , as at Palenque and Yaxchilan . Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples . As in Petén , roof combs adorned principal structures . Palaces had multiple entrances that used post @-@ and @-@ lintel entrances rather than corbel vaulting . Many sites erected stelae , but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings . 
 = = Language = = 
 Before 2000 BC , the Maya spoke a single language , dubbed proto @-@ Mayan by linguists . Linguistic analysis of reconstructed Proto @-@ Mayan vocabulary suggests that the original Proto @-@ Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands , although the evidence is not conclusive . Proto @-@ Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups that make up the family , including Huastecan , Greater K 'iche 'an , Greater Q 'anjobalan , Mamean , Tz <unk> @-@ Ch 'olan , and Yucatecan . These groups diverged further during the pre @-@ Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times . The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as Ch 'olan ; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu , in the highlands , also appears to be in , or related to , Ch 'olan . The use of Ch 'olan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to Medieval Latin as a ritual or prestige language . Classic Ch 'olan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite , used in inter @-@ polity communication such as diplomacy and trade . By the Postclassic period , Yucatec was also being written in Maya codices alongside Ch 'olan . 
 = = Writing and literacy = = 
 The Maya writing system is one of the outstanding achievements of the pre @-@ Columbian inhabitants of the Americas . It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system of more than a dozen systems that developed in Mesoamerica . The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300 – 200 BC , in the Petén Basin . However , this is preceded by several other Mesoamerican writing systems , such as the Epi @-@ Olmec and Zapotec scripts . Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD , or early 2nd century . Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem . By about AD 250 , the Maya script had become a more formalised and consistent writing system . 
 The Catholic Church and colonial officials , notably Bishop Diego de Landa , destroyed Maya texts wherever they found them , and with them the knowledge of Maya writing , but by chance three uncontested pre @-@ Columbian books dated to the Postclassic period have been preserved . These are known as the Madrid Codex , the Dresden Codex and the Paris Codex . A few pages survive from a fourth , the Grolier Codex , whose authenticity is disputed . Archaeology conducted at Maya sites often reveals other fragments , rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which were codices ; these tantalizing remains are , however , too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived , most of the organic material having decayed . In reference to the few extant Maya writings , Michael D. Coe , a prominent archaeologist at Yale University , stated : 
 [ O ] ur knowledge of ancient Maya thought must represent only a tiny fraction of the whole picture , for of the thousands of books in which the full extent of their learning and ritual was recorded , only four have survived to modern times ( as though all that posterity knew of ourselves were to be based upon three prayer books and ' Pilgrim 's Progress ' ) . 
 Most surviving pre @-@ Columbian Maya writing dates to the Classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from Maya sites , such as stelae , or on ceramics vessels . Other media include the aforementioned codices , stucco façades , frescoes , wooden lintels , cave walls , and portable artefacts crafted from a variety of materials , including bone , shell , obsidian , and jade . 
 = = = Writing system = = = 
 The Maya writing system ( often called hieroglyphs from a superficial resemblance to the Ancient Egyptian writing ) is a logosyllabic writing system , combining a syllabary of phonetic signs representing syllables with logogram representing entire words . Among the writing systems of the Pre @-@ Columbian New World , Maya script most closely represents the spoken language . At any one time , no more than around 500 glyphs were in use , some 200 of which ( including variations ) were phonetic . 
 The Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans , its use peaking during the Classic Period . In excess of 10 @,@ 000 individual texts have been recovered , mostly inscribed on stone monuments , lintels , stelae and ceramics . The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree @-@ bark generally now known by its Nahuatl @-@ language name <unk> used to produce codices . The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest . The knowledge was subsequently lost , as a result of the impact of the conquest on Maya society . 
 The decipherment and recovery of the knowledge of Maya writing has been a long and laborious process . Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century , mostly the parts having to do with numbers , the Maya calendar , and astronomy . Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s , and accelerated rapidly thereafter . By the end of the 20th century , scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts , and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content . 
 = = = Hieroglyphic script = = = 
 The basic unit of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block , which transcribes a word or phrase . The block is composed of one or more individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block , with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space . Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern . For ease of reference , epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically , and top to bottom numerically . Thus , any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified : C4 would be third block counting from the left , and the fourth block counting downwards . If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription , column labels are not repeated , rather they continue in the alphabetic series ; if there are more than 26 columns , the labelling continues as A ' , B ' , etc . <unk> row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text . 
 Although hieroglyphic text may be laid out in varying manners , generally text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks . The reading order of text starts at the top left ( block A1 ) , continues to the second block in the double @-@ column ( B1 ) , then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column ( A2 ) , and thus continues in zig @-@ zag fashion . Once the bottom is reached , the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column . Where an inscription ends in a single ( unpaired ) column , this final column is usually read straight downwards . 
 Individual glyph blocks may be composed of a number of elements . These consist of the main sign , and any affixes . Main signs represent the major element of the block , and may be a noun , verb , adverb , adjective , or phonetic sign . Some main signs are abstract , some are pictures of the object they represent , and others are " head variants " , personifications of the word they represent . Affixes are smaller rectangular elements , usually attached to a main sign , although a block may be composed entirely of affixes . Affixes may represent a wide variety of speech elements , including nouns , verbs , verbal suffixes , prepositions , pronouns , and more . Small sections of a main sign could be used to represent the whole main sign , and Maya scribes were highly inventive in their usage and adaptation of glyph elements . 
 = = = Writing tools = = = 
 Although the archaeological record does not provide examples of brushes or pens , analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair . A Classic period sculpture from Copán , Honduras , depicts a scribe with an <unk> fashioned from a conch shell . Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes , including palettes and mortars and pestles . 
 = = = Scribes and literacy = = = 
 Commoners were illiterate ; scribes were drawn from the elite . It is not known if all members of the aristocracy could read and write , although at least some women could , since there are representations of female scribes in Maya art . Maya scribes were called aj tz 'ib , meaning " one who writes or paints " . There were probably scribal schools where members of the aristocracy were taught to write . Scribal activity is identifiable in the archaeological record ; Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I , king of Tikal , was interred with his paint pot . Some junior members of the Copán royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements . A palace at Copán has been identified as that of a noble lineage of scribes ; it is decorated with sculpture that includes figures holding ink pots . 
 Although not much is known about Maya scribes , some did sign their work , both on ceramics and on stone sculpture . Usually , only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel , but multiple sculptors are known to have recorded their names on stone sculpture ; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras . However , most works remained unsigned by their artists . 
 = = Mathematics = = 
 In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations , the Maya used a base 20 ( vigesimal ) system . The bar @-@ and @-@ dot counting system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC ; the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic , and added the symbol for zero . This may have been the earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide , although it may have been predated by the Babylonian system . The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD . In its earliest uses , the zero served as a place holder , indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count . This later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation , and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years , until its use was extinguished by the Spanish . 
 The basic number system consists of a dot to represent one , and a bar to represent five . By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero ; during the Classic period other glyphs were used . The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 using a combination of these symbols . The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position ; as a numeral shifted upwards , its basic value multiplied by twenty . In this way , the lowest symbol would represent units , the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty , and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400 , and so on . For example , the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level , four dots on the next level up , and two dots on the next level after that , to give <unk> , plus <unk> , plus <unk> . Using this system , the Maya were able to record huge numbers . Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column .
