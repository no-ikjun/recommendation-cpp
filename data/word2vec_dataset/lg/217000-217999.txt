 In the 1880s , despite the return of gold to commerce nationwide with the resumption of specie payments at the end of 1878 , few three @-@ dollar pieces were coined . There was a small speculative boom by the public in putting aside three @-@ dollar pieces ; nevertheless , thousands remained at the Philadelphia Mint . Few were sent to banks ; the coins sold for a small premium when banks had some or when they were purchased from exchange brokers . The coins ' main use was as gifts , or in jewelry . The pieces were struck only at Philadelphia after the 1870 @-@ S rarity , and early numismatist S.H. Chapman noted of the 1879 through 1889 issues , " of the later years of the $ 3 , large numbers were remelted at the Philadelphia Mint . " The Mint apparently favored certain Philadelphia dealers in the distribution of the gold dollar , but the three @-@ dollar piece could be obtained without a premium at the cashier 's window of the Philadelphia Mint . Large numbers of the 1879 three @-@ dollar piece ( mintage 3 @,@ 000 for circulation ) , 1880 ( 1 @,@ 000 ) , and 1881 ( 500 ) were hoarded by early coin collector and dealer Thomas L. Elder , who asked bank tellers to look out for them . Elder could not have obtained them directly from the Mint at the time of issue as he was still a child in 1880 , and did not begin collecting coins until 1887 . 
 With the rise of collecting interest in the three @-@ dollar piece in the 1880s , unscrupulous employees at the Philadelphia Mint enriched themselves by illicit striking of earlier @-@ date pieces , including the 1873 , 1875 , and 1876 . Bowers , in his <unk> of the Bass Collection , particularly blames these irregularities on Oliver Bosbyshell , chief coiner at Philadelphia from 1876 to 1885 . During that period , quantities of pattern coins , restrikes , and pieces struck in different metals flowed to well @-@ connected collectors and dealers , and Bosbyshell sold a large personal collection of such pieces shortly after leaving office as chief coiner . Although Bosbyshell returned as Philadelphia Mint superintendent from 1889 to 1894 , he does not appear to have resumed his illicit activities . 
 The relatively large mintage of about 6 @,@ 000 in 1887 was due to a fad sweeping the country whereby men would present their lady friends with a coin with one side ground off and replaced by the woman 's initials . Many wealthy suitors preferred to use a gold coin for this presentation . A larger @-@ than @-@ usual number of proof pieces were struck in 1888 and held by the Mint in anticipation of future trades with collectors for items which the Mint desired for its coin collection . The 1888 piece is the most common proof coin in the series , with an official mintage of 200 pieces . 
 In 1889 , Mint Director James P. Kimball sent a letter to the House of Representatives Committee on Coinage , Weights , and Measures urging the abolition of the three @-@ dollar piece . Kimball wrote , " this is a denomination which serves no useful purpose , its present coinage being in fact limited to its production for cabinet [ coin collecting ] purposes . The value of over $ 153 @,@ 000 in three @-@ dollar pieces still on hand at the Mint at Philadelphia can not be disposed of , owing to the unpopularity of this coin as a circulating medium . " The gold dollar and three @-@ dollar piece were not coined after 1889 , and were abolished by Congress on September 26 , 1890 . 
 In the 1890s , 49 @,@ 087 three @-@ dollar pieces were melted as obsolete at the Philadelphia Mint . Although no list was kept by years , Bowers suggests that many of the pieces were dated 1874 or 1878 ( both years with relatively high mintages ) , or were from the final years of the series . In the 1890s , they typically commanded a premium of 25 or 50 cents at exchange brokers . In the 1920s , three @-@ dollar pieces sold at a premium when other denominations of gold coinage remained at face value . The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman 's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1854 as the cheapest three @-@ dollar piece in the lowest listed condition ( Very Fine or MS @-@ 20 ) at $ 825 . An 1855 @-@ S in proof is the record holder in sales price for the denomination , selling at auction in 2011 for $ 1 @,@ 322 @,@ 500 . 
 In 1934 , Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross wrote in her annual report that a total of 539 @,@ 792 three @-@ dollar pieces had been coined , of which 452 @,@ 572 were struck at Philadelphia , 62 @,@ 350 at San Francisco ( not including the 1870 @-@ S ) , 24 @,@ 000 at New Orleans , and 1 @,@ 120 at Dahlonega . According to Breen , three @-@ dollar pieces " represent relics of an interesting but abortive experiment ; today they are among the most highly coveted of American gold coins " . New York coin dealer Norman Stack stated in the 1950s , " All are rare . There is no such thing as a common three @-@ dollar gold piece . " 
 = Johnson Creek ( Willamette River ) = 
 Johnson Creek is a 25 @-@ mile ( 40 km ) tributary of the Willamette River in the Portland metropolitan area of the U.S. state of Oregon . Part of the drainage basin of the Columbia River , its watershed consists of 54 square miles ( 140 km2 ) of mostly urban land occupied by about 180 @,@ 000 people as of 2012 . Passing through the cities of Gresham , Portland , and Milwaukie , the creek flows generally west from the foothills of the Cascade Range through sediments deposited by glacial floods on a substrate of basalt . Though polluted , it is free @-@ flowing along its main stem and provides habitat for salmon and other migrating fish . 
 Prior to European settlement , the watershed was heavily forested and was used by Native Americans of the Chinook band for fishing and hunting . In the 19th century , white settlers cleared much of the land for farming , and the stream is named for one of these newcomers , William Johnson , who in 1846 built a water @-@ powered sawmill along the creek . By the early 20th century , a rail line parallel to the stream encouraged further residential and commercial development . As urban density increased in the floodplain , seasonal floods grew more damaging . In the 1930s the Works Progress Administration of the federal government lined the lower 15 miles ( 24 km ) of Johnson Creek with rock to control the floods . Despite this , the creek flooded 37 times between 1941 and 2006 . Since the 1990s , regional planners have tried to reduce flooding by controlling stormwater runoff , creating stream meanders , reducing erosion , replacing impervious surfaces , and protecting riparian buffers . 
 The Johnson Creek watershed includes the subwatersheds of Badger Creek , Sunshine Creek , Kelley Creek , Mitchell Creek , Veterans Creek , Crystal Springs Creek , and smaller streams . Parks along the creek and its tributaries include natural areas , a wildlife refuge , a rhododendron garden , a botanical garden , and a 21 @-@ mile ( 34 km ) bicycle and pedestrian rail trail that follows the creek for much of its length . 
 = = Course = = 
 Johnson Creek begins near the unincorporated community of Cottrell , in Clackamas County , Oregon , southeast of Gresham in the foothills of the Cascade Range , and flows generally westward about 25 miles ( 40 km ) to its confluence with the Willamette River , a major tributary of the Columbia River . The creek passes through the cities of Gresham , Portland , and Milwaukie and crosses the border between Clackamas County and Multnomah County eight times . 
 For much of its course , the creek flows at almost right angles to the numbered avenues of southeast Portland and its eastern suburbs . As the creek descends , so do the avenue numbers . The creek begins in uplands in Clackamas County east of Southeast 362nd Avenue and flows swiftly to the west for about 5 miles ( 8 km ) , crisscrossing the border between Clackamas County and Multnomah County 5 times in this upstream stretch , and passing under U.S. Route 26 , the Mount Hood Highway , in Multnomah County at about 20 miles ( 32 km ) from the mouth . Shortly thereafter , it receives Badger Creek and Sunshine Creek from the left and the North Fork of Johnson Creek from the right . 
 Turning sharply , Johnson Creek flows swiftly northwest for about 3 miles ( 5 km ) , entering Gresham and shortly thereafter passing the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) gauge at Regner Road , 16 @.@ 2 miles ( 26 @.@ 1 km ) from the mouth . Soon the creek enters Main City Park in Gresham , where it again turns sharply and flows slightly south of west . Here the slope flattens , and the stream runs more slowly for the next third of its course . Slightly west of Main City Park , it passes the Gresham Pioneer Cemetery . Just beyond the cemetery , it receives Butler Creek on the left , enters Portland at about 13 miles ( 21 km ) from the mouth , and receives Kelley Creek on the left shortly thereafter . Mitchell Creek , a major tributary of Kelley Creek , enters Kelley Creek about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) south of Johnson Creek . Shortly thereafter , Johnson Creek passes the USGS gauge station at Sycamore , 10 @.@ 2 miles ( 16 @.@ 4 km ) from the mouth , and flows under Cedar Crossing Bridge . 
 Meandering slowly through the Lents neighborhood of Portland , Johnson Creek receives Veterans Creek , which enters on the left from its headwaters in Happy Valley in Clackamas County . Johnson Creek passes under Interstate 205 , and shortly thereafter begins to flow more swiftly again at Southeast 82nd Avenue , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) from the mouth . It then makes its sixth and seventh county @-@ border crossings , dipping briefly into Clackamas County and back north into Multnomah County , and then runs near the border between Portland and Milwaukie along Johnson Creek Boulevard for about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) . After passing under Oregon Route 99E ( Southeast McLoughlin Boulevard ) in Portland 's Sellwood neighborhood , the creek turns sharply south about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the mouth . 
 At Southeast 21st Avenue , it receives Crystal Springs Creek , which enters on the right . This tributary , 2 @.@ 7 miles ( 4 @.@ 3 km ) long , begins on the Reed College campus , flows under the Blue Bridge in Reed Canyon , through the Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden , and generally south to Johnson Creek . From its confluence with Crystal Springs Creek , Johnson Creek flows south about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , crossing the county border for the eighth and final time . After re @-@ entering Clackamas County , it passes the USGS gauge station at Milwaukie , 0 @.@ 7 miles ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) from the mouth . Shortly thereafter , Johnson Creek empties into the Willamette River 18 @.@ 5 miles ( 29 @.@ 8 km ) above its confluence with the Columbia River , which in turn flows about another 100 miles ( 160 km ) to the Pacific Ocean at Astoria . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 = = = Geology and topography = = = 
 The floodplain of Johnson Creek is a remnant of large glacial floods known as the Missoula Floods that deposited thick sediments between 18 @,@ 000 and 13 @,@ 000 years ago in the Columbia River Basin , including much of the Willamette Valley . Underlying the sediments are substantial thicknesses of basalt lavas from the Columbia River Basalt Group . The lava , exposed mainly in the uplands , has been folded and faulted to form a series of sub @-@ basins , including the Johnson Creek watershed . 
 The watershed is a roughly rectangular area of about 54 square miles ( 140 km2 ) . The topography of the watershed varies greatly from the high point of about 1 @,@ 100 feet ( 335 m ) above sea level in the Boring Hills near the creek 's source to the low point of 26 feet ( 8 m ) where the creek meets the Willamette River . 
 Slopes in the watershed range generally between 1 and 25 percent . Mount Scott and Powell Butte rise to about 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 305 m ) and have slopes ranging from 10 to 30 percent . Gresham Butte and Hogan Butte , in Gresham , have the steepest slopes , including a few around 50 percent . The Boring Hills , of volcanic origin , rise more than 800 feet ( 244 m ) higher than the terraces to the north and west . The Kelso Slope , a northwest @-@ sloping dissected surface west of the canyon of the Sandy River , tilts down from about 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 305 m ) above sea level near Sandy to about 400 feet ( 122 m ) above sea level east of Gresham . 
 Formed by the ancestral Columbia and Willamette Rivers , the terraces north of Johnson Creek are generally underlain by permeable sand and gravel . Three isolated hills — Rocky Butte , Mount Tabor , and Kelly Butte — rise about 200 to 400 feet ( 61 to 122 m ) above the surrounding terraces . Except for Powell Butte , the terrain on the creek 's north side is less steep than on the south side , which includes Mount Scott and the Boring Lava Domes . 
 The eastern half of the watershed is more open and rural than the urban western half , which consists largely of residential areas with pockets of commerce and industry . An estimated 180 @,@ 000 people lived in the watershed as of 2012 . 
 = = = Soils = = = 
 The potential for soil erosion varies throughout the watershed . Erosion is not a big threat in the northwestern part of the watershed , where the land is flat and developed , or in the northeast , dominated by low @-@ erosion soils . In the southeast , soils have a medium risk of erosion , and soils around Powell Butte and the Boring Lava Domes have " an extremely high <unk> factor and are sensitive to ground disturbance " . 
 The watershed 's soils vary in their permeability and ability to retain water . Clays that do not absorb much water dominate the eastern end of the watershed and the lands south of the creek . Northern areas of the watershed tend to be porous and less prone to rapid runoff . 
 = = = Hydrology = = = 
 The watershed can be divided into two hydrologic areas with different infiltration rates . The northern area , comprising about 40 percent of the watershed , consists of the Portland Terraces , and the southern consists of the Boring Hills and the Kelso Slope . Most of the rain that falls on the northern area percolates into the ground , and most of the rain that falls on the southern area runs quickly into the creek or its tributaries . Rain that falls on the north generally has a more gradual , longer @-@ lasting effect , sustaining the base flow of the creek during dry periods . 
 About 40 percent of the tributaries that originally flowed over the surface of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development , especially on the north side of the main stem . Generally , the remaining free @-@ flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north ; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek , which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south . The other major tributaries are Hogan , Kelley , Butler , Sunshine , and Badger creeks . Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries . 
 Fill at Foster Road and Southeast 111th Avenue usually prevents stormwater runoff from a 9 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 23 km2 ) area of the watershed in the Lents and <unk> @-@ Gilbert neighborhoods from flowing directly into the creek . Instead , runoff is routed to sumps , where it percolates into the ground . Normal drainage patterns have also been altered further downstream in the Sellwood , <unk> , Westmoreland , and Woodstock neighborhoods , where runoff flows into the Portland sewer system instead of into the creek . 
 = = = Jurisdiction = = = 
 Six local political jurisdictions overlap with the Johnson Creek watershed . In 2000 , 38 percent of the watershed was in Portland 's city limits , 24 percent in unincorporated Clackamas County , 23 percent in Gresham , 11 percent in unincorporated Multnomah County , 4 percent in Milwaukie , and 0 @.@ 1 percent in Happy Valley . None of the cities lies entirely within the watershed . In 2000 , Johnson Creek and its tributaries drained 53 percent of Gresham , 42 percent of Milwaukie , 19 percent of Happy Valley , and 14 percent of Portland . The watershed covered only 1 @.@ 2 percent of unincorporated Multnomah County and less than 1 percent of unincorporated Clackamas County . 
 Neighboring watersheds on the east side of the Willamette River include Mount Scott Creek and Kellogg Creek , which flow through Milwaukie and drain directly into the Willamette ; the Clackamas River , which drains the southeast suburbs and empties into the Willamette near Oregon City ; the Sandy River , which drains the eastern suburbs and empties into the Columbia ; and Fairview Creek and the Columbia Slough , which drain north Portland and Gresham , emptying into the Columbia . 
 Nineteenth @-@ century maps also show numerous springs and small streams flowing into a wetland that covered an area of today 's southeast Portland between Powell Boulevard ( U.S. Route 26 ) and Johnson Creek , a distance of 2 @.@ 25 miles ( 3 @.@ 62 km ) . Though most of the wetland complex has been filled in and built upon , remnants exist at the Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden on Crystal Springs Creek . Old maps also show two streams flowing into a slough that drained part of the wetland . One flowed through the Clinton Street neighborhood , about six city blocks north of Powell Boulevard , and the other drained the Colonial Heights neighborhood , slightly further north near Ladd 's Addition . These streams and most others in this area were diverted into the city sewer system and no longer appear on the surface . A Johnson Creek near Hoyt Arboretum on the west side of the Willamette River in Portland has no relationship to the Johnson Creek on the east side . 
 = = = Volunteer group = = = 
 The Johnson Creek Watershed Council ( <unk> ) is a nonprofit group organized in 1995 to protect the creek and its watershed . Its projects involve such things as controlling invasive species , planting native riparian vegetation , improving fish passage , and creating off @-@ channel flood storage . The council is heavily dependent on volunteers . In 2011 alone , more than a thousand volunteers donated 5 @,@ 500 hours of their time to <unk> activities . 
 = = = Annual report card = = = 
 In 2015 , Portland 's Bureau of Environmental Services ( BES ) began issuing annual " report cards " for watersheds or fractions thereof that lie within the city . BES assigns grades for each of four categories : hydrology , water quality , habitat , and fish and wildlife . Hydrology grades depend on the amount of pavement and other impervious surfaces in the watershed and to what degree its streams flow freely , not dammed or diverted . Water @-@ quality grades are based on measurements of dissolved oxygen , E @-@ coli bacteria , temperature , suspended solids , and substances such as mercury and phosphorus . Habitat ranking depends on the condition of stream banks and floodplains , riparian zones , tree canopies , and other variables . The fish and wildlife assessment includes birds , fish , and macroinvertebrates . In 2015 , the BES grades for Johnson Creek are hydrology , B + ; water quality , C + ; habitat , C , and fish and wildlife , D + . 
 = = History = = 
 Before settlers moved into the basin , it consisted mainly of upland and wetland forests in which Native Americans fished , hunted , and foraged . Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon Cascade Range as early as 10 @,@ 000 years ago . By 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 years ago , settlements in the Clackamas River basin , adjacent to the Johnson Creek watershed , had moved to the river 's lower floodplain . The area was the home of the Clackamas Indians , a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean . The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to its confluence with the Columbia River and reached into the foothills of the Cascades . When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806 , the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1 @,@ 800 people living in 11 villages . Epidemics of smallpox , malaria , and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851 , and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands , including Johnson Creek . 
 By the middle of the 19th century , the European American newcomers had begun to remove vegetation , build sawmills , fell trees , fill wetlands , and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek . The creek is named for one of these newcomers , William Johnson , who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water @-@ powered sawmill . In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb , who would later found Milwaukie , filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River . In 1886 , plans were made for train tracks along the creek . In 1903 , the Springwater Division Line , also known as the Portland Traction Company Line , the Cazadero Line , and the <unk> Line , was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight . Sellwood , <unk> , Lents , and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line . By the 1920s , housing began to replace creekside farms . 
 = = Floods = = 
 By removing the original vegetation , rural and urban development of the Johnson Creek watershed induced more rapid storm runoff and expensive floods . As a flood @-@ control measure in the 1930s , the Works Progress Administration of the federal government cleared and lined with rock about 90 percent of the creek between its mouth and Southeast 158th Avenue , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) from the mouth , creating an artificial channel 6 feet ( 2 m ) to 10 feet ( 3 m ) deep and 25 feet ( 8 m ) to 50 feet ( 15 m ) wide . Although substantially altering the stream and its aquatic life , this channel failed to prevent overflows , the largest of which damaged 1 @,@ 200 structures in 1964 . 
 Precipitation patterns in the Johnson Creek watershed have contributed to frequent high flows and floods along the creek , typically between November and February . Based on records from 1961 to 1990 , Portland 's average annual precipitation , as measured at Portland International Airport along the Columbia River , is about 36 inches ( 910 mm ) . About 21 inches ( 530 mm ) falls from November through February and only about 5 inches ( 130 mm ) from June through September . The airport , at about 30 feet ( 9 m ) above sea level , is at essentially the same elevation as the mouth of Johnson Creek . Annual precipitation at higher elevations in the creek 's upper watershed is much higher , more than 70 inches ( 1 @,@ 800 mm ) . 
 The floods primarily affect four areas in Portland : Tideman Johnson Natural Area at Southeast 45th Avenue , the area west of Southeast 82nd Avenue ; Lents , and lower Powell Butte . The U.S. National Weather Service defines Johnson Creek 's flood stage , measured at USGS station <unk> at Sycamore in Portland , as 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) , equivalent to a flow rate ( discharge rate ) of about 1 @,@ 200 cubic feet ( 34 m3 ) per second . The USGS peak streamflow data collected by the stream gauge at that station show that the creek reached or exceeded 1 @,@ 200 cubic feet ( 34 m3 ) per second 37 times between 1941 and 2006 ; that is 37 floods in 65 years . Twenty of those floods exceeded 1 @,@ 500 cubic feet ( 42 m3 ) per second . At least seven of the floods caused major property damage . A more recent overflow occurred in December 2007 , when the creek crested at 1 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) above flood stage . Between 1978 and 1997 , flood insurance claims totaling an estimated $ 2 million were paid for damage along the creek . 
 The biggest flood measured at Sycamore , 10 @.@ 2 miles ( 16 @.@ 4 km ) from the mouth of the creek , occurred in 2015 . Exceeding the official flood stage of 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) by more than 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) , the creek reached 15 @.@ 33 feet ( 4 @.@ 67 m ) on December 7 of that year . The second highest level , 15 @.@ 30 feet ( 4 @.@ 66 m ) , occurred in November 1996 , followed by the Christmas flood of 1964 on December 22 , when the creek reached 14 @.@ 68 feet ( 4 @.@ 47 m ) at Sycamore . 
 As of 2008 , the USGS was monitoring Johnson Creek at Regner Road in Gresham , 16 @.@ 3 miles ( 26 @.@ 2 km ) from the mouth , and at Milwaukie , 0 @.@ 7 miles ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) from the mouth , as well as at Sycamore . It also had stream @-@ monitor stations on Kelley Creek and Crystal Springs Creek . The Sycamore station was the oldest , having begun operation in 1941 . 
 Proposals by agencies such as Metro , the regional government of the Portland metropolitan area , and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1970s and 1980s to control Johnson Creek flooding were abandoned after groups of residents objected to every proposal . In 1990 , the City of Portland formed the Johnson Creek Corridor Committee from multiple agencies and citizen groups with varied interests related to the watershed . Led by the city 's Bureau of Environmental Services , the combined groups in 2001 produced the Johnson Creek Restoration Plan to reduce flooding , improve water quality , and improve fish and wildlife habitat . Goals varied from section to section along the creek and included controlling storm water runoff , reducing erosion , replacing or mitigating impervious surfaces , and protecting riparian zones . Through 2007 , at least 75 site @-@ specific restoration projects had been carried out in the Johnson Creek Watershed , ranging from the $ 1 @.@ 2 @-@ million Brookside Project , a constructed wetland , to small riparian repair projects . Most involved voluntary citizen participation in all phases , including the long @-@ term management and care of the sites . In late 2012 , the city completed the East Lents Floodplain Project , which restored 70 acres ( 28 ha ) of the natural floodplain to a low @-@ lying area along the creek . 
 = = Pollution = = 
 The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) rated Johnson Creek 's water quality between 1986 and 1995 as " very poor " . Monitoring the creek 0 @.@ 2 miles ( 0 @.@ 3 km ) from the mouth , it recorded very high concentrations of nitrates and high concentrations of phosphates . Fecal coliform bacteria , total solids , and biochemical oxygen demand also impaired water quality . These conditions occurred throughout the year , and results for each parameter fell into the " very poor " category . On the Oregon Water Quality Index ( OWQI ) used by DEQ , water quality scores can vary from 10 ( worst ) to 100 ( ideal ) . The minimal seasonal average for Johnson Creek on this scale was 26 , the second worst in the lower Willamette basin . By comparison , the minimal seasonal average in the nearby Willamette River at the Hawthorne Bridge in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years . Studies suggest that most pollutants of Johnson Creek do not come from point sources but are washed off urban and rural land surfaces during storms . 
 High temperatures cause problems for aquatic life throughout the watershed . The Oregon standard for maximum temperatures conducive to salmonid rearing in the Willamette Basin is 17 @.@ 8 ° C ( 64 @.@ 0 ° F ) , and data show that the mean maximum summertime temperatures in Johnson Creek exceed this standard . The maximum temperature that Coho salmon can survive for short periods is 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) . <unk> at several locations on Johnson Creek in 1992 recorded maximum average weekly water temperatures higher than 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) in June , July , and August , and an absolute maximum temperature of 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) . 
 Studies conducted by DEQ , USGS , the City of Gresham , and other public agencies have identified DDT ( <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , dieldrin , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) , chlordane , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) as carcinogenic pollutants of Johnson Creek . The creek has been classified as a " waterbody of concern " by the DEQ because of elevated levels of copper , chromium , and nickel in water and sediments . Generally , metal concentrations increase downstream .

 A study conducted in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates , an important source of food for fish and other aquatic life . The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams , Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland , with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks . 
 Most fish species in Johnson Creek tolerate warm water and disturbed conditions . These include red @-@ sided shiners , sculpin , suckers , and speckled dace . 
 Large populations of salmon inhabited the creek before urban construction altered the watershed and the stream channel , and in the 21st century , the creek and its tributaries still provide habitat for smaller numbers of chinook and coho salmon , steelhead , and coastal cutthroat trout . Steelhead populations in Johnson Creek are within the Lower Columbia River steelhead distinct population segment and listed as threatened ( 2011 ) . Chinook and coho salmon are listed as threatened as part of the Lower Columbia River Evolutionary Significant Unit ( 2011 ) .

 Before the area became urban , large mammals including bobcats , black bears , foxes , cougars , wolves , and elk thrived in the area .

Less developed areas support black @-@ tailed deer , coyotes , deer mice , voles , bats , western flycatchers , black @-@ headed grosbeaks , orange @-@ crowned warblers , common mergansers , and woodpeckers . Other wildlife in the watershed include beaver , river otter , freshwater mussels , and bald eagles . Johnson Creek and its watershed are home to life forms that , under Oregon law , have been listed as " sensitive " species . These are naturally reproducing native animals that may become threatened or endangered throughout all or any significant part of their range in Oregon . Such animals known to live in the Johnson Creek watershed include long @-@ toed , northwestern , and Columbia salamanders , red @-@ legged frogs , painted turtles , great horned owls , toads , hawks , and coyotes . A plant found on Powell Butte , tall bugbane ( <unk> elata ) , is also listed as a sensitive species . 
 = = = Vegetation = = = 
 The watershed lies in the Willamette Valley ecoregion designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) . It was covered until the mid @-@ 19th century with Oregon ash , red alder , and western redcedar forests and scattered black cottonwood groves in riparian areas . Douglas @-@ fir and Oregon white oak grew in the uplands . About 57 percent of the watershed is covered with plant life , including grass , trees , and all other forms of vegetation . As of 2000 , about 70 percent of the watershed lay within the urban growth boundary . Of the total land area , 57 percent is single @-@ family residential , 12 percent multi @-@ family , 10 percent commercial , 8 percent rural , and 13 percent parks and open space . In 2000 , of about half of the rural agricultural total in the watershed consisted of cultivated crops or pasture while tree farms and ornamental nurseries made up about 30 percent . 
 Creek restoration projects since the 1990s have reduced the amount of Himalayan blackberry , an invasive species that had come to dominate much of the landscape near the creek . New plantings include native shrubs and trees such as red @-@ osier dogwood , elderberry , Indian plum , and willow . City parks adjacent to Johnson Creek have areas devoted to marsh with shrubs , cattails , and <unk> , forested wetland , riparian woodland , open meadow , and orchard trees .

 By 1960 , use of the rail line along Johnson Creek had declined and passenger service was discontinued . By 1990 the City of Portland bought much of the corridor .

 = = Production = = 
 " Episode 4 " was the first of the series to be written by Robert Engels ; Engels returned to pen a number of other episodes across both seasons . The episode was directed by Tim Hunter , who would also go on to helm " Episode 16 " and " Episode 28 " in the second season . Hunter had known series co @-@ creator David Lynch from their time studying together at the American Film Institute . Engels had been brought on board by the other creative force in the series , Mark Frost , who felt that Engels ' sense of humor would be well @-@ suited to the series ' style . Engels found the pace of the series ' writing to be quite fast , noting that Frost and Lynch would outline the plot of an episode in a matter of hours — Engels had previously been used to spending days at a time working on similar amounts of material with writing crews on other programs . 
 Hunter recalls being pleasantly surprised to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series , having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s . Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance , including a magic trick involving two golf balls , which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode . The character of Gordon Cole , first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call , was conceived as being hard of hearing ; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice , and worked backwards to establish a reason for this . Engels wrote most of Cole 's dialogue over the series , having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing . 
 Engels felt that the three largest influences on the series as a whole were the 1960s television series The Wild Wild West , Mayberry R.F.D. and The Fugitive — the inclusion of a one @-@ armed character in Twin Peaks was a direct homage to the latter of these . Engels has also noted that the series would make use of normal , conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a " familiar " framework , allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop — he particularly cites this episode 's parole hearing for Hank Jennings as an example , as it offers nothing out of the ordinary other than the single domino which Jennings is playing with at all times , drawing attention to the item as it is the only thing which seems out of place . 
 Hunter 's direction in some scenes was inspired by Otto Preminger 's work on the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel . That film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scène ; Hunter found himself using several of Preminger 's techniques to make the most out of several of the episode 's smaller sets such as the RR Diner . Several scenes in the episode were also shot using a split <unk> lens , allowing for a greater depth of field . For example , a scene featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer talking had the actors at either side of a room ; the split <unk> lens allowed for both of them to still be in sharp focus . The episode ends with a shot featuring a Dutch angle ; Hunter was the only director on the series who Frost and Lynch allowed to use this shot , which was otherwise forbidden .

 = Only Happy When It Rains = 
 " Only Happy When It Rains " is a song written and produced by alternative rock group Garbage for the band 's self @-@ titled debut studio album . The song was recorded at the band 's own recording studio , Smart Studios , in Madison , Wisconsin , being mixed twice before its release . The bleak content of the lyrics was intended as a parody of the angst @-@ filled themes present in mid @-@ 1990s alternative rock , as well as a sarcastic reference to Garbage 's own preference for darker themes . 
 " Only Happy When it Rains " was released as the third single from the campaign for Garbage in both the United Kingdom ( in September 1995 ) and North America ( in February 1996 ) , being issued in three formats vinyl , CD maxi , and cassette . The song received positive reviews , praising the production and Shirley Manson 's singing , and became the band 's breakthrough single , charting strongly on both the UK Singles Chart and Billboard Hot 100 . It also crossed over to pop radio formats , propelling their debut album into the Top 100 of the Billboard 200 for the first time , and the song 's music video , directed by Samuel Bayer , received much airplay on MTV . " Only Happy When it Rains " has gone on to be an enduring work for the group , being featured in the video game Guitar Hero 5 and receiving covers by Richard Cheese , Katerina Graham and Metallica . 
 = = Composition and recording = = 
 " Only Happy When It Rains " was written and recorded between March 1994 and May 1995 , with the composition happening in sessions between band members Duke Erikson , Shirley Manson , Steve Marker and Butch Vig in Marker 's basement recording studio , and the recording itself being done at their own Smart Studios in Madison , Wisconsin . Bass on " Only Happy When It Rains " was played by Mike Kashou , and additional percussion by Pauli Ryan . In the latter stages of the album recording , Garbage mixed " Only Happy When It Rains " twice before it was sent for mastering . At the last minute , Vig decided to increase the mix of the guitar tracks louder ; he later claimed that the song still did not sound the way he wanted it to , in his head . The mixing was noted for Manson 's voice being at the same volume level as the instruments , while in mainstream pop the singing is louder than the musical backdrop . The song is written in the key of G # minor , set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute , and the chord progression is G # m – F # – E – C # m – E – F # in the verses and C # -F # -G # -A in the chorus . 
 The song 's bleak lyrics were explained by Marker as a mockery of the angsty " wearing your heart on your sleeve thing " themes prevalent in mid @-@ 1990s alternative rock songs , as well as a self @-@ deprecating reference to Garbage 's own dark lyrics , with Manson explaining that the song was " a dig at ourselves because we like records that don 't make us feel very happy , and at this so @-@ called ' alternative ' scene of ' we 're so weird and more wonderful than everybody else ' " . Vig added that " ' Only Happy When It Rains ' was about what happened with grunge and the angst @-@ filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene . With us there 's self @-@ deprecation , we have to poke fun at ourselves because we 're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics , which makes us filled with self @-@ loathing , <unk> . " Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song " Happy When It Rains " ( 1987 ) and Manson 's own Scottish psyche . Lyrically , Manson described " Only Happy When It Rains " as " about wanting love but knowing life will always get in the way .... yet not being obliterated by that . It 's a song for people that know what it is like to live on the dark side of life . It 's about devotion but a different kind . A devotion to the truth and to freedom ... and to hell with the consequences . " 
 When " Only Happy When It Rains " was to be remastered in 2007 for Garbage 's greatest hits album Absolute Garbage , the song had to be reverse engineered from a damaged backup DAT due to the analog masters for the debut album being lost , resulting in some discernible differences in the remaster .

" At the end of 1995 , Melody Maker rated " Only Happy When It Rains " the 49th best Song of the Year , writing up : " In a year of sunny Britpop , reservoir supplies of ironic bubblegum pop @-@ noir were dangerously low . This burst of mocking <unk> helped " .

 = Hawaii House Bill 444 = 
 House Bill 444 ( abbreviated H.B. 444 ) was a 2009 bill of the Hawaii State Legislature , passed in April 2010 and vetoed by Governor of Hawaii Linda Lingle , that would have legalized civil unions for couples in the state of Hawaii . Its legislative process was accompanied by controversy over the bill 's content and effects and rallies were held by supporters and opponents . 
 The bill passed the Hawaii House of Representatives in February 2009 in a form specific to same @-@ sex couples , was passed in amended form including opposite @-@ sex couples by the Hawaii Senate in May 2009 , and was carried over in the 2010 session , where it passed the Senate again in January 2010 with a veto @-@ proof majority . The bill moved back to the House but was indefinitely postponed by a voice vote initiated by House Speaker Calvin Say , requiring a vote of two @-@ thirds of Representatives to be taken up again in 2010 , and was considered dead . In April 2010 , on the last day of the legislative session , the House suspended the rules on the Senate bill and passed it with a majority , sending the bill to Governor Linda Lingle , who vetoed it in July 2010 . 
 Hawaii does not allow same @-@ sex marriages or civil unions , but two unmarried people can register for a reciprocal beneficiary relationship , which provides some of the rights and benefits that come with marriage . The bill was written to become law on January 1 , 2010 , would allow all couples to obtain rights equal to those of married couples , and make Hawaii the only state in the Western United States to allow civil unions instead of domestic partnerships . 
 = = Content of the bill = = 
 House Bill 444 H.D. 1 as introduced and passed by the Hawaii House of Representatives " extends the same rights , benefits , protections , and responsibilities of spouses in a marriage to partners in a civil union . " To be eligible for a civil union , the bill outlined that the person seeking a civil union may not already be in a civil union , marriage , or reciprocal beneficiary relationship with someone else , the two people seeking a civil union must be of the same sex , both members of the civil union must be 18 years or older , and the two partners must not be related . The bill also enumerated familial relationships in which civil unions would be automatically nullified , such as a man with his father , grandfather , or son , or a woman with her mother , grandmother , or daughter . If one of the persons had a guardian , the guardian had to consent for the subject to obtain a civil union . 
 Section 1 , § — 9 of House Bill 444 explained that " partners to a civil union ... shall have all the same rights , benefits , protections , and responsibilities under law ... as are granted to spouses in a marriage . " The bill also recognized domestic partnerships , civil unions , and same @-@ sex marriages performed in other states as civil unions in Hawaii , and would have taken effect on January 1 , 2010 . In addition , House Bill 444 repealed a statute that declared " private <unk> not unlawful . " 
 House Bill S.D. 1 444 as passed by the Hawaii Senate was amended to remove the bill 's reference to same @-@ sex couples , include language stating the legislature 's intent not change the definition of marriage , and include partners in civil unions for use of the terms " spouse " , " family " , " immediate family " , " dependent " , and " next of kin " . The language of the bill 's coming into effect remained unchanged at January 1 , 2010 .

Civil unions were not restricted . Bills creating civil unions were considered several times , but failed to receive committee approval prior to 2009 .

 H.B. 444 was introduced in the Hawaii House of Representatives on January 26 , 2009 . It passed the Hawaii House Judiciary Committee on February 5 , 2009 , with 12 members voting in favor and none opposed and was approved by the Hawaii House of Representatives on February 12 , 2009 , with 33 members voting in favor and 17 opposed , one vote fewer than the two @-@ thirds vote needed to override a veto by the Republican Governor Linda Lingle , who did not indicate whether she considered a veto . It was referred to the Hawaii Senate on February 13 , 2009 . A hearing by the Committee on Judiciary and Government Operations ( JGO ) was held at the State Capitol on February 24 , 2009 , with the outcome of three senators supporting the bill and three opposed ; the bill was not passed out of committee . 
 The Senate Democratic leadership stated the bill might be taken from committee and brought to a debate before the full Senate , which was possible after March 10 , 2009 . Following a rally held on February 22 , 2009 , that opposed the passage of H.B. 444 and in which between 2 @,@ 000 and 8 @,@ 000 people participated , a number of Democratic senators became unwilling to vote in favor of the motion , citing concerns about changing common Senate procedure . The number of senators supporting civil unions was reduced from 18 to 13 out of 25 senators . Supporters held a candlelight vigil attended by 300 to 400 people in support of the bill on March 7 , 2009 . 
 Senator Will Espero offered an amendment to the bill that would have reduced the number of benefits granted , stating this would remove concerns that civil unions were similar to marriage . Passing an amended bill would have required the House to vote on it again or to establish a conference committee to negotiate differences between versions of both chambers . Supporters of civil unions stated they would not support the compromise , and a senator argued that " an amendment will kill it . " Hawaii Senate Majority Leader Gary Hooser stated in March 2009 he would try to bring the bill to a vote if no other senator did so by the end of the legislative session in May 2009 . It was not clear how many senators supported Hooser and opposing groups announced protests if action was taken . On March 25 , 2009 , the attempt to bring the bill before the full Senate failed when six senators supported the measure instead of the required nine senators . Senate President Colleen Hanabusa and JGO chairman Brian Taniguchi had opposed recalling H.B. 444 from Taniguchi 's committee , citing unwillingness to change the traditional lawmaking process . 
 On May 7 , 2009 , a second motion to recall the bill from committee , initiated by Senator Les Ihara , Jr . , was successful after 10 Democrats voted in favor . The Senate Democratic Leadership , Democrats opposed to civil unions , and Senate Republicans voted in favor of an amendment to the bill that added language reaffirming the distinction between civil unions and marriage and allowing same @-@ sex and opposite @-@ sex couples to enter civil unions . The amendment was adopted , which killed the bill , as a revised version required renewed approval by the Hawaii House of Representatives and the Legislature adjourned May 8 , 2009 . Senate President Hanabusa stated the issue would not be taken up again before 2010 .

 The bill was carried over into the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a distraction from the budget and should not be voted on for final passage in the Senate . Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass . If passed , the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives . Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto , arguing that he does not want to force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill 's approval was in doubt . The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1 , 2010 , and if the language is not changed , the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content . 
 The Senate passed an unchanged bill on January 22 , 2010 , with a veto @-@ proof two @-@ thirds ' majority , after an amendment to update the effective date was rejected . The measure moved for final approval to the House of Representatives , but on January 29 , House Speaker Calvin Say moved to indefinitely postpone a vote on the bill , which was approved by voice vote . No votes were recorded and the move deferred action on the bill for 2010 unless two @-@ thirds of Representatives vote to reconsider the bill , and it was considered dead . 
 On April 29 , the last day of the legislative session , the Senate bill was revived in the Hawaii House following a motion by Majority Leader Blake <unk> . Speaker Calvin Say immediately ordered a recess and after the representatives returned four votes to suspend legislative rules postponing the issue were taken and the bill passed with 31 to 20 votes . Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 to decide whether to sign or veto the measure . The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto . Lingle vetoed the bill on July 6 , arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum . The House had ruled out any attempt to override her vetoes for the legislative session .

 Following the introduction of H.B. 444 , gay rights organizations stated their support , arguing the bill supported equality in an ethnically diverse state .

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Honolulu , Clarence Richard Silva , called the bill " a travesty to the democratic process " that " ignores the will of the people .

" Linda Krieger , a University of Hawaii law professor and adviser for a student gay rights group , stated " where the fundamental civil rights of an unpopular minority are at stake , the principle of ' letting the people decide ' is often a mere cloak for majoritarian tyranny . " The First Unitarian Church of Honolulu sponsored a poll that found 70 percent opposition to same @-@ sex marriage and 67 percent support on whether gays and lesbians should have the " same rights as everyone else . " 
 The Senate hearings on the bill attracted large turnout and testimony was recorded for 15 hours . In the hearing , bill opponents outnumbered supporters . Mike Gabbard , who sponsored the 1998 amendment permitting the legislature to outlaw same @-@ sex marriage , argued the bill would lead to same @-@ sex marriage being taught in Hawaiian schools . Kim Coco Iwamoto of the Hawaii Board of Education countered civil unions would make children in gay families less likely to be harassed . Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii Duke Aiona criticized the bill , arguing it " attempts to circumvent the will of the people by authorizing the equivalent to same @-@ sex marriage " . U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie supported the bill , stating " it is shameful that while they must give their equal share to the government , the government will not give them equal protection " about gay and lesbian citizens of Hawaii . 
 The Honolulu Advertiser reported that the Senate Democratic leadership reconsidered their support for the bill because of the large demonstration of opponents and their pressure on senators to oppose the bill . It found that some senators privately suggested the bill 's delay in committee or a proposed amendment to the bill were ways to avoid taking a vote following the controversy . 
 The candlelight vigil following the bill 's defeat in committee was attended by labor union members and religious groups . Father Richard Shields of the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii stated religion should be taken out of the argument and a spokesperson for the hotel and restaurant union Local 5 argued the bill provided economic justice . A letter later sent to senators in support of the H.B. 444 by community groups , including the Local 5 union , the Hawaii NAACP , the Hawaii State Democratic Women 's Caucus , and the Japanese American Citizens League . 
 In response to Majority Leader Gary Hooser 's statement that he intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate , the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education . The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance . Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama 's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives . The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same @-@ sex marriage . The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success . 
 Following the adoption of the amended version of H.B. 444 , Senator Les Ihara , Jr. stated , " I have a hard time reconciling the statement that the proponents made , that this is for equal rights and civil unions — at the same time , this kills it for the session . " Michael <unk> of Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays called the vote " a dog @-@ and @-@ pony show " . Hawaii Family Forum leader and former Democratic state representative Dennis <unk> commented that " things worked out for the good . " 
 Hooser began a campaign in June 2009 to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in 2010 , calling his support for the bill an act on a " critical issue " . Neil Abercrombie was elected to succeed Linda Lingle as Governor in the 2010 gubernatorial election , defeating Duke Aiona . 
 On July 6 , 2010 , following Lingle 's veto of the bill , Lambda Legal and the ACLU announced that they would file a lawsuit to enable civil unions , stating that " our constitution prevents discrimination based on sexual orientation . "

It was speculated that the film was to be based on the real @-@ life story of a gangster who had moved from the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu to Mumbai in the late 1960s . 
 The film was revived later by R. R. Venkat later in January 2011 with a tagline " Guns do not need agreements " .

 Mahesh received the film 's script while dubbing for Dookudu ( 2011 ) , but due to that commitment took ten days to finish reading the script . He said in an interview that he could maintain the consistency in the character only because of the fewer working days . Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh 's specific characterisation ; he added that Mahesh 's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri . Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking , since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker . 
 Shruti Haasan was initially considered for the female lead role after her performance in her Telugu film debut , Anaganaga O Dheerudu ( 2011 ) . However , Kajal Aggarwal was signed as the female lead later in May 2011 , marking her first collaboration with both Mahesh and Jagannadh respectively . She was paid ₹ 10 million for this film . Jagannadh confirmed reports stating Mahesh and Kajal sharing a kiss in the film , adding that he retained them after Mahesh 's wife Namrata <unk> approved it .

 Prakash Raj , Nassar , Sayaji Shinde , <unk> Subramanyam , Brahmaji and Bandla Ganesh among others were cast for key supporting roles . Hansika Motwani was rumoured to be a part of the film 's cast in late August 2011 but not immediately confirmed . In mid October 2011 , Hansika reportedly agreed to perform an item number in the film . She later dismissed those reports as baseless rumours , claiming that other acting assignments keep her away from accepting . 
 Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was therefore selected to perform the item number instead . She was friends with Jagannadh , and he approached her for this song during the film 's shoot at Mumbai , saying that the song suited her and her personality as a dancer . She also tried to understand the meaning of the lyrics while dancing . Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing , suspecting a possible sprain , and found the costumes uneasy , but had to continue upon the choreographer 's insistence . Canadian @-@ born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal 's friend in the film .

 State Route 127 ( SR 127 ) is a 27 @.@ 05 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 43 @.@ 53 km ) state highway serving the eastern region of the U.S. state of Washington . The highway , listed on the National Highway System , begins in rural Garfield County at U.S. Route 12 ( US 12 ) and travels north across the Snake River on the Elmer Huntley Bridge . The roadway continues into Whitman County before it ends at SR 26 in Dusty . SR 127 formed a section of the Inland Empire Highway and Primary State Highway 3 ( PSH 3 ) prior to becoming US 295 in 1926 . US 295 was decommissioned in 1968 and replaced by a longer SR 127 , traveling its full length from Dodge to Colfax from its establishment in 1970 until an extension of SR 26 to Colfax in 1979 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 127 begins at an intersection with US 12 in the unincorporated community of Dodge , located between Starbuck and Pomeroy in rural Garfield County . The highway travels north around Dodge Hill and into the hills along New York Gulch before reaching the Snake River . SR 127 crosses the Snake River on the Elmer Huntley Bridge into Whitman County east of the former Central Ferry State Park . The highway continues northeast up the Central Ferry grade to Dusty , where SR 127 ends at an intersection with SR 26 . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2012 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 127 was its northern terminus at SR 26 , serving 1 @,@ 000 vehicles . The entire route of SR 127 is designated as part of the National Highway System , a highway system that includes roadways important to the national economy , defense , and mobility ; and as a Highway of Statewide Significance by WSDOT , which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington .

 The present route of SR 127 was added to the Washington state highway system in 1913 as part of the Inland Empire Highway , traveling in a circular arc from Ellensburg through the Yakima Valley and into the Palouse towards the Canadian border in Laurier . The Inland Empire Highway was numbered as State Road 3 in 1923 and PSH 3 in 1937 as part of the primary and secondary state highways . The United States Highway System was adopted on November 11 , 1926 by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) and included US 295 , traveling northeast from US 410 at Dodge to US 195 in Colfax and crossing the Snake River at Central Ferry . US 295 succeeded PSH 3 during the 1964 state highway renumbering , but was decommissioned in 1968 before the new state highway system was codified . The roadway was re @-@ designated as SR 127 after the new sign route number system was codified into the Revised Code of Washington in 1970 , traveling 43 @.@ 82 miles ( 70 @.@ 52 km ) from US 12 at Dodge to US 195 in Colfax and crossing the Snake River on the Elmer Huntley Bridge , completed in 1969 . SR 127 was truncated to its present route after SR 26 was extended east to Colfax over the former route of SR 127 .

 Up is a 2009 American 3D computer @-@ animated comedy @-@ drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Directed by Pete Docter , the film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen ( Ed Asner ) and an earnest young Wilderness Explorer named Russell ( Jordan Nagai ) . By tying thousands of balloons to his home , 78 @-@ year @-@ old Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of South America and complete a promise made to his late wife , Ellie . The film was co @-@ directed by Bob Peterson , with music composed by Michael Giacchino . 
 Docter began working on the story in 2004 , which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating . He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration . The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably , and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth . The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 balloons in the film 's sequences . Up was Pixar 's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3 @-@ D. 
 Up was released on May 29 , 2009 and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival , becoming the first animated and 3D film to do so . The film became a great financial success , accumulating over $ 731 million in its theatrical release . Up received universal acclaim , with most reviewers commending the humor and heart of the film . Edward Asner was praised for his portrayal of Carl , and a montage of Carl and his wife Ellie aging together was widely lauded . The film received five Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture , making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination , following Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Carl Fredricksen is a young 9 @-@ year @-@ old boy who idolizes famous explorer Charles Muntz . Muntz has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls , and vows to return there to catch one alive . One day , Carl befriends a girl named Ellie , who is also a fan of Muntz . She confides to Carl her desire to move her " clubhouse " — an abandoned house in the neighborhood — to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls . Carl and Ellie eventually get married and live together in the restored house . Carl sells toy balloons from a cart at a zoo Ellie opens . After suffering a miscarriage and being told they cannot have a child , the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls . They try to save for the trip , but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs . Finally , an elderly Carl arranges for the trip , but Ellie suddenly becomes ill and dies . 
 Years later , Carl still lives in the house , stubbornly holding out as the surrounding neighborhood is torn down for new construction , but when he accidentally injures a construction worker over damage to his mailbox , a court orders him to move to a retirement home . However , Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie , and turns his house into a makeshift airship , using thousands of helium balloons . Russell , a young Wilderness Explorer , becomes an accidental stowaway in his effort to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly . After surviving a thunderstorm , the flying house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls . Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still @-@ buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa , hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate . Russell encounters a tall , colorful flightless bird , whom he names " Kevin " . They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug , who wears a special collar that allows him to speak , and who vows to take the bird to his master . 
 The group is set upon by a pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha , a <unk> ( who is also seeking the bird ) , and are taken to their master , who turns out to be an elderly Charles Muntz . Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible , where he explains that he has spent years since his disgrace searching for the giant bird . When Russell notes the bird 's similarity to Kevin , Muntz becomes hostile , believing they have been attempting to steal the bird . The pair flees with Kevin and Dug , but Muntz catches up with them , captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl 's house , forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin . Carl rushes to put out the fire , allowing Muntz to take the bird . He and Russell eventually reach the falls , though Russell is disappointed in Carl over his decision to abandon Kevin . 
 Settling into his home , Carl looks through Ellie 's childhood scrapbook , and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage , along with a note thanking him for the " adventure " and encouraging him to go have a new one . Reinvigorated , he goes to find Russell , only to see him sailing off with some balloons to save Kevin on his own . Carl empties the house of furniture and possessions , lightening it , and pursues him . Russell is captured by Muntz , but Carl manages to board the dirigible in flight and free both him and Kevin . Dug accidentally defeats Alpha and becomes the dogs ' new leader . Muntz pursues them around the airship , finally cornering Dug , Kevin , and Russell inside Carl 's tethered house . Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship with Dug and Russell clinging to her back , but when Muntz leaps after them , he snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death . The house then descends out of sight through the clouds . 
 Carl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks , then fly the dirigible back to the city . Carl presents Russell with his final badge : a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met and made their promise . The two and Dug then enjoy some ice cream together . Meanwhile , Carl 's house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls , fulfilling his promise to Ellie . 
 = = Voice cast = = 
 Ed Asner as Carl Fredricksen ( Jeremy Leary voiced Carl as a young boy ) . Docter and Rivera noted Asner 's television alter ego , Lou Grant , had been helpful in writing for Carl , because it guided them in balancing likable and unlikable aspects of the curmudgeonly character . When they met Asner and presented him with a model of his character , he joked , " I don 't look anything like that . " ( The appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film , Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner . ) They tailored his dialogue for him , with short sentences and more consonants , which " cemented the notion that Carl , post @-@ Ellie , is a disgruntled bear that 's been poked awake during hibernation " . In Colombia , unexpected publicity for the film was generated due to the uncanny similarity of Carl with Colombian ex @-@ president Julio César <unk> Ayala . 
 Christopher Plummer as Charles F. Muntz , an old explorer looking for the Beast of Paradise Falls , vowing not to return to North America until he had captured the last @-@ living creature , using a group of dogs to aid him in his hunt . The name of his airship , the Spirit of Adventure , may have been inspired by Charles Lindbergh 's airplane , Spirit of St. Louis . In various interviews , Pete Docter has mentioned Howard Hughes and real life adventurers Charles Lindbergh and Percy Fawcett as inspirations for Muntz . 
 Jordan Nagai as Russell , a young Wilderness Explorer who becomes an accidental passenger in Carl 's floating house in his effort to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly . Throughout most of the film , he makes several comments to Carl that suggest that Russell 's father and mother are no longer together . Russell 's design was based on Pixar animator Peter Sohn . Docter auditioned 400 boys in a nationwide casting call for the part . Nagai , who is Japanese American , showed up to an audition with his brother , who was actually the one auditioning . Docter realized Nagai behaved and spoke non @-@ stop like Russell and chose him for the part . Nagai was 8 years old when cast . Docter encouraged Nagai to act physically as well as vocally when recording the role , lifting him upside down and tickling him for the scene where Russell encounters Kevin . Asian Americans have positively noted Pixar 's first casting of an Asian lead character , in contrast to the common practice of casting non @-@ Asians in Asian parts . 
 Bob Peterson as Dug , the Golden Retriever misfit of Muntz 's pack of dogs that can all communicate with humans through a device on each of their collars . Peterson knew he would voice Dug when he wrote his line " I have just met you , and I love you , " which was based on what a child told him when he was a camp counselor in the 1980s . The DVD release of the film features a short called Dug 's Special Mission , which follows Dug just before his first meeting with Carl and Russell . Dug previously appeared in Ratatouille as a shadow on a wall that barks at <unk> also voices Alpha , the Doberman Pinscher leader of Muntz 's pack of dogs . Pete Docter has stated that Alpha " thinks of himself as Clint Eastwood " . Despite his menacing appearance , a frequent malfunction in Alpha 's translating collar causes his voice to sound comically high @-@ pitched and squeaky , as if he had been breathing helium . The normal voice for his translator is a resonant , intimidating bass . With both voices , Alpha has a roundabout speech pattern that causes his sentences to be longer than necessary . 
 Pete Docter as Kevin , the " Beast of Paradise Falls " , which is actually just a large , colorful prehistoric bird . Docter also voices <unk> <unk> , Russell 's scout leader , seen at the end of the film . 
 Elizabeth Docter as Ellie Fredricksen as a younger child . The voice actor is the director 's daughter , who also provided some of the drawings shown by Ellie . 
 Delroy Lindo as Beta , a Rottweiler and one of Muntz 's dogs . 
 Jerome Ranft as Gamma , a Bulldog and one of Muntz 's dogs . 
 John Ratzenberger as Tom , a construction worker who asks if Carl is ready to sell his house . 
 David Kaye as the newsreel announcer . 
 Danny Mann as Steve , a construction worker whom Carl injures because he accidentally wrecked his mailbox .

 Director Pete Docter first began writing Up in 2004 . The fantasy of a flying house was developed on the idea of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating , which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up . Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months . Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons . The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor . Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist , stating that children would relate to Carl in the way that they relate to their grandparents . 
 Early concepts were very different from the final film . The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father 's kingdom , and when the brothers fell to Earth , they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other . Docter 's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film , but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet @-@ era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui . This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing . Another idea Docter added , then removed , was magic fountain @-@ of @-@ youth eggs laid by the bird , in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl , but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting , and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency . 
 Docter noted that the film reflects his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas , Ollie Johnston , and Joe Grant ( who all died before the film 's release and thus the film was dedicated to them ) . Grant gave the script his approval as well as some advice before his death in 2005 . Docter recalled that Grant would remind him that the audience needed an " emotional bedrock " because of how wacky the adventure would become ; here it is Carl mourning for his wife . Docter felt that Grant 's personality influenced Carl 's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character , and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy , Walter Matthau , James Whitmore , and their own grandparents , because there was " something sweet about these grumpy old guys " . Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl 's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly " hav [ ing ] this charm and almost this ' old man license ' to say things that other people couldn 't get away with [ ... ] It 's like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses ' honey ' . I wish I could call a waitress ' honey ' . " 
 Docter revealed that the filmmakers ' first story outline had Carl " just want [ ing ] to join his wife up in the sky . It was almost a kind of strange suicide mission or something . And obviously that 's [ a problem ] . Once he gets airborne , then what ? So we had to have some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten . " As a result , they added the plot of going to South America . The location was chosen due to both Docter 's love of tropical locations , but also in wanting a location that Carl could be stuck with a kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker . They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being " stuck in his ways " . 
 Docter created Dug as he felt it would be refreshing to show what a dog thinks , rather than what people assume it thinks . Knowledge of canine communication , body language and pack behaviors for the artists and animators to portray such thoughts came from consultant Dr. Ian Dunbar , veterinarian , dog behaviorist and trainer . The idea for Alpha 's voice derived from thinking about what would happen if someone broke a record player and it always played at a high pitch . Russell was added to the story at a later date than Dug and Kevin ; his presence , as well as the construction workers , helped to make the story feel less " episodic " . 
 Carl 's relationship with Russell reflects how " he 's not really ready for the whirlwind that a kid is , as few of us are " . Docter added he saw Up as a " coming of age " tale and an " unfinished love story " , with Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife . He cited inspiration from Casablanca and A Christmas Carol , which are both " resurrection " stories about men who lose something , and regain purpose during their journey . Docter and Rivera cited inspiration from the Muppets , Hayao Miyazaki , Dumbo , and Peter Pan . They also saw parallels to The Wizard of Oz and tried to make Up not feel too similar . There is a scene where Carl and Russell haul the floating house through the jungle . A Pixar employee compared the scene to Fitzcarraldo , and Docter watched that film and The Mission for further inspiration . The character Charles Muntz comes from Howard Hughes and Errol Flynn . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 Docter made Venezuela the film 's setting after Ralph Eggleston gave him a video of the tepui mountains of <unk> National Park ; and tepuis were already featured in a previous Disney film , Dinosaur . In 2004 , Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte <unk> by airplane , jeep , and helicopter . They spent three nights there painting and sketching , and encountering ants , mosquitoes , scorpions , frogs , and snakes . They also flew to <unk> <unk> and climbed to Angel Falls . Docter felt " we couldn 't use [ the rocks and plants we saw ] . Reality is so far out , if we put it in the movie you wouldn 't believe it . " The film 's creatures were also challenging to design because they had to fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis , but also be realistic because those mountains exist in real life . The filmmakers visited Sacramento Zoo to observe a Himalayan <unk> for Kevin 's animation . The animators designed Russell as an Asian @-@ American , and modeled Russell after similar looking Peter Sohn , a Pixar storyboarder who voiced Emile in Ratatouille and directed the short Partly Cloudy , because of his energetic nature . 
 While Pixar usually designs their characters to be caricatured , Carl was even more so , being only three heads high . He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing , yet giving him wrinkles , pockmarks on his nose , a hearing aid , and a cane to make him appear elderly . Docter wanted to push a stylized feel , particularly the way Carl 's head is proportioned : he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house , while Russell is rounded like a balloon . The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural , although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story , who suffered from the " uncanny valley " . Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld , Hank Ketcham , and George Booth influenced the human designs . Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10 @,@ 000 balloons flying the house . New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin 's iridescent feathers . To animate old people , Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics . The directors had various rules for Carl 's movements : he could not turn his head more than 15 – 20 degrees without turning his torso as well , nor could he raise his arms high . However , they also wanted him to grow more flexible near the end of the film , transforming into an " action hero " . 
 A technical director worked out that to make Carl 's house fly , he would require 23 million balloons , but Docter realized that number made the balloons look like small dots . Instead , the balloons created were made to be twice Carl 's size . There are 10 @,@ 927 balloons for shots of the house just flying , 20 @,@ 622 balloons for the lift @-@ off sequence , and a varying number in other scenes . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Up is the third Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino , after The Incredibles and Ratatouille . What Pete Docter wanted most importantly out of the music was the emotion , so Giacchino wrote a character theme @-@ based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story . At the beginning of the movie , when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz , the first piece of music heard is " Muntz 's Theme " , which starts out as a celebratory theme , and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70 years later . " Ellie 's Theme " is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions ; for instance , during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons , the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement . Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that changes during a particular moment in the story . 
 The score was released as a digital download on May 26 , 2009 , three days before the film opened in theaters . It won the Academy Award for Best Original Score , the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album , the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score , and the 2010 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music . It is the first score for a Pixar film to win the Oscar ( Randy Newman also won for Monsters , Inc. and Toy Story 3 , but in the category of Best Original Song ) .

 When the film screened at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood , California from May 29 to July 23 , 2009 , it was accompanied by Lighten Up ! , a live show featuring Disney characters . Other tie @-@ ins included children 's books such as My Name is Dug , illustrated by screenwriter Ronnie del Carmen . Despite Pixar 's track record , Target Corporation and Walmart stocked few Up items , while Pixar 's regular collaborator Thinkway Toys did not produce merchandise , claiming its story is unusual and would be hard to promote . Disney acknowledged not every Pixar film would have to become a franchise . Promotional partners include Aflac , NASCAR , and Airship Ventures , while Cluster Balloons promoted the film with a replica of Carl 's couch lifted by hot air balloons for journalists to sit in . 
 Before the film 's worldwide release date , Pixar granted a wish from 10 @-@ year @-@ old Colby Curtin to see the film before she died . Colby had been diagnosed with cancer and was too sick to go to a theater . A Pixar employee flew to the Curtin 's house with a DVD of the finished film and screened it for her and her family . Curtin died seven hours later at 9 : 20 pm , shortly after seeing the film . 
 Director Pete Docter intended for audiences to take a specific point from the film , saying : 
 Basically , the message of the film is that the real adventure of life is the relationship we have with other people , and it 's so easy to lose sight of the things we have and the people that are around us until they are gone . More often than not , I don 't really realize how lucky I was to have known someone until they 're either moved or passed away . So , if you can kind of wake up a little bit and go , " Wow , I 've got some really cool stuff around me every day " , then that 's what the movie 's about .

 Before its theatrical release , Disney · Pixar created three small animated vignettes called UPisodes to promote its film UP on the internet . These UPisodes chronicled Carl Fredricksen and Russell 's journey through the jungle , not seen in the movie . Fans were able to view the vignettes on Apple iTunes movie trailer site and YouTube . 
 UPisode One : Animal Calls - in the first episode , Russell demonstrates his ability to mimic animal calls . 
 UPisode Two : First Aid - in the second episode , Russell tries to relieve a minor injury that Carl received .

 Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and called it " a wonderful film . " The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as " Winsome , touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever , this gorgeously rendered , high @-@ flying adventure is a tidy 90 @-@ minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it . " Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film " contains many boring stretches of mindless <unk> and bland character interaction , " it also declared that there are scenes in Up of " such beauty , economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments ... to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout [ the film ] ... " Variety enthused that " Up is an exceptionally refined picture ; unlike so many animated films , it 's not all about sensory bombardment and volume ...

 The character of Carl Fredricksen has received mostly positive reception . Bill <unk> , author of <unk> the Pixar Way , praised Carl for his ability to be a jerk and likable at the same time . Wall Street Journal editor Joe Morgenstern described Carl as gruff , comparing him to Buster Keaton , but adds that this begins to wear thin as the movie progresses . He has been compared with Spencer Tracy , an influence on the character , by The Washington Post editor Ann Hornaday and Empire Online editor Ian Freer , who describes him as similar to a " Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner @-@ era " Tracy . Entertainment Weekly editor Lisa Schwarzbaum described his appearance as a cross between Tracy and an eccentric out of a George Booth cartoon . TIME editor Richard Corliss also makes the comparison , calling him a " trash compacted version " of Tracy . He has also been compared to Walter Matthau , another inspiration for the character 's design , by LA Weekly editor Scott Foundas , suggesting that actor Ed Asner was channeling him while performing the role of Carl . Variety editor Todd McCarthy described Carl as a combination of both Tracy and Matthau . 
 The relationship between Carl and his wife Ellie has been praised in several media outlets . In his book Disney , Pixar , and the Hidden Message of Children 's Films , author M. Keith Booker described the love between Carl and Ellie as touching . While also describing the scene of the two of them aging as a " masterpiece of its own kind , " he was not sure how much children would appreciate the scene , commenting that his son was <unk> in his seat during the scene . Reelviews editor James Berardinelli praised their relationship , stating that it brought a tear to his eye in a way no animated film has done , including anything by famed anime director Hayao Miyazaki . Ann Hornaday praised the prologue , describing it as " worthy of Chaplin in its heartbreaking poignancy . " Chicago Tribune editor Michael Phillips praised the scene , describing it as an emotional and cinematic powerhouse , and that he also was nearly moved to tears . However , Salon.com editor Stephanie Zacharek criticized the love between Carl and Ellie , describing their marriage as resembling a dental adhesive commercial more than a real relationship . 
 Edward Asner was praised in several media outlets for his portrayal of Carl . San Francisco Chronicle editor Mick LaSalle praised Asner as a great choice due to having a grumpiness to his voice that is not truly grumpy , but rather coming from a protective stance . Entertainment Weekly editor Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Asner 's acting , stating that he has a " Lou Grant authority " to his voice . Time editor Richard Corliss stated that Asner had the " gruffness and deadpan comic timing to bring Carl to life . " The Boston Globe editor Ty Burr concurred with this , stating that his Lou Grant @-@ like voice had not diminished with time . USA Today editor Claudia Puig praised Asner 's delivery , describing it as superb . 
 The formulation of Russell as an Asian American character , along with the casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well . Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell . EWP lauded Pixar for the creation of the character , stating , " We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film . " The character is noted as Pixar 's first lead Asian character , and was further positively received within the added context of historical non @-@ Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment . Asian American organizations and entertainment websites , such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans ( MANAA ) , <unk> , and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions , noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment . In an interview with NPR in 2013 , Angry Asian Man 's Phil Yu reflected on the character 's lack of typical Asian stereotyping , stating , " You know , he just happens to be Asian and he 's , you know , really adorable character . But that kid could 've been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian - just a little color , you know , and it 's really wonderful when that kind of thing happens where they don 't have to play that up and make it like a thing or a joke , which happens a lot .

 = Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad = 
 The Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad was a 3 ft ( 914 mm ) narrow gauge railroad in Blair and Cambria Counties , Pennsylvania which operated during the late 19th and early 20th century . It carried passenger traffic up from the vicinity of Altoona to Wopsononock and coal and timber down from Wopsononock and Dougherty to Altoona . Originally constructed to develop coal mines and resort traffic atop the Allegheny Plateau , it became involved in a complicated and ultimately unsuccessful scheme to break the Pennsylvania Railroad 's control over the Clearfield Coalfield . Never very profitable , it went through several reorganizations , the last in 1913 . Conversion to 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) standard gauge in 1916 did not improve the situation , and the railroad was abandoned in 1919 . 
 = = Charter and construction = = 
 The railroad was chartered on May 27 , 1890 as the Altoona and Wopsononock Railroad . It was surveyed from Juniata , a northern suburb of Altoona , up Spring Run , and climbed a circuitous , twisting route up the Allegheny Front through Juniata Gap , to terminate at the newly established resort town of Wopsononock . By the time the first annual meeting of the stockholders was held on January 13 , 1891 , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of the road had been completed as a 3 ft ( 914 mm ) narrow gauge line . The board ultimately decided to complete the remaining 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) to the same gauge . Frank G. Patterson , an Altoona attorney , was elected president , and William L. Shellenberger vice @-@ president . 
 Rails were finished to the top of the Alleghenies on June 6 , and the first train arrived in Wopsononock on June 11 . The railroad was formally opened on July 2 , 1891 . An extension to Dougherty , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) beyond Wopsononock , was begun on September 31 , in order to serve mines of the newly formed Richland Coal Company , headed by Shellenberger . Patterson was also involved in the coal company , serving as its secretary . 
 = = Extension and legal battle = = 
 Patterson wished to extend the line to Dougherty , and a further 12 miles ( 19 km ) to <unk> on Clearfield Creek . To finance the extension , the shareholders , in November 1891 , authorized a $ 60 @,@ 000 mortgage on the property , and allowed Patterson to issue himself 600 additional shares of stock . He did so , but never paid the money due for them to the company 's treasury . 
 On January 22 , 1892 , the railroad 's name was changed to the Altoona , Clearfield and Northern Railroad to reflect the projected extension , which was built that year as far as Dougherty . However , a struggle for control of the railroad now ensued . 
 Patterson had agreed to sell 60 % of the company 's stock to James Kerr , who was expected in turn to sell the stock to the Pennsylvania Railroad , at whose Juniata station the line terminated . However , before Patterson could transfer the stock to Kerr , several other directors of the railroad , including Shellenberger , contracted to sell a majority interest in the railroad to Samuel P. Langdon . Langdon controlled the Altoona and Philipsburg Connecting Railroad , a short line in the Philipsburg area whose southern end would reach Ramey , about 17 miles ( 27 km ) from Dougherty , in 1894 . He intended to connect the two railroads and use the AC & N to enter Altoona . 
 Patterson and Langdon both claimed to control a majority of the company 's stock , and in February 1893 , rival boards of directors were elected by stockholders loyal to those two figures . The issue of 600 shares to Patterson , authorized in 1891 , turned the issue , and its validity was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and Patterson 's board of directors ordered seated . Langdon promptly petitioned for a receivership , and was appointed joint receiver with Patterson . Patterson , however , took most of the responsibility for operations . He was responsible having <unk> installed at Wopsononock and Juniata in late 1894 so that the railroad 's engines did not have to back down the mountain . The co @-@ receivership was lifted on July 6 , 1896 , and Patterson took full control of the railroad again . However , the railroad failed to cover its operating expenses shortly thereafter , and Patterson was re @-@ appointed receiver on September 28 , 1896 . On February 29 , 1897 , it was sold under foreclosure to William L. Shellenberger , on behalf of the bondholders — the group which had allied with Langdon . On March 17 , 1897 , it was reorganized as the Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad . 
 Shellenberger and his fellow bondholders had good reason to seek control of the railroad . After their failure to deliver control of the road to Langdon , he brought suit against them . In exchange for his dropping the suit , they agreed to lease the Altoona and Beech Creek to the Pittsburgh , Johnstown , Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad , a holding company formed by Langdon , on highly favorable terms . The new company was to operate the Altoona & Philipsburg Connecting , planning to convert to standard gauge and extend the two railroads to a junction at East <unk> , near Dougherty . The PJE & E would be extended further south through Ebensburg and then down to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Johnstown . During this period , the line was known as the " Altoona Division " of the PJE & E. On December 17 , 1898 , Langdon chartered the Altoona and Beech Creek Terminal Railroad , which would extend the Altoona and Beech Creek from Juniata to a new terminal at 9th Street and 15th Avenue in Altoona . However , he was unable to carry out these plans , and his lease was invalidated on March 27 , 1900 . Through appeals and legal maneuvers , Langdon was able to hold out until December 27 , 1901 , when the Sheriff of Blair County ejected the PJE & E employees and returned the Altoona and Beech Creek to its stockholders . The Altoona and Beech Creek Terminal was dissolved in 1905 – 6 . 
 The Altoona and Beech Creek reported itself in the Official Guide of 1903 as having been extended to <unk> , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) beyond Dougherty . However , it does not appear that this extension was , in fact , built . By 1909 , the railroad had built two short branches of 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) each at the Juniata end of the line . The <unk> Branch left the main line near Broadway and Penn Avenue , Juniata , and circled around to the north , serving a few local industries and reaching the PRR 's main line at Juniata Junction , near 2nd Avenue and 10th Street . The Fairview Branch ran southwest from a wye near 25th Avenue and Broadway to end in the Fairview neighborhood of Altoona , at 23rd Avenue and 10th Street . 
 Despite the battle waged for possession of it , the railroad had not been very profitable . Passenger traffic to Wopsononock had been declining , and coal traffic from Dougherty was rather limited . Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain , which also provided revenue . A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal tipple at Dougherty on April 30 , 1903 . When the railroad became insolvent again , Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4 , 1909 . It was once more sold under foreclosure on April 30 , 1910 to H.A. Davis , and reorganized as the Altoona , Juniata and Northern Railway . 
 = = Conversion and abandonment = = 
 Andrew <unk> , one of the original Altoona & Wopsononock directors , was elected president of the newly organized company . The board remained largely unchanged , although Shellenberger finally severed his association with the railroad . It remained unprofitable , and Davis , in turn , sold the line to Sigmund Morris , of Altoona . Morris had incorporated the Altoona Northern Railroad on November 7 , 1912 to acquire the line , and the Altoona , Juniata and Northern was merged into it on January 16 , 1913 . Morris planned to convert the railroad to 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) standard gauge , electrify it to make it an interurban , and extend it to connect with the Beech Creek Railroad ( a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad ) at Patton . However , Morris was unable to execute these plans . A group of New York City investors took over the railroad about 1916 . They converted the railroad to standard gauge , operating initially with ex @-@ Pennsylvania Railroad 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0s , but replacing them with <unk> when the 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0s were found to be unsuitable for the track . 
 The conversion failed to make the railroad pay , and the company went into receivership again on August 8 , 1918 . The last passenger train was operated on July 16 , 1919 and the last coal train on July 30 . Negotiations with the bondholders to resume service were not successful , and the rails were removed in 1921 .

 The Altoona & Wopsononock initially owned two engines . # 1 was a National 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 , and # 2 a Baldwin 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 , both of which were purchased used from the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad . In 1892 , the Altoona , Clearfield & Northern bought # 3 , a Baldwin 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 . However , due to the depleted state of the railroad 's finances , it was unable to pay for # 3 . Samuel Langdon forestalled legal proceedings by having the locomotive transferred to his United Collieries Co . , which paid Baldwin in coal . Nothing is known of # 4 , if it ever existed . The Altoona & Beech Creek bought # 5 and # 6 , both Baldwin 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0s , in 1901 , while still under Pittsburg , Johnstown , Ebensburg & Eastern control . After the PJE & E lost its lease on the railroad , litigation ensued over the ownership of # 3 ; by the time the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declared in favor of the A & BC in 1903 , United Collieries had sold it to the Surry , Sussex and Southampton Railroad . # 5 and # 6 were sold to the Ohio River and Western Railroad and the <unk> Sugar Company , respectively , when the railroad was converted to standard gauge in 1916 . 
 The Altoona Northern initially purchased three ex @-@ PRR 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0s ( built at Juniata Shops ) , numbered # 101 – 103 . They were found to be unsuitable for the light track and steep grades , and were sold in 1917 .

 Details of the railroad 's rolling stock are obscure . In 1891 , it owned five passenger and three freight cars . In addition to the coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty ( fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season ) , the railroad had at least one parlor car and several Brill @-@ built observation cars . Contemporary photographs show that the railroad built some of its own open @-@ air cars for excursion service . Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of gondola cars for coal traffic .

 = Hurricane Danny ( 1997 ) = 
 Hurricane Danny was the only hurricane to make landfall in the United States during the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season , and the second hurricane and fourth tropical storm of the season . The system became the earliest @-@ formed fifth tropical or subtropical storm of the Atlantic season in history when it attained tropical storm strength on July 17 , and held that record until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season when Tropical Storm Emily broke that record by several days . Like the previous four tropical or subtropical cyclones of the season , Danny had a non @-@ tropical origin , after a trough spawned convection that entered the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico . Danny was guided northeast through the Gulf of Mexico by two high pressure areas , a rare occurrence in the middle of July . After making landfall on the Gulf Coast , Danny tracked across the southeastern United States and ultimately affected parts of New England with rain and wind . 
 Danny is notable for its extreme rainfall , the tornadoes generated by it , and the destruction it produced on its path , causing a total of nine fatalities and $ 100 million ( 1997 USD , $ 147 million 2016 USD ) in damage . The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama , as at least 36 @.@ 71 inches ( 932 mm ) fell on Dauphin Island . Flooding , power outages , and erosion occurred in many areas of the Gulf Coast , and rescues had to be executed from flooded roadways . Tornadoes generated by Danny on the East Coast caused a great amount of damage . Of the nine fatalities caused by Danny , one happened off the coast of Alabama , four occurred in Georgia , two occurred in South Carolina , and two occurred in North Carolina . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A broad mid @-@ tropospheric trough over the southeastern United States spawned an area of convection over the lower Mississippi River Valley on July 13 , and drifted southward towards the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico . As it moved into the Gulf of Mexico , a weak and isolated surface low pressure area formed off the coast of Louisiana . The circulation in the system steadily expanded , and initially the surface winds and convection were intermittent . On July 16 , deep convection increased and organized near the center , and oil rigs and surface buoys reported surface winds of 30 mph ( 50 km / h ) . Based on the observations , it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16 while about 150 miles ( 240 km ) south of the southwestern Louisiana coastline . 
 The depression slowly organized for the next day , as it drifted to the northeast . On July 17 , the rate of organization and development of deep convection increased considerably , and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny later that day . From the night of July 17 through July 18 , Danny quickly developed deep convection and banding features in the favorable environment of the Gulf of Mexico , and reached hurricane status later on July 18 . Located between two high pressure systems , Danny continued its unusual July track to the northeast , and crossed over southeastern Louisiana near the Mississippi River Delta . A small storm , Danny continued to strengthen after reaching the coastal waters off Mississippi on the night of July 18 , and attained a peak of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) early on July 19 . The hurricane @-@ force winds , however , were confined to the eyewall . After stalling near the mouth of Mobile Bay on July 19 , Hurricane Danny turned to the east , and made its final landfall near Mullet Point , Alabama later that day . 
 The storm rapidly weakened as it continued northward , and degenerated into a tropical depression by July 20 . The weak depression moved through Alabama , Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina , maintaining a well @-@ defined cloud signature . Due to a front behind the system , Danny unusually strengthened to a tropical storm over North Carolina on July 24 . This rare phenomenon occurred due to interaction with a developing trough and its associated baroclinic zone . Danny entered the Atlantic Ocean , north of the North Carolina @-@ Virginia border , near Virginia Beach . It quickly reached a secondary peak of 60 miles per hour ( 100 km / h ) , and continued rapidly northeastward towards the waters of the Atlantic . A strong mid to upper @-@ level cyclone turned Danny northward , threatening Massachusetts . It stalled while just 30 miles ( 50 km ) southeast of Nantucket on July 26 , turned to the east out to sea , and became extratropical later that day . On July 27 , the former hurricane merged with a frontal zone . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch on July 17 , as Danny strengthened to a tropical storm , for the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama . When Danny strengthened to a hurricane on July 18 , a few hours before its landfall in far southeastern Louisiana and over a day before landfall in Alabama , the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning . Grand Isle mayor Arthur Ballenger ordered the evacuation of the town 's 1 @,@ 500 residents , a decision made due to the large number of tourists on the island and to prevent anyone from being unable to leave the island . With a 5 foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) storm surge possibility , Danny had the potential to flood the only highway out of the island . Officials distributed sandbags to residents in St. Bernard Parish to seal off easily flooded roads , with officials recommending that residents leave the area . 
 Prior to the arrival of the hurricane , the governors of Mississippi and Alabama declared disaster emergencies , expecting a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) storm surge and up to 20 inches ( 500 mm ) of rain at that time . Six shelters were opened in Mobile County , though few attended them . Officials also considered opening shelters near local casinos and beaches in Biloxi , Mississippi . 
 Southeastern Massachusetts also had a tropical storm warning issued , a few hours before sustained tropical storm force winds affected the area and less than 12 hours before its closest approach to the coastline . 
 = = Impact = = 
 As a small storm , Hurricane Danny only caused a damage toll of $ 100 million ( 1997 USD , $ 147 million 2016 USD ) . A total of 4 direct and 5 indirect deaths resulted from the effects of Danny .

 Heavy rain and winds buffeted many parishes located east of the city of New Orleans . A small radius near the center of the storm had much of the extreme rainfall , and limited the flooding , which could have been disastrous if it were widespread . Grand Isle and portions of the lower Plaquemines Parish were the worst hit in Louisiana . Additionally , Grand Isle reported a wind gust of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and a storm surge of 5 @.@ 2 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) . At New Orleans International Airport , sustained winds of 28 mph ( 45 km / h ) and gusts of 33 mph ( 53 km / h ) were reported on July 19 . A gauge reported a water level of 4 @.@ 85 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in Venice . Storm tides were 2 to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 to 0 @.@ 9 meters ) above normal on average . A Coast Guard helicopter had to evacuate 7 Texans who were on a yacht in the Gulf of Mexico forty miles offshore , since their radio was broken and they were therefore unaware they were sailing into the storm . After being rescued , they were treated for minor injuries at a suburban New Orleans hospital . 
 At least 10 @,@ 000 people lost electricity in Louisiana . Furthermore , 130 boats were damaged or sunk at a large marina in Buras , Louisiana , due to the storm surge of over 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) , in a matter of minutes . Both Grand Isle and Grand Terre Island received erosion on their shores , while many commercial fishing boats in Grand Isle were also heavily damaged . Around 160 households and 80 businesses reported damage on Grand Isle . Jefferson Parish and Plaquemines Parish had $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( 1997 USD , $ 2 @.@ 21 million 2016 USD ) and $ 3 @.@ 5 million ( 1997 USD , $ 5 @.@ 16 million 2016 USD ) total in damage respectively . Significant flooding happened throughout Jefferson Parish , with the floods affecting a total of 163 houses and 84 businesses . Meanwhile , in Plaquemines Parish , ten houses and 35 trailers had damage , with 8 businesses at least partially flooded and 40 commercial fishing boats also damaged . Lafourche Parish had no significant damage to report . Empire and Venice were the most damaged areas in Plaquemines Parish . In the areas of Plaquemines Parish within the hurricane protection levees , trees , power lines , house roofs , and mobile homes sustained damage , in addition to localized flooding throughout the parish after about 10 inches of rain . In lower Terrebonne Parish , some highways were flooded , due to storm tides , and a few roads were also flooded in St. Bernard and Orleans parishes , which were outside the hurricane protection levees . <unk> damage occurred elsewhere in the extreme southeastern portion of Louisiana , due to Danny being a small tropical cyclone and a minimal hurricane . 
 Eastern Jackson County had the greatest impact throughout Mississippi . Pascagoula reported a wind gust of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) on July 19 . Pascagoula airport reported 7 @.@ 87 inches ( 200 mm ) of rain from July 17 through July 19 . Some streets and a few homes were flooded in far southeastern Jackson County , in areas of poor drainage systems . The coast of Mississippi had no significant damage according to emergency management officials . An oil rig off the coast of Pascagoula was ripped from its moorings and collided with a tank that spilled 500 gallons ( 1 @,@ 892 L ) of fuel into the Bayou <unk> stream . 
 By late on July 19 , the American Red Cross was providing shelter to over 2 @,@ 000 people in Alabama , Mississippi , and Florida . 
 Extreme amounts of rainfall were produced over Alabama . Dauphin Island had the highest amount of rainfall , 37 @.@ 75 inches ( 959 mm ) reported by the HPC . Dauphin Island Sea Lab recorded 36 @.@ 71 inches ( 932 mm ) of rain , but not all the rain may have recorded in the rain gauge at this location , so it is possible the rainfall may have been underestimated . Doppler weather radar estimates show that around 43 inches ( 1 @,@ 090 mm ) of rain fell off the coast of Dauphin Island . A storm surge of over 6 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) occurred off Highway 182 , midway between Gulf Shores and Fort Morgan , in addition to the rainfall . Unusually , when the storm stalled off the coast of Alabama , prevailing northerly winds forced the water out of Mobile Bay , causing tides to be two feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) below normal . Observers noted that , if river channels had not remained , it would have been possible to walk across the bay unhindered by water . Additionally , a four @-@ story condominium project that was under construction in Gulf Shores crashed due to high winds . In addition , three tornadoes occurred in Alabama , one being in Orange Beach , another in Opelika , while the other one occurred in Alabama Port . There were some other tornadoes that also caused minimal damage . 
 Despite its effects in the northern Gulf of Mexico , only one person was directly killed from the storm there ; a man drowned off the coast when he fell off his sailboat near Fort Morgan , Alabama . One indirect casualty also occurred in the area , when a man had a heart attack while trying to secure a boat off the Alabama coast during the storm . Numerous roads became flooded and impassable for several days , south and along I @-@ 10 in Mobile , south and central Choctaw , and Baldwin counties . Along the Fowl and Fish rivers , in Mobile and Baldwin counties respectively , significant damage to homes occurred due to flooding . Most roads on Dauphin Island were flooded in over a foot of water . A few homes were close to falling into Mobile Bay , and one home had to be moved backwards towards land to prevent its destruction . At the peak of the storm in Alabama , at least 44 @,@ 000 people were without power in Mobile and Baldwin counties . In rural Choctaw County , north of Mobile , several families were rescued from flooded roads and trapped cars . The majority of houses and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings from the western shore of Mobile Bay , and from Fort Morgan east to Orange Beach , had roof damage . $ 60 @.@ 5 million ( 1997 USD , $ 89 @.@ 2 million 2016 USD ) in total property damage occurred in Alabama , in addition to pecan and pine tree damage costing $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( 1997 USD , $ 3 @.@ 69 million 2016 USD ) .

 In the state of Florida , some damage to the cotton crop occurred in Escambia County . Otherwise , very little damage resulted from the storm in northwestern Florida . The Panama City , Florida area had some minor fresh water flooding . A race in the NASCAR All Pro series at the Five Flags Speedway in Pensacola , Florida scheduled to be held on July 19 was postponed to September 13 , 1997 due to Hurricane Danny . By the time Danny reached Georgia and the Carolinas , its potential impact had weakened , though it still managed to produce 8 – 12 inches ( 200 – 300 mm ) of rain as it drifted through the western portions of the states . In Augusta , Georgia , fourteen South Carolina National Guardsmen were struck by lightning , one of whom had to be hospitalized in intensive care and six others received treatment at a hospital and were then released . Four indirect deaths occurred from traffic accidents during the storm 's onslaught in Georgia . A severe thunderstorm cell in South Carolina produced five tornadoes that touched down , one of which killed a woman in her destroyed duplex while passing through Lexington County . An F2 tornado with a width of 200 yards ( 200 m ) and a length of 4 miles ( 6 km ) , was on the ground for 3 miles ( 5 km ) to the northeast of Gaston , South Carolina , causing $ 942 @,@ 000 ( 1997 USD , $ 1 @.@ 39 million 2016 USD ) in damage , killing one , injuring six , and destroying 13 residences , with damage to many others . Several tornadoes and waterspouts were spawned over Virginia ; most of them occurred in Norfolk , Portsmouth , and Hampton . An F1 tornado with a width of 50 yards ( 50 m ) and a length of 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , touched down 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) in Portsmouth , causing $ 400 @,@ 000 ( 1997 USD , $ 590 thousand 2016 USD ) in damage .

Rainfall in Fayetteville measured 2 @.@ 85 inches ( 72 mm ) , while the remainder of the Mid @-@ Atlantic states received approximately 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of rain . 
 The heavy rains caused two people to drown in Charlotte . A girl drowned after being swept into a creek , and a woman drowned while in her car . Also in North Carolina , tropical rains related to Danny caused a CSX train to derail from its trestle into Little Sugar Creek , spilling about 2 @,@ 500 gallons ( 9 @,@ 500 L ) of diesel and therefore forcing a nearby public housing development to be evacuated . Sustained tropical @-@ storm force winds affected Martha 's Vineyard , Nantucket Island , and parts of Cape Cod , in addition to the coastal waters from the entrance of Buzzards Bay to the south and east of Cape Cod . Only minor damage occurred , despite these strong winds , which were experienced primarily in southeastern Massachusetts . The minor damage included localized flooding , power outages , downed tree limbs , and lost boats . A suspension of ferry service to Nantucket Island occurred for most of July 25 , with a shorter suspension happening on the service to Martha 's Vineyard . No significant coastal flooding affected the region , although a storm shelter was opened on Nantucket Island to host a Boy Scout group camping there . Danny was the fifth tropical cyclone to affect Southern New England in the 20th century during the month of July .

Specialized turtle exclusion devices , known as TEDs , or specialized nets that allowed the turtles to escape them , were required before Danny for shrimp trawlers . The Director of the Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said that the " inordinate amount of debris is causing extraordinary difficulty with the performance of ( TEDs ) in these areas . " Therefore , the United States Environmental Protection Agency allowed an alternative to the TEDs , of shorter tow times with seasonal restrictions of a maximum of 55 minutes from April 1 through October 31 , and a maximum of 75 minutes from November 1 through March 31 . By making the shorter tow times the required alternative , the EPA intended to minimize any sea turtle casualties as a result of trawlers being allowed to remove the TEDs . 
 One of three wolves that escaped from a zoo in Gulf Shores , Alabama during Hurricane Danny was found in November later that year , after seasonal conditions meant less tourists and therefore less food in Gulf State Park where the wolf had resided . One of the other wolves had already been recaptured , while the other had already been shot and killed . 
 Some cotton crops in the Southeast United States received needed rainfall from Danny , while others were harmed , as 100 @,@ 000 acres of cotton fields in Alabama were too heavily damaged for their crop to be salvaged . The effects of Danny caused the gasoline production of Gulf Coast oil refineries to decline and thus contributed to an increase in gas prices in the months following Danny throughout the United States . A severe drought had been in place in the Mid @-@ Atlantic region during the month of July . The high amount of rainfall caused by Danny helped to ease dry conditions in portions of the Mid @-@ Atlantic , but not sufficiently to stop the drought from developing further in most areas from northern Virginia to southern New England . 
 The extremely short distance of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a Doppler radar station in Mobile , Alabama and its slow landfall over the course of a day led to further study by meteorologists . The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than it is possible for hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve , with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation . One conclusion of the study included the need to sample the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface @-@ level winds and the overall intensity of a storm . Another conclusion was that while Danny 's slow movement positioned it over a tidal estuary bordering the Gulf , maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with high sea surface temperatures and other environmental conditions remained favorable . 
 The storm dropped 36 @.@ 71 inches ( 932 mm ) of rain on Dauphin Island , setting the new record for the most tropical or subtropical cyclone related rainfall in the state of Alabama , and is among the largest in the United States . The storm also became the earliest 5th tropical or subtropical storm of a season when it reached tropical storm strength on July 17 . This record was broken in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season when Hurricane Emily first attained tropical storm status on July 12 , just five days earlier . 
 = Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland , BWV 61 = 
 Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland ( Now come , Savior of the heathens ) , BWV 61 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed it in Weimar for the first Sunday in Advent , the Sunday which begins the liturgical year , and first performed it on 2 December 1714 . 
 The cantata text was provided by Erdmann Neumeister , who quoted the Book of Revelation and framed his work by two hymn stanzas , the beginning of Martin Luther 's " Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland " , the main hymn for Advent with a melody based on Medieval chant , and the end from Philipp Nicolai 's " Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern " . The librettist quoted developed his thoughts like a sermon . Bach structured the cantata in six movements , beginning with a chorale fantasia , followed by a series of alternating recitatives and arias , and concluded by a four @-@ part chorale . He scored it for three vocal soloists ( soprano , tenor and bass ) , strings and continuo . Bach led the first performance on 2 December 1714 . As Thomaskantor , director of music of the main churches of Leipzig , he performed the cantata again on 28 November 1723 . 
 = = History and words = = 
 On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co @-@ reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe @-@ Weimar . As concertmaster , he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works , specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche ( palace church ) , on a monthly schedule . 
 The exact chronological order of Bach 's Weimar cantatas remains uncertain . Only four bear autograph dates . BWV 61 is dated 1714 and bears the liturgical designation " am ersten Advent " , the First Sunday of Advent . The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Romans , " now is our salvation nearer " ( Romans 13 : 11 – 14 ) , and from the Gospel of Matthew , the Entry into Jerusalem ( Matthew 21 : 1 – 9 ) . 
 The cantata text was provided by Erdmann Neumeister , published in Geistliche <unk> in Frankfurt in 1714 . He began and ended his work with a hymn stanza . " Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland " is the main hymn for Advent , which Martin Luther had derived from the Latin Veni <unk> gentium . Its melody is based on Medieval chant and supplies a " dark , imposing character " . For the conclusion , Neumeister chose the second part , the Abgesang , of the seventh and final stanza of Philipp Nicolai 's " Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern " . The librettist quoted the Book of Revelation in the fourth movement : " Siehe , ich stehe vor der Tür und <unk> an . So <unk> meine Stimme hören wird und die Tür <unk> , zu dem <unk> ich <unk> und das <unk> mit ihm halten und er mit mir . " – " Behold , I stand at the door and knock . Anyone that hears My voice and opens the door , to him I will enter and keep the evening meal with him and he with me . " ( Revelation 3 : 20 ) . The poet combined the ideas of Jesus ' entry into Jerusalem and his promise to return with an invitation to enter the heart of the individual Christian . He developed his thoughts like a sermon , as the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr notes : mentioning that the arrival of Jesus brings blessing every day ( movement 2 ) , a prayer that Jesus may come to his congregation ( movement 2 ) , and in response to his statement of being at the door ( movement 4 ) the opening of the heart of the individual Christian who knows about his sinfulness ( movement 5 ) . Bach had set one text by Neumeister before , possibly by 1713 , in his cantata Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt , BWV 18 . 
 Because of Bach 's liturgical designation , the performance can be precisely dated to 2 December 1714 . As Thomaskantor , director of music of the main churches of Leipzig , Bach performed the cantata again on 28 November 1723 , beginning the first liturgical year in the new position . Bach paid attention to the exceptional occasion at beginning of the liturgical year , also when he composed later the chorale cantata Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland , BWV 62 ( 1724 ) , and Schwingt freudig euch empor , BWV 36 ( 1731 ) , which are all inspired by Luther 's hymn . Bach also began his Orgelbüchlein by a setting of the same tune . In Leipzig , the first Sunday in Advent was the last chance to hear cantata music before Christmas , because tempus clausum was observed during Advent . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in six movements , beginning with chorale fantasia , followed by a series of alternating recitatives and arias and concluded by a chorale . He scored it for three vocal soloists ( soprano ( S ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ( B ) ) , violins ( Vl ) , two violas ( Va ) , and basso continuo ( Bc ) , including cello ( Vc ) and bassoon ( Fg ) . The autograph score is titled : " Dominica 1 . Adventus Xsti . / Nun komm der Heyden Heyland . / â . / due Violini / due Viole / Violoncello / è & / Fagotto . / <unk> : Alto . <unk> è <unk> / Col ' / Organo . / da / Joh Sebast Bach / anno . / 1714 " . The duration is given as 18 minutes . According to the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff , the use of two viola parts is French style . Dürr notes that perhaps the strings were doubled by oboes , at least in the Leipzig performance , in a practise that was " not always marked in the score " . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring , keys and time signatures are taken from Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown .

 = = = 1 = = = 
 The first Sunday of Advent begins the liturgical year . Bach marked it by creating the opening chorus , " Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland " ( Now come , Saviour of the Gentiles ) , as a chorale fantasia in the style of a French overture , which follows the sequence slow – fast ( fugue ) – slow . In a French opera performance , the King of France would have entered during the overture ; Bach greets a different king . Two of the four lines of the chorale melody are combined in the first slow section , line three is treated in the fast section , and line four in the final slow section . The melody of line 1 is first presented in the continuo , then sung by all four voices one after another , accompanied by a solemn dotted rhythm in the orchestra . Line 2 is sung by all voices together , accompanied by the orchestra . Line 3 is a fast fugato , with the instruments playing colla parte , marked " gai " . Line 4 is set as line 2 . Wolff notes that Bach possibly followed the model of an opera by Agostino Steffani , Henrico Leone , which uses a chorus in a French overture .

 The recitative for tenor , " Der Heiland ist <unk> " ( The Saviour has come ) , begins secco but continues as an arioso , with tenor and continuo imitating one another . This more lyrical style of recitative derives from early Italian operas and cantatas , where it was known as <unk> <unk> – half aria . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 The tenor aria , " Komm , Jesu , komm zu deiner Kirche " ( Come , Jesus , come to Your Church ) , is accompanied by the violins and violas in unison . It is written in the rhythm of a gigue , and the combination of voice , unison strings and continuo gives it the texture of a trio sonata . Dürr comments that the use of the unison string ritornello , played even during the vocal passages , provides a " rather pointedly strict and unified character " . The musicologist Richard Taruskin comments : " This hybridization of operatic and instrumental styles is ... standard operating procedure in Bach 's cantatas . " 
 = = = 4 = = = 
 The quote from Revelation , " Siehe , ich stehe vor der Tür und <unk> an " ( See , I stand before the door and knock ) , is given as a recitative to the bass as the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) . The knocking on the door is expressed by pizzicato chords in the strings . Dürr notes : " The most expressive text @-@ engendered declamation is here ingeniously melted down into a structure only ten bars long but of compelling musical logic . " John Eliot Gardiner , who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 , compares it to an Emmaus scene in Bach 's later cantata <unk> bei uns , denn es will Abend werden , BWV 6 , the " post @-@ Resurrection appearance to the disciples " in Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ , BWV 67 , even to " the entry of the Commendatore in Mozart ’ s opera Don Giovanni . Bach would later frequently use the bass as the voice of Christ , in his St Matthew Passion even with a similar string accompaniment .

 In the closing chorale , " Amen , amen ! Komm , du schöne <unk> " ( Amen , amen ! Come , you fair crown of joy ) , Bach sets the Abgesang only of the final stanza of Nicolai 's hymn .

The hymn tune itself , through its very abbreviation implies a sense of urgency and the feeling of being unable to defer any longer . " In Bach 's setting , the violin adds a jubilant fifth part to the four vocal parts . The violin has to " climb three octaves to convey the extent of the soul 's longing for the joys of a future life and the prospect of Jesus returning at the end of time " .

 = Charles Town expedition = 
 The Charles Town expedition ( September 1706 ) was a combined French and Spanish attempt under Captain Jacques Lefebvre to capture the capital of the English Province of Carolina , Charles Town , during Queen Anne 's War ( as the North American theater of the War of the Spanish Succession is sometimes known ) . 
 Organized and funded primarily by the French and launched from Havana , Cuba , the expedition reached Charles Town in early September 1706 after stopping at St. Augustine to pick up reinforcements . After a brief encounter with a privateer the Brillant , one of the expedition 's six ships , became separated from the rest of the fleet . Troops landed near Charles Town were quickly driven off by militia called out by Governor Nathaniel Johnson when word of the fleet 's <unk> reached the area , and an improvised flotilla commanded by Colonel William Rhett successfully captured the Brillant , which arrived after the other five ships had already sailed away in defeat . 
 = = Background = = 
 News of the start of the War of the Spanish Succession had come to southeastern North America in mid @-@ 1702 , and officials of the English Province of Carolina had acted immediately . After failing in December 1702 to capture St. Augustine , the capital of Spanish Florida , they launched a series of destructive raids against the Spanish @-@ Indian settlements of northern Florida . French authorities in the small settlement at Mobile on the Gulf coast were alarmed by these developments , since , as allies of the Spanish , their territory might also come under attack . 
 The idea of a combined Franco @-@ Spanish expedition first arose in 1704 , when the governor of Florida , José de Zúñiga y la Cerda , discussed the idea with a French naval captain as a means of revenge for the Carolina raids ; however , no concrete action came of this discussion . Pierre LeMoyne d 'Iberville , the founder of Mobile and an experienced privateer who had previously wrought havoc against English colonial settlements in the Nine Years ' War , in 1703 developed a grandiose plan for assaulting Carolina . Using minimal French resources , d 'Iberville planned for a small French fleet to join with a large Spanish fleet at Havana , which would then descend on Carolina 's capital , then known as Charles Town . The expedition was to be paid for by holding other English colonial communities hostage after destroying Charles Town . It was not until late 1705 that d 'Iberville secured permission from King Louis XIV for the expedition . The king provided ships and some troops , but required d 'Iberville to bear the upfront cost of outfitting the expedition . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Two small fleets , one headed by d 'Iberville , who was to lead the expedition , left France in January 1706 , totalling 12 ships and carrying 600 French troops . They first sailed for the West Indies , where additional troops were recruited at Martinique , and d 'Iberville successfully ransacked English @-@ held Nevis . D 'Iberville then released part of his squadron , and sailed for Havana . There he attempted to interest Spanish authorities in supporting the expedition , with limited success , due in part to a raging epidemic of yellow fever . In addition to decimating the expedition 's troops , Spanish Governor Pedro Álvarez de <unk> died of the disease on July 6 , and d 'Iberville himself succumbed on July 8 . Before he died , d 'Iberville handed control of the expedition to Captain Jacques Lefebvre . 
 Lefebvre sailed from Havana with five ships , carrying about 300 French soldiers under the command of General Arbousset , and 200 Spanish volunteers led by General Esteban de Berroa . The fleet first made for St. Augustine , where Governor Francisco de <unk> y Martínez provided a sixth ship , another 30 infantry , and about 50 " Christian Indians " from the Timucua , Apalachee , and <unk> tribes . 
 The French fleet sailed from St. Augustine on August 31 . During the passage a sloop was spotted , and the Brillant gave chase ; she consequently became separated from the rest of the squadron . The sloop was a privateer sent out by Carolina governor Nathaniel Johnson to intercept Spanish supply ships ; its captain quickly returned to Charles Town with word of the fleet 's movement . The countryside and town , then also suffering the ravages of a yellow fever epidemic , rallied in response to Governor Johnson 's calling out of the militia . The exact number of militia mustered is not known ; of the non @-@ slave population of 4 @,@ 000 , an estimated 900 men served in the colonial militia . Anticipating that a landing would be attempted on James Island , which guarded the southern approach to the harbor , Johnson posted the militia there under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Rhett . The northern point of James Island was fortified by Fort Johnson , which housed a few cannon whose range was inadequate to prevent ships from entering the harbor . The militia also improvised a small flotilla of ships , which even included a fire ship . 
 = = Attacks = = 
 The Spanish fleet arrived off the harbor bar on September 4 ( this date is recorded in contemporary English documents and histories as August 24 due to differences between the Julian calendar then in use in the English colonies , and the modern Gregorian calendar ) . Despite the absence of the Brillant , which carried much of the French force , including " the campaign guns , shovels , spades , shells , and the land commander " ( the latter being General Arbousset ) , Captain Lefebvre and his fleet crossed the bar on September 7 , and delivered an ultimatum the next day . He demanded a ransom of 50 @,@ 000 Spanish pesos , threatening to destroy Charles Town if it was not paid . Governor Johnson contemptuously dismissed the demand as paltry , claiming the town was worth 40 million pesos , and that " it had cost much blood , so let them come " . 
 On September 9 the invaders landed two separate forces . One large force , numbering about 160 , plundered some plantations near the Charleston neck , but was recalled when the Governor Johnson sent militia out in boats to oppose them . A second smaller force was landed on James Island , but was also driven away by the threat of opposition . Late that night Johnson received word that the party on the neck was still active , and sent Lieutenant Colonel Rhett with 100 men to investigate . Arriving around daybreak on the 10th , they apparently surprised the invaders . The invaders fled after a brief skirmish , but about 60 were captured , and as many as 12 invaders were killed along with one of the defenders . On September 11 Lieutenant Colonel Rhett sailed the colonial flotilla out to find the invaders , only to discover that they had sailed off . 
 The next day the Brillant showed up , unaware of what had just transpired . Her captain had misjudged the distance from St. Augustine and had made landfall further north before turning around . General Arbousset landed his troops east of Charles Town , but the Brillant was captured by the colonial fleet ; Arbousset and his men surrendered after suffering 14 – 30 killed in a brief battle with the English militia . The prisoners included 90 to 100 Indians ; most of these were " sold for slaves " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Carolina officials declared October 17 a day of thanksgiving for their successful defense . The large number of prisoners , however , caused them some trouble . They sent about one third of them off to Virginia , expecting that they would be transported to England . However , by the time the prisoners arrived in Virginia , the annual merchant fleet had already sailed . Virginia authorities were unhappy that they now had to hold the prisoners , who would otherwise have been set free with the ship they arrived on . 
 In response to the Franco @-@ Spanish expedition , Carolinians led Indian raiding expeditions that besieged Pensacola , one of the few remaining Spanish outposts in Florida . They also mobilized Indian forces to attack Mobile , but these efforts were frustrated by French diplomatic activities in the Indian communities and also by false rumors of another Franco @-@ Spanish expedition . 
 = Jan Henryk Dąbrowski = 
 Jan Henryk Dąbrowski ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; also known as Johann Heinrich Dąbrowski ( Dombrowski ) in German and Jean Henri Dombrowski in French ; 29 August 1755 – 6 June 1818 ) was a Polish general , widely respected after his death for his patriotic attitude , and described as a national hero . 
 Dąbrowski initially served in the Saxon Army and joined the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth Army in 1792 , shortly before the Second Partition of Poland . He was promoted to the rank of general in the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794 . After the final Third Partition of Poland , which ended the existence of Poland as independent country , he became actively involved in promoting the cause of Polish independence abroad . He was the founder of the Polish Legions in Italy serving under Napoleon since 1797 , and as a general in Italian and French service he contributed to the brief restoration of the Polish state during the Greater Poland Uprising of 1806 . He participated in Napoleonic Wars , taking part in the Polish @-@ Austrian war and the French invasion of Russia until 1813 . After Napoleon 's defeat , he accepted a senatorial position in the Russian @-@ backed Congress Poland , and was one of the organizers of the Army of Congress Poland . 
 The Polish national anthem , Poland Is Not Yet Lost , written and first sung by the Polish legionnaires , mentions Dąbrowski by name , and is also known as Dąbrowski 's Mazurka . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = In Saxony and Poland = = = 
 Dąbrowski was born to Jan Michał Dąbrowski and Zofia Maria Dąbrowska , née Sophie von Lettow , in <unk> , Crown of the Kingdom of Poland , on 29 August 1755 . He grew up in Hoyerswerda , Electorate of Saxony , where his father served as a Colonel in the Saxon Army . He joined the Royal Saxon Horse Guards in 1770 or 1771 . His family was of Polish origin . Nonetheless , in his childhood and youth he grew up surrounded by German culture in Saxony , and signed his name as Johann Heinrich Dąbrowski . He fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession ( 1778 – 1779 ) , during which time his father died . Shortly afterward in 1780 he married <unk> <unk> . He lived in Dresden , and steadily progressed through ranks , becoming a Rittmeister in 1789 . He served as Adjutant general of King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony from 1788 to 1791 . 
 Following the appeal of the Polish Four @-@ Year Sejm to all Poles serving abroad to join the Polish army , and not seeing much opportunity to advance in his military career in the now @-@ peaceful Saxony , on 28 June 1792 he joined the Army of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth with a rank of <unk> and on 14 July he was promoted to the rank of vice @-@ brigadier . Joining in the final weeks of the Polish – Russian War of 1792 , he did not see combat in it . Unfamiliar with the <unk> of Polish politics , like many of Poniatowski 's supporters , he joined the Targowica Confederation in late 1792 . 
 Dąbrowski was seen as a cavalry expert , and King Stanisław August Poniatowski was personally interested in obtaining Dąbrowski 's services . As a cavalryman educated in a Dresden military school under Count Maurice Bellegarde , a reformer of the Saxon army 's cavalry , Dąbrowski was asked to help modernize the Polish cavalry , serving in the ranks of the 1st Greater Poland Cavalry <unk> ( 1 <unk> Brygada <unk> Narodowej ) . In January 1793 , stationed around Gniezno with two units of cavalry , about 200 strong , he briefly engaged the Prussian forces entering Poland in the aftermath of the Second Partition of Poland , and afterward became a known activist advocating the continuation of military struggle against the occupiers . 
 The Grodno Sejm , held in the fall of 1793 , nominated him for a membership in a military commission ; this caused him to be viewed with suspicion by the majority of the dissatisfied military , and he was not included in the preparations for the upcoming uprising . Thus he was taken by surprise when the Kościuszko Insurrection erupted , and his own brigade mutinied . He declared his support for the insurgents after the libation of Warsaw , and from then on took an active part in the uprising , defending Warsaw and leading an army corps in support of an uprising in Greater Poland . His courage was commended by Tadeusz Kościuszko himself , the Supreme Commander of the National Armed Forces , who promoted him to the rank of general . 
 = = = In the Napoleonic service = = = 
 After the failure of the uprising he remained in partitioned Poland for a while , attempting to convince the Prussian authorities that they need Poland as an ally against Austria and Russia . He was unsuccessful , and with the Third Partition of Poland between Russia , Prussia and Austria , Poland disappeared from the map of Europe . Dąbrowski 's next solution was to convince the French Republic that it should support a Polish cause , and create a Polish military formation . This proved to be more successful , and indeed Dąbrowski is remembered in the history of Poland as the organiser of Polish Legions in Italy during the Napoleonic Wars . ( These Legions are also often known as the " Dąbrowski 's Legions " . ) This event gave hope to contemporary Poles , and is still remembered in the Polish national anthem , named after Dąbrowski . He began his work in 1796 , when he came to Paris and soon afterward met Napoleon Bonaparte in Milan . On January 7 , 1797 he was authorized by the Cisalpine Republic to create Polish legions , which would be part of the army of the newly created Republic of Lombardy . 
 In April Dąbrowski lobbied for a plan to push through to the Polish territories in Galicia , but that was blocked by Napoleon who instead decided to use those troops on the Italian front . Dąbrowski 's Polish soldiers fought at Napoleon 's side from May 1797 until the beginning of 1803 . As a commander of his legion he played an important part in the war in Italy , entered Rome in May 1798 , and distinguished himself greatly at the Battle of Trebia on June 19 , 1799 , where he was wounded , as well as in other battles and combats of 1799 – 1801 . From the time the Legions garrisoned Rome , Dąbrowski obtained a number of trophies from a Roman representative , namely the ones that the Polish king , Jan III Sobieski , had sent there after his victory over the Ottoman Empire at the siege of Vienna in 1683 ; amongst these was an Ottoman standard which subsequently became part of the Legions ' colors , accompanying them from then on . However , the legions were never able to reach Poland and did not liberate the country , as Dąbrowski had dreamed . Napoleon did , however , notice the growing dissatisfaction of his soldiers and their commanders . They were particularly disappointed by a peace treaty between France and Russia signed in Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , which dashed Polish hopes of Bonaparte freeing Poland . Shortly afterwards , in March , Dąbrowski reorganized both Legions at Milan into two 6 @,@ 000 @-@ strong units . Disillusioned with Napoleon after the Lunéville treaty , many legionnaires resigned afterward ; of the others , thousands perished when the Legions were sent to suppress the Haitian Revolution in 1803 ; by that time Dąbrowski was no longer in command of the Legions . 
 Dąbrowski , meanwhile , spent the first few years of the new century as a general in the service of the Italian republic . In 1804 he received the Officer cross of Legion of Honour , and the next year , the Italian Order of the Iron Crown . Together with Józef Wybicki he was summoned again by Napoleon in fall of 1806 and tasked with recreating the Polish formation , which Napoleon wanted to use to recapture Greater Poland from Prussia . The ensuing conflict was known as the Greater Poland Uprising , and <unk> was the chief leader of Polish insurgent forces in it . Dąbrowski distinguished himself at siege of Tczew , siege of Gdańsk and at Battle of Friedland . 
 In 1807 the Duchy of Warsaw was established in the recaptured territories , essentially as a satellite of Bonaparte 's France . Dąbrowski became disappointed with Napoleon , who offered him monetary rewards , but no serious military or government position . He was also awarded the Virtuti Militari medal that year . Soon , however he set out to defend Poland against an Austrian invasion under the command of Prince Józef Poniatowski in 1809 . Joining the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw shortly after the Battle of Raszyn , he took part in the first stages of the offensive on Galicia , and then organized the defense of Greater Poland . In June 1812 Dąbrowski commanded the 17th ( Polish ) Infantry Division in the V Corps of the Grande Armée , during Napoleon 's invasion of Russia . However , by October the Franco @-@ Russian war was over and the French forces , decimated by a severe winter , had to retreat . At the disastrous Battle of Berezina in late November that year , Dąbrowski was wounded , and his leadership and tactics in it were criticized . After the March reorganization of the Grande Armée , he commanded the 27th ( Polish ) Infantry Division in the VIII Corps . He commanded it at the Battle of Leipzig ( 1813 ) , and subsequently on 28 October he became the commander in chief of the all remaining Polish forces in Napoleon 's service , succeeding Antoni Paweł Sułkowski . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 Dąbrowski always associated independent Poland with a Polish Army , and offered his services to the new power , which promised to organize such a formation : Russia . He was one of the generals entrusted by the tsar Alexander of Russia with the reorganization of the Duchy 's army into the Army of Congress Poland . In 1815 he received the titles of general of cavalry and senator @-@ voivode of the new Congress Kingdom . He was also awarded the Order of the White Eagle on December 9 that year . Soon afterward he withdrew from active politics . He retired in the following year to his estates in <unk> Góra in the Grand Duchy of Posen , Kingdom of Prussia , where he died on 6 June 1818 , from a combination of pneumonia and gangrene . He was buried in the church in <unk> Góra . 
 Over the years , Dąbrowski wrote several military treaties , primarily about the Legions , in German , French and Polish . 
 = = = Remembrance = = = 
 Dąbrowski was often criticized by his contemporaries , and by the early Polish historiography , but his image improved with time . He has been often compared to the two other military heroes of the time of Partitions and the Legions , Tadeusz Kościuszko and Józef Poniatowski , and to the father of Second Polish Republic , Józef Piłsudski . In particular , his mention in the Polish national anthem , also known as Dąbrowski 's <unk> , contributed to his fame in Poland . It is not uncommon for modern works of Polish history to describe him as a " ( national ) hero " . 
 Dąbrowski is also remembered outside of Poland for his historical contributions . His name , in the French version " <unk> " , is inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . 
 = Cape Fear shiner = 
 The Cape Fear shiner ( Notropis <unk> ) is a North American species of freshwater fish in the Cyprinidae family . It is endemic to the central part of the state of North Carolina in the southeastern United States and is only found in the shallow streams of the Cape Fear River basin . The fish is small and yellow with black lips and a black stripe which runs down the middle of the fish 's side . This shiner is normally found in mixed schools with other minnow species . It is unique amongst its genus because it has elongated intestines that are specifically adapted to a primarily herbivorous diet . It can breed twice a year and normally lives for only two or three years in the wild . The males and females are normally similar in appearance but become different colors in the spawning season . This species of shiner was not discovered until 1962 . 
 The shiner is critically endangered due to its small population size and threats to its habitat from dam construction and pollution . It was first recognized as threatened in 1987 . The species has since undergone a successful captive breeding program and its status has been a significant factor in the destruction of a dam that destroyed part of the shiner 's habitat . However , the species is still limited to just five populations in the wild and some experts believe that a single toxic chemical spill into the Cape Fear River could wipe out the entire wild population . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Cape Fear shiner was only discovered in 1962 and described as a distinct species by Franklin F. <unk> , Jr. in 1971 . The specific epithet is derived from the Greek <unk> / <unk> - ' longest / tallest ' or ' very long ' ( a superlative from <unk> / <unk> - length ) and ... cholas / <unk> ' intestines ' or ' bile ' . This fish belongs to the carp and minnow family Cyprinidae , and within this family , it belongs to the genus Notropis , which includes a large number of eastern North American minnows . The Cape Fear shiner is unusual in its genus because its intestines are elongated and more convoluted than those of other Notropis species , a trait shared only by the Ozark <unk> . This feature better adapts the shiner to a diet primarily of plant material . It is superficially different from similar members of its genus because of the angle and size of its mouth , head shape , eight anal fin rays , and black edge on its lower lip . It is also one of the few Notropis to have a black peritoneum . Its closest relatives are the <unk> Shiner and the Sand Shiner . It has no subspecies . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Cape Fear shiner is a small but stocky minnow of about 5 centimeters ( 2 in ) long with a maximum length of 7 @.@ 7 centimeters ( 3 in ) . It is mostly a silvery yellowish shade with a black stripe running down the middle of the fish ’ s side to its caudal peduncle and a lighter stripe above this one . The scales are outlined in black . The shiner 's fins are clear to yellow and moderately pointed . The dorsal fin 's origin is over or slightly before the pelvic fin 's origin . During the spawning season , the males become more golden in color while the females become more silvery . The Cape Fear Shiner 's snout is acute and rounded and has a black upper lip and a lower lip that has a thin black bar stretching across its margin . The upper lip always overhangs above the lower lip . 
 The shiner only has pharyngeal teeth ( teeth located on the back of the fish 's throat on its gill arches ) , similar to the teeth of other omnivorous shiners . The Cape Fear Shiner 's eyes are moderately sized and on the side of the fish 's head . It has eight anal fin rays . The shiner 's distinctive long dark intestines are coiled and visible through the fish 's belly wall and it also has a distinctive black peritoneum . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Cape Fear shiner is endemic to the Upper Basin of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina ’ s Piedmont . Only five wild populations of this fish are known to exist . These populations are found in the freshwater Deep , Haw , and Rocky rivers in Chatham , Harnett , Lee , Moore , and Randolph counties . The largest of these populations is found where the Deep and Rocky Rivers meet . During the winter , shiners may migrate from their shoals in main river channels to smaller tributary streams . This shiner has the smallest range of any Notropis . 
 This minnow typically lives in clean streams over gravel , cobble , and boulder substrates , especially where nearby water willows and <unk> are available to provide protection from predators . The shiner rarely ventures into water deeper than 0 @.@ 5 meters ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) . It has been observed in slow runs , riffles , and slow pools . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 The Cape Fear shiner is often found swimming in mixed schools with other minnow species ; however , it is never the most numerous minnow in a mixed school . It has been known to survive for six years in captivity but are only believed to survive for two or three years in the wild . 
 The Cape Fear shiner 's intestines are adapted to help the fish digest plants and they were initially suggested to be primarily herbivorous because of this adaptation . However , recent studies have shown that the shiner eats a variety of both plant and animal matter . It is known to eat detritus , bacteria , phytoplankton , diatoms , and algae . 
 The shiner is threatened by numerous predators , such as crappie , bass , and the introduced Flathead Catfish . However , the adult Flathead Catfish does not pose a significant threat because of the differences in habitats of the two species within the river ; the juvenile catfish , which share the same habitat as the shiner , may pose a larger threat . 
 This shiner spawns around May 15 when the water temperature reaches 19 ° C ( 66 @.@ 2 ° F ) . A second spawning may occur in the late summer . Both male and female change color while spawning and the male develops a number of small tubercles along its upper body . The shiner generally moves to slower @-@ flowing pools to lay its eggs in rocky substrates . Eggs hatch after three days , although the young generally live off of their egg yolk for another five days . Juvenile shiners are often found in slow @-@ moving water , particularly amongst large rocks in the middle of a stream or in flooded channels and pools . Juveniles sexually mature after their first year . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The Cape Fear shiner is only known from five different populations , two of which are extremely small and run a high risk of extinction . The other three populations are more stable and are estimated to number between 1500 and 3000 individual fish that are reproductively viable . 
 The Cape Fear shiner was recognized as " Endangered with Critical Habitat " on September 25 , 1987 under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 . Since 1987 , the shiner has dwindled both in range and population . This fish is also protected from being captured and traded by the Lacey Act . The shiner is not believed to have had historically large populations . 
 This minnow has been endangered by dam construction on the Cape Fear River , which has led to the flooding and destruction of its shallow water habitat . The small number of geographically separated populations may also threaten the species ’ genetic health , although a 2004 study concluded that genetic diversity was still relatively high . A deterioration of water quality due to pollution at some of the sites has also threatened the shiner . Experiments have shown that the shiner is highly sensitive to contaminating chemicals , and experts believe that the wild population of this species can be wiped out by a single toxic chemical spill . 
 The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been working to protect this species . Some of the conservation methods used to protect this species include studying its biology in the wild and donating $ 16 @,@ 000 in 1998 to help maintain a captive population at the North Carolina Zoo . Since the first successful captive breeding in 1997 , this species has bred easily in captivity . An experiment was carried out in 2001 in which 900 captive @-@ bred shiners were released temporarily into the wild to judge water quality at potential reintroduction sites . 
 In the fall of 2005 , work crews began removing the <unk> Dam , which had destroyed part of the shiner 's habitat . After the work that removed the dam finished in February 2006 , the lake fell back to its historic creek levels , allowing the Cape Fear Shiner to expand its range back into several miles of river that was previously unsuitable for inhabitation because of the dam . In 2009 Deep River 's riverine and riparian habitat was surveyed to identify areas for protection or restoration . 
 = Higher @-@ speed rail = 
 Higher @-@ speed rail ( <unk> ) , also known as high @-@ performance rail , higher @-@ performance rail , or almost @-@ high @-@ speed rail , is a jargon used to describe inter @-@ city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than conventional rail but are not high enough to be called high @-@ speed rail services . The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand the high @-@ speed rail networks . Some countries use the term medium @-@ speed rail , or semi @-@ high speed rail instead . 
 = = Definitions = = 
 As with the definitions of high @-@ speed rail , there is no universal definition of higher @-@ speed rail either . The term has been used by government agencies , government officials , transportation planners , academia , the rail industry , and the media , but sometime with overlaps in the speed definitions . Some countries with an established definition of higher @-@ speed rail include : 
 In Canada , according to the Surface Transportation Policy , Department of Transport , the speed range for higher @-@ speed rail is between 160 and 240 km / h ( 99 and 149 mph ) . 
 In India , according to the Minister of Railways , the speed range for India 's higher @-@ speed rail will be between 160 and 200 km / h ( 99 and 124 mph ) . 
 In Indonesia , the government is considering higher @-@ speed rail options , referred to as medium @-@ speed railway . The speed range is between 200 and 250 km / h ( 120 and 160 mph ) 
 In the United Kingdom , the term higher @-@ speed rail is used for upgraded tracks with train speeds up to 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) 
 In the United States , the term " higher @-@ speed rail " , as opposed to " high @-@ speed rail " , is used by regional planners in many U.S. states to describe inter @-@ city passenger rail services with top speeds of between 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) and 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . This is the equivalent of the definition of " Emerging High @-@ Speed Rail " as defined by the Federal Railroad Administration . However , the Congressional Research Service defines " Higher Speed Rail " as rail services with speeds up to 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) and defines rail services on dedicated tracks with speeds over 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) as " Very High Speed Rail " . 
 State @-@ level departments of transportation and council of governments may use different definitions . Below is the list of known definitions of higher @-@ speed rail which use some of the 5 speed levels , 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) , 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) , 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) and 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) : 
 In Thailand , higher @-@ speed rail , which is called medium @-@ speed rail there , has top speeds of up to 250 km / h ( 160 mph ) . 
 = = Speed limits = = 
 In Canada , the assumption about grade crossing is that operating higher @-@ speed rail services between 160 and 200 km / h ( 99 and 124 mph ) would require " improved levels of protection in acceptable areas " . 
 In the United States , railroad tracks are largely used for freight with at @-@ grade crossings . Passenger trains in many corridors run on shared tracks with freight trains . Most trains are limited to top speeds of 79 mph ( 127 km / h ) unless they are equipped with an automatic cab signal , automatic train stop , automatic train control or positive train control system approved by the Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA ) . In developing higher @-@ speed rail services , one of those safety systems must be used . 
 Additionally , the FRA establishes classification of track quality which regulates the speed limits of the trains with Class 5 , Class 6 , Class 7 and Class 8 for top speeds of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) , 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) , 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) and 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) , respectively . The FRA also regulates passenger train design and safety standards to ensure trains that operate at speeds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) up to 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) comply with its Tier I standard and trains that operate at speeds up to 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) comply with its Tier II standard . 
 Another limitation is the safety of grade crossings which limits how fast the trains can go . FRA regulations set speed limits for tracks with grade crossings as follows : 
 For 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) or less : Grade crossings are permitted . States and railroads cooperate to determine the needed warning devices , including passive <unk> , flashing lights , two quadrant gates ( close only ' entering ' lanes of road ) , long gate arms , median barriers , and various combinations . Lights and / or gates are activated by circuits wired to the track ( track circuits ) . 
 For 110 to 125 mph ( 180 to 200 km / h ) : The FRA permits crossings only if an " impenetrable barrier " blocks highway traffic when a train approaches . 
 Above 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) : No crossings will be permitted . 
 In Europe , the limit is often 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) over grade crossings . In Sweden there is a special rule permitting 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) if there are barriers and automatic detection of road vehicles standing on the track . In Russia 250 km / h ( 160 mph ) is permitted over grade crossings . 
 With the above limitations , many regional transportation planners focus on rail improvements to have the top speeds up to 110 mph when proposing a new higher @-@ speed rail service . 
 = = Similar categories = = 
 In countries where there had been rail improvement projects in the later part of the 20th century and into the 2000s , there are inter @-@ city rail services with comparable speed ranges of higher @-@ speed rail , but they are not specifically called " higher @-@ speed rail " . Below are some examples of such services that are still in operation . 
 Europe : The InterCity services in many European countries have top speeds of mostly up to 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) , but it can go up to 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) Intercity trains that cross international borders are usually designated as <unk> and reach similar speeds where tracks allow it . 
 Japan : The Mini @-@ <unk> in Japan are upgraded lines from narrow gauge to allow Shinkansen to pass through with top speeds of 130 km / h ( 81 mph ) . However , the International Union of Railways recognizes the Mini @-@ <unk> lines as high @-@ speed rail . 
 Spain : Many inter @-@ city rail services operated by Renfe <unk> , the state @-@ owned company , are not classified as high @-@ speed rail . Those services are <unk> , <unk> , Arco and Talgo ( from Talgo III to Talgo VII ) with top speeds of 160 and 200 km / h ( 99 and 124 mph ) 
 In Norway , there is sometimes talked about <unk> <unk> , which may be compared to higher @-@ speed rail as used here – and <unk> , high @-@ speed rail . Most of the rail network is old , with sharp curves , and speeds at only 70 – 130 km / h . The lines around Oslo are upgraded or renewed , or are planned to be so . Some of the sections , like <unk> ( Oslo – Ski , 22 km ) , are built or planned for 250 km / h – though others to <unk> <unk> , i.e. 160 or 200 km / h . By the same token , the Norwegian FLIRT trains and the El 18 locomotives have a top speed at 200 km / h . Gardermobanen is called a high @-@ speed line , and the GMB Class 71 and NSB Class 73 are often called high @-@ speed trains – with 210 km / t top speed . However , the limits are blurry . Sometimes , e.g. the <unk> are called high @-@ speed trains . 
 Sweden : SJ ( Swedish Railways ) operates inter @-@ city rail services using X 2000 trains in major routes across the country with top speeds of 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) . The operator brands it as high @-@ speed rail services ; however , the International Union of Railways only recognizes the 300 km / h ( 190 mph ) line from Stockholm to Malmö and Göteborg as the only high @-@ speed rail line in Sweden which is still in the planning stage . 
 In Germany regional trains along the Munich @-@ Nuremberg high speed line which was built for 300 km / h run at 200 km / h without being specially designated . Those trains use locomotives that are used for Intercity trains elsewhere and the higher speed was chosen mainly to increase capacity . 
 = = Rail improvement strategies = = 
 There are many types of train that can support higher @-@ speed rail operation . Usually , the rail infrastructure needs to be upgraded prior to such operation . However , the requirements to the infrastructure ( signalling systems , curve radii , etc . ) increase much with higher speeds , so an upgrade to a higher @-@ speed standard is often much simpler and less expensive than building new high @-@ speed lines . But an upgrade to existing track currently in use , with busy traffic in some segments , makes challenges associated with the construction work that could potentially disrupt the train services . The followings are some strategies used by regional transportation planners and rail track owners for their rail improvement projects in order to start the higher @-@ speed rail services . 
 = = = Signal upgrades = = = 
 In Australia , the increased top speeds from 130 to 160 km / h ( 81 to 99 mph ) in the Regional Fast Rail project required a change to the signalling system to account for increased braking distance . Prior to the project , the system comprised a mixture of equipment from pre @-@ WWI mechanical signalling to the remote control systems of the 1980s . In some cases , operators needed to telephone the local operators to manually control the signal boxes . With the new speeds , the signalling needed to be computerized . The project employed the Solid State Interlocking with the newly laid fiber @-@ optic communication between the components to use three computer systems to control the signals . When the output of one computer differs from the other two , the system will fail that computer and continue the signal operations as long as the outputs from the other two computers are consistent . The project deployed the Train Protection & Warning System which allows the system to automatically applies the brakes at a sufficient distance to stop the train if the driver does not control the speeds adequately . The project also incorporated Train Control and Monitoring System to allow real @-@ time monitoring of the position of trains . 
 In the United States , the first step to increase top speeds from 79 mph ( 127 km / h ) is to install a new signal system that incorporates FRA @-@ approved positive train control ( PTC ) system that is compatible with higher @-@ speed rail operation . There are both transponder @-@ based and GPS @-@ based PTC systems currently in use in the United States . By a mandate , a significant portion of the railroads in the United States will be covered by PTC by the end of 2015 . 
 = = = Track improvements = = = 
 To support trains that run regularly at higher speeds , the rails need to be reliable . Most freight tracks have wooden ties which cause rails to become slightly misaligned over time due to wood rot , splitting and spike @-@ pull ( where the spike is gradually loosened from the tie ) . The concrete ties used to replace them are intended to make the track more stable , particularly with changes in temperature . Rail joints are also an issue , since most conventional rail lines use bolts and <unk> to join two sections of the rail together . This causes the joint to become slightly misaligned over time due to loosening bolts . To make for a smoother ride at higher speeds , the lengths of rail may be welded together to form continuous welded rail ( <unk> ) . However , the continuous welded rails are vulnerable to stress due to changes in temperature . 
 In Australia , the track condition before the Regional Fast Rail project could only support trains up to speeds of 130 km / h ( 81 mph ) . The tracks are with mixture of wooden and concrete ties . The rail weight varies but with majority being 47 kg / m ( 95 lb / yd ) . The track upgrade in the project included changing to use concrete ties and to use new standard of rail weight at 60 kg / m ( 121 lb / yd ) in order to support the new top speeds of 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) . 
 There may be restriction in maximum operating speeds due to track geometry of existing line , especially on curves . Straightening the route , where possible , will reduce the travel time by increasing the allowable speeds and by reducing the length of track . When straight routes are not possible , reducing the number of curves and lowering the degree of curvature would result in higher allowable speeds on those curves . An example is the elimination of three consecutive reverse curves in favor of one larger curve . Raising <unk> may be considered for sharp curves which significantly limit speed . The higher speeds on those modified curves , together with the higher <unk> , will require track modification to have transition spirals to and from those curves to be longer . 
 Old turnouts may need replacement to allow trains to run through the turnouts at higher speeds . In the United States , some old turnouts have speed limit of 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) . Even with newer turnouts ( rated # 20 ) , the diverging speed limit is still at 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) which would significantly slow down the higher @-@ speed train passing through those sections . High @-@ speed turnouts ( rated # 32 @.@ 7 ) are capable of handling maximum diverging speeds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . 
 In order to minimize the downtime to upgrade tracks , a track renewal train ( TRT ) can automate much of the process , replacing rails , ties , and ballast at the rate of 2 miles per day . In the United States , a TRT is used by Union Pacific Railroad on the track shared with future higher @-@ speed rail service in Illinois area . 
 For electrified track , the old catenary may need to be replaced . The fixed @-@ tension catenary which is acceptable for low speeds may not be suitable for regular higher @-@ speed rail services , where a constant tension is automatically maintained when temperature changes cause the length of the wire to expand or contract . 
 = = = Crossing improvements = = = 
 With trains running at higher speeds throughout the route , safety at all at @-@ grade crossings needs to be considered . 
 In Australia , the levels of upgrade of the crossing in the rail improvements project were based on the risk analysis . The improvements included flashing light protection , automatic full barriers protection , and pedestrian gates crossings . The project also introduced the use of rubber panels at the crossings . 
 In the United States , the FRA limits train speeds to 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) without an " impenetrable barrier " at each crossing . Even with that top speed , the grade crossings must have adequate means to prevent collisions . Another option is grade separation , but it could be cost @-@ prohibitive and the planners may opt for at @-@ grade crossing improvements instead . 
 The safety improvements at crossings can be done using combination of techniques . This includes passive devices such as upgraded signage and pavement markings . Another low @-@ cost passive device is median separators which are installed along the center line of roadways , extending approximately 70 to 100 feet from the crossing , to discourage drivers from running around the crossing gates . More active devices include the four @-@ quadrant gate , which blocks both sides of each traffic lane . Longer gate arms can cover 3 / 4 of the roadway . Video cameras can also be installed to catch the violators . A signal monitoring system can also be installed to alert the crews when the crossing equipment has malfunctioned . 
 In Norway , grade crossings are not permitted at speeds above 160 km / h . 
 = = = <unk> and passing sidings = = = 
 In areas where there is frequent interference between freight and passenger trains due to congestion which causes the passenger trains to slow down , more extensive improvements may be needed . Certain segments of the line in congested areas may need to be rerouted . New track may need to be laid to avoid many curves which slow down the trains . In stretches of heavy freight train traffic , adding passing sidings along the segment should be considered . Sometimes certain stations may need to be bypassed . 
 = = = Electrification = = = 
 Another consideration is electrification . Electrifying a railway line entails a major upgrade to the rail infrastructure and equipment . On the infrastructure side , it requires catenary lines to be built above the tracks . New transmission lines are needed to carry power from the power plants . <unk> are required for each of the 40 @-@ mile ( 64 km ) lengths to reduce severe voltage losses . There is also a need to consider the required amount of power supply and new power plants may be required . For locomotives , new electric locomotives are needed or existing diesel @-@ electric locomotives can be retrofitted into all @-@ electric locomotives , but it is a complicated task . These factors cause electrification to have high initial investment costs . The advantages of all @-@ electric locomotives are that they provide quieter , cleaner and more reliable operations than the diesel @-@ electric counterpart . The fuel consumption , locomotive maintenance costs and track wear of all all @-@ electric locomotives are also lower . Furthermore , electric traction makes the operator more independent of oil price fluctuations and imports , as electricity can be generated from domestic resources or renewable energy . This was a major consideration in the electrification of the GDR network , as lignite ( and therefore electricity ) was cheap and plentiful domestically whereas oil had to be imported at world market prices . 
 An alternative to catenary lines is to use a third rail system which has a semi @-@ continuous rigid conductor placed alongside or between the rails of a railway track . However the operating speeds of this type of systems cannot be greater than 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) due to its limitation of the power supply gaps at turnouts and grade crossings . Therefore , the third rail system is not generally used for higher @-@ speed rail . 
 One example in the United States that does involve electrification is the Keystone Improvement Project to provide higher @-@ speed rail service along the Harrisburg @-@ Pittsburgh segment of the Keystone Corridor in Pennsylvania . The plan includes additional track , a new signal system and electrification . If completed as planned , this would allow Amtrak to utilize electric power continuously on service from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh . The first segment ( " Main Line " ) has already been using electric locomotives with a top speed of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) .

 In 1999 , the concept of Regional Fast Rail project was initiated by the State Government of Victoria with a goal to provide express higher @-@ speed rail services between 4 main regional centres of Victoria ( Geelong , Ballarat , Bendigo and the Latrobe Valley ) and Melbourne . The initiative included a key component to upgrade rail infrastructure to have top speeds up to 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) . The development phase of initiative was between 2000 and 2002 . Finally , the services on four lines began between 2005 and 2006 with top speeds of 160 km / h using <unk> trains . Additionally , Queensland Rail 's Tilt Train and <unk> Prospector are considered to be higher @-@ speed rail .

 Amtrak Cascades , a 467 @-@ mile ( 747 km ) intercity rail service , stretches from Eugene , Oregon , through the State of Washington to Vancouver , British Columbia , in Canada .

However , as of 2012 , the Washington State Department of Transportation plans for its 300 @-@ mile ( 480 km ) stretch to have top speeds of only 79 mph ( 127 km / h ) , and the plan in Oregon is to limit the speeds to 79 mph as well , with safety and other freight service concerns voiced by the track owner , Union Pacific Railroad . This essentially halts the plan to provide a higher @-@ speed rail service on this corridor in the near future .

 The Northern Lights Express project , in the planning stages and proposed to begin construction in 2017 , would upgrade the BNSF trackage between Minneapolis and Duluth to support service up to 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) . 
 Other higher @-@ speed rail proposals are periodically considered , but would need to pass through neighboring states , which have thus far not agreed to cooperate . Minnesota transportation planners proposed a higher @-@ speed rail service called the River Route , with top speeds of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) , between Minneapolis – Saint Paul , Minnesota , and Chicago , Illinois , via Milwaukee , Wisconsin , which follows the Empire Builder route . There is no current progress with the River Route project due to the cancellation of the funding in Wisconsin . 
 Another alternative that has been discussed is to have a new route that heads south to Iowa to join the rail link from Iowa to Chicago . There was a report in 2011 that Iowa would halt its involvement in high / higher @-@ speed rail projects . However , the Iowa Department of Transportation and Illinois Department of Transportation continue to pursue the study of rail link between Chicago and Omaha , Nebraska , through Iowa with top speeds of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . Therefore , the status of the proposal to link Minneapolis – Saint Paul with Chicago via Iowa is unknown .

 In 1998 , New York State initiated a $ 185 million program in partnership with Amtrak to increase the speeds of the Empire Service to 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) by reconstructing all seven gas @-@ turbine Turboliner trainsets , originally built in 1976 – 1977 , to the new RTL @-@ III specification . The reconstructed trains , coupled with track improvements , would cut the travel time between New York City and Albany by 20 minutes . However , the project ran into many problems including issues with the trains and the unsuccessful implementation of required track improvements . New York ended the rehabilitation program in 2005 after spending $ 70 @.@ 3 million . Fallout over the program led to litigation between New York and Amtrak ; Amtrak would eventually pay New York $ 20 million and commit to funding $ 10 million in track improvements .

In the rail plan , there is a multi @-@ phase project to upgrade the rail service from Chicago , Illinois , to Milwaukee and Madison , Wisconsin , with top speeds of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . The latter phases of the project will expand the same service to Minneapolis – Saint Paul in Minnesota and another route to Green Bay , Wisconsin . There was a reaction against the project in 2010 , and the $ 810 million grant the state originally received for the project from the federal government was rescinded . As of 2012 , the rail plan is postponed indefinitely .

 The three Baltic states have been working with the European Union as part of the Trans @-@ European Transport Networks ( TEN @-@ T ) initiative on a study to build a higher @-@ speed rail line in the Rail Baltica corridor to connect Warsaw , in Poland , and Tallinn , in Estonia . 
 = = = Canada = = = 
 For a rail route to connect Windsor , Ontario to Detroit , Michigan in the United States , a higher @-@ speed rail plan was proposed as an alternative after a study on the Windsor to Quebec City route in Canada was to consider only high @-@ speed rail with top speeds of 200 km / h ( 124 mph ) or more . Politicians in Windsor area proposed in 2012 that having higher @-@ speed rail connection between Windsor and Detroit must be part of the consideration . 
 Another feasibility study is ongoing as part of the Northern New England Intercity Rail Initiative to connect between Boston and Montreal trains at top speeds of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) .

 A project to modernize railway network in Greece is ongoing . A new 106 km ( 66 mi ) alignment between <unk> and Domokos is designed to avoid the mountainous part . The new line will have speeds of 160 and 200 km / h ( 99 and 124 mph ) .

 In October 2013 , the Minister of Railways announced at the two @-@ day international technical conference on High Speed Rail Travel ; Low Cost Solution that the focus of India 's rail improvement is to implement a lower cost solution to meet the immediate needs by providing higher @-@ speed rail services as an incremental step before the dedicated track high @-@ speed rail can be achieved . India 's higher @-@ speed rail will be in the range of 160 and 200 km / h ( 99 and 124 mph ) . On 3 July 2014 , a trail run with the new top speeds of 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) was successfully completed on a journey of 200 km ( 120 mi ) between Delhi and Agra . The new service , to be in operation in March 2016 , will cut the travel time from 126 minutes by the current trains with top speeds of 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) down to 99 minutes . 
 = = = Indonesia = = = 
 Before September 2015 , Indonesia had a plan to build its first high @-@ speed rail between Jakarta and Bandung . There were <unk> from China and Japan to build the new rail line . However , on September 4 , 2015 , the government of Indonesia announced the cancellation of the project . The Coordinating Minister for the Economy gave the reason that the distant between the two cities is only 150 km ( 93 mi ) . The short distant would make it hard to sustain the top speeds of 300 km / h ( 190 mph ) which would not justify the high construction cost to build a high @-@ speed rail line . The government now has a focus on medium @-@ speed railway between the two cities which will be in the range of 200 and 250 km / h ( 120 and 160 mph ) .

 = = = = Proposed routes = = = = 
 In addition to ongoing projects , there are proposed routes that have not reached the feasibility study stage yet . In Pennsylvania , a rail advocacy group started fund raising efforts in 2014 to obtain $ 25 @,@ 000 for a preliminary study and additional $ 100 @,@ 000 for feasibility study of the route from Erie to Pittsburgh . The proposal is for 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) express train services to directly link the two cities . An alternative is to have intermediate stops in Ohio cities including Ashtabula , Warren , and Youngstown before heading back to New Castle , Pennsylvania . 
 In Ohio , a rail advocacy group works with local political leaders in Ohio , Indiana and Illinois to consider a higher @-@ speed rail line from Cincinnati to Chicago . This is in response to another advocacy group in Indiana that gained funding for the Columbus , Ohio – Fort Wayne – Chicago route that is already in feasibility study stage . The group persuaded the Hamilton County government in Ohio to advocate for the study . The county commissioners unanimously voted in September 2014 to pursue a feasibility study . As a possible route that goes through the states of Kentucky and Indiana , the county expects that Ohio @-@ Kentucky @-@ Indiana Regional Council of Governments will help fund a feasibility study . 
 In Michigan , a feasibility study sponsored by an environmental group is in progress for a new rail line between Detroit and Grand Rapids . The proposal is to have trains running at speeds between 79 and 110 mph ( 127 and 177 km / h ) . The state transportation department is interested in the study but is not ready to move beyond this study . 
 In Texas , the East Texas Corridor Council proposed a higher @-@ speed rail route between Longview and Dallas . The trains will operate at speeds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . 
 = Manta ray = 
 Manta rays are large rays belonging to the genus Manta . The larger species , M. birostris , reaches 7 m ( 23 ft 0 in ) in width while the smaller , M. alfredi , reaches 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft 1 in ) . Both have triangular pectoral fins , horn @-@ shaped cephalic fins and large , forward @-@ facing mouths . They are classified among the Elasmobranchii ( sharks and rays ) and are placed in the family Myliobatidae ( eagle rays ) . 
 Mantas are found in temperate , subtropical and tropical waters . Both species are pelagic ; M. birostris migrates across open oceans , singly or in groups , while M. alfredi tends to be resident and coastal . They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton , which they swallow with their open mouths as they swim . Gestation lasts over a year , producing live pups . Mantas may visit cleaning stations for the removal of parasites . Like whales , they breach , for unknown reasons . 
 Both species are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Anthropogenic threats include pollution , entanglement in fishing nets , and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine . Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats . They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals , but are more vulnerable closer to shore . Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists . Only a few aquariums are large enough to house them . In general , these large fish are seldom seen and difficult to study . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 The name " manta " is Portuguese and Spanish for mantle ( cloak or blanket ) , a type of blanket @-@ shaped trap traditionally used to catch rays . Mantas are known as " <unk> " because of their horn @-@ shaped cephalic fins , which are imagined to give them an " evil " appearance . 
 Manta rays are members of Chondrichthyes , fish with tough cartilage rather than bone in their skeletons . Mantas are among the Elasmobranchii ( sharks and rays ) , in the superorder <unk> ( rays and skates ) and the order <unk> ( stingrays and relatives ) . The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae , where it is grouped in the subfamily <unk> along with the devil rays . 
 Mantas evolved from bottom @-@ dwelling stingrays , eventually developing more wing @-@ like pectoral fins . M. birostris still has a vestigial remnant of a sting barb in the form of a caudal spine . The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head , while in mantas they are right at the front . Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders . 
 The scientific naming of mantas has had a convoluted history , during which several names were used for both the genus ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> ) and species ( such as <unk> , americana , <unk> and hamiltoni ) . All were eventually treated as synonyms of the single species Manta birostris . The genus name Manta was first published in 1829 by Dr Edward Nathaniel Bancroft of Jamaica . The specific name birostris is ascribed to Johann Julius Walbaum ( 1792 ) by some authorities and to Johann August <unk> ( 1798 ) by others . The name alfredi was first used by Australian zoologist Gerard <unk> , who named the manta after Prince Alfred . 
 Authorities were still not in agreement and some argued that the black color morph was a different species from the mostly white morph . This proposal was discounted by a 2001 study of the mitochondrial DNA of both . A 2009 study analyzed the differences in morphology , including color , <unk> variation , spine , dermal denticles ( tooth @-@ like scales ) and teeth of different populations . Two distinct species emerged : the smaller M. alfredi found in the Indo @-@ Pacific and tropical east Atlantic , and the larger M. birostris found throughout tropical , subtropical and warm temperate oceans . The former is more coastal while the latter is more ocean @-@ going and migratory . 
 A third possible species , preliminarily called Manta sp. cf. birostris , reaches at least 6 m ( 20 ft ) in width , and inhabits the tropical west Atlantic , including the Caribbean . It and M. birostris occur in sympatry . A 2010 study on mantas around Japan confirmed the morphological and genetic differences between M. birostris and M. alfredi . 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 While some small teeth have been found , few fossilized skeletons of manta rays have been discovered . Their cartilaginous skeletons do not preserve well as they lack the calcification of the bony fish . Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known , one from the Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina . Remains of an extinct species have been found in the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina . These were originally described as Manta fragilis but were later reclassified as <unk> fragilis . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Appearance and anatomy = = = 
 Manta rays have broad heads , triangular pectoral fins , and horn @-@ shaped cephalic fins located on either side of their mouths . They have horizontally flattened bodies with eyes on the sides of their heads behind the cephalic fins , and gill slits on their ventral surfaces . Their tails lack skeletal support and are shorter than their disc @-@ like bodies . The dorsal fins are small and at the base of the tail . The largest mantas can reach 1 @,@ 350 kg ( 2 @,@ 980 lb ) . In both species the width is approximately 2 @.@ 2 times the length of the body ; M. birostris reaches at least 7 m ( 23 ft ) in width while M. alfredi reaches about 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) . Dorsally , mantas are typically black or dark in color with pale markings on their " shoulders " . <unk> , they are usually white or pale with distinctive dark markings by which individual mantas can be recognized . All @-@ black color morphs are known to exist . The skin is covered in mucus which protects it from infection . 
 The two species of manta differ in color patterns , dermal denticles , and dentition . M. birostris has more angular shoulder markings , larger ventral dark spots on the abdominal region , charcoal @-@ colored ventral outlines on the pectoral fins and a dark colored mouth . The shoulder markings of M. alfredi are more rounded , while its ventral spots are located near the posterior end and between the gill slits , and the mouth is white or pale colored . The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in M. birostris , while those of M. alfredi are evenly spaced and lack cusps . Both species have small square shaped teeth on the lower jaw but M. birostris also has enlarged teeth on the upper jaw . Unlike M. alfredi , M. birostris has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin . 
 Mantas move through the water by the wing @-@ like movements of their pectoral fins , which drive water backwards . Their large mouths are rectangular , and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward @-@ facing mouths . The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial , and mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills . The cephalic fins are usually spiralled , but flatten during foraging . The fish 's gill arches have pallets of pinkish @-@ brown spongy tissue that collect food particles . Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses . They have one of the highest brain @-@ to @-@ body mass ratios of all fish . Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm . M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m , while their relative <unk> <unk> , which has a similar structure , dives to nearly 2000 m ; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters . 
 = = = Lifecycle = = = 
 Mating takes place at different times of the year in different parts of the manta 's range . Courtship is difficult to observe in this fast @-@ swimming fish , although mating " trains " with multiple individuals swimming closely behind each other are sometimes seen in shallow water . The mating sequence may be triggered by a full moon and seems to be initiated by a male following closely behind a female while she travels at around 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) per hour . He makes repeated efforts to grasp her pectoral fin with his mouth , which may take twenty or thirty minutes . Once he has a tight grip , he turns upside @-@ down and presses his ventral side against hers . He then inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca where they remain for sixty to ninety seconds . The clasper forms a tube which channels sperm from the genital papilla ; a siphon propels the seminal fluid into the oviduct . The male continues to grip the female 's pectoral fin with his teeth for a further few minutes as both continue to swim , often followed by up to twenty other males . The pair then part . For some reason the male almost always grasps the left pectoral fin , and females often have scars that illustrate this . 
 The fertilized eggs develop within the female 's oviduct . At first they are enclosed in an egg case while the developing embryos absorb the yolk . After hatching , the pups remain in the oviduct and receive additional nutrition from milky secretions . With no umbilical cord or placenta , the unborn pup relies on buccal pumping to obtain oxygen . Brood size is usually one or occasionally two . The gestation period is thought to be twelve to thirteen months . When fully developed , the pup resembles a miniature adult and is expelled from the oviduct with no further parental care . In wild populations , an interval of two years between births may be normal , but a few individuals become pregnant in consecutive years , demonstrating an annual ovulatory cycle . The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium has had some success in breeding M. alfredi , with one female giving birth in three successive years . In one of these pregnancies , the gestation period was 372 days and at birth the pup had a width of 192 cm ( 76 in ) and weight of 70 kg ( 150 lb ) . In southern Africa M. birostris males mature at 4 m ( 13 ft ) while females reach maturity slightly over that . In Indonesia , M. birostris males appear to mature at 3 @.@ 75 m ( 12 ft ) while female mature at around 4 m ( 13 ft ) . In southern Africa M. alfredi matures at widths of 3 m ( 10 ft ) for males and 3 @.@ 9 m ( 13 ft ) for females . In the Maldives , male M. alfredi mature at a width of 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 ft 2 in ) while females mature at 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) . In Hawaii , M. alfredi mature at a width of 2 @.@ 8 m ( 9 ft 2 in ) for males and 3 @.@ 4 m ( 11 ft ) for females . Female mantas appear to mature at 8 – 10 years . Manta rays may live for as long as 50 years . 
 = = = Behavior and ecology = = = 
 Swimming behavior in mantas differs across habitats : when travelling over deep water , they swim at a constant rate in a straight line , while further inshore they usually bask or swim idly around . Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50 . They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals . Mantas sometimes breach , leaping partially or entirely out of the water . Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other . These leaps come in three forms : forward leaps where the fish lands head first , similar jumps with a tail first re @-@ entry or somersaults . The reason for breaching is not known ; possible explanations include mating rituals , birthing , communication , or the removal of parasites and commensal <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 As filter feeders , manta rays consume large quantities of zooplankton in the form of shrimp , krill and planktonic crabs . An individual manta eats about 13 % of its body weight each week . When foraging , it slowly swims around its prey , herding it into a tight " ball " and then speeds through the bunched organisms with a wide @-@ open mouth . If a ball is particularly dense , a manta may somersault through it . While feeding , mantas flatten their cephalic fins to channel food into their mouths and the small particles are collected by the tissue between the gill arches . As many as fifty individual fish may gather at a single , plankton @-@ rich feeding site . Mantas are themselves preyed upon by large sharks and by killer whales . They may also be bitten by cookiecutter sharks , and harbor parasitic copepods . 
 Mantas visit cleaning stations on coral reefs for the removal of external parasites . The ray adopts a near @-@ stationary position close to the coral surface for several minutes while the cleaner fish consume the attached organisms . Such visits most frequently occur when the tide is high . In Hawaii , wrasses provide the cleaning ; some species feed around the manta 's mouth and gill slits while others address the rest of the body surface . In Mozambique , sergeant major fish clean the mouth while <unk> concentrate on bite wounds . M. alfredi visits cleaning stations more often than M. birostris . Individual mantas may revisit the same cleaning station or feeding area repeatedly and appear to have cognitive maps of their environment . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Mantas are found in tropical and subtropical waters in all the world 's major oceans and also venture into temperate seas . The furthest from the equator they have been recorded is North Carolina in the United States ( <unk> ) to the north , and the North Island of New Zealand ( <unk> ) to the south . They prefer water temperatures above 68 ° F ( 20 ° C ) and M. alfredi is predominantly found in tropical areas . Both species are pelagic . M. birostris lives mostly in the open ocean , travelling with the currents and migrating to areas where upwellings of nutrient @-@ rich water increase prey concentrations . 
 Fish that have been fitted with radio transmitters have travelled as far as 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) from where they were caught and descended to depths of at least 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . M. alfredi is a more resident and coastal species . Seasonal migrations do occur , but they are shorter than those of M. birostris . Mantas are common around coasts from spring to fall , but travel further offshore during the winter . They keep close to the surface and in shallow water in daytime , while at night they swim at greater depths . 
 = = Conservation issues = = 
 = = = Threats = = = 
 The greatest threat to manta rays is overfishing . M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans , but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires , while M. alfredi is even more localized . Their distributions are thus fragmented , with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations . Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate , overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them . 
 Both commercial and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products . They are typically caught with nets , trawls and harpoons . Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin ; the latter were used as abrasives . Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries , but is unattractive compared to other fish . Demand for their gill rakers , the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills , has recently entered Chinese medicine . To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers , targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines , Indonesia , Mozambique , Madagascar , India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Brazil and Tanzania . Each year , thousands of manta rays , primarily M. birostris , are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers . A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country 's fish markets each year . By comparison , M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites around the world are estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals . Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California , the west coast of Mexico , India , Sri Lanka , Indonesia , and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically . 
 Manta rays are subject to other anthropogenic threats . Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen @-@ rich water over their gills , they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation . Mantas cannot swim backwards and , because of their protruding cephalic fins , are prone to entanglement in fishing lines , nets , and even loose mooring lines . When snared , mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting , tangling themselves further . Loose , trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh , resulting in irreversible injury . Similarly , mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish . Some mantas are injured by collision with boats , especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed . Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change , tourism , pollution from oil spills , and the ingestion of <unk> . 
 = = = Status = = = 
 In 2011 , mantas became strictly protected in international waters because of their inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals . The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale . Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays , the fish often migrate through unregulated waters , putting them at increased risk from overfishing . The IUCN declared M. birostris to be ' Vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction ' in November 2011 . 
 In the same year , M. alfredi was also classified as ' Vulnerable ' with local populations of fewer than 1000 individuals and little or no interchange between subpopulations . The Manta Trust is a UK @-@ based charity dedicated to research and conservation efforts for manta rays . The organization 's website is also an information resource for manta conservation and biology . 
 Besides these international initiatives , some countries are taking their own actions . New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since the introduction of the Wildlife Act in 1953 . In June 1995 , the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts , effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption . The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas . In the Philippines , the taking of mantas was banned in 1998 , but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen . Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002 , and the ban was reintroduced . The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007 . This ban may not be strictly enforced , but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox , an island off the Yucatán Peninsula , where manta rays are used to attract tourists . 
 In 2009 , Hawaii became the first of the United States to introduce a ban on the killing or capturing of manta rays . Previously , there was no fishery for mantas in the state , but migratory fish that pass the islands are now protected . In 2010 , Ecuador introduced a law prohibiting all fishing for manta and other rays , their retention as bycatch , and their sale . 
 = = Relation to humans = = 
 The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped the sea and its animals . Their art often depicts manta rays . Historically , mantas were feared for their size and power . Sailors believed that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors . This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California found them to be placid and that they could interact with the animals . Several divers photographed themselves with mantas , including Jaws author Peter Benchley . 
 = = = Aquariums = = = 
 Due to their size , it is rare for mantas to be kept in captivity and few aquariums currently display them . One notable individual is " Nandi " , a manta ray which was accidentally caught in shark nets off Durban , South Africa , in 2007 . Rehabilitated and outgrowing her aquarium at <unk> Marine World , Nandi was moved to the larger Georgia Aquarium in August 2008 , where she resides in its 23 @,@ 848 @-@ m3 ( 6 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 @-@ US gal ) " Ocean Voyager " exhibit . A second manta ray joined that aquarium 's collection in September 2009 , and a third was added in 2010 . 
 The Atlantis resort on Paradise Island , Bahamas , hosted a manta named " Zeus " which was used as a research subject for three years until it was released in 2008 . The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium also houses manta rays in the " Kuroshio Sea " tank , one of the largest aquarium tanks in the world . The first manta ray birth in captivity took place there in 2007 . Although this pup did not survive , the aquarium has since seen the birth of three more manta rays in 2008 , 2009 , and 2010 . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 Sites at which manta rays congregate attract tourists , and manta viewing generates substantial annual revenue for local communities . Tourist sites exist in the Bahamas , the Cayman Islands , Spain , the Fiji Islands , Thailand , Indonesia , Hawaii , Western Australia and the Maldives . Mantas are popular because of their enormous size and because they are easily habituated to humans . Scuba divers may get a chance to watch mantas visiting cleaning stations and night dives enable viewers to see mantas feeding on plankton attracted by the lights . 
 Ray tourism benefits locals and visitors by raising awareness of natural resource management and educating them about the animals . It can also provide funds for research and conservation . Constant unregulated interactions with tourists can negatively affect the fish by disrupting ecological relationships and increasing disease transmission . At Bora Bora , an excessive number of swimmers , boaters and jet skiers caused the local manta ray population to abandon the area . 
 In 2014 , Indonesia has brought in a fishing and export ban as it has realized that manta ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing the fish to be killed . A dead manta is worth $ 40 to $ 500 while manta ray tourism can bring in $ 1 million during the life of a single manta ray . Indonesia has 2 @.@ 2 million square miles of ocean and this is now the world 's largest sanctuary for manta rays . 
 = Cyclone Sose = 
 Tropical Cyclone Sose was a moderate storm system that chiefly impacted the island nation of Vanuatu in early April 2001 . The developing cyclone was first detected on April 3 , while situated well to the northeast of Vanuatu . As atmospheric conditions became more conducive to intensification , the disturbance gradually consolidated as it drifted toward the west @-@ southwest . After receiving the name Sose on April 5 , the cyclone was driven southeastward , passing just west of Espiritu Santo and neighboring islands . Although it never made landfall , Sose was particularly expansive , producing a wide area of gale @-@ force winds . The cyclone peaked in strength between April 7 and 8 with maximum 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) and 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) , placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale . Ultimately , stronger wind shear and an increasingly hostile upper @-@ air pattern took their toll on the cyclone as it progressed due south ; Sose lost tropical characteristics to the northeast of Norfolk Island by April 12 . The extratropical remnants of Sose continued into the Tasman Sea . 
 Occurring just two months after Cyclone Paula affected Vanuatu , Sose compounded the damage already done by the previous storm , especially to crops and farmlands . Throughout the island chain , two people lost their lives to the storm . Roadways were blocked by debris and floodwaters , while schools and classrooms on several islands were damaged or ruined . The storm destroyed about 200 homes around the nation and damaged many more , particularly on southern Espiritu Santo . The storm 's large fetch generated enormous swells as far away as Australia 's Eastern Seaboard , where surfers took advantage of the abnormally intense conditions and two swimmers drowned . On <unk> Island in New Caledonia , a man was swept away by a large wave and presumed dead . The storm later produced torrential rainfall and strong winds over the North Island of New Zealand , sparking damaging freshwater floods and downing trees and power lines . Hazardous driving conditions in the Waikato region led to a fatal traffic accident in which three people died . Another individual drowned in a swollen river . Sose reportedly contributed to coastal flooding as far away as Tonga . In all , Sose killed nine people ; total monetary damage is unknown . As a result of the storm 's destruction , its name was later retired . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Cyclone Sose originated in a broad area of disturbed weather first identified on April 3 , well to the east @-@ northeast of Vanuatu . The system initially drifted generally toward the west under an improving upper @-@ level wind shear pattern that began to catalyze favorable outflow . Late on October 4 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance , noting strong banding features and a well @-@ defined low @-@ level center of circulation . Tropical Depression 13F formed at 1200 UTC next day as examined by the Fiji Meteorological Service ( FMS ) , the local Regional Specialized Meteorological Center . At the time , the new cyclone was situated about 140 km ( 87 mi ) to the northwest of Espiritu Santo . The JTWC 's official " best track " entry on the storm — designated 19P — first lists it as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on April 4 , though operationally , the agency did not issue its first tropical cyclone warning until late on April 5 . The storm proceeded slowly westward and gradually continued to organize , its intensification hindered by residual wind shear and its proximity to the mountainous terrain of Espiritu Santo . However , convection over the center continued to develop , and consequently the FMS upgraded 13F to Tropical Cyclone Sose at 1800 UTC . 
 Sose remained nearly stationary for a period of 24 hours , blocked by a strong subtropical ridge to the south . Over the course of April 6 , an approaching mid @-@ level trough of low pressure created a weakness in the ridge , allowing Sose to accelerate southeastward . The storm 's environment steadily improved in both the lower and upper levels , triggering the consolidation of deep convection around the center . As a result , early on April 7 , a central dense overcast formed . According to the FMS , Sose reached its peak strength at 1800 UTC , with maximum 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) and a central barometric pressure of 975 hPa ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) . The cyclone passed just to the west of the islands of Vanuatu as its outer bands contracted around the well @-@ defined central dense overcast . A large feeder band persisted on the eastern side of the circulation , bridging the northwestern southeastern quadrants . The feature became a notable aspect of the cyclone 's satellite presentation . The JTWC estimated that 19P reached its peak intensity at 1200 UTC on April 8 , possessing 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) and gusts up to 170 km / h ( 105 mph ) . The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission imaged the storm shortly thereafter , and revealed a distinct eye about 44 km ( 27 mi ) across , bounded on the southern semicircle by strong convection activity . 
 Sose made its closest approach to New Caledonia early on April 8 , passing about 280 km ( 175 mi ) to the northeast . A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient well to the south of Sose 's center , contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale @-@ force winds . In turn , the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path , despite never having made landfall . As it progressed on its southeastward track , the cyclone began to show signs of weakening , at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough . At the same time , a mid @-@ level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south ; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone 's circulation , causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection . Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening , and by early on April 10 , the center had become exposed and ill @-@ defined . Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington , New Zealand , where it continued to deteriorate . The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11 , while the system was located about 335 km ( 210 mi ) northeast of Norfolk Island . TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition . Drifting south @-@ southwestward , the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12 . The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea , where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand 's North Island . Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand .

 Prior to the storm 's passage of New Caledonia , residents there were advised to take basic precautions , such as remaining indoors during bouts of inclement weather . Storm warnings were hoisted over the Loyalty Islands and South Province . Vanuatu 's Department of Meteorology began posting official alerts on April 7 . Warnings for heavy rains and strong winds were posted throughout northern New Zealand in anticipation of the storm 's remnants . With Easter weekend , more motorists were already expected to be traveling longer distances , and officials grew concerned of dangerous effects on traffic from the cyclone . Police increased their presence to unprecedented levels in an attempt to control speeding and other hazardous behaviors . 
 Due to the storm 's " negative impact on one or more countries " , Sose was retired from the cyclical list of tropical cyclone names ; it was replaced with Sarai .

 Sose predominately affected the western islands of Vanuatu , starting from the north . Most severely impacted were the islands of Espiritu Santo , Malakula , Aoba , Efate , <unk> , Tanna , <unk> , and the Shepherd Islands . In several locations , Sose compounded or worsened the destruction wrought by Cyclone Paula in late February and early March . The storm produced significant precipitation , heavy seas , and sustained winds exceeding 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . 
 A resident of Malakula was struck and killed by a falling coconut while seeking shelter from the worsening conditions . Agriculture on nearby <unk> Island , already impaired by Paula , was further compromised ; all crops , both those remaining after Paula and those planted in the intervening time , were destroyed . Four classrooms on the small island were also damaged beyond use . Buildings on Aoba incurred appreciable damage , while on Efate , the storm brought down utility poles , severely damaged local schools , and left roads covered with debris and floodwaters . Flooding in the nation 's capital city of Port Vila forced 50 residents to leave their homes in search of higher ground . Espiritu Santo , particularly the island 's south shore around <unk> , bore the brunt of Cyclone Sose . Several types of crops ( also weakened by Paula ) took a heavy beating , and 60 people had to evacuate due to encroaching floods . In total , the storm demolished 59 houses on the island and in some way damaged another 101 . A young child drowned after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen waterway . Just offshore , the M / V <unk> succumbed to the heavy seas ; all 16 of its occupants successfully swam four hours to shore . 
 Overall , the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office estimated at least 50 % each of food crops and buildings in the hardest @-@ hit provinces were left in a state of damage . The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs considered about 200 residences throughout the island nation " lost " to the storm . The National Disaster Committee met on April 9 to discuss potential emergency aid for residents of the areas hardest hit by cyclones Sose and Paula . Around the same time , the Vanuatu Red Cross stated that it would distribute supplies such as materials for makeshift shelters and water purification tablets . The Red Cross was also to provide 500 bags of rice to villages in the Shepherd Islands . Political unrest on a national level limited the government 's attention to initial recovery ; it did not immediate declare a state of emergency or file any requests for international aid .
