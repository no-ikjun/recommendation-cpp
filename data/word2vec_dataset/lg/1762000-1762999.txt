 [ D ] The Worcester Chronicle appears to have been written in the middle of the 11th century . After 1033 it includes some records from Worcester , so it is generally thought to have been composed there . Five different scribes can be identified for the entries up to 1054 , after which it appears to have been worked on at intervals . The text includes material from Bede 's Ecclesiastical History and from a set of 8th @-@ century Northumbrian annals . It is thought that some of the entries may have been composed by Archbishop Wulfstan . [ D ] contains more information than other manuscripts on northern and Scottish affairs , and it has been speculated that it was a copy intended for the Anglicised Scottish court . From 972 to 1016 , the sees of York and Worcester were both held by the same person — Oswald from 972 , Ealdwulf from 992 , and Wulfstan from 1003 , and this may explain why a northern recension was to be found at Worcester . By the 16th century , parts of the manuscript were lost ; eighteen pages were inserted containing substitute entries from other sources , including [ A ] , [ B ] , [ C ] and [ E ] . These pages were written by John Joscelyn , who was secretary to Matthew Parker . 
 = = = The Peterborough Chronicle = = = 
 [ E ] The Peterborough Chronicle : In 1116 , a fire at the monastery at Peterborough destroyed most of the buildings . The copy of the Chronicle kept there may have been lost at that time or later , but in either case shortly thereafter a fresh copy was made , apparently copied from a Kentish version — most likely to have been from Canterbury . The manuscript was written at one time and by a single scribe , down to the annal for 1121 . The scribe added material relating to Peterborough Abbey which is not in other versions . The Canterbury original which he copied was similar , but not identical , to [ D ] : the Mercian Register does not appear , and a poem about the Battle of Brunanburh in 937 , which appears in most of the other surviving copies of the Chronicle , is not recorded . The same scribe then continued the annals through to 1131 ; these entries were made at intervals , and thus are presumably contemporary records . Finally , a second scribe , in 1154 , wrote an account of the years 1132 – 1154 ; but his dating is known to be unreliable . This last entry is in Middle English , rather than Old English . [ E ] was once owned by William Laud , Archbishop of Canterbury 1633 – 1654 , so is also known as the Laud Chronicle . The manuscript contains occasional glosses in Latin , and is referred to ( as " the Saxon <unk> of <unk> church " ) in an antiquarian book from 1566 . According to Joscelyn , Nowell had a transcript of the manuscript . Previous owners include William Camden and William L 'Isle ; the latter probably passed the manuscript on to Laud . 
 = = = The Canterbury Bilingual Epitome = = = 
 [ F ] The Canterbury Bilingual Epitome : At about 1100 , a copy of the Chronicle was written at Christ Church , Canterbury , probably by one of the scribes who made notes in [ A ] . This version is written in both Old English and Latin ; each entry in Old English was followed by the Latin version . The version the scribe copied ( on folios 30 – 70 ) is similar to the version used by the scribe in Peterborough who wrote [ E ] , though it seems to have been abridged . It includes the same introductory material as [ D ] and , along with [ E ] , is one of the two chronicles that does not include the " Battle of Brunanburh " poem . The manuscript has many annotations and <unk> , some made by the original scribe and some by later scribes , including Robert Talbot . 
 = = = Copy of the Winchester Chronicle = = = 
 [ A2 ] / [ G ] Copy of the Winchester Chronicle : [ A2 ] was copied from [ A ] at Winchester in the eleventh century and follows a 10th @-@ century copy of an Old English translation of Bede 's Ecclesiastical History . The last annal copied was 1001 , so the copy was made no earlier than that ; an episcopal list appended to [ A2 ] suggests that the copy was made by 1013 . This manuscript was almost completely destroyed in the 1731 fire at Ashburnham House , where the Cotton Library was housed . Of the original 34 leaves , seven remain , ff . 39 – 47 in the manuscript . However , a transcript had been made by Laurence Nowell , a 16th @-@ century antiquary , which was used by Abraham <unk> in an edition of the Chronicle printed in 1643 . Because of this , it is also sometimes known as [ W ] , after <unk> . The appellations [ A ] , [ A2 ] and [ G ] derive from Plummer , Smith and Thorpe , respectively . 
 = = = Cottonian Fragment = = = 
 The Cottonian Fragment [ H ] consists of a single leaf , containing annals for 1113 and 1114 . In the entry for 1113 it includes the phrase " he came to Winchester " ; hence it is thought likely that the manuscript was written at Winchester . There is not enough of this manuscript for reliable relationships to other manuscripts to be established . Ker notes that the entries may have been written contemporarily . 
 = = = Easter Table Chronicle = = = 
 [ I ] Easter Table Chronicle : A list of Chronicle entries accompanies a table of years , found on folios 133 @-@ 37 in a badly burned manuscript containing miscellaneous notes on charms , the calculation of dates for church services , and annals pertaining to Christ Church , Canterbury . Most of the Chronicle 's entries pertain to Christ Church , Canterbury . Until 1109 ( the death of Anselm of Canterbury ) they are in English ; all but one of the following entries are in Latin . Part of [ I ] was written by a scribe soon after 1073 , in the same hand and ink as the rest of the Caligula MS. After 1085 , the annals are in various contemporary hands . The original annalist 's entry for the Norman conquest is limited to " Her <unk> <unk> <unk> " ; a later hand added the coming of William the Conqueror , " 7 her com <unk> . " At one point this manuscript was at St Augustine 's Abbey , Canterbury .

 Two manuscripts are recorded in an old catalogue of the library of Durham ; they are described as <unk> duo <unk> . In addition , Parker included a manuscript called Hist . Angliae <unk> in his gifts but the manuscript that included this , now Cambridge University Library MS. <unk> , has lost 52 of its leaves , including all of this copy of the chronicle . 
 = = Use by Latin and Anglo @-@ Norman historians = = 
 The three main Anglo @-@ Norman historians , John of Worcester , William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon , each had a copy of the Chronicle , which they adapted for their own purposes . Symeon of Durham also had a copy of the Chronicle . Some later medieval historians also used the Chronicle , and others took their material from those who had used it , and so the Chronicle became " central to the mainstream of English historical tradition " . 
 Henry of Huntingdon used a copy of the Chronicle that was very similar to [ E ] . There is no evidence in his work of any of the entries in [ E ] after 1121 , so although his manuscript may actually have been [ E ] , it may also have been a copy — either one taken of [ E ] prior to the entries he makes no use of , or a manuscript from which [ E ] was copied , with the copying taking place prior to the date of the last annal he uses . Henry also made use of the [ C ] manuscript . 
 The Waverley Annals made use of a manuscript that was similar to [ E ] , though it appears that it did not contain the entries focused on Peterborough . The manuscript of the chronicle translated by Geoffrey Gaimar cannot be identified accurately , though according to historian Dorothy Whitelock it was " a rather better text than ' E ' or ' F ' " . Gaimar implies that there was a copy at Winchester in his day ( the middle of the 12th century ) ; Whitelock suggests that there is evidence that a manuscript that has not survived to the present day was at Winchester in the mid @-@ tenth century . If it survived to Gaimar 's time that would explain why [ A ] was not kept up to date , and why [ A ] could be given to the monastery at Canterbury . 
 John of Worcester 's Chronicon ex chronicis appears to have had a manuscript that was either [ A ] or similar to it ; he makes use of annals that do not appear in other versions , such as entries concerning Edward the Elder 's campaigns and information about Winchester towards the end of the chronicle . His account is often similar to that of [ D ] , though there is less attention paid to Margaret of Scotland , an identifying characteristic of [ D ] . He had the Mercian register , which appears only in [ C ] and [ D ] ; and he includes material from annals 979 – 982 which only appears in [ C ] . It is possible he had a manuscript that was an ancestor of [ D ] . He also had sources which have not been identified , and some of his statements have no earlier surviving source . 
 A manuscript similar to [ E ] was available to William of Malmesbury , though it is unlikely to have been [ E ] as that manuscript is known to have still been in Peterborough after the time William was working , and he does not make use of any of the entries in [ E ] that are specifically related to Peterborough . It is likely he had either the original from which [ E ] was copied , or a copy of that original . He mentions that the chronicles do not give any information on the murder of Alfred <unk> , but since this is covered in both [ C ] and [ D ] it is apparent he had no access to those manuscripts . On occasion he appears to show some knowledge of [ D ] , but it is possible that his information was taken from John of Worcester 's account . He also omits any reference to a battle fought by Cenwealh in 652 ; this battle is mentioned in [ A ] , [ B ] and [ C ] , but not in [ E ] . He does mention a battle fought by Cenwealh at <unk> , which is not in any of the extant manuscripts , so it is possible he had a copy now lost . 
 = = Importance = = 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle is the single most important source for the history of England in Anglo @-@ Saxon times . Without the Chronicle and Bede 's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ( the Ecclesiastical History of the English People ) , it would be impossible to write the history of the English from the Romans to the Norman conquest ; Nicholas Howe called them " the two great Anglo @-@ Saxon works of history " . It is clear that records and annals of some kind began to be kept in England at the time of the earliest spread of Christianity , but no such records survive in their original form . Instead they were incorporated in later works , and it is thought likely that the Chronicle contains many of these . The history it tells is not only that witnessed by its compilers , but also that recorded by earlier annalists , whose work is in many cases preserved nowhere else . 
 Its importance is not limited to the historical information it provides , however . It is just as important a source for the early development of English . The Peterborough Chronicle changes from the standard Old English literary language to early Middle English after 1131 , providing some of the earliest Middle English text known . Howe notes , in " Rome : Capitol of Anglo @-@ Saxon England " , that many of the entries indicate that Rome was considered a spiritual home for the Anglo @-@ Saxons , Rome and Roman history being of paramount importance in many of the entries ; he cites the one for AD 1 , for instance , which lists the reign of Octavian Augustus before it mentions the birth of Christ . 
 The Chronicle is not without literary interest . Inserted at various points since the 10th century are Old English poems in celebration of royal figures and their achievements : " The Battle of Brunanburh " ( 937 ) , on King Æthelstan 's victory over the combined forces of Vikings , Scots and the Strathclyde Britons , and five shorter poems , " Capture of the Five Boroughs " ( 942 ) , " The Coronation of King Edgar " ( 973 ) , " The Death of King Edgar " ( 975 ) , " The Death of Prince Alfred " ( 1036 ) , and " The Death of King Edward the Confessor " ( 1065 ) .

 An important early printed edition of the Chronicle appeared in 1692 , by Edmund Gibson , an English jurist and divine who became Bishop of Lincoln in that year . Titled <unk> <unk> , it printed Latin and Old English versions of the text in parallel columns and became the standard edition until the 19th century . It was superseded in 1861 by Benjamin Thorpe 's Rolls edition , which printed six versions in columns , labelled A to F , thus giving the manuscripts the letters which are now used to refer to them . 
 John Earle wrote Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel ( 1865 ) . Charles Plummer edited this book , producing a Revised Text with notes , appendices , and glossary in two volumes in 1892 and 1899 . This edition of the A and E texts , with material from other versions , was widely used ; it was reprinted in 1952 .

 Beginning in the 1980s , a new set of scholarly editions have been printed under the series title " The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle : A Collaborative Edition " . Some volumes are still projected , such as a volume focusing on the northern recension , but existing volumes such as Janet Bately 's edition of [ A ] are now standard references . A recent translation of the Chronicle is Michael Swanton 's The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , which presents translations of [ A ] and [ E ] on opposite pages , with interspersed material from the other manuscripts where they differ .

 = Presque Isle State Park = 
 Presque Isle State Park / <unk> / is a 3 @,@ 112 @-@ acre ( 1 @,@ 259 ha ) Pennsylvania state park on an arching , sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie , 4 miles ( 6 km ) west of the city of Erie , in Millcreek Township , Erie County , Pennsylvania , in the United States . The peninsula sweeps northeastward , surrounding Presque Isle Bay along the park 's southern coast . It has 13 miles ( 21 km ) of roads , 21 miles ( 34 km ) of recreational trails , 13 beaches for swimming , and a marina . Popular activities at the park include swimming , boating , hiking , biking , and birdwatching . 
 The recorded history of Presque Isle begins with the Erielhonan , a Native American tribe who gave their name to Lake Erie , and includes French , British , and American forts , as well as serving as a base for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry 's fleet in the War of 1812 . With the growing importance of shipping on Lake Erie in the 19th century , Presque Isle became home to several lighthouses and what became a United States Coast Guard station . In 1921 it became a state park , and as of 2007 it hosts over 4 million visitors per year , the most of any Pennsylvania state park . 
 The Presque Isle peninsula formed on a moraine from the end of the Wisconsin glaciation and is constantly being reshaped by waves and wind . This leads to seven ecological zones within the park , which provide a classic example of ecological succession . A National Natural Landmark since 1967 , the park has been named one of the best places in the United States for watching birds , particularly in the Gull Point Natural Area . The Tom Ridge Environmental Center at the entrance to the park allows visitors to learn more about the park and its ecology . Presque Isle State Park has been chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of " 25 Must @-@ See Pennsylvania State Parks " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early inhabitants = = = 
 Presque Isle was formed at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation about 11 @,@ 000 years ago . The earliest known inhabitants of the southern Lake Erie coast were the Erielhonan , also known as the " <unk> " , an Iroquoian speaking tribe of Native Americans . Erielhonan meant the " Cat " or " Raccoon " people , and the name " Erie " , a corruption of Erielhonan , became the name of the lake and county in which Presque Isle Park is found and of the city nearest the park . 
 An Erielhonan legend taught that the Great Spirit led them to Presque Isle because of the wealth of game , the abundance of clean fresh water , and the cool breezes " coming from the land of snow and ice " ( i.e. Canada ) . Another legend explains how the Erielhonan ventured into Lake Erie in search of the land where the sun set , but the spirit of the lake blew a fierce storm to keep them from finding it . To protect the Erielhonan from the storm , their god laid his outstretched arm into the lake , giving them safety during the storm . The god 's arm remained in the lake , protecting the tribe 's future generations . 
 The Erielhonan are believed to have lived and farmed on the peninsula . They fought several wars , the last starting in 1653 with the Five Nations of the Iroquois . Despite initial victories over the Senecas , in 1654 the Erielhonan their largest village , <unk> ( at the modern city of Erie ) , was destroyed by 1 @,@ 800 Iroquois warriors . By 1656 the Erielhonan were destroyed as a people , although the Iroquois adopted survivors who were absorbed primarily into the Senecas . 
 = = = Forts , settlers , and War of 1812 = = = 
 The French first named the peninsula in the 1720s ; presque @-@ isle means peninsula ( lit . " almost an island " ) in French . They built Fort Presque Isle at the modern city of Erie in the summer of 1753 , naming it for the peninsula that protected the fort . The French also built two " military outposts " on Presque Isle itself : one at the entrance to the peninsula and one at the eastern point . During the French and Indian War , the French abandoned their outposts and burned their fort in 1759 . The British constructed a new fort of the same name that year , which later fell to Native American forces on June 19 , 1763 , during Pontiac 's Rebellion . 
 Presque Isle passed from British to American control after the American Revolutionary War , and the Iroquois sold their rights to the land containing the peninsula to the United States at the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784 . Pennsylvania did not acquire an undisputed title to the land until it purchased the Erie Triangle from the Federal government on April 3 , 1792 . In 1795 General Anthony Wayne built a new , American " Fort Presque Isle " , and on April 18 of that year the town of " Presqu ' Ile " , since renamed Erie , was laid out near it . Wayne died at the fort on December 15 , 1796 , and was originally buried there . 
 Erie County was formed from Allegheny County on March 12 , 1800 . Millcreek Township , which initially contained both the Presque Isle peninsula and village of Erie , was one of the original townships . Erie was named the county seat in 1803 , incorporated as a borough in 1805 , and became a city in 1851 . 
 During the War of 1812 , Presque Isle played a part in the victory over the British in the Battle of Lake Erie . Oliver Hazard Perry , commander of the American fleet , made strategic use of the bay to as a place to construct six of the nine ships in his fleet . Using this location protected the men by creating an obstacle , forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to reach them . 
 The " Little Bay " near the tip of the peninsula where the ships sheltered , next to the current Perry 's Monument , was later named " Misery Bay " because of the hardships during the winter of 1813 – 1814 , after the men returned there from battle . Many men suffered from smallpox and were kept in quarantine near the bay . A great many infected men died and were buried in what is now called Graveyard Pond . 
 After the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10 , 1813 , Perry 's two largest ships were badly damaged , and the US Brig Lawrence was intentionally sunk in Misery Bay . The Lawrence was raised in 1875 but was burned while on display at the 1876 Centennial Exposition . The US Brig Niagara was initially repaired , then sunk for preservation in 1820 and raised in 1913 , and parts of it were eventually used in the current Niagara , based across Presque Isle Bay in Erie .

 The Presque Isle peninsula forms Presque Isle Bay , which serves as a natural harbor for Erie . During the 19th century , as Lake Erie navigation grew more important , shipping aids were built on Presque Isle . As of 2007 , two main lighthouses can be found in the park . The Erie Harbor North Pier Light began as a wooden tower , erected in 1830 . In 1858 , a stronger steel structure was brought from France and installed at Erie to replace the wooden beacon , which had been damaged by a schooner . This light still stands at the far eastern side of the park , near the inlet between the lake and the bay . 
 The Presque Isle Light was constructed in 1872 on the north side of Presque Isle and was lit on July 12 , 1873 . This light is 74 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 23 m ) , with a red brick house that was used as a lighthouse keeper residence , and later a park residence . Today the lighthouse is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and flashes a white light to warn ships of the sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie . The light station is open to public tours from Memorial Day through Labor Day on weekends , weather permitting ( see <unk> ) . A third , smaller lighthouse was built in 1906 by the Erie Waterworks on the Presque Isle Bay side of the peninsula . Today it stands in the ferry landing for the Presque Isle Water Taxi service , south of the former waterworks along the state park 's multi @-@ purpose trail on the southeast side of Presque Isle . 
 United States Life @-@ Saving Service District 9 opened a life @-@ saving station at Presque Isle in 1876 . William Clark was the keeper from 1877 until he drowned in 1891 . He was succeeded by Andrew Jansen , who was the keeper until 1914 . When the Life @-@ Saving Service and the Revenue Cutter Service merged in 1915 to become the United States Coast Guard , <unk> Presque Isle , also called the Erie life @-@ saving station , became Coast Guard Station # 236 . The station , still in operation , is assigned to the Ninth District of the United States Coast Guard .

 In 1908 , Erie started building a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh water for the city . Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula , where particulates in the water were allowed to settle , removing them from the lake water . After treatment , the water flowed into the waterlines of the city . In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built : this pumped the water from one basin into the other , then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie . This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949 . The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and <unk> @-@ rentals within the state park . 
 As Pennsylvania 's only surf beach , the Presque Isle beaches were already a popular attraction when the state legislature authorized the creation of the " Pennsylvania State Park at Erie " in May 1921 . Oversight was given to the new " State Park and Harbor Commission of Erie " , including local representation , instead of to the state Department of Forests and Waters . Presque Isle quickly became the most popular state park in Pennsylvania . Presque Isle was an early example of locating state parks near cities , a trend that would become prevalent statewide only in the 1960s . 
 The first paved road was built in the park in 1924 , and today 13 miles ( 21 km ) of roads run through the park . Pennsylvania Route 832 is the main road into the park , and is subsequently known as Peninsula Drive . Presque Isle has been referred to as " Peninsula State Park " . The Perry Monument in the park was constructed in 1926 near Misery Bay and the burials in Graveyard Pond . 
 By 1937 official state publications were referring to the park as " Presque Isle State Park " , and that same year it led the state park system with 1 @.@ 4 million visitors . In the 1950s the peninsula was enlarged to accommodate new roads and parking , using 3 million square yards ( 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 m2 ) of sand dredged from the interior of the peninsula . The resulting basin became the current marina . Other new facilities included three modern bath houses built in 1957 . That same year Gull Point ( at the eastern end of the peninsula ) was named a nature preserve by the state . 
 Presque Isle was named a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1967 . A recommendation was made to abolish the independent board as early as 1930 , although this did not come about until January 19 , 1971 , with the creation of the state Department of Environmental Resources ( which later became the DCNR ) . From 1989 to 1992 , over 50 breakwaters were built along the western and northern shore of the peninsula to help control erosion . In 1997 the park 's Important Bird Area ( IBA ) was one of the first 73 IBAs established in Pennsylvania . As part of the State Parks 2000 strategic plan of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources ( DCNR ) , Gull Point was named a " State Park Natural Area for rare and migratory shorebirds to rest , feed and possibly nest " . 
 The Tom Ridge Environmental Center at the entrance to the park opened in May 2006 . As of 2007 , the Pennsylvania DCNR Bureau of Parks , which administers all 120 Pennsylvania state parks , had chosen Presque Isle for its " 25 Must @-@ See Pennsylvania State Parks " list , citing its status as Pennsylvania 's only surf beach , its status as a National Natural Landmark , and its " geological and biological diversity and its historic significance " . Scenes for the film The Road were shot at Presque Isle in April 2008 , with Beach 10 used as a seashore . 
 A weak tornado touched down in the state park on June 27 , 2010 . Rated an EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale , it downed power lines and trees near the Stull Interpretive Center , and also damaged a nearby observation platform . Presque Isle was closed on June 28 to facilitate clean @-@ up of the debris and reopened the next morning . 
 During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 , parts and remnants of the storm reached Presque Isle . The park was closed in preparation of the storm and waves for 14 – 18 feet were called for , along with high winds . The storm was expected to be severe , but luckily was not . Only 8 foot waves were recorded and not as high of winds either . The park made it out with only minor flooding , a few downed trees , and the loss of power at the park marina . 
 = = Geology and climate = = 
 Presque Isle is a recurved , sand spit that formed during the last glacial period , or ice age , when the Laurentide Ice Sheet advanced into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie , and , when it retreated to the north between 12 @,@ 370 BC and 12 @,@ 790 BC , left behind a moraine consisting of clay , sand , and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula . The deposits are constantly being re @-@ worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift . 
 The French term <unk> 'île , the origin of the park 's name , means " peninsula " , or , literally , " almost an island " . Despite the name , Presque Isle has been an island for brief periods of time after it has been cut off from the mainland several times since 1819 — the longest stretch was from 1832 to 1864 . In the 1950s to combat erosion , the state and federal governments built sets of concrete seawalls and perpendicular groins . In 1992 , a series of 58 breakwaters were also constructed to have capture sand and significantly slowed its movement eastward . Even with the substantial engineering projects , sand has to be relocated from <unk> that form behind the breakwaters , and new sand has to be brought in annually to replenish the beaches . 
 Presque Isle protects the natural Presque Isle Bay , which creates a deep and wide harbor for the city of Erie . The bay is often filled with pleasure craft as well as cargo ships from all over the world that use the Great Lakes shipping port . Erie became an international port after the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959 . 
 Owing to the parks location relative to Erie , its climate is similar to that of the city . Erie and the peninsula are located in a snow belt that stretches from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown ; accordingly , its winters are typically cold , with heavy lake @-@ effect snow , but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt . The Erie region lies in the humid continental zone ( Köppen Dfa ) . Presque Isle 's lakeside location helps to temper summer heat , with an average of only 3 @.@ 8 days of 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) + highs annually , and the highest temperature ever recorded was 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) on June 25 , 1988 ; there is an average of 2 @.@ 5 days with lows of 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) or colder annually , and the lowest temperature ever recorded was − 18 ° F ( − 28 ° C ) on January 19 , 1994 and February 16 , 2015 . Ice dunes typically form along the beaches in the winter from snowfall and frozen spray , and normally reach a height over 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . The dunes protect the beaches from erosion during winter storms , and continue growing until the surface of Lake Erie freezes in the winter . 
 = = Flora , fauna , and habitat = = 
 = = = Ecological zones and succession = = = 
 According to the DCNR , because it has so " many unique habitats , Presque Isle contains a greater number of the state 's endangered , threatened and rare species than any other area of comparable size in Pennsylvania . " The DCNR recognizes seven different ecological zones within Presque Isle State Park , each with a different plant and animal community . These zones are : Lake Erie ; the beaches and shoreline ; sandy plain and ponds ; sand dunes and ridges ; marshes and old ponds ; heath and sub @-@ climax forest ; and the climax forest . Lake Erie , which surrounds the park , is the first zone and is home to 80 species of fish and at least six species of crustaceans . 
 The remaining ecological zones , with their progression from shoreline to climax forest , are a classic illustration of the concept of ecological succession . Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting shoreline and dunes . The shoreline , the second zone , is formed by wave action and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition , with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new shoreline . The newly formed sandy plain and the ponds formed in it are the third zone . The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind @-@ blown sand or drifting dunes . The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals : for example , the state park is home to 89 species of Odonata ( dragonflies and damselflies ) and Lepidoptera , including 35 different butterflies , as well as 84 different sorts of spiders . 
 Sand dunes and ridges are the fourth zone , formed when beach sand transported by wind and waves becomes trapped by vegetation . Dunes grow and are stabilized by grasses , followed by other types of vegetation . This provides habitat for amphibians , birds , mammals , and reptiles . Old dunes can become more permanent ridges , which shelter ponds . These dunes , ridges , and ponds are often remnants of previous shorelines ; at the Presque Isle State Park " Long Pond " just east of the marina , dunes and ridges mark the eastern shoreline from 1862 . The fifth ecological zone consists of old ponds and marshes . Ponds protected by dunes and ridges are more stable ; these old ponds support more plant and animal life , and as they fill with vegetation , they become marshes . Old ponds and marshes have high biodiversity . Nearly 400 species of terrestrial vertebrates live on Presque Isle , including 318 different birds , 48 kinds of mammals , 13 types of amphibians , and 19 reptile species . 
 The sixth and seventh ecological zones are characterized by their shrubs and trees , and Presque Isle State Park is home to 633 plant species ( 195 monocotyledons , 410 dicotyledons , 5 gymnosperms , 5 horsetails , 13 ferns , and 5 mosses ) . The sixth zone , thicket and sub @-@ climax forest , forms when shrubs grow on dying marshes , followed by small trees . The trees shade and thin out the thickets of shrubs , leading to a sub @-@ climax forest . The seventh and final stage is climax forest , where many large trees form a canopy . If left undisturbed , this ecological succession is believed to take between 500 and 600 years , although visitors to parts of Presque Isle State Park can walk through all of these zones in 5 miles ( 8 km ) . 
 The Pennsylvania Audubon Society has listed the park as Pennsylvania Important Bird Area ( IBA ) # 1 , and it considered one of the best birdwatching sites on Pennsylvania . The diversity of habitats on the peninsula makes it an ideal home for over 320 species of birds . ( For comparison , the United States has about 925 bird species . ) Forty @-@ five of the bird species found in the park are listed as " endangered " or " threatened " , including the piping plover , cerulean warbler , rusty blackbird and saltmarsh sharp @-@ tailed sparrow . Waterfowl and wading birds live at Presque Isle year round . Four species of gull and three species of tern can be seen at Gull Point during the summer months . The majority of collection during the annual Christmas Bird Count , which has been held in Erie County since 1956 , is garnered from observations made by volunteers within the park . Many different species of plants and animals can also be found at Presque Isle State Park due to the wide variety of ecological zones . 
 = = = Gull Point Natural Area = = = 
 Human beings have played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan . The natural drift of sand is hindered or stopped by breakwaters , permanent structures , and roads . Roads also do not absorb rainwater , causing erosion , and break up natural habitats . Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats , but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones . One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans : it is the easternmost part of the park , Gull Point . 
 Gull Point at Presque Isle State Park has been set aside as a Pennsylvania " State Park Natural Area " . These areas provide locations for scientific observation of natural systems ; they protect examples of natural interest and beauty as well as examples of unique and typical animal and plant habitats . 
 Gull Point covers 319 acres ( 129 ha ) , of which 67 acres ( 27 ha ) form the Natural Area and are closed to park visitors during the height of the bird migrations . The natural area is a safe haven and resting spot for migrating and nesting birds . Many of the species of birds that rest at Gull Point are not seen anywhere else in Pennsylvania . Presque Isle lies on the Atlantic Flyway , a major migratory path , and some of these birds migrate from as far north as the Arctic Circle to South America . They pass through in November on their long flights south and return in April on their flights north . 
 Erosion and deposition of sand , which has formed Gull Point , continues to change it . From May 1991 to October 2006 , Gull Point lost a total of 4 @.@ 6 acres ( 1 @.@ 9 ha ) , and if this trend continues , it may become an island . After the breakwaters were constructed in 1992 , less sand was added to replenish the beaches . Federal funding of sand replenishment has been cut off since 2005 , leading to further reduction in sand added to the peninsula . Without new sand , erosion has reduced the northern beaches of Gull Point , even while regions to the east and south have continued to grow at a slower rate , for a net yearly loss of 0 @.@ 4 acres ( 0 @.@ 2 ha ) . 
 = = Tom Ridge Environmental Center = = 
 The Tom Ridge Environmental Center ( TREC ) is the gateway to and administrative center for Presque Isle State Park , as well as housing interactive educational exhibits , a " Discovery Center " , classrooms , and research laboratories . The Center , which officially opened on May 26 , 2006 , is on 12 acres ( 5 ha ) just off Route 832 on a bluff overlooking Lake Erie . TREC is named for former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge , " who grew up in Erie , worked at the park as a young man and provided funding for the center and numerous Presque Isle projects during his administration . " 
 Construction on the center began in 2002 , although the idea for such a center at Presque Isle was some 50 years old . The Presque Isle State Park headquarters began operating from TREC in 2005 , and it is also home to offices for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection 's Great Lakes and Coastal Zone Management programs , the DCNR Recreation and Conservation program , as well as Presque Isle Audubon , Lake @-@ Erie Allegheny Earth Force , Pennsylvania Sea Grant , Presque Isle Partnership , and the Purple Martin Conservation Association . The Regional Science Consortium , " a collaborative , non @-@ profit organization that focuses on and coordinates educational and research projects for Lake Erie and the upper Ohio River Basin " , was organized in 2002 and is based at TREC . Its 32 member organizations include schools , school districts , colleges , universities , museums , state agencies , conservation groups , and private corporations from Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Ontario . 
 Facilities at the 65 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 6 @,@ 000 m2 ) Tom Ridge Environmental Center include eight research laboratories ( including several large aquariums ) for the RSC , several classrooms , a " Discovery Center " for younger students to explore science hands @-@ on , interpretive exhibits highlighting local and regional flora and fauna , as well as the human history and culture of the area . The center also offers a large @-@ format movie theater , a smaller theater , gift shop , cafeteria , and a 75 @-@ foot ( 23 m ) tall observation tower that overlooks Lake Erie . The center was constructed as a " green " building and has received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) rating from the United States Green Building Council . Besides supporting environmental research and education , the center is meant to " increase off @-@ season use " of the state park . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 In addition to the facilities at TREC , Presque Isle State Park provides opportunities for daytime recreational activity along the Lake Erie and Presque Isle Bay coastlines , as well as on its inland trails and lagoons . Boating , canoeing , fishing , and water skiing are common summer sports , while hiking , biking , inline skating , and bird watching are some of the inland activities . Ice fishing , ice boating , ice skating , and cross @-@ country skiing occupy winter visitors . Two of the beaches feature volleyball courts ; Beach 6 has 6 courts and Beach 11 has one . No admission fee is charged for the park or TREC . 
 Boats of nearly any variety are permitted on Lake Erie at Presque Isle State Park . Boats with internal combustion engines are prohibited in the interior lagoons , except for Grave Yard Pond , where a concession rents motor and pontoon boats , canoes , and kayaks for recreational use . The park also has a 500 @-@ slip marina , open to boats up to 42 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 13 m ) , and five boat launches . Boat tours provide views of the park , lake , bay , and Erie skyline . All boats must have a current registration from any state . Water conditions on Lake Erie can change with little notice , and boaters are asked to use caution . 
 Water skiing and scuba diving are permitted at Presque Isle State Park in designated waters of Lake Erie . Water skiing must take place in Presque Isle Bay or out on Lake Erie and is prohibited within 500 feet ( 150 m ) of the shore . Scuba divers must be certified and are required to register at the park office to obtain information on the waters that are open to diving . 
 Presque Isle State Park has two distinct fishing zones . Lake Erie is home to perch , trout , walleye , bass , and steelhead . Presque Isle Bay is the home of muskellunge , northern pike , crappie , smelt , as well as other fish that swim in from the lake . Trout fishing is also allowed in the two waterworks basins , which are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission . Hunting is prohibited at Presque Isle State Park with the exception of controlled duck and goose hunting seasons in designated blinds . 
 Presque Isle State Park , which has 13 beaches , is home to the only surf swimming in Pennsylvania . Beaches are open from Memorial Day to Labor Day with swimming permitted when lifeguards are on duty from 10 : 00 EDT to 20 : 00 EDT . Extensive picnic facilities are available at most of the swimming areas .

 = Arp2 / 3 complex = 
 Arp2 / 3 complex is a seven @-@ subunit protein complex that plays a major role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . It is a major component of the actin cytoskeleton and is found in most actin cytoskeleton @-@ containing eukaryotic cells . Two of its subunits , the Actin @-@ Related Proteins <unk> and <unk> closely resemble the structure of monomeric actin and serve as nucleation sites for new actin filaments . The complex binds to the sides of existing ( " mother " ) filaments and initiates growth of a new ( " daughter " ) filament at a distinctive 70 degree angle from the mother . Branched actin networks are created as a result of this nucleation of new filaments . The regulation of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton is important for processes like cell locomotion , phagocytosis , and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles . 
 The Arp2 / 3 complex was named after it was identified by affinity chromatography from <unk> <unk> , though it had been previously isolated in 1989 in a search for proteins that bind to actin filaments in Drosophila melanogaster embryos . It is found in most eukaryotic organisms , but absent from a number of <unk> and plants . 
 = = Mechanisms of actin polymerization by Arp2 / 3 = = 
 Many actin @-@ related molecules create a free barbed end for polymerization by <unk> or severing pre @-@ existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores . However , the Arp2 / 3 complex stimulates actin polymerization by creating a new nucleation core . Actin nucleation is an initial step in the formation of an actin filament . The nucleation core activity of Arp2 / 3 is activated by members of the <unk> @-@ Aldrich syndrome family protein ( WASP , N @-@ WASP , WAVE , and <unk> proteins ) . The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2 / 3 complex to create a nucleation core . However , de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks , since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre @-@ existing filaments . Thus , the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to pre @-@ existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton . Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent <unk> and thus conserve the actin filament . 
 The Arp2 / 3 complex simultaneously controls nucleation of actin polymerization and branching of filaments . Moreover , autocatalysis is observed during Arp2 / 3 @-@ mediated actin polymerization . In this process , the newly formed filaments activate other Arp2 / 3 complexes , facilitating the formation of branched filaments . 
 The mechanism of actin filament initiation by Arp2 / 3 has been disputed . The question is where the complex binds the filament and <unk> a " daughter " filament . Historically two models have been proposed . Recent results , and the balance of opinion in the field , favour the side branching model , in which the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the side of a pre @-@ existing ( " mother " ) filament at a point different from the nucleation site . Although the field lacks a high @-@ resolution crystal structure , data from electron microscopy , together with biochemical data on the filament nucleation and capping mechanisms of the Arp2 / 3 complex , favour side branching . In the alternative barbed end branching model , Arp2 / 3 only associates at the barbed end of growing filaments , allowing for the elongation of the original filament and the formation of a branched filament . This model , which is based on kinetic analysis and optical microscopy , is decreasingly favoured by the field . 
 = = Cellular uses of Arp2 / 3 = = 
 The Arp2 / 3 complex appears to be important in a variety of specialized cell functions that involve the actin cytoskeleton . The complex is found in cellular regions characterized by dynamic actin filament activity : in <unk> cups , in the leading edge of motile cells ( <unk> ) , and in motile actin patches in yeast . In mammals and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum it is required for phagocytosis . The complex has also been shown to be involved in the establishment of cell polarity and the migration of <unk> monolayers in a wound @-@ healing model . In mammalian oocytes , the Arp2 / 3 complex is involved in oocyte asymmetric division and polar body emission , which result from the failure of spindle migration ( a unique feature of oocyte division ) and cytokinesis . Moreover , enteropathogenic organisms like Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella use the Arp2 / 3 complex for actin @-@ <unk> dependent rocketing movements . The Arp2 / 3 complex also regulates the intracellular motility of endosomes , lysosomes , <unk> vesicles , and mitochondria . Moreover , recent studies show that the Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for proper polar cell expansion in plants . Arp2 / 3 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana result in abnormal filament organization , which in turn affects the expansion of trichomes , pavement cells , hypocotyl cells , and root hair cells . 
 = Bridge near Limyra = 
 The Bridge near Limyra ( in Turkish : <unk> <unk> , " Bridge of the Forty Arches " ) is a late Roman bridge in Lycia , in modern south @-@ west Turkey , and one of the oldest segmented arch bridges in the world . Located near the ancient city of Limyra , it is the largest civil engineering structure of antiquity in the region , spanning the Alakır Çayı river over a length of 360 m ( 1 @,@ 181 @.@ 1 ft ) on 26 segmental arches . These arches , with a span @-@ to @-@ rise ratio of 5 @.@ 3 : 1 , give the bridge an unusually flat profile , and were unsurpassed as an architectural achievement until the late Middle Ages . Today , the structure is largely buried by river sediments and surrounded by greenhouses . Despite its unique features , the bridge remains relatively unknown , and only in the 1970s did researchers from the Istanbul branch of the German Archaeological Institute carry out field examinations on the site . 
 = = Field examinations = = 
 No information on the bridge survives from ancient sources . The first descriptions appear in European travellers ' accounts from the 19th century . The British archaeologist Charles Fellows was the first to explore the region of Lycia , and visited the bridge in May 1840 . Fellows , as well as <unk> Spratt and Edward Forbes , who visited the site two years later , describe it as having 25 arches . In 1882 , an Austrian expedition , including Otto <unk> , interpreted the structure as part of an ancient road that connected Limyra with the city of Attaleia ( modern Antalya ) to the east . However , this mission failed to produce any plans or sketches of the site . 
 The first , and as of 2008 only scientific examination of the bridge was undertaken by the German archaeologists Wolfgang W. Wurster and Joachim Ganzert in two successive days in September 1973 , and completed through further visits in subsequent years . Their findings were published in 1978 in the <unk> Anzeiger journal of the German Archaeological Institute , with the express intent of bringing the imperiled state of the hitherto almost intact bridge into the spotlight : 
 Recently , citrus fruit plantations were created in this fertile bottomland ; greenhouses for early vegetables are now being built east of the bridge . The bridge is greatly endangered through the beginning of intensive cultivation in the vicinity . The locals strip the still intact bridge surface for stones ; bulldozers employed to build irrigation canals rip the structure apart and crush the stone pavement with their caterpillar tracks . 
 In 1993 , the civil engineer Colin O 'Connor summarized their report in his English @-@ language monograph on Roman bridges , and also emphasized the exceptional character of this bridge . No further scientific examinations of the Limyra Bridge are known . 
 = = Location and situation = = 
 The bridge crosses the Alakır Çayı stream , whose ancient name is unknown , 3 @.@ 2 km ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) east of the ruins of Limyra ( distance measured from the city 's theatre ) and 3 @.@ 8 km ( 2 @.@ 4 mi ) north of the modern coastline , close to the modern road from <unk> to <unk> . The local topography is dominated by the foothills of the <unk> Dağı mountains , which blend here with the alluvial bottomlands of the Bay of <unk> . In this transitional area , the bridge was built immediately above the point where the narrow river valley opens into the wide estuary plain , and where the crossing of the river during the rain period would be obstructed by high water . While the eastern end of the bridge levels off at the gravel plain , the western end abuts directly to the rising rock wall of the mountain , presumably for protection against floods . The resulting sharp bend in the course of the road could also be exploited in case of need to block the road . A modern dam , Alakır <unk> , was constructed upstream for irrigation purposes and flood protection . 
 Lycia did not , in contrast to other Roman provinces , possess a very developed road system . While the north – south traffic was conducted primarily through the few river valleys , the east – west routes led , unlike today , mostly on and along the mountain ridges . This particular road , leading from Limyra over the Alakır Çayı and into the neighbouring region of Pamphylia and Attaleia , must have been of special importance , since the two regions were united in a single province , Lycia et Pamphylia , until the 4th century . In comparison to the main arterial roads of the Roman Empire however , the roads of Lycia were , with 3 – 4 m ( 9 @.@ 8 – 13 @.@ 1 ft ) width , rather modest and confined to pedestrian and pack animal traffic . This is further corroborated by the fact that no wagon ruts are evident on the paving of the Limyra bridge , nor any traces of a parapet or breastwork . 
 = = Construction = = 
 With a length of 360 m ( 1 @,@ 181 @.@ 1 ft ) , the Limyra Bridge qualifies as the largest surviving engineering achievement of antiquity in Lycia . The bridge stands on 26 uniform segmental arches consisting of a double , radially laid course of bricks . At the eastern end , the original 27th arch has been replaced by two smaller , semicircular arches of later construction . The latter are built with a single course of bricks . Traces of the original , flat beginning of the collapsed arch are still visible on the piers . 
 At the time of Wurster 's and Ganzert 's visit to the site , the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the springing line of the vaults . No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert . Only two of the 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements of the clear span and the pier width could be undertaken . It was , however , possible to calculate the dimensions of the remaining bays from their exposed sections . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 = = = = Arches and piers = = = = 
 The spans of the arches ranged from 11 @.@ 60 m ( 38 @.@ 1 ft ) to 14 @.@ 97 m ( 49 @.@ 1 ft ) ( arches 2 and 26 respectively ) . Based on the size of the spans , one can distinguish four groups , with the following median values : 
 11 @.@ 60 – 12 @.@ 30 m ( 38 @.@ 1 – 40 @.@ 4 ft ) for four arches ( Nos. 2 , 3 , 7 , 21 ) 
 12 @.@ 75 m ( 41 @.@ 8 ft ) for fourteen arches ( Nos. 5 , 9 – 15 , 17 – 19 , 22 – 24 ) 
 13 @.@ 10 m ( 43 @.@ 0 ft ) for four arches ( Nos. 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) 
 13 @.@ 60 m ( 44 @.@ 6 ft ) for three arches ( Nos. 16 , 20 , 25 ) 
 The reason for this grouping is unclear ; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match the lay of the river bed . The differences however could point to the repeated use of differently @-@ sized falsework structures in the construction of the barrel vaults ( see animation below ) . 
 Only in a single case , between arches 26 and 27 , were Wurster and Ganzert able to determine the breadth of a pier : 2 @.@ 10 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) . <unk> this value from the common arch span of 12 @.@ 75 m ( 41 @.@ 8 ft ) , a clear span of 10 @.@ 65 m ( 34 @.@ 9 ft ) remains . Since all arches have a rise of ca . 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) , the Limyra Bridge has an unusually large span @-@ to @-@ rise ratio of 5 @.@ 3 to 1 . Such flattened arches were very rare at the time for stone bridges , and were not matched and surpassed until the reappearance of segmental arch bridges in 14th century Italy . For the largest arch in the Limyra Bridge , the ratio is even greater , spanning a width 6 @.@ 4 times its height . The two later arches , in contrast , are , with a ratio of 2 @.@ 7 : 1 , quite ordinary semi @-@ circular arches . 
 = = = = Height = = = = 
 The total height of the bridge could not be determined because most of the structure is silted up . However , the distance between the arches ' abutments and the pavement surface could be determined at only 3 @.@ 25 m ( 10 @.@ 7 ft ) . 
 The surface level is almost horizontal : the roadway lies at a height of 20 @.@ 05 – 20 @.@ 55 m ( 65 @.@ 8 – 67 @.@ 4 ft ) above sea level between arches 1 to 20 , and falls slightly in its eastern section , between arches 21 and 26 to a level of 19 @.@ 94 to 19 @.@ 66 m ( 65 @.@ 4 to 64 @.@ 5 ft ) . Since there is no indication of a later sinking of the structure , this nearly uniform height indicates careful levelling and the existence of solid pier foundations . In contrast , the lengthwise axis of the bridge displays often significant deviations from arch to arch . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Remarkably , the support line of the structure 's dead load is almost identical with the curve of the vault arch . The <unk> analysis of the bridge proves the structure 's great load capacity : 
 In modern classification , the bridge would be able to support loads of a Class 30 bridge ( per DIN 1072 ) ; this would mean , that it could support a 30 @-@ tonne vehicle on one arch and additionally on the remaining surface of the arch a load of 500 <unk> / m ² . The bridge was thus very safe for ancient traffic . 
 = = = Materials = = = 
 The Limyra bridge was built in a composite manner of brick , stonemasonry , and rubble . 
 = = = = Arches = = = = 
 The bricks of the segmental arches are made of yellow @-@ red clay , mixed with fine brick fragments . The bricks are rectangular plates , measuring ca . 40 cm × 50 cm ( 15 @.@ 7 in × 19 @.@ 7 in ) and 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . They are placed with the shorter side upright facing outwards , so that the total thickness of the arches measures ca . 80 cm . The bricks are bound with grout of lime mortar mixed with brick shards and fine gravel , forming 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) -thick joints . The two later semi @-@ circular arches were built with smaller bricks , although surviving bricks from the original arch were re @-@ used at places . The abutment stones are dressed limestone ashlar blocks , and form a sloping surface to support the arches . 
 The double @-@ layer technique facilitated a more effective use of the falsework , since they could be removed and used elsewhere as soon as the lower course was finished : 
 The construction of the two layers of the double brick @-@ arches in two separate phases had two advantages . In the first phase , the falsework only had to carry the weight of the lower course , so that it could itself be of lighter construction . In the second phase , the weight of the upper layer could be already borne by the lower vault ; the falsework was thus already available for use in a different arch . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 As far as can be determined , between arches 2 to 21 , the outer facing of the superstructure consists of four layers of brick , followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar . In contrast , between arches 22 and 26 , as well as in both ramps on either end , the facing consists of ashlar blocks . The two repaired arches 27a and <unk> are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles . In arch 26 , the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework . 
 The interior of the superstructure consists of a combination of unworked masonry blocks and large river boulders , bound with lime mortar . 
 = = = = Pavement = = = = 
 The bridge surface is located only 30 – 40 cm ( 11 @.@ 8 – 15 @.@ 7 in ) over the arches ' apex , is 3 @.@ 55 – 3 @.@ 70 m ( 11 @.@ 6 – 12 @.@ 1 ft ) wide , increasing towards either end at 4 @.@ 30 m ( 14 @.@ 1 ft ) and projects ca . 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) over the superstructure on either side . It is paved with large and irregular limestone cobblestones , although smaller pebbles have been used in the repairs at the two semicircular arches . 
 = = Dating = = 
 The exact chronological placement of the Limyra bridge is difficult due to its unique place within Roman engineering tradition and the lack of comparable structures . Wurster and Ganzert used following characteristics as a starting point : 
 multiple arches of same width , and horizontal deck level with only small @-@ gradient ramps on either end 
 very flat segmental arches built with double , radially layered brick courses 
 the use of mortar in the stonework 
 exterior facing primarily rough masonry with interspersed bricks , partly dressed ashlar blocks 
 exceptionally large paving stones . 
 In contrast to these , most Roman stone bridges were faced with ashlar and rested on <unk> arches , a method which is dominant in other vaulted structures in Lycia too . Compared to the massive and tall semicircular @-@ arched bridges that are typical of Roman architecture , the Limyra bridge , with its flat segmented arches , offers a markedly lower and more elongated appearance , so that Wurster and Ganzert offer a " provisional " late dating , approximately during the reign of emperor Justinian I in the 6th century , during which the use of mixed brick and stone is attested in other structures of the region . 
 On the other hand , this mixed technique is already present in the 3rd @-@ century AD aqueduct of Aspendos , and the Romans certainly knew how to build segmented @-@ arched bridges , as attested by surviving examples , three of which are listed by Wurster and Ganzert themselves . An earlier construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD cannot therefore be excluded . The case for an earlier construction date has been strengthened in recent years with the discovery of further seven Roman segmented arch bridges . The remnants of the nearby <unk> Bridge over the river Xanthos , which dates to the 3rd century and has some architectural similarities with the Limyra bridge , could further reinforce that case .

 " Hard " is a song by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna from her fourth studio album , Rated R ( 2009 ) . The song was written by Terius Nash , Christopher Stewart , Rihanna , and Jeezy , with vocals performed by the latter two . Nash and Stewart produced it under their stage names , The @-@ Dream and Tricky Stewart . " Hard " was sent to radio by Def Jam Recordings on November 10 , 2009 , as the second United States single from Rated R. It is a hip hop song and features military horns , hissing synthesizers , sharp beats and piano chords . Upon its release , it received critical acclaim , with critics praising Rihanna 's vocal performance and Jeezy 's collaboration . 
 The song became Rihanna 's thirteenth top ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 , matching Beyoncé as the female artist with the most US top ten songs since 2000 . It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . An accompanying music video , directed by Melina Matsoukas , was filmed in Los Angeles in December 2009 . In the video , Rihanna commands an army while clothed in stylized military costumes . Critics praised the video and noted a difference from her previous clips . After the video premiere , the song charted in Canada , New Zealand and the United Kingdom . Rihanna performed " Hard " at Jay @-@ Z 's concert at UCLA Pauley Pavilion and at the 2009 American Music Awards .

In an interview with MTV , Rihanna explained that while she was in Paris , Christopher " Tricky " Stewart and The @-@ Dream played a few songs for her , which included " Hard " . Rihanna decided to record the song because it was different from her normal creative output . Stewart , in an interview with Rap @-@ Up , spoke about the song before its title or any details were released , describing the song as " edgy " and a " club banger " . When asked if the song was bigger than Rihanna 's commercially successful song " Umbrella " , he said , " No , it 's different . It 's a superstar taking a step in a totally different direction . " " Hard " is the first song for which Jeezy was credited thus , instead of under his enduring stage name " Young Jeezy " . 
 " Hard " incorporates musical elements of hip hop and is four minutes and ten seconds long . It features militant horns , hissing synths , sharp beats and piano notes . It is written in the key of B minor and set in common time with a pop and R & B groove and a tempo of 91 beats per minute . Rihanna 's vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of G3 to the high note of B4 . As noted by Ailbhe Malone of NME , Rihanna adopts Jay @-@ Z 's vocal style in the lyric , " Brilliant , resilient , fan mail from 27 million . " " Hard " is a song about emulating power and strength , and how Rihanna assumes a role of being the best at what she does . Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media wrote that the song is " a strutting statement of power " .

Herrerra continued , " Though ' Hard ' doesn 't find Rihanna in her typical comfort zone , the atypical is precisely what she has aimed for with her new material — and it works " . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called " Hard " and " Rude Boy " the highlights of Rated R , and wrote , " both of which exploit Rihanna 's most appealing vocal style , a sulky , icy , monotone " . Petridis also noted that the song " undercuts the standard <unk> of Hard — ' fan mail from 27 million ' " . Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented on Rihanna 's vocal style and the persona she adopts in the song . Greenblatt wrote , " Rihanna dons hip @-@ hop swagger like borrowed armor , leaning heavily on her Caribbean accent and unleashing a string of baddest @-@ bitch boasts via dancehall @-@ riddim 'd bangers like ' Hard , ' ' G4L , ' and ' Wait Your Turn ' " .

 The music video for " Hard " was directed by Melina Matsoukas and released in December 2009 . It was the first Rihanna video directed by Matsoukas , who would go on to direct videos for " Rude Boy " and " Rockstar 101 " . Before the premiere of the video , Rihanna told Kyle Anderson of MTV News : " It 's couture @-@ military . Everything is surrounded by the whole idea of something military . We have tanks , we have troops , we 've got helicopters , we 've got explosions . [ ... ] Tight gear , lots of cute outfits , lots of bullets . Crazy . " 
 The video 's first scene is set in a desert at night . Rihanna , wearing a garrison cap , sunglasses , and a stylized white top , stands in front of an army . This scene is intercut with scenes of Rihanna in a bunker ; she wears an army hard hat , pink lace up boots , and a skin @-@ colored top with small black rectangles covering her breasts . Half way through the first verse , the scene changes to a daytime desert scene in which Rihanna wears a low cut , short black dress with spiked shoulder pads , and walks through the location as small explosions occur around her . 
 As the first chorus begins , earlier scenes from the video are intercut with each other ; Rihanna is shown commanding her troops , firing a machine gun , and dancing in the bunker . As the second verse begins , Rihanna is seen with slicked @-@ back hair wearing a metal bikini top , rolling in mud and surrounded by troops on a stone structure before a mountainous backdrop . She is shown gambling with ( and winning against ) soldiers in another bunker . 
 As the second chorus starts , Rihanna , wearing a bullet bra and a helmet similar in appearance to the ears of Mickey Mouse , stands on a pink army tank . During Jeezy 's rap verse , Jeezy is seen in the middle of a crosshair , and explosions occur around Rihanna . During the bridge and final chorus of the song , scenes of Rihanna from throughout the video are intercut with each other . In this sequence , Rihanna wears a high @-@ waisted black bikini and waves a large black flag with a white " R " in the middle of it .

 Peter Gaston of Spin wrote that the video for " Hard " resembles " Janet Jackson 's ' Rhythm Nation ' meets Christina Aguilera 's ' Dirrty ' phase — Rihanna vamps in dimly lit outposts , dodges explosions in the desert , and , quite enticingly , takes a break from boot camp to smother herself with mud . Morale @-@ boosting , indeed ! " James Dinh of MTV News showed the video , on a small player , to fans in Times Square in New York City to ask their opinions . Most said she looked " sexy " in the video , and agreed that it was different from previous videos and shows where she came from and where she is going in her personal life . Bill Lamb of About.com wrote , " I must confess that I do fail to understand the point of Rihanna humping the gun turret of a pink tank dressed in Mickey Mouse ears . It seems pains were taken to make the setting look like Afghanistan or Iraq with the other actors looking as close to real military personnel as possible . " Lamb criticized the video 's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war , saying , " Does Def Jam , Rihanna 's label , need to be reminded that this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30 @,@ 000 troops from our country to real war ? In my mind this is one of the most tasteless , offensive moves by a major pop artist in recent memory . "

 = Mork Goes Erk = 
 " Mork Goes Erk " is the seventeenth episode of the first season of Mork & Mindy . The episode first premiered on ABC on February 8 , 1979 . " Mork Goes Erk " was later released on VHS on January 1 , 1998 as part of a two @-@ episode special which also included " Mork 's First Christmas , " and on DVD on September 7 , 2004 as part of the " Mork & Mindy - The Complete First Season " DVD boxed set . 
 In the episode , David Letterman portrayed a self @-@ help group leader by the name of " Ellsworth " offering ERK or Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning . Mork ( Robin Williams ) and Mindy ( Pam <unk> ) attend one of Ellsworth 's trainings at the suggestion of their friend Susan ( Morgan Fairchild ) , where they endure Ellsworth 's authoritarian brand of group therapy . Mork points out hypocrisy in Ellsworth 's teachings , and exposes him as a fraud . The episode has been called a parody of the Erhard Seminars Training or " est " course . The episode received mostly positive reviews , and was highlighted as one of the season 's best episodes , along with " Mork 's First Christmas " and " Mork 's Mixed Emotions " . David Letterman 's performance as " Ellsworth " also received good reviews . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the beginning of the episode , Mork , Mindy and Bickley ( Tom Poston ) are all sitting around feeling depressed . Mindy has just learned that Mork 's supervisor Orson has arranged for Mork to be transferred to another planet , and Bickley is suffering from writer 's block . Their friend Susan comes by to visit , and suggests that they all go and attend a seminar on Ellsworth 's Revitalization Konditioning . As the guests arrive at the seminar , Ellsworth nervously asks Susan if all of the attendants ' checks are in order . He then lays out the rules for the duration of the training , which includes no leaving and no consumption of alcohol . When Bickley hears this , he promptly gets up to leave the seminar . 
 The attendants of the seminar are then given Ellsworth 's harsh version of reality , which has been compared to the tenets of Erhard Seminars Training . Ellsworth preaches a belief in self @-@ adoration , which he says will get rid of emotional highs and lows . Ellsworth centers this goal around the notion of " finding our own space . " He utilizes an authoritarian style of control within the group , as a therapeutic method to solve problems . The other attendees at the seminar are shown to be passive consumers looking for any way to fix their personal issues . However , Mork , with his trademark causing of difficulty , begins to question the foundation of the rules of the course , as well as the nature of the philosophical material that Ellsworth has put forth , by pointing out hypocrisy among Ellsworth 's own contradictory statements . In the end , Mork wins out over the Ellsworth philosophy by instead calling to mind universal humanistic moral values . Ellsworth dismisses Mork 's victory over his methodology , exclaiming : " I 've got my Rolls @-@ Royce ! " Mork wins a moral victory @-@ and <unk> , it turns out , has had his Rolls @-@ Royce stolen .

 In a 1982 article in the journal Theory & Society , Lewis & Clark College sociology professor Robert Goldman compared and contrasted Letterman 's " Ellsworth " character and his training program to that of Werner Erhard 's course Erhard Seminars Training . Goldman noted that the episode spent time : " lampooning Werner Erhard and est @-@ like commercial pop psychologies . " However , Goldman went on to note that the inherent problem with " Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning " was not the training - but Ellsworth himself . 
 Ellsworth is seen as a parody of consumerism : " As the self @-@ help entrepreneur , Ellsworth is portrayed as a walking collection of lifestyle @-@ status points and sign @-@ values ... Conspicuous consumption and commodity fetishism define his personality . " Goldman explained that the Mork and Mindy episode succeeded in distinguishing between criticism of the Ellsworth training , and criticism of Ellsworth , citing Ellsworth 's character traits of : " tyranny , selfishness , open greed , and flaunting of the accoutrements of his vulgar money @-@ making .

 TV Guide 's 2005 book TV Guide : The Ultimate Resource to Television Programs on DVD highlighted " Mork Goes Erk " as one of three " Classic Episodes " of the first season , including " Mork 's First Christmas " , and " Mork 's Mixed Emotions " . Matthew Tobey of Allmovie wrote that the episode was most notable because of David Letterman 's appearance before he became more well known . Donald Liebenson of Amazon.com also cited David Letterman 's performance as : " an abusive EST @-@ like guru " as one of the more memorable parts of the Season One DVD boxed set , but thought that the highlight of the season was the episode " Mork 's Mixed Emotions . " The Dallas Morning News also praised Letterman 's performance as a " shady motivational speaker , " commenting that the episode was a way for Letterman to hone his " smarminess " before his later work on Late Show with David Letterman . Jonathan Boudreaux of <unk> described Letterman as " a <unk> EST @-@ like guru , " and called the episode itself " disjointed . "

 In 1998 , Minogue was dropped from her label Deconstruction following the poor commercial performance of her sixth studio album Impossible Princess . She instead signed on to Parlophone and released her seventh studio album Light Years . The disco and Europop inspired album was a critical and commercial success , and was later certified four times @-@ platinum in Minogue 's native country Australia for shipment of 280 @,@ 000 units , and platinum in the United Kingdom for shipment of 300 @,@ 000 units . " Spinning Around " was released as the lead single off the album and was a commercial success , attaining a platinum certification in Australia for shipment of 70 @,@ 000 units , and a silver certification in the United Kingdom for shipment of 200 @,@ 000 units . She promoted the album by embarking on the On a Night Like This tour . 
 Soon after , Minogue began work on her eighth studio album Fever . On the album , she collaborated with producers and writers such as British singer @-@ songwriter Cathy Dennis , who co @-@ wrote two songs out of the three she co @-@ produced , Rob Davis , who co @-@ produced and co @-@ wrote three songs , and Richard Stannard and Julian Gallagher , who co @-@ produced and co @-@ wrote three songs . In the vein of Light Years , Fever is a disco and dance @-@ pop album that contains elements of adult contemporary and club music . The recording of the album took place at studios such as the Biffco Studios in Dublin , Hutch Studios in Chicago , Olympic Studios in London and Stella Studios . 
 = = Musical styles and lyrical content = = 
 Fever is primarily a dance @-@ pop album , with prominent elements of 1970s @-@ influenced disco and Europop . Jacqueline Hodges from BBC Music wrote that the album is not " pure pop " , and is rather characterized by a more adventurous dance @-@ oriented sound . NME critic Alex Needham identified a " filter disco effect " , described as " the one that sounds like you 've gone under water and then ecstatically come up for air , " working on various songs on the album . Needham saw Fever as an " update " from the " frothy disco " of Light Years . Songs like the opening track " More More More " and closing track " Burning Up " are examples of the disco @-@ influenced production of the album . The former is an uptempo song with a " funky " bassline , while the latter was described as a " slow burn " disco song . Teen pop elements appear on songs like " Love at First Sight " , which begins with an electric piano intro , and the " aggressive " " Give It to Me " . The lead single " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " is a " robotic " midtempo dance and nu @-@ disco song . Many critics felt that various songs on the album , particularly " Come into My World " , are similar to " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " . The title track and " Dancefloor " draw influences from synthpop and club music , respectively . " In Your Eyes " contains hints of techno and disco music . Minor influences of ambient music surface on the " atmospheric " " Fragile " . Minogue 's vocal delivery ranges from " sensuous " ( in " More More More " ) to " sweet " ( in " Your Love " ) . The latter track contains instrumentation from an acoustic guitar . Jason Thompson from PopMatters commented that Minogue " knows how to express herself through irresistible melodies and seductive emoting " , such as on the title track , which makes use of " suggestive panting " . Unlike Minogue 's previous studio efforts , Fever does not contain any ballads . 
 The lyrical content of Fever chiefly focuses on themes of love and enjoyment . Thompson described the album to be " all about dancing , fucking , and having a good time " . In the song " Love at First Sight " , Minogue describes how she fell in love with her partner at " first sight " and how it led to good things happening for her . " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " was termed a " mystery " as the singer never mentions who the her object of desire in the song is . Lynskey Dorian from The Guardian suggested that Minogue refers to either " a partner , an evasive one @-@ night stand or someone who doesn 't know she exists " as her obsession . The production of " Give It to Me " contrasts with its lyrics : Minogue urges her partner to " slow down , " but the beat " goes in the opposite direction and tells your body to push it a little more on the dance floor . " The lyrics of " Fragile " are simple and aim directly at the " [ listener 's ] heart " . " Come into My World " is a " plea for love " as Minogue invites her partner into her life . On the other hand , " Dancefloor " focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship , with Minogue celebrating a break @-@ up by " lose [ ing ] it in the music " .

 Following its release , Fever reportedly sold over six million copies worldwide , becoming Minogue 's highest selling album , as of today . The album 's lead single " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " peaked atop charts in 40 countries and sold more than five million copies worldwide , becoming Minogue 's highest selling single to date and one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time . The song is notable for being Minogue 's biggest and strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States , a region in which Minogue previously had managed to achieve little success . It is also considered to be Minogue 's signature song . Due to the single 's commercial impact , the album enjoyed similar success in the United States and earned Minogue her only platinum album certification in the region . According to the IFPI , Fever was the thirtieth best @-@ selling album globally in the year 2002 . 
 Fever is considered to be a prominent example of Minogue 's constant " reinventions " . The image she adopted during this period was described by Baker as " slick , minimalist and postmodern " , and it was seen as a step forward from the " camp @-@ infused " tone of Light Years . Larissa Dubecki from The Age used the term " nu @-@ disco diva " to describe Minogue during this period . Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that Minogue 's public image and her persona in her music videos " presented herself as a mechanical muse whose every gesture snapped and locked into place with the sound of a vacuum seal " . He further remarked that the singer 's " hygienic coo summoned a cool sort of cyborg soul , and her videos showed her gliding through sleek <unk> , tonguing the sweet @-@ and @-@ sour tang of a techno kiss " . Adrien Begrand from PopMatters felt that the simplicity of the album made it a " classy piece of work " and commented that Minogue 's experience and choice of collaborators resulted in " the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless , brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [ Spears ] and Christina [ Aguilera ] " . Robbie Daw from Idolator pointed out that Britney Spear 's recording of her 2004 hit " Toxic " , Madonna 's comeback album Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) , Paris Hilton 's musical debut Paris ( 2006 ) , and radio stations ' shift towards playing " more groove @-@ oriented sounds " all followed the release of Fever , although he admitted that " we have no way of knowing whether Kylie Minogue 's eighth studio album was directly responsible for these pop happenings " . Chris True from AllMusic , in his biography of Minogue , commented that the release of the album and lead single " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " cemented her position as an international music icon , saying " Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001 , and she would be reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well " . 
 Fever also brought Minogue a number of accolades and award nominations . At the 2002 ARIA Music Awards ceremony , the album won the awards for " Best Pop Release " and " Highest Selling Album " , and garnered a nomination in the category of " Album of the Year " . At the same ceremony , " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " won the awards for " Single of the Year " and " Highest Selling Single " , and Minogue won the " Outstanding Achievement Award " . At the 2002 Brit Awards ceremony , Fever won the award for " Best International Album " , while Minogue was nominated for " Best International Female Solo Artist " and " Best Pop Act " , winning the former . At the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony , the album was nominated for " Best Album " ; Minogue was nominated for " Best Female Act " , " Best Dance Act " , and " Best Pop Act " , winning the latter two . During this period , Minogue earned her first Grammy Award nomination when " Love at First Sight " was nominated in the category of " Best Dance Recording " at the 2003 award ceremony , although it lost to British electronic band Dirty Vegas 's song " Days Go By " . She eventually won a Grammy Award when " Come into My World " was nominated in the same category at the 2004 award ceremony . It marked the first time an Australian music artist had won an award in a major category at the American award show since Australian rock band Men at Work won the award for " Best New Artist " in 1982 . The song is Minogue 's only Grammy award winning song to this date .

 = USS Massachusetts ( BB @-@ 59 ) = 
 USS Massachusetts ( BB @-@ 59 ) , known as " Big Mamie " to her crewmembers during World War II , was a battleship of the second South Dakota class . She was the seventh ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the sixth state , and one of two ships of her class ( along with her sister Alabama ) to be donated for use as a museum ship . Massachusetts has the distinction of having fired the US Navy 's first and last 16 @-@ in ( 406 mm ) shells of the war . 
 During World War II Massachusetts was initially assigned to duty in the Atlantic Fleet during which she successfully crippled the Vichy French battleship Jean Bart in a gun duel during Operation Torch . Transferred to the Pacific fleet in 1943 , Massachusetts participated in the Solomon Islands campaign and the Philippines Campaign , and in the latter campaign took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf . In 1945 she was one of several ships assigned to shell targets on Honshū , the largest of the Japanese Home Islands . Following the end of World War II , Massachusetts was involved in routine operations off the US coast and eventually reassigned to the Atlantic fleet . Decommissioned in 1947 , she was laid up in the reserve fleet at Norfolk , Virginia until stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 1962 . 
 In an effort to spare the battleship from scrapping , citizens of Massachusetts pooled resources to raise money for her transfer to the Massachusetts Memorial Committee , and in 1965 the Navy formally donated the battleship to the committee . Massachusetts was towed to Battleship Cove , Fall River , Massachusetts , and formally opened as a museum ship on 14 August 1965 .

 Massachusetts was one of four fast battleships of the South Dakota class to be authorized for construction by the United States Congress in 1938 . Her keel was laid down on 20 July 1939 at the Fore River Shipyard of Quincy , Massachusetts . She was launched on 23 September 1941 sponsored by Mrs. Charles Francis Adams , wife of a former Secretary of the Navy . She was commissioned on 12 May 1942 at Boston , Massachusetts , Captain Francis E. M. Whiting in command . 
 Massachusetts 's main battery consisted of nine 16 in ( 410 mm ) / 45 caliber Mark 6 guns in three triple turrets ( two superfiring turrets forward , the third turret mounted aft of the main superstructure ) that were capable of firing 2 @,@ 700 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 200 kg ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) Mark 8 shells . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty 5 " / 38 caliber guns , which could hit targets up to 9 miles ( 14 km ) away . For defense against air strikes , Massachusetts was fitted with an anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) battery of 0 @.@ 50 cal machine guns and 1 @.@ 1 " / 75 caliber guns . With a wholesale shift to air power at the dawn of World War II came the imperative to gain and maintain air superiority in order to protect the growing fleet of Allied aircraft carriers . By the end of the war Massachusetts sported an array of Oerlikon 20 mm and quadruple Bofors 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns .

 After a shakedown cruise , Massachusetts set sail from the United States on 24 October 1942 . Four days later she joined a task force forming to support the invasion of North Africa , where she served as the flagship for Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt during Operation Torch . 
 Early in the morning on 8 November the Naval Battle of Casablanca began . Lying off the city , Massachusetts , the heavy cruisers Tuscaloosa and Wichita and four destroyers , came under fire from four 194 mm ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) and four 138 mm ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns in a shore battery at El Hank . The American ships responded by shelling Jean Bart , an incomplete French battleship forced to sail from Saint @-@ Nazaire in May 1940 to escape advancing Axis forces . When engaged , Jean Bart had only one of her two quadruple turrets installed , the other having its guns lost to torpedo attack while in shipment from France . 
 Massachusetts began firing at 07 : 04 at a range of 22 @,@ 000 m ( 72 @,@ 000 ft ) ; she continued until 08 : 33 with a seven @-@ minute halt from 07 : 40 to 07 : 47 . A total of nine full broadsides and thirty @-@ eight volleys varying between three and six guns were fired , five rounds hit Jean Bart. One , at 08 : 06 , disabled her operational turret , others struck docks and merchant ships , sinking two . 
 With the help of the heavy cruiser Tuscaloosa , Massachusetts next targeted French destroyers in the fray , sinking Fougueux and Boulonnais as well as the light cruiser Primauguet . Along with shore batteries , she shelled an ammunition dump . Massachusetts was hit twice by the battery at El Hank , but sustained only superficial damage . By the end of the engagement she had fired 786 of the 800 rounds of 16 inch ammunition she carried , or 98 % of her complement . 
 After a cease @-@ fire , she headed for the United States on 12 November and prepared for deployment to the Pacific . 
 = = Pacific war = = 
 Massachusetts arrived at Nouméa , New Caledonia on 4 March 1943 . For the next few months , she operated in the South Pacific , protecting convoy lanes and supporting operations in the Solomon Islands . From 19 – 21 November , she sailed with an aircraft carrier group striking Makin , Tarawa , and <unk> in the Gilbert Islands . On 8 December , Massachusetts along with five other fast battleships ( USS Indiana ( BB @-@ 58 ) , USS North Carolina ( BB @-@ 55 ) , USS South Dakota ( BB @-@ 57 ) , USS Washington ( BB @-@ 56 ) , and USS Alabama ( BB @-@ 60 ) ) , bombarded Nauru Island , an enemy phosphate @-@ producing center , causing severe damage to shore installations there . 
 The Navy now drove steadily across the Pacific . On 30 January 1944 , Massachusetts bombarded Kwajalein , and she covered the landings there on 1 February . With a carrier group she struck against the Japanese stronghold at Truk on 17 February . That raid not only inflicted heavy damage on Japanese aircraft and naval forces , but also proved to be a stunning blow to enemy morale . On 21 – 22 February , Massachusetts helped fight off a heavy air attack on her task group while it made raids on Saipan , Tinian , and Guam . She took part in the attack on the Caroline Islands in late March and participated in the landing of US troops at Hollandia on 22 April . Upon retiring from Hollandia , Massachusetts and the other ships of Task Force 38 ( TF 38 ) staged another attack on Truk . 
 Massachusetts shelled Ponape Island on 1 May , her last mission before sailing to Puget Sound to overhaul and <unk> her gun barrels , now well @-@ worn . On 1 August , she left Pearl Harbor to resume operations in the Pacific war zone . She departed the Marshall Islands on 6 October , sailing to support the landings in Leyte Gulf . In an effort to block Japanese air attacks in the Leyte conflict , she participated in a fleet strike against Okinawa on 10 October . From 12 – 14 October she screened Allied forces while they struck Formosa . While part of Task Group 38 @.@ 3 ( TG 38 @.@ 3 ) she took part in the Battle for Leyte Gulf from 22 – 27 October , during which planes from her group sank four Japanese carriers off Cape Engaño . After having stopped briefly at Ulithi , Massachusetts returned to the Philippines as part of TF 38 which struck Manila on 14 December . 
 On 18 December 1944 Massachusetts and the other ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force . At the time of the typhoon Massachusetts was sailing with the Third Fleet 's Task Group 38 @.@ 1 and reported one injured sailor and two planes lost as a result of the typhoon . 
 From 30 December – 23 January 1945 , she sailed as part of TF 38 , which struck Formosa and supported the landing at Lingayen . During that time she turned into the South China Sea , where TF 38 destroyed shipping from Saigon to Hong Kong ; the operation concluded with air strikes on Formosa and Okinawa . 
 From 10 February – 3 March , with the 5th Fleet , Massachusetts guarded carriers during raids on Honshū . Her group also struck Iwo Jima by air for the invasion of that island . On 17 March , the carriers launched strikes against Kyūshū while Massachusetts fired in repelling enemy attacks , splashing several planes . Seven days later , she bombarded Okinawa . She spent most of April fighting off air attacks , while engaged in the operations at Okinawa , returning to the area in June , when she passed through the eye of a typhoon with 100 knots ( 190 km / h ; 120 mph ) winds on 5 June . She bombarded Minami <unk> Jima in the Ryukyu Islands on 10 June . 
 Massachusetts sailed on 1 July from Leyte Gulf to join the Third Fleet 's final offensive against Japan . After protecting carriers that launched strikes against Tokyo , she formed part of a force that , on 14 July , shelled Kamaishi , Honshū , Japan 's second largest iron and steel center . Two weeks later , she bombarded the industrial complex at Hamamatsu before she returned to blast Kamaishi on 9 August . It was here that Massachusetts fired what was probably the last 16 in ( 410 mm ) shell fired in combat in World War II .

 After the war , Massachusetts sailed for Puget Sound and overhaul 1 September . She left there 28 January 1946 for operations off the California coast , until leaving San Francisco , California , for Hampton Roads , arriving 22 April . She was decommissioned on 27 March 1947 to enter the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk , Virginia , and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1962 . After being stricken , approximately 5 @,@ 000 tons of equipment were stripped from Massachusetts for use on other naval vessels , including both of the explosively driven catapults used to launch float planes . 
 " Big Mamie " , as she was affectionately known , was saved from the scrap pile when veterans and citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , with the assistance of Massachusetts schoolchildren who raised $ 50 @,@ 000 for her preservation , and was transferred to the non @-@ profit Massachusetts Memorial Committee on 8 June 1965 . She was enshrined at Battleship Cove in Fall River , Massachusetts , on 14 August 1965 , as the Bay State 's memorial to those who gave their lives in World War II . 
 In the 1980s , when the Reagan administration , as part of its " 600 @-@ ship Navy " plan , recommissioned all four of the Iowa @-@ class battleships , the U.S. Navy recovered large amounts of specialized equipment and spare parts that were still in storage aboard Massachusetts . Despite being used as a parts cache to get the Iowa @-@ class battleships back in service , Massachusetts was added to the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark 14 January 1986 . 
 In November 1998 , Massachusetts was closed to the public in advance of her planned departure for Boston , where she was scheduled to undergo an overhaul . She departed on her 300 @-@ mile ( 480 km ) trip to the capital at 06 : 30 4 November 1998 with a tug boat moving her under the Braga , Mt . Hope and Newport Bridges , then up the coast to Boston . She arrived 7 November and entered Boston 's Drydock Number 3 , where an inspection determined the battleship was in need of additional steel plating along her hull at the water line to protect against sea water corrosion . In addition , the survey also located leaking rivets and identified a need to remove two of the battleship 's propellers for repair purposes . For the next four months Massachusetts underwent repairs to correct these problems , including the addition of nearly 225 @,@ 000 pounds ( 102 @,@ 000 kg ) of steel to her hull and the addition of a compound known as Red Hand <unk> to encase and protect the hull against further deterioration . In March 1999 Massachusetts emerged from her dry docking period and returned under tow to Battleship Cove , arriving at her berth at 15 : 30 13 March 1999 to a crowd of citizens , dignitaries , veterans , and civic officials . 
 Massachusetts is listed in good condition and she remains mostly unaltered , adhering to her World War II era configuration . Former crewmembers have held reunions each year since the ship was decommissioned , with the 65th annual reunion taking place in June 2010 . 
 USS Massachusetts ( BB @-@ 59 ) is one of eight remaining US battleships that have been donated for use as museum ships ; the other battleships are USS Alabama ( BB @-@ 60 ) , USS Iowa ( BB @-@ 61 ) , USS Missouri ( BB @-@ 63 ) , USS New Jersey ( BB @-@ 62 ) , USS North Carolina ( BB @-@ 55 ) , USS Texas ( BB @-@ 35 ) , and USS Wisconsin ( BB @-@ 64 ) . 
 The tour program on board the Massachusetts has evolved over the years . In the late 1960s and early 1970s there were guided tours . About the mid @-@ 1970s visitors were given a radio receiver so they could listen to a pre @-@ recorded presentation in different areas of the ship . Today , interpretation is provided by signage and videotaped interviews with former crewmembers about their experiences working in different areas of the ship . 
 Some areas of the ship are dedicated to specific purposes such as the PT boat exhibit and the Massachusetts War Memorial which lists the name of every service member from Massachusetts who died during the Second World War . The officer 's wardroom is now in use as a snack bar and is open to visitors . 
 Over the 50 years the ship has been open to the public , more areas of the ship have been made accessible to the public thanks to the efforts of volunteers , many of whom were Navy veterans of the Second World War . The ship also has overnight facilities for youth groups .

 " 4 @-@ D " is the fourth episode of the ninth season and the 186th episode overall of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . The episode first aired in the United States on December 9 , 2001 on the Fox network . It was written by Steven Maeda and directed by Tony Wharmby . The episode is a " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " episode , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology , or overarching fictional history , of The X @-@ Files . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5 @.@ 1 and was viewed by 5 @.@ 38 million households . It received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files ; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) , Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) , and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) . In this episode , a vicious murderer named Erwin Lukesh , capable of jumping between parallel universes , shoots Doggett using Reyes ' gun . Brad Follmer opens an investigation to figure out the truth . They eventually deduce that Lukesh is the real murderer . 
 Maeda wrote the episode after being inspired by the situation of a real @-@ life French journalist , Jean @-@ Dominique Bauby , who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid . The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho and was created by Maeda in the hopes that he would go on to be a memorable villain . Effects expert Mat Beck created the unique visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes . To create the effect of a parallel universe , every scene in the episode 's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) monitors Erwin Lukesh , a suspected serial killer who cuts out his victims ' tongues . While pursuing him , Reyes goes into an apartment building and is attacked by Lukesh with a razor . John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) , observes the pursuit electronically and hears a scream . He rushes to help Reyes and finds her dying , her throat cut . Doggett chases Lukesh into an alleyway , where the killer seemingly vanishes . Lukesh then appears behind Doggett and fires at him with Reyes ' gun . 
 The setting then changes ; Doggett arrives at Reyes ' new apartment with a housewarming gift . Neither seems to be aware of the previous events . Reyes then receives a phone call from Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) , who informs her that Doggett has been shot and is being taken to the hospital . Reyes tells Skinner that Doggett is in her apartment , but then finds that he has vanished . When she arrives at the hospital , Reyes learns that Doggett was shot with her gun . Reyes is questioned by the FBI , insisting that Doggett was with her at the time of the shooting . Meanwhile , Lukesh watches the interrogation and identifies Reyes as the shooter . 
 Doggett regains consciousness , but is breathing with the help of a respirator . Meanwhile , Lukesh goes to his apartment where he lives with his disabled mother . As he prepares to fix her lunch , he goes to his freezer and pulls out a bag containing a human tongue . Reyes performs a background check on Lukesh , and becomes convinced that he is in fact responsible for the shooting . Reyes goes to Doggett , and through a computer setup that enables him to tap out words , Doggett tells her that Lukesh shot him but that Doggett also saw her with her throat cut . 
 Lukesh then returns to the alleyway where Doggett was shot and vanishes . Based on the contradictory evidence , Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill . She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because two versions of the same person cannot exist in the same universe . Skinner questions Lukesh , who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned . Noting this , Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned , which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable . Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett . After she threatens to talk to the FBI , Lukesh kills her . 
 Doggett tells Reyes that , in order to resolve the situation , she must turn off his respirator and allow him to die , but she refuses . Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next , Skinner convinces Reyes to go back to her apartment while he , Scully , and Follmer monitor her . She returns and is attacked by Lukesh . The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head , killing him . Reyes then returns to the hospital , closing her eyes as she shuts off Doggett 's respirator . As she opens her eyes , the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier . Reyes , stunned and fighting back tears , embraces Doggett as he , evidently unaware of any of the previous events , asks her what is wrong .

 = = = Writing = = = 
 Steven Maeda , the writer , had previously written eighth season episodes " Redrum " and " Vienen " . Due to their success , Maeda was asked to pen a ninth season stand alone episode . His efforts were hampered by the fact that , due to the departure of David Duchovny , the general circumstances of The X @-@ Files had become more difficult . The plot for " 4 @-@ D " was inspired by the situation of a real @-@ life French journalist , Jean @-@ Dominique Bauby . Bauby had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid . Maeda wanted to employ a similar type of aliment in his script , and originally thought of drawing up a guest character for this purpose . However , he eventually felt that the plot would be more successful with a regular character , and decided to use Doggett . Maeda employed the theory of parallel universes in order to explain the circumstances of the episode . The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's 1960 film Psycho . Maeda later noted that he wished to create a villain that would be as memorable as other antagonists in The X @-@ Files , such as Eugene Victor Tooms and The Flukeman . 
 " 4 @-@ D " expounded upon the budding relationship between Doggett and Reyes . Most of the two 's romantic interactions were limited to " flirtatious undercurrents " because , according to Annabeth Gish , series creator Chris Carter " was never big on the flamboyant big performances . " Robert Patrick later claimed that he came up with the scene wherein Reyes shaves a wounded Doggett . He noted , " I 'd read The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , and I believe there 's a part of that in the book where the character gets shaved , and I thought , ' Wow , that 's really an intimate kind of moment . ' " 
 = = = Effects and cultural references = = = 
 Effects expert Mat Beck was instructed to create a visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes . Various effects were tested , including characters disappearing into black holes as well as phasing through the air in a more " exaggerated " and " watery " way . Beck ultimately decided to use a combination of both effects . Separate shots of a morphing scene were taken : one of the actors , and one of the background . Beck then used software to morph the two together to make it appear as if they had vanished . Later , artistic touches were added in post @-@ production editing to give a more futuristic effect . 
 To create the effect of a parallel universe , every scene in the episode 's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown . In order to render words correctly , letters had to be re @-@ written backwards so that they yielded the correct spelling . Monica Reyes ' Georgetown apartment address is 67 Bennett Avenue . This is a reference to Rod Serling 's address in Binghamton , New York . Furthermore , her apartment number 6 , is a reference to Patrick McGoohan 's number in the 1967 television series , The Prisoner .

 " 4 @-@ D " received mixed to positive reviews from critics . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five . The two noted that , while the episode 's premise " doesn 't seem as well thought through " as Maeda 's past efforts , " 4 @-@ D " is " worth it " . Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode " earns its stripes by at last restoring to the series a pulse . " Furthermore , they praised Gish 's performance , noting that she " finally [ is ] given a showcase that makes Reyes so much more than a New Age fanatic " . Christina Urban , in an editorial review of the ninth season in Barnes & Noble , praised the episode . Urban said it is " by far the best of the season " . Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a " B " . Morgan slightly criticized the episode 's resolution , writing that it " explained nothing . I mean , how do these other universes work ? " 
 In a season review , Michelle Kung from Entertainment Weekly wrote that " 4 @-@ D " was one of the few ninth season episodes " worthy " of praise , but that it was overshadowed by the show 's " ludicrous conspiracy plots " . Other reviews were more critical mixed . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a " C " and called it a " mediocre to bad hour of television " , but one that could have been better had more effort been applied to it . Handlen was particularly critical of the editing , structure , and sense of urgency . He wrote that " ' 4 @-@ D ' shows what happens when this creative team has a legitimately cool concept : it wastes the opportunity . " M.A. Crang , in his book Denying the Truth : Revisiting The X @-@ Files after 9 / 11 , felt that the interactions between Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish were the " highlights " of the episode , but he was critical of the ending for wrapping things up " far too conveniently .

 = Ohio State Route 368 = 
 State Route 368 ( SR 368 ) is a short north – south state highway in western Ohio , a U.S. state . SR 368 travels from its southern terminus at SR 366 approximately 1 @.@ 75 miles ( 2 @.@ 82 km ) east of Russells Point to its northern terminus on Seminole Island in the eastern half of Indian Lake , at an intersection where it meets Logan County Road 272 ( CR 272 ) and CR 286 . Having made its debut in the late 1930s , SR 368 is a two @-@ lane spur route that serves both Indian Lake State Park and communities of cottages that are on two eastern Indian Lake islands : Shawnee and Seminole . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 368 is located exclusively in northwestern Logan County . About 3 @,@ 100 vehicles travel on SR 368 on average each day . 
 The route begins at a T @-@ intersection ( formerly a Y @-@ intersection ) with SR 366 in McArthur Township about 1 @.@ 75 miles ( 2 @.@ 82 km ) east of Russells Point . From there , it heads due north , abutted by a subdivision of cottages on the west side and open fields on the east side . After entering into the property of Indian Lake State Park , SR 368 bends to the northwest , passing amidst a blend of fields and trees as it crosses into Washington Township . The highway next passes an access road to a state park boat launch for Indian Lake . 
 As it turns to the north , SR 368 traverses into a heavily wooded area . Along this stretch , SR 368 passes into Stokes Township . It curves to the northeast as it departs the forest and enters into a neighborhood of cottages along a very narrow strip of land as it travels further out onto Indian Lake . After it travels through an S @-@ curve , SR 368 continues to the northeast , then bends to the northwest , crosses over an inlet and enters Shawnee Island . Turning to the west @-@ northwest , SR 368 passes amidst numerous houses and cottages on Shawnee Island . The highway then passes onto Seminole Island , on which the highway comes to an end as it arrives at an intersection where it meets CR 272 , which heads north from the intersection , and CR 286 , which departs to the southwest .

 SR 368 made its debut in 1934 . It was originally routed along the exact alignment that it utilizes today . The only difference was that at the time , the route SR 368 met at its southern terminus was known as SR 32 , which a few years later would become US 33 . 
 In 1961 , US 33 was moved to a new alignment further south . Consequently , the SR 366 designation was applied to the former alignment of the U.S. highway . However , at the same time , SR 368 was extended east , running concurrent with SR 366 east to SR 117 north of Huntsville , where both routes arrived at a shared terminus . This remained the case until 1979 , when SR 368 was restored back to its original alignment , leaving SR 366 as the solo route between SR 368 and SR 117 .

 = 1991 – 92 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 1991 – 92 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season was an average cyclone season in which most storms remained over open waters . At the time , the season lasted from November 15 , 1991 to April 30 , 1992 , although this season began early when three tropical depressions formed before the official start . The second , designated Tropical Depression A2 by the Météo @-@ France office ( MFR ) on Réunion , passed north of Madagascar on October 16 before weakening . The first named storm was Severe Tropical Storm Alexandra , which developed on December 18 from the monsoon trough ; many other storms during the year originated in this manner . Tropical Storm Bryna was the only tropical storm of the season to make landfall , having struck northeastern Madagascar on January 2 . The basin was most active in February , when five named storms developed , including Tropical Depression Elizabetha which struck western Madagascar . In early March , Cyclone Harriet entered the basin from the Australian region and was renamed Heather . It intensified to peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , making Heather the strongest storm of the season . In April , another cyclone – Jane – crossed from the Australian region and was renamed Irna , which reentered the Australian region on April 19 to end tropical activity within the basin . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 In general , sea surface temperatures were warmest near the equator in the northeast portion of the basin , and in the Mozambique Channel between Mozambique and Madagascar . During the season , the Météo @-@ France office ( MFR ) on Réunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin . The agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique , and warned on tropical cyclones in the region from the coast of Africa to 80 ° E , south of the equator . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , which is a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force , also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the southwestern Indian Ocean . 
 During the season , there was an El Niño event that caused tropical cyclogenesis in the southern hemisphere to shift more to the east . In addition , the monsoon trough , which helped spawn most of the storms in the season , was weaker than normal in the Indian Ocean . The number of tropical depressions forming was above average , although there were fewer days than normal with tropical cyclone activity .

 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Alexandra = = = 
 On December 17 , the JTWC began monitoring a tropical depression about 700 km ( 440 mi ) west of Diego Garcia in association with the intertropical convergence zone ( ITCZ ) , designating it as Tropical Cyclone 09S . The next day , the MFR also began classifying the system . The nascent depression moved generally to the southeast , and later more to the south @-@ southeast , ahead of an approaching upper @-@ level trough . On December 20 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alexandra , and that day developed an ill @-@ defined eye , as well as good inflow . The JTWC upgraded Alexandra to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane – with 1 ‑ minute sustained winds of at least 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) on December 21 , but MFR only estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Although the MFR estimated the storm subsequently weakened , the JTWC assessed that Alexandra continued to intensity to a peak 1 ‑ minute intensity of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) on December 22 . Around that time , the cyclone had slowed and turned to the east . Increased shear caused gradual weakening , and the strengthening of the subtropical ridge turned Alexandra to the southwest . The JTWC discontinued advisories on December 26 , and Alexandra dissipated three days later well to the east @-@ northeast of Mauritius , or about 1 @,@ 600 km ( 1 @,@ 000 mi ) south of where it first formed . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Bryna = = = 
 The MFR began monitoring a tropical depression on December 25 about 900 km ( 550 mi ) east @-@ northeast of the northern tip of Madagascar . Initially moving eastward without any strengthening , the depression turned back to the west toward Madagascar on December 28 due to a ridge . Two days later , the JTWC also began tracking the system , designating it as Tropical Cyclone 10S . With warmer water temperatures but persistent wind shear , the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Bryna on December 31 . At 1800 UTC that day , the MFR estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 70 km / h ( 45 mph ) . On January 1 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) , before assessing that Bryna began weakening . The storm made landfall in the Sava Region of eastern Madagascar early on January 2 and subsequently crossed the northern portion of the country . Although the JTWC discontinued advisories while Bryna was inland , the MFR continued tracking it , and the circulation emerged into the Mozambique Channel on January 3 , moving around a ridge . Bryna curved to the south , brushing <unk> before moving farther offshore . The MFR estimated a secondary peak intensity of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) on January 7 , based on ship reports , although the structure was more subtropical in nature . Around that time , <unk> was turning to the southeast , and the next day made a final landfall in southwestern Madagascar . After crossing the southern portion of the country , Bryna moved over open waters , eventually turning back to the southwest before dissipating on January 10 . 
 While moving over Madagascar , Bryna dropped heavy rainfall , causing some damage and two deaths in Mahajanga . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Celesta = = = 
 After a period of inactivity lasting about a month , a tropical depression formed from the monsoon trough about 900 km ( 560 mi ) northeast of Mauritius on February 8 . The system moved generally to the south and southeast , passing just east of Rodrigues on February 10 . Later that day , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Celesta . On February 11 , both the JTWC and the MFR estimated peak winds of 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Celesta turned to the south and looped to the northwest , crossing over its track on February 12 . The storm dissipated on February 14 , having succumbed to wind shear . Despite Celesta passing near <unk> , winds on the island did not exceed 19 km / h ( 11 mph ) . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Davilia = = = 
 Two days after Celesta dissipated , another tropical depression formed in the same region on February 16 from a broad low pressure area involving Celesta 's remnants . It moved northeastward and later turned to the southeast due to a trough . The new depression vacillated in intensity but remained weak . On February 22 , the JTWC also began issuing warnings on the depression , designating it as Tropical Cyclone 19S . On the next day , the MFR upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Davilia , estimating peak winds of 70 km / h ( 45 mph ) . Continuing to the southeast , Davilia failed to intensify further due to persistent wind shear , and it dissipated on February 25 . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Elizabetha = = = 
 Late on February 22 , a tropical depression formed within a broad area of convection south of the Comoros in the Mozambique Channel . With warm water temperatures , it gradually intensified while moving east @-@ southeastward , and MFR upgraded it to Tropical Storm Elizabetha on February 24 . After reaching winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) , the storm weakened back to tropical depression status and turned sharply southward , making landfall just west of Mahajanga in western Madagascar . Elizabetha weakened further over land and dissipated on February 26 , producing wind gusts of 87 km / h ( 54 mph ) at Mahajanga . The JTWC did not issue any advisories in the storm . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Farida = = = 
 A tropical depression developed in the northeast portion of the basin on February 23 within the monsoon trough , classified as Tropical Cyclone 22S by the JTWC . For much of its duration , the storm moved southwestward due to weak steering currents . It intensified into Tropical Storm Farida on February 25 . Two days later , the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , and the next day the MFR upgraded Farida to tropical cyclone status . The cyclone intensified further , reaching peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 95 mph ) according to MFR , and peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) according to JTWC . While near peak intensity , the cyclone had developed well @-@ defined outflow , and around that time was interacting with Tropical Storm Gerda to its northwest . Due to increasing wind shear , Farida gradually weakened , first below tropical cyclone intensity on March 1 , and to tropical depression intensity the next day . Late in its duration , the system turned to the northwest before dissipating on March 4 . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Gerda = = = 
 A tropical depression formed northwest of Reunion on February 24 , which moved generally eastward . The next day , the depression passed north of Reunion and Mauritius and south of St. Brandon , before turning to the northeast . The system was located near another tropical depression to the northeast , and both vortexes were tracked for several days . On February 26 , the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 24 , although the agency estimated the system was located farther to the north , closer to where the other tropical depression was . The JTWC assessed tropical storm intensity on February 27 , noting the system was moving generally southeastward , although the MFR tracked the depression as executing a loop before turning to the southeast . On February 29 , the MFR estimated peak 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) , upgrading it to Tropical Storm Gerda . At the same time , the JTWC had downgraded Gerda to a tropical depression . The system turned to the southwest , executing another large loop before resuming its southwest trajectory on March 1 . That day , Gerda weakened to a tropical depression , before executing a third loop to the northeast and later to the southeast , passing between Mauritius and Rodrigues . On March 4 , Gerda dissipated , having produced gusts to 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) on Rodrigues . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Harriet @-@ Heather = = = 
 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical low about 550 km ( 340 mi ) east of the Cocos Islands on February 24 . Located in the Australian basin , it quickly intensified to tropical storm status and was named " Harriet " by the BoM , and Tropical Cyclone 20S by the JTWC . After passing just south of North Keeling Island , Harriet turned more to the southwest , and strengthened into a Category 5 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale on March 1 . By that time , the MFR had begun issuing advisories , and later that day renamed Harriet as Heather after the cyclone crossed into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean . When Heather reached the basin , the JTWC was estimating peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) , and shortly thereafter the MFR estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . 
 On March 4 , an approaching trough turned the cyclone to the south and southeast , producing stronger wind shear that induced weakening . By that time , the JTWC estimated Heather had weakened to a 1 ‑ minute intensity of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . The cyclone reintensified slightly while accelerating to the southeast , and MFR estimated Heather re @-@ attained its peak of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) on March 5 . Soon after , the storm began weakening again , and on March 7 Heather exited into the Australian region below tropical cyclone status . The cyclone continued to the southeast , becoming extratropical on March 8 and dissipating the next day in the Great Australian Bight . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Jane @-@ Irna = = = 
 The final storm of the season formed in the Australian basin , and like Harriet @-@ Heather also originated out of the monsoon trough . On April 7 , a tropical low developed northeast of the Cocos Islands , and gradually intensified while moving southward , becoming Tropical Cyclone Jane the next day . The JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone <unk> . A ridge to the south turned the storm to the west on April 11 . The cyclone intensified further , developing an eye , and crossed into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean on April 13 . At that time , the MFR renamed Jane as Tropical Cyclone Irna . Late on April 13 , the agency estimated peak 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . The next day , the JTWC estimated Irna reached peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) . Subsequently , an approaching trough turned the cyclone to the south and increased wind shear , which caused weakening . The eye dissipated , and Irna soon weakened below tropical cyclone status . On February 17 , Irna weakened into a tropical depression . The next day , the JTWC discontinued advisories , and on April 19 , Irna crossed back into the Australian region , dissipating on April 20 . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 In addition to the named storms , there were several other storms during the season that were warned on . On September 10 , 1991 , the JTWC began monitoring a tropical depression in the northeastern portion of the basin . The system moved southeastward , and according to the agency intensified into a 85 km / h ( 50 mph 1 ‑ minute sustained ) tropical storm on September 12 . By the next day , the storm dissipated after turning back to the north . 
 About a month after the previous storm dissipated , the JTWC classified another tropical depression on October 11 about 960 km ( 600 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Seychelles . The system tracked west @-@ southwestward , and the MFR also began issuing warnings on it as Tropical Depression A2 on October 14 . Two days later , the JTWC briefly upgraded the depression to a tropical storm , although MFR only estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 50 km / h ( 30 mph ) . By that time , the storm had turned to the west , passing north of the northern tip of Madagascar . After turning to the west @-@ northwest , the depression dissipated on October 22 . While the depression was active , the MFR also briefly tracked another tropical depression to its northeast , which formed on October 16 about 540 km ( 345 mi ) south @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia . Classified as Tropical Depression A3 by MFR , the depression tracked to the west @-@ southwest , turned to the southeast , and resumed its westward trajectory for several days before dissipating on October 22 . 
 On November 20 , the JTWC began tracking Tropical Cyclone 04S a short distance southeast of Diego Garcia . The next day , MFR also initiated advisories on it , classifying the system as Tropical Depression A4 . After moving southwestward initially , the storm curved south @-@ southeastward and intensified . The JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 85 mph ( 50 mph ) , and the MFR estimated 10 ‑ minute winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) , indicating that it could have been named . While near peak intensity , the storm was affected by wind shear that displaced the circulation center along the north edge of the convection . The storm turned to the west , passing just south of St. Brandon before dissipating on November 29 . 
 While storms Farida and Gerda were both active , Tropical Depression H1 formed east of Madagascar on February 26 , and throughout its duration moved in a circular direction around Gerda . The depression moved to the east but slowly executed a clockwise loop around St. Brandon . It never intensified beyond winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) , and dissipated on March 1 . On March 7 , the MFR identified a subtropical cyclone in the Mozambique Channel , but did not issue warnings on it .

 = Urse d 'Abetot = 
 Urse d 'Abetot ( sometimes Urse of Abetot , Urse de Abetot , Urse d 'Abitot or Urse of <unk> ) ( c . 1040 – 1108 ) was a Norman as well as a medieval Sheriff of Worcestershire and royal official under Kings William I , William II and Henry I. He was a native of Normandy and came to England shortly after the Norman Conquest of England , and was appointed sheriff in about 1069 . Little is known of his family in Normandy , who were not prominent . Although Urse 's lord in Normandy was present at the Battle of Hastings , there is no evidence that Urse took part in the invasion of England in 1066 . 
 Urse built a castle in the town of Worcester , which encroached on the cathedral cemetery there , earning him a curse from the Archbishop of York . Urse helped to put down a rebellion against King William I in 1075 , and quarrelled with the Church in his county over the jurisdiction of the sheriffs . He continued in the service of William 's sons after the king 's death , and was appointed constable under William II and marshal under Henry . Urse was known for his acquisitiveness , and during William II 's reign was considered second only to Ranulf Flambard , another royal official , in his rapacity . Urse 's son succeeded him as sheriff but was subsequently exiled , thus forfeiting the office . Through his daughter , Urse is an ancestor of the Beauchamp family , who eventually became Earls of Warwick .

 On 5 January 1066 Edward the Confessor , King of England , died . Edward 's lack of children meant there was no clear legitimate successor , leading eventually to a succession dispute . Some medieval writers state that shortly before Edward 's death he named his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Harold Godwinson , Earl of Wessex , as his heir . Others claim that Edward had promised the throne to his cousin , William , Duke of Normandy , a powerful autonomous ruler in northern France . Harold , the most powerful English noble , took the initiative and was crowned king on 6 January . William , lacking Harold 's proximity to the centres of English royal government , gathered troops and prepared an invasion fleet . He invaded England in October , and subsequently defeated and killed Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066 . William was crowned on Christmas Day at Westminster , becoming William I. 
 Between his coronation and 1071 , William consolidated his hold over England , defeating a number of rebellions that arose particularly in the north and west of the country . Immediately after Hastings , only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands , which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William 's invasion . The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land , again distributed to William 's continental followers . By 1086 , when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England , most of the native English nobility had been replaced by Norman and other continental nobles . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 Urse came from an undistinguished family , and made his way on military reputation . He was probably born in about 1040 , but the exact date is unknown . He was from St Jean d 'Abbetot in Normandy , where his family had lands , and where he himself was a tenant of the lords of Tancarville . Other tenants of the Tancarville lords included Robert d 'Abetot and his wife <unk> , who held lands close to St Jean d 'Abbetot in the early 12th century ; despite the name , it is not certain that Robert d 'Abetot was related to Urse . Urse had a brother usually called Robert Despenser , sometimes known as Robert fitz Thurstin , who also became a royal official . The historian Emma Mason suggested that Urse may have been a nickname rather than a forename , perhaps given on account of his tenacious temperament . Urse 's usual last name derives from his ancestral village in Normandy . His brother 's usual last name of Despenser derives from his office , that of dispenser , in the royal household . 
 Ralph , the Lord of Tancarville during the reign of King William I of England and Urse 's overlord in Normandy , fought at the Battle of Hastings , but there is no evidence that Urse himself was present . He is probably the same person as the " Urse d 'Abetot " who was a witness to a charter of William before the invasion of England . The historian Lewis Loyd refers to Urse as " in origin a man of no importance who made his way as a soldier of fortune " . 
 = = Service to William I = = 
 = = = Sheriff of Worcester = = = 
 Urse arrived in England after Hastings , but it is unknown if his brother Robert arrived with him or separately . Urse was appointed Sheriff of Worcestershire some time after the Norman Conquest of England , probably in about 1069 , part of the wholesale replacement of English royal officials with Norman and other immigrants that took place in the early part of William 's reign . As sheriff , Urse was responsible for collecting taxes and forwarding them to the treasury , and was empowered to raise armies if rebellion or invasion threatened . The sheriff presided over the shire court , and was accountable for the shire 's annual payments to the king . During the reigns of William the Conqueror and his sons , the office of sheriff was a powerful one , as it did not share power with any other official in the shire , unless there was an earl in overall control . Because of their control of the courts for the hundreds – which were subdivisions of the shire – sheriffs had opportunities for patronage and also had a large say in who became members of the hundred and shire court juries . The death of Edwin , Earl of Mercia , who held power in Worcestershire until his death in 1071 during a rebellion against William , allowed Urse to accumulate more authority in Worcestershire , as Edwin was the last Earl of Mercia . 
 Urse also oversaw the construction of a new castle at the town of Worcester , although nothing now remains of the castle . Worcester Castle was in place by 1069 , its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter . The motte of the castle overlooked the river , just south of the cathedral . Although Urse had control of the castle after it was built , by 1088 he had lost it to the bishops of Worcester . 
 In 1075 , three earls rebelled , for reasons unknown , and sought aid from the King of Denmark , Sweyn II Estridsson , who had a distant claim to the English throne . Among the rebels was Roger de Breteuil , the Earl of Hereford , whose lands neighboured those of Urse . Along with Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester , Abbot Æthelwig of Evesham , and Walter de Lacy , Urse prevented de Breteuil from crossing the River Severn . Urse 's actions kept the rebels from seizing control of the Severn Valley and joining up with the other English rebels , Waltheof , the Earl of Northumbria , and Ralph de Gael , the Earl of Norfolk . Urse and the magnates fighting alongside him , in addition to their obvious desire to suppress rebellion , had an interest in defeating de Breteuil , as he was the most powerful lord in the area . De Breteuil was caught , tried , and imprisoned for life , increasing the power of his rivals . 
 Urse , along with his contemporaries , benefited from the increasing power wielded by the sheriffs . Although royal officials , including the sheriffs , had been appropriating ecclesiastical lands since the late 10th century , in the immediate years after the Norman Conquest churchmen complained about the increased amount of land seized by the sheriffs . Urse received his share of complaints , but he was part of a wider trend during the early years of William I 's reign . The appropriation of land led to an increase in the recording of rights and possessions not only by clergy but also by laymen , culminating in the recording of all possessions and the rights held by the king over them in the Domesday Survey of 1086 . This behaviour was not limited to the sheriffs , as other nobles were also accused in contemporary chronicles of appropriating land from churches and from native Englishmen . 
 = = = Disputes with Wulfstan and Ealdred = = = 
 During the reign of William I , Urse became involved in a dispute with Bishop Wulfstan over the rights of the sheriff in the lands of the diocese . By the time of Domesday Book in 1086 , Urse 's powers as sheriff had been excluded from the <unk> , the area of Worcestershire controlled by the bishops of Worcester . Domesday Book records that the <unk> was regarded as an immunity , exempt from judicial actions by royal officials . Urse complained that this immunity reduced his income , but this did not affect the outcome of his dispute with Wulfstan , who prevailed . Although Wulfstan claimed that the immunity dated from before the Conquest , it actually owed its existence to the ability of the bishop to fill the shire court with his supporters , and thus influence the findings of the court . 
 Urse was also involved in a dispute between Wulfstan and Evesham Abbey over lands in Worcestershire as , after the Conquest , Urse acquired the lands of Azur , a kinsman of an earlier Bishop of Worcester , Beorhtheah . Azur had originally leased the lands from the diocese , but after Urse confiscated the lands , the sheriff did not return the lands to the bishop , and instead kept them for himself . The Worcester monk Hemming recorded the loss of the lands to Urse in Hemming 's Cartulary , a cartulary written about 1095 recording lands and charters belonging to the diocese of Worcester . Hemmings ' Cartulary mentions not just Azur 's lands , but others at Acton Beauchamp , Clopton , and Redmarley as taken from the diocese of Worcester by Urse . After Abbot Æthelwig 's death , Urse also acquired lands that Æthelwig had seized through less than legal means , when William I 's half @-@ brother Odo of Bayeux , the Bishop of Bayeux , presided at the lawsuit brought to determine the ownership of the lands . Odo gave a number of the disputed estates to Urse during the course of the lawsuit . 
 The 12th @-@ century chronicler William of Malmesbury records a story , in which shortly after Urse was appointed sheriff , he encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter of Worcester Cathedral . Ealdred , the Archbishop of York , pronounced a rhyming curse on Urse , declaring " Thou are called Urse . May you have God 's curse . " Ealdred had been Bishop of Worcester before becoming archbishop , and still retained an interest in the diocese . Gerald of Wales , a late 12th- and early 13th @-@ century writer , wrote that Wulfstan uttered the curse after Urse had attempted to have Wulfstan deposed as bishop . Gerald goes on to relate that Wulfstan stated he would only relinquish his episcopal staff to the king who had granted it , William I 's predecessor , Edward the Confessor . Gerard then reports that Wulfstan proceeded to work a miracle at Edward 's tomb , a miracle so impressive that King William confirmed Wulfstan in his episcopate . Although Urse did not succeed in removing Wulfstan , and although there are certainly embellishments added in Gerald 's story , it is clear that Urse and Wulfstan were the main powers in Worcestershire , and were thus great rivals . 
 The Archbishop 's curse had no discernible effect , either on Urse 's career or the castle . Other chroniclers record that Urse stole monastic lands , including some from Evesham Abbey . Urse gained a reputation for greed and avarice , especially with regard to church lands . Great Malvern Priory , however , claimed him as a founder in a 14th @-@ century document . 
 = = = Domesday lands = = = 
 In 1086 , the Domesday Survey documents that while the majority of Urse 's lands were in Worcestershire , he also held land in Warwickshire , Herefordshire , and Gloucestershire . His lands in Warwickshire were held directly from the king , as a tenant @-@ in @-@ chief , while others were held as an under @-@ tenant of others who had their lands directly from the king . Urse 's lands in Herefordshire likewise were held as a mixture of tenant @-@ in @-@ chief and sub @-@ tenant , as was also the case in Gloucester . Of the lands that Urse held in Worcestershire , he held them both directly from the king and from the Bishop of Worcester . Domesday also records that the revenue that Urse was responsible for as sheriff was £ 128 and 4 shillings from Worcestershire . This was just the amount due for the royal estates in Worcester , as Urse was also responsible for payments of £ 23 and 5 shillings for the royal lands in the Borough of Worcester , £ 17 as profits on the shire and hundred courts with an additional £ 16 or a hunting hawk , specifically a " Norway hawk " ; also due from the courts . Urse also had to pay the queen £ 5 plus £ 1 additional for a " <unk> horse " . All of these payments were guaranteed by Urse , who had to make up any shortfall . 
 Domesday makes it obvious that Urse was the most powerful layman in Worcester , and the only person who could contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester . The power struggle continued into the 12th century , as Urse 's descendants still contested the bishops . Only one other layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday , and he held much less land than Urse . 
 = = Service to William II and Henry I = = 
 After the death of King William I of England , Urse continued to serve William 's sons and successors , Kings William II Rufus and Henry I. While William I granted the duchy of Normandy to his eldest son , Robert Curthose , England went to his second surviving son , William Rufus . Henry ( later Henry I ) , the youngest son , was given a sum of money . In 1088 , shortly after William Rufus became king , Urse was present at the trial of William de St @-@ Calais , Bishop of Durham , and is mentioned in De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi , a contemporary account of the trial . During William I 's reign , Urse had served the king mainly as a regional official , but during William II 's reign Urse began to take a broader role in the kingdom as a whole . Urse became a constable in the king 's household for both William II and Henry I , and under William II , he ascended to the office of marshal . 
 Urse was an assistant to William II 's main minister , Ranulf Flambard , and frequently served as a royal judge . The historian Emma Mason argues that Urse , along with Flambard , Robert Fitzhamon , Roger Bigod , Haimo the dapifer , or seneschal , and Eudo , another dapifer , were the first recognizable barons of the Exchequer . During his absence from England , the king addressed a number of writs to Urse , along with Haimo , Eudo , and Robert Bloet , ordering them to enforce William 's decisions in England . The historian Francis West , who studied the office of the justiciarship , asserts that Haimo , Eudo , and Urse , along with Flambard , could be considered the first English justiciars . 
 Urse 's estates grew under William II , partly as a result of the inheritance of some of the lands of his brother , Robert Despenser , who died about 1097 . Later , Urse consolidated his holdings by exchanging some of Robert 's lands in Lincolnshire with Robert de Lacy for lands closer to his base in Worcestershire . Urse d 'Abetot gained and passed to his heirs an estate that later became the Barony of <unk> , Worcestershire . 
 William II died in a hunting accident on 2 August 1100 . His younger brother Henry immediately rode to Winchester and had himself crowned king before his elder brother , Robert Curthose , could claim the throne . Although Urse did not attest the charter Henry issued after he seized the throne , Urse was at court shortly afterwards . When Robert Curthose invaded England in 1101 in an attempt to take the English throne , Urse supported Henry . Urse was present at the court held at Winchester on 2 August 1101 , when a peace treaty was ratified between the brothers . During Henry 's reign , the king regranted Urse 's lands to him , with some of them now granted as a tenant @-@ in @-@ chief when previously Urse had held those lands as an under @-@ tenant , and not directly from the king . Urse 's lands at <unk> were previously held by Roger of Montgomery , but were granted to Urse as a direct tenant of the king when Roger 's son , Robert of <unk> , was outlawed in 1102 . Urse continued to attest many of Henry 's charters until 1108 , although he did not use the title of " constable " in those charters . 
 Sometime between May and July 1108 , Henry addressed a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading . The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates other than those normal for such courts . From this , the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining those who did not attend . The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure that could be used in what type of case . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Urse died some time in 1108 . Little is known of his wife , Alice , whose death is unrecorded . Urse was succeeded as sheriff by his son Roger d 'Abetot , who was exiled in about 1110 and forfeited the office of sheriff . Roger 's successor , Osbert d 'Abetot , was probably Urse 's brother . Urse also had a daughter , probably named Emmeline , who married Walter de Beauchamp . Walter succeeded to Urse 's lands after Roger 's exile . A charter for Saint @-@ Georges de <unk> Abbey may indicate that Urse had a second son , named Robert . Urse may also have had another daughter , who married Robert Marmion , as some of Urse 's estates went to Marmion 's family and others to the Beauchamps . 
 Urse earned a reputation for extortion and financial exactions . During the reign of William II , he was considered second only to the king 's minister Ranulf Flambard in his rapacity . The first mention of his exactions is in Hemming 's Cartulary . Further details were given by the medieval chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Gerald of Wales , both of whom relate Ealdred 's curse . His exactions were also mentioned in Domesday Book , where an entry in the survey for Gloucestershire noted that his oppression prevented the inhabitants of Sodbury so much that they were unable to pay their customary rents . He intimidated the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter into granting him a lease of two of their estates , Greenhill and Eastbury . Urse was one of a new breed of royal official , one who was not opposed to royal power but rather welcomed it , as it helped his own position . 
 Through his daughter , he is an ancestor of the Beauchamp family of Elmley in Worcestershire , a scion of which , William de Beauchamp , became Earl of Warwick . It is likely that the Beauchamp family 's symbol , a bear , derives from their relationship to Urse . 
 = Korn ( album ) = 
 Korn ( printed as KoЯn ) is the eponymous debut studio album by the American nu metal band Korn . It was released on October 11 , 1994 , through Immortal / Epic Records . Before recording the album , the band was approached by Immortal / Epic Records after a performance at Huntington Beach , California . The band signed to their label because they didn 't want to " sign away all of their creative freedom . " The band would record at Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu , California with producer Ross Robinson , who also produced their 1993 demo Neidermayer 's Mind . The recording took place from May to June 1994 . After the recordings , Korn toured with Biohazard and House of Pain . 
 The album 's themes include child abuse , drug abuse and bullying . The album cover depicts a young girl being approached by a large man who is holding what appears to be a horseshoe or , more presumably , blades ; furthermore , the girl 's shadow gives the appearance that her body is being hanged due to the position of the band 's logo . Photography was done by Stephen Stickler , and the design was directed by Jay Papke and Dante Ariola . The first single " Blind " charted at number 15 on the Canadian Alternative 30 , the album peaked at number ten in New Zealand as well as number seventy @-@ two on the Billboard 200 . The debut album has sold over 4 million copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan as of January 4 , 2013 . The album has now sold over 10 million copies worldwide , and is considered to have started the nu metal genre .

 Before Korn developed a name , they had moved into a small house together in Huntington Beach , California , south of Los Angeles , where they began working on songs . Soon after moving , they rented Underground Chicken Sounds , a recording studio , from Jeff <unk> , who had previously allowed lead singer Jonathan Davis to live in his garage . While they were recording at the studio , they attracted a crowd of people when performing the prelude to " Clown " . The band 's bass guitarist , Reginald " Fieldy " Arvizu , said that the crowd gathered because the band 's style sounded so " different " . 
 Korn began playing gigs in the summer of 1993 . While performing at Huntington Beach , the band was spotted by Immortal / Epic A & R Paul Pontius . He approached the band offering to record an album through their company . Although the group had offers from several other labels , Korn went with Immortal / Epic because they did not want to " sign away all of their creative freedom . " 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 While Korn was looking for a place to record their debut album , they asked producer Ross Robinson to produce their album . After accepting the offer , Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch , Malibu , California . The band would record the majority of the album there , while additional recording took place at Bakersfield 's Fat Tracks . Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously , as opposed to recording instruments separately . The " distinctive " sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments , rather than the production . The bagpipes on " Shoots and Ladders " are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain @-@ top . However , they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at the back door of the studio while Jonathan Davis walked past outside playing . As he walked further from the microphone , this led to the sound naturally fading quieter . Korn finished recording their self @-@ titled album by the end of June 1994 . 
 Since Robinson produced the album , his career was launched by its success , as it " taught Robinson how to produce . " In an interview with the heavy metal magazine Metal Hammer , Davis touted Robinson 's behavior , saying : " Ross is a very pure and clean @-@ spirited person , and you feel it when you 're with him . He 's the kind of person that can draw that out of you . I felt very safe with Ross . " The album was released on October 11 , 1994 through Immortal and Epic Records . During the recording of Korn , there were four outtakes : " Christmas Song " , " Sean Olson " , " Layla " , and " This Broken Soul " . " Sean Olson " was put in the single " Shoots and Ladders " .

 Stephen Stickler acted as the band 's photographer , and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola directed the album 's cover art and booklet . The cover depicts a little girl in a purple dress with a matching bow in her blonde hair , bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her . The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground , and is holding what appears to be a horse shoe or , more presumably , blades . The band 's logo , a childlike drawing of the band 's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis , is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow ; the way it 's positioned next to the girls ' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged . 
 After Korn finished recording the album , they began touring with Biohazard and House of Pain at free gigs . Korn personally passed out flyers at their performances . Their record company gave them enough money for their own tour bus . Korn 's first gig was in Atlanta , Georgia . About half way through the tour , the tour bus that their record company gave them stopped working , forcing the band to find a new one . This first tour proved very unsuccessful in promoting the album . Aside from them touring , Korn released four singles . " Blind " was the lead single , released in 1994 , followed by " Need To " , " Shoots and Ladders " , and " Clown " . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 Korn begins with " Blind " , starting with the dueling riffs of James Shaffer and Brian Welch . Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis ' first line is " Are you ready ? ! " , which is now one of the band 's trademarks . Davis told Metal Hammer that on the album 's second track , " Ball Tongue " , he " didn 't sing a goddamn word in that song . I couldn 't describe what I wanted to do , so that 's how it came out . It 's a really heavy sound . " " Shoots and Ladders " is about Davis ' disgust with the society . The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes . Davis relates : " ' Shoots and Ladders ' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes , the first songs many of us ever hear . ' Shoots and Ladders ' , to set the record straight , calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are . I choose each rhyme for a different reason — ' Baa Baa Black Sheep ' has racist overtones . ' London Bridge ' talks of all the people of London dying ( from the Black Plague , as does ' Ring Around the Roses ' ) . Then there 's ' Little Red Riding Hood ' — one story tells of the wolf raping Red Riding Hood and killing her . " 
 " Clown " ' s concept deals with an incident that happened in San Diego , California . A skinhead that told Davis to " go back to Bakersfield " attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band 's road manager , Jeff , knocked the skinhead out . " Helmet in the Bush " was about Davis ' drug abuse , and the fear that gripped him at the height of his drug problem . He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare , as if he cannot help himself . Davis explained : " I 'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed . Speed in the morning , I 'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I 'd lay down and go to sleep , I 'd wake up and just snort and it 's like ' Yeah , okay , I 'm up . ' It was bad . It 's like , you do one line and stay up all night , but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done . Eventually you start spinning @-@ out from sleep deprivation . You get hallucinations and shit like that . " 
 " Faget " ' s lyrical themes are about lead vocalist Jonathan Davis ' time in high school where he was relentlessly bullied primarily by jocks for wearing eyeliner , listening to new wave and enjoying arts . He constantly was called names like " fag " or " faggot " . Jonathan Davis talked about the song in an interview saying , 
 " There 's a big rumor about me being a homosexual . Does it really matter ? I have lots of gay friends . It shouldn 't matter . I was in the New Romantic scene [ in high school ] with Duran Duran [ as his favorite band ] , wearing makeup . I got called a fag by the jocks . Couldn 't walk through the halls without hearing that or being picked on . " 
 " Daddy " , the album 's longest track saw , Jonathan Davis " descending very real tears . " Davis said that the song 's concept deals with his childhood , saying " People think ' Daddy ' was written because my father abused me , but that 's not what the song 's about . When I was a kid , I was being abused by someone else . I don 't really like to talk about that song . " Some 14 minutes into " Daddy " — well after the song has ended — a tape that Ross Robinson found in an abandoned house begins to play . The tape depicts an argument between a man and his wife over a Dodge Dart carburettor .

 Korn was well received by music critics . Arnopp stated that the group " positively encouraged America 's formerly introverted , apathetic misfits to thrust a livid middle finger in the face of high – school jocks who would traditionally bundle them into a locker and brand them ' faggots ' for sporting hair longer than any Army buzz @-@ cut . " The Calgary Herald gave the album a negative review , noting that Davis ' vocals derivative of Pantera 's Philip Anselmo and Pearl Jam 's Eddie Vedder . Musically , the review concluded that the Korn borrowed too much from Sonic Youth and Soundgarden . 
 In their original 1994 review , the Los Angeles Times wrote " Kindred to such bands as Tool , Rollins Band and Rage Against the Machine , Korn and its singer @-@ lyricist , Jonathan Davis , make their core ethic fairly explicit in songs like " Predictable , " " Lies " and " Fake " : the world is a torment @-@ filled morass that leaves us seething with deep , internalized fears ; virtue lies in confronting those painful truths unflinchingly and screaming them to the world . " 
 In July 2014 , Guitar World ranked Korn at number 27 in their " Superunknown : 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994 " list . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Korn 's debut album is said to have established nu metal . As said by Joel McIver , Korn " was almost solely responsible for the tidal wave of change that subsequently swept the metal scene . " Bands like Coal Chamber and Limp Bizkit were inspired by the album 's " churning rage , emphasising similar grooves and song structures , " and " the sound 's hip @-@ hop elements . " Slipknot , Machine Head , and Sepultura were also inspired by the album . The album launched the career of record producer Ross Robinson , who later produced albums such as Roots by Sepultura , Three Dollar Bill , Yall by Limp Bizkit , and the Slipknot albums Slipknot and Iowa . In 2014 , Rolling Stone described the album as " the most important metal record of the last 20 years " .

 = Butlins Skegness = 
 Butlins Skegness ( officially Butlins Resort Skegness ) , formerly Butlin 's Skegness or <unk> World ; is a holiday camp located in Ingoldmells near Skegness in Lincolnshire , England . Sir William Butlin conceived of its creation based on his experiences at a Canadian summer camp in his youth and by observation of the actions of other holiday accommodation providers , both in seaside resort lodging houses and in earlier smaller holiday camps . 
 Construction of the camp began in 1935 and it was opened in 1936 , when it quickly proved to be a success with a need for expansion . The camp included dining and recreation facilities , such as dance halls and sports fields . During World War II , the camp was subject to a short military occupation when it served as a Naval training base , reverting to being a holiday camp in 1946 . Over the past 75 years the camp has seen continuous use and development , in the mid @-@ 1980s and again in the late 1990s being subject to substantial investment and redevelopment . 
 In the late 1990s the site was re @-@ branded as a holiday resort , and remains open today as one of three remaining Butlins resorts . 
 = = Holiday camp conception = = 
 In 1914 , Billy Butlin was living in Toronto with his mother and stepfather , when he left school and went to work for Eatons department store . According to Butlin , one of the best aspects of working for the company was that he was able to visit their summer camp which gave him his first taste of a real holiday — indeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life . 
 The onset of World War I led to his leaving Eatons and enlisting in the Canadian Expeditionary Force serving in Europe , but seeing little if any action . After the war , Butlin made his way back to England where he used some of his last £ 5 ( 2011 : £ 189 @.@ 00 ) to purchase a stall in his uncle Marshall Hill 's travelling fair . 
 As a showman , Butlin quickly became successful , one stall becoming several , and several becoming his own travelling fair . Butlin soon had fixed fairground sites as well as his travelling fair – the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills ' Circus . In 1925 he opened a set of fairground stalls in Barry Island , Wales where he observed the way landladies in seaside resorts would ( sometimes literally ) push families out of the lodgings between meals , and began to nurture the idea of a holiday camp similar to the one he had attended whilst an employee at Eatons . 
 In 1927 Butlin leased a piece of land from the Earl of Scarbrough by the seaside town of Skegness , where he set up an amusement park with hoopla stalls , a tower slide , a haunted house ride and , in 1928 , a miniature railway and Dodgem cars — these were the first bumper cars in Britain , as Butlin had an exclusive license to import them . 
 = = Butlin 's camp = = 
 During the early 1930s Butlin joined the board of Harry Warner 's holiday camp company and in 1935 he observed the construction of Warner 's holiday camp in Seaton , Devon . Butlin learned from the experience of Warner , and employed the workers who had constructed the Seaton camp to come to Lincolnshire to build his new camp at Skegness . 
 Construction began in September 1935 with the local paper reporting the first sod being turned on the 4th of that month . Butlin designed the camp himself and said of the camp , " my plans were for 1 @,@ 000 people in 600 chalets with electricity , running water , 250 bathrooms , dining and recreational halls . A theatre , a gymnasium , a rhododendron bordered swimming pool with cascades at both ends and a boating lake . " However Butlin hired the architect Harold Ridley Hooper , to draw up the formal plans for the camp buildings . In the camp 's landscaped grounds , there were to be tennis courts , bowling and putting greens and cricket pitches . The total cost of the project was £ 100 @,@ 000 ( 2011 : £ 5 @.@ 7 million ) and despite having suffered a financial shortfall during construction , the camp opened on schedule in 1936 . One of the original 1936 chalet accommodation units is still present and is now a grade II listed building , recognising its historical significance . 
 He opened his camp on 11 April 1936 ( Easter Even ) . It was officially opened by Amy Johnson from Hull , who had been the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia . An advertisement costing £ 500 ( 2011 : £ 28 thousand ) was placed in the Daily Express , announcing the opening of the camp and inviting the public to book for a week 's holiday . The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week 's full board , at a cost of between 35 shillings ( £ 1 @.@ 75 ) and £ 3 ( 2011 : £ 167 @.@ 00 ) , according to the time of year . The advert proved successful , and over the first summer season the capacity of the camp had to be increased from 500 to 2 @,@ 000 , to cope with the demand . 
 When the camp opened , Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had envisioned , as most kept to themselves , and others looked bored . He asked Norman Bradford ( who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp ) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes . By the end of the night the camp was buzzing and the Butlin 's atmosphere was born . From that point on , entertainment was at the very heart of Butlin 's and Bradford became the first of the Butlin 's Redcoats . That night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Bradford , and the role of Redcoat was formed . 
 In 1938 Butlin won the contract to supply amusements to the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow . After the exhibition was complete , Butlin returned with some of the infrastructure . His Clacton camp and Sheerness amusement park each received miniature railways , while Skegness received a building in the shape of the " Butlin theatre " which was later renamed the " Gaiety " . 
 Butlin continued to increase the capacity of the camp until 3 September 1939 when the Second World War was declared . The next morning , the campers were sent home and the site was taken over by the Royal Navy for use as a training establishment . 
 = = Wartime use = = 
 Once the Navy took over , the camp became known as HMS Royal Arthur and was used to train sailors for the war effort . In order to operate as a military base , many of the bright external colours were painted over , the dance hall became an armoury , and the rose beds were dug up , to become sites for air raid shelters . 
 While the outside was repainted , much of the interior décor went unchanged . Speaking of his time there George Melly reported that Royal Arthur had " a certain architectural frivolity inappropriate to a Royal Navy Shore Establishment . " Melly went on to mention how the main reception still had a sky scene with clouds painted on the ceiling and a large artificial ( though realistic ) tree in the centre of it . He also noted that their meals were served from an approximation of an Elizabethan inn named " Ye Olde <unk> and Whistle " . 
 During the war , the German airforce bombed Royal Arthur 52 times , including one incident on 21 August 1940 when an attack led to damage or demolition of 900 small buildings . By the end of the conflict however , the camp 's condition was good enough that it took only 6 weeks for Butlin to repair the wartime damage and reopen the camp to the public on 11 May 1946 . After reopening , some signs of military occupation remained with one observer noting that the blankets supplied to campers retained the insignia of HMS Royal Arthur . 
 = = Later history = = 
 In 1947 , Butlin had experimented with opening an airfield attached to his camp at Pwllheli . Patrons could fly in , to be collected by a Redcoat and transported to the camp . Flight Magazine reported that " flying visitors were unanimous in their praise of what they saw and experienced " , noting that the experience contrasted to the poor reputations the camps were given in the media of the period . Welcoming the experiment as a success , Butlin announced his intention to open airfields at his other camps . The following year he opened his next airfield at Skegness and announced that visitors could fly to the camp on a service run by BEA from 26 June . The airfield also allowed Butlin 's to offer services such as pleasure trips and sightseeing trips , as well as allowing private charters . 
 In 1948 Butlin 's also opened the Ingoldmells Hotel , which was situated outside the camp on the main road . In 1949 , the hotel became the first in Skegness to have a television for the use of guests . Situated in the hotel 's palm court function room , the TV was manufactured by <unk> but could be subject to interference from the hotel 's refrigerator . 
 Butlin 's had a long history of combining amusements with transport , starting with their first miniature railway at the Empire Exhibition in 1938 . Skegness was to receive its own miniature railway in 1962 . A chairlift system was installed at the same time . In 1965 , the camp became home to the UK 's first commercial monorail system . According to Peter Scott , who has researched the history of Butlin 's transport systems , Butlin apparently got the idea for the system from Disneyland . Construction began in 1964 with the cars being manufactured locally ; the total cost of the system was £ 50 @,@ 000 ( 2011 : £ 794 thousand ) . In 1974 a fire broke out in the kitchens of the Beachcomber Chinese restaurant leading to the complete destruction of the Princes building . In the Ballroom upstairs , a " Miss Personality Competition " was taking place when smoke was first spotted . The Redcoat in Charge of this event and the compère acted quickly , and were able to evacuate the building with no loss of life . To compensate for the loss of the entertainment venue , the <unk> was moved to encompass the Ingoldmells Hotel , which then became another venue . 
 In 1987 , the resort benefited from a £ 14 million ( 2011 : £ 32 @.@ 3 million ) investment and improvement scheme , following which the resort was known as <unk> World . Around this time , many of the structures were subject to change with the demolition of many chalets and some central buildings including the Windsor dining hall and Empire theatre . The 1980s saw the removal of the miniature railway and chairlift system , but also saw the construction of a new indoor swimming pool named the <unk> and an outdoor fun pool . 
 As with its Bognor Regis and Minehead counterparts , the Skegness resort underwent further improvement work in 1998 with the construction of the Skyline Pavilion . This tented structure is described by tourism writer Bruce Prideaux as a " Baby Millennium Dome " even though it pre @-@ dated the dome . The Pavilion contains entertainment facilities such as stages , bars , restaurants , shops and amusements . The improvement programme also included the construction of 1 @,@ 045 brand new accommodation units , making it the largest timber @-@ frame construction project in Europe that year . At the same time , the company dropped its use of the possessive apostrophe , changing from Butlin 's to Butlins ; after the refurbishment the resort was renamed as Butlins Resort Skegness , as it remains to date . 
 = = Butlins Resort Skegness = = 
 Today the resort caters for over 400 @,@ 000 visitors per year with 350 @,@ 000 being resident and 70 @,@ 000 visiting for the day . Along with the nearby Fantasy Island amusement park , the resort is the largest employer in the Skegness area , and currently employs 1 @,@ 200 staff each year , 40 of which make up the Redcoat team . According to the national police profile of the local residents , a large proportion of the Butlins workforce is now Eastern European in origin . 
 Over the years many of the attractions have been removed , including the monorail at the end of 2002 . However the resort still retains several swimming pools and a funfair . Today it provides a range of activities such as rock climbing , fencing , and archery . It also provides a wide range of entertainment , aided by the formation of strategic partnerships with popular brands , including The X Factor , Britain 's Got Talent , Thomas & Friends , Brainiac : Science Abuse , Guinness World Records , Bob the Builder , <unk> and Angelina Ballerina . 
 = = Pop Culture & Other Influences = = 
 In 1962 the Camp played its part in the formation of the rock band the Beatles , when Paul McCartney and John Lennon visited to meet Ringo Starr who was playing drums with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes at the time , to offer Starr the drummers position with The Beatles , who had just secured a recording contract . Storm 's group had a summer booking at the camp , following on from the previous year . It was in 1960 whilst playing Butlin 's Pwllheli camp that Richard Starkey developed his stage name Ringo Starr . The first song McCartney himself ever sang in public was " Long Tall Sally " , at a Butlin 's talent competition . 
 For several years between 1956 and 1959 , the comedian and TV presenter Dave Allen worked as a Redcoat at the camp . For Allen it was his first experience of fame ( within the community of campers ) and he found that he could not escape it , saying , " You can 't get away once they know you — unless you lock yourself in your chalet .

He reasoned that it had already proved easily convertible to a naval base and that Britain was unprepared for sudden invasions as a result of overseas deployments .

 = Electoral district of Perth = 
 The Electoral district of Perth is a Legislative Assembly electorate in the state of Western Australia . Perth is named for the capital city of Western Australia whose central business district falls within its borders . It is one of the oldest electorates in Western Australia , with its first member having been elected in the inaugural 1890 elections of the Legislative Assembly . 
 It has historically been a mostly safe seat for the Labor Party , but was won by Liberal Eleni Evangel at the 2013 election . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Perth is bounded by the Swan River to the south and southeast , Mitchell Freeway and Thomas Street to the west , Green Street to the north , and Walcott Street to the northeast . Its boundaries include the suburbs of East Perth , Highgate , Leederville , Mount Hawthorn , Northbridge , North Perth , Perth and West Perth along with part of Mount Lawley southwest of Walcott Street . Major features inside the electorate include Perth 's central business district , Kings Park , the East Perth redevelopment precinct and Hyde Park . 
 Historically , the boundaries included a much smaller area . In 1911 , it only covered the central business district and Northbridge , and in 1929 , a section between Newcastle and Bulwer Streets was added . When it was recreated from parts of the abolished West Perth and East Perth districts at the 1961 redistribution , the Perth electorate included all of West Perth and part of Kings Park , but its northern boundary only extended to Vincent Street , Hyde Park and the East Perth railway station . The 1972 redistribution added part of West Leederville east of Kimberley Street , and extended the northern boundary to include southern Leederville and parts of North Perth and Mount Lawley . By 1982 , it extended to Walcott Street , and the 1994 redistribution saw it extend well into the former seat of Mount Lawley . 
 The 2007 redistribution , which came into effect at the 2008 election , removed Menora and parts of Mount Lawley northeast of Walcott Street , while including all of West Perth as well as Kings Park , which had previously been part of <unk> .

 As redistributions alter an electorate 's area and demographic profile , the 2006 Census conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the boundaries prior to the redistribution is the main source of information on the electorate 's current profile . At the 2006 census , the median age of the electorate 's residents was 35 years , compared to 36 across metropolitan Perth — only 12 @.@ 1 % of the electorate 's population ( compared with 19 @.@ 5 % ) were below 15 , but the 25 – 54 age group was significantly greater . Only 53 @.@ 7 % of its residents were born in Australia , compared to 61 @.@ 5 % in Perth , and much less of the remainder were from northwestern Europe ( 10 @.@ 78 % as against 13 @.@ 93 % ) . At home , significantly more electorate residents spoke Italian , Cantonese , Mandarin and Greek at home , and whilst the top three religions ( Catholicism , no religion and Anglicanism ) differed little from other parts of Perth , Buddhism and Eastern Orthodox adherents outnumbered those of the Uniting Church . Only 36 % were married compared to 49 % across Perth , whilst only 47 @.@ 7 % of homes ( compared to 67 @.@ 2 % ) were fully owned or being purchased . The median income in the electorate was $ 606 compared with $ 513 , and 49 @.@ 5 % of the electorate 's workers were professionals or managers compared with 31 @.@ 8 % . 
 In the 2007 redistribution , Menora , with a median income of $ 397 and a median age of 48 , with 42 @.@ 5 % being 55 years or over , was removed , whilst West Perth , with a slightly larger population and a median income of $ 698 and a median age of 34 , and a higher percentage of professionals and managers than the electorate 's average , was added . 
 The Australian Bureau of Statistics do not collect data on sexuality , but the electorate is home to a significant portion of Perth 's gay community . Perth 's main gay venues , Connections Nightclub and the Court Hotel , as well as events such as the Pride Parade and <unk> , are located in the electorate .

 The electoral district of Perth was created as one of the initial 30 single @-@ member districts , and one of only six in the Perth – Fremantle area . Its first member , who was elected on 10 December 1890 , was Dr Edward Scott , a doctor by training who had been elected as Mayor of Perth the previous year . He resigned in December 1891 , and was replaced at the resulting by @-@ election on 12 January 1892 by Thomas Molloy . Molloy became embroiled in a controversy regarding provision of state aid to private schools , which he and fellow Catholic MLAs Timothy Quinlan and Alfred Canning supported . The Catholic Vicar General , Father Anselm Bourke , established the Education Defence League with their assistance . However , the issue became a major one in the 1894 election amongst the voting public , and all three MLAs lost their seats , Molloy losing to George Randell , a prominent Congregationalist who had led the cause against state aid . Randell became the Opposition Leader to Premier John Forrest , but stepped down from that role a year later in July 1895 , and did not contest the 1897 election , which was won by a supporter of Forrest . 
 In the 1901 election , after which the <unk> under George Leake were able to form a minority government , Frank Wilson , formerly the member for Canning , won the seat . After five months , the Leake government failed , and the governor eventually invited Alf Morgans of the Ministerial Party to form a government and appoint a six @-@ member Ministry . Morgans appointed Wilson minister of mines and commissioner of railways on 21 November 1901 . Until 1947 , members of parliament who were appointed as ministers were required to resign their seat and recontest it at a ministerial by @-@ election , which was normally a fairly non @-@ eventful matter . However , Leake and his allies contested the six by @-@ elections with such organised campaigning that three of the six ministers , including Wilson , were defeated . 
 In 1911 , the seat was won for the first time for the Australian Labor Party by Walter Dwyer , a lawyer who helped to draft the Industrial Arbitration Act 1912 during the first Scaddan administration ; however , he was defeated by James Connolly of the new Liberal Party in 1914 . Connolly became a minister without portfolio in the new Wilson government in 1916 , but resigned in June 1917 when appointed to the role of Agent General for Western Australia . Robert Pilkington of the Nationalist Party won the subsequent by @-@ election on 21 July 1917 and election two months later , before leaving for England in 1921 . Harry Mann , a former detective who , amongst other things , oversaw gaming and racing , was elected in his place . 
 A controversy erupted in 1933 upon the establishment of a Lotteries Commission , to which Mann , along with John Scaddan and Legislative Council member Alec Clydesdale , were appointed . Several profitable newspaper competitions , including that of The Sunday Times , were prohibited due to being thinly disguised forms of gambling . In response , a Citizens ' Reform League was formed to defend the crosswords , and at the elections later that year , both Mann and Scaddan lost their seats — with Perth being won by former Labor Senator Ted Needham , who was to hold the seat until its abolition at the 1950 election , and North Perth for the following three years until his retirement . One sideline to Needham 's campaigns was watchmaker and jeweller William Murray , who had placed a public notice in The West Australian on 28 October 1930 stating that Parliament " has become an out @-@ of @-@ date instrument for achieving the will of Anglo @-@ Saxon peoples " and seeking names and addresses of anyone wishing to work towards overthrowing it — and then ran for election as a Nationalist in 1936 and 1943 . 
 The seat was re @-@ established at the 1962 election with different boundaries — the neighbouring seats of West Perth , East Perth and North Perth having all been abolished in the 1961 redistribution — and was won by Labor 's Stanley Heal , the previous member for West Perth . He was defeated at the 1965 election by Peter Durack of the Liberal Country League , who was in turn defeated by Terry Burke in 1968 . Burke , the brother of Brian Burke who went on to serve as Premier from 1983 until 1988 , went on to hold the seat for 19 years until 1987 . He faced some high @-@ profile Liberal opponents , including future Legislative Councillor Bob Pike in 1971 , historian and author Hal G.P. <unk> in 1977 and Olympic swimmer Peter Evans in 1986 . 
 Burke resigned in 1987 , and Labor 's Dr Ian Alexander , a City of Perth councillor and town planner from the party 's left faction , won the subsequent by @-@ election on 9 May 1987 . He spent much of his parliamentary time on Aboriginal issues , sustainability and the environment and the Northern Suburbs Transit System project . On 4 March 1991 , Ian Alexander resigned from the Labor party citing " frequent breaches of the party 's basic principles and platforms " , and sat as an independent until the 1993 election . Dr Alexander did not stand for election in 1993 , and Labor 's Diana Warnock , a former radio talk @-@ show host , won the seat with 50 @.@ 29 % of the two @-@ party @-@ preferred vote against the Liberals ' Hal G.P. <unk> . 
 On 21 October 1999 , Warnock announced her departure at the next election for personal reasons , and threw her support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde , a member of the Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament . However , the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele Farina for the post , and Labor 's affirmative action policy for candidates in winnable seats meant that failing to pick a female candidate would risk sitting male MPs . A week later , the Centre faction openly split , with a breakaway group endorsing Hyde . On 5 November , Farina withdrew from the contest , leaving Hyde to be preselected unopposed ahead of the 2001 election . He maintained the seat for Labor at the election , becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Western Australian parliament . 
 On 9 March 2013 , Liberal candidate and City of Perth councillor Eleni Evangel defeated John Hyde and Labor in an upset victory with a significant swing , becoming the first Liberal member for Perth since the 1960s .

 West Ham United Football Club is a professional football club based in Stratford , East London , England , that competes in the Premier League , England 's top tier of football . They played home games at the Boleyn Ground from 1904 until the end of the 2015 – 16 season when they moved to London Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park . 
 The club was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United . The club has traditionally played in a claret and blue home strip with white shorts . West Ham competed in the Southern League and Western League before joining the Football League in 1919 ; they were promoted to the top flight in 1923 , when they also played in the first FA Cup Final at Wembley . In 1940 , the club won the inaugural Football League War Cup . 
 West Ham have been winners of the FA Cup three times , in 1964 , 1975 , and 1980 , and have also been runners @-@ up twice , in 1923 , and 2006 . The club have reached two major European finals , winning the European Cup Winners ' Cup in 1965 and finishing runners up in the same competition in 1976 . West Ham also won the Intertoto Cup in 1999 . They are one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football , spending 58 of 90 league seasons in the top flight . The club 's highest league position to date came in 1985 – 86 when they achieved third place in the then First Division . 
 Three West Ham players were members of the 1966 World Cup final @-@ winning England team : captain Bobby Moore and goalscorers Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The earliest generally accepted incarnation of West Ham United was founded in 1895 as the Thames Ironworks team by foreman and local league referee Dave Taylor and owner Arnold Hills and was announced in the Thames Ironworks Gazette of June 1895 . 
 The team played on a strictly amateur basis for 1895 at least , with a team featuring a number of works employees including Thomas Freeman ( ships fireman ) , Walter Parks ( clerk ) , Tom Mundy , Walter Tranter and James Lindsay ( all boilermakers ) , William Chapman , George Sage , and William Chamberlain and apprentice riveter Charlie Dove . 
 The club , Thames Ironworks were the first ever winners of the West Ham Charity Cup in 1895 contested by clubs in the West Ham locality , then won the London League in 1897 . They turned professional in 1898 upon entering the Southern League Second Division , and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt . The following year they came second from bottom , but had established themselves as a fully fledged competitive team . They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals Fulham in a relegation play @-@ off , 5 – 1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status . 
 The team initially played in full dark blue kits , as inspired by Mr. Hills , who had been an Oxford University " Blue , " but changed the following season by adopting the sky blue shirts and white shorts combination worn through 1897 to 1899 . In 1899 , they acquired their now @-@ traditional home kit combination of claret shirts and sky blue sleeves in a wager involving Aston Villa players , who were League Champions at the time . 
 Following growing disputes over the running and financing of the club , in June 1900 Thames Ironworks F.C. was disbanded , then almost immediately relaunched on 5 July 1900 as West Ham United F.C. with Syd King as their manager and future manager Charlie Paynter as his assistant . Because of the original " works team " roots and links ( still represented upon the club badge ) , they are still known as " the Irons " or " the Hammers " amongst fans and the media . 
 = = = Birth of West Ham United = = = 
 West Ham Utd joined the Western League for the 1901 season while also continuing to play in the Southern Division 1 . In 1907 , West Ham were crowned the Western League Division 1B Champions , and then defeated 1A champions Fulham 1 – 0 to become the Western League Overall Champions . The reborn club continued to play their games at the Memorial Grounds in Plaistow ( funded by Arnold Hills ) but moved to a pitch in the Upton Park area in the guise of the Boleyn Ground stadium in 1904 . West Ham 's first game in their new home was against fierce rivals Millwall ( themselves an Ironworks team , albeit for a rival company ) drawing a crowd of 10 @,@ 000 and with West Ham running out 3 – 0 winners , and as the Daily Mirror wrote on 2 September 1904 , " Favoured by the weather turning fine after heavy rains of the morning , West Ham United began their season most auspiciously yesterday evening ; when they beat Millwall by 3 goals to 0 on their new enclosure at Upton Park . " 
 In 1919 , still under King 's leadership , West Ham gained entrance to the Football League Second Division , their first game being a 1 – 1 draw with Lincoln City , and were promoted to Division One in 1923 , also making it to the first ever FA Cup Final to be held at the old Wembley stadium . Their opponents were Bolton Wanderers . This was also known as the White Horse Final , so named because an estimated 200 @,@ 000 people came to see the match ; spilling out on to the pitch , which had to be cleared prior to kick @-@ off , by " Billie , " a giant white horse ( actually grey ) being ridden by PC George Scorey . The Cup Final match itself ended 2 – 0 to Bolton . The team enjoyed mixed success in Division 1 but retained their status for ten years and reached the FA Cup semi @-@ final in 1933 . 
 In 1932 , the club was relegated to Division Two and long term custodian Syd King was sacked after serving the club in the role of manager for 32 years , and as a player from 1899 to 1903 . Following relegation , King had mental health problems . He appeared drunk at a board meeting and soon after committed suicide . He was replaced with his assistant manager Charlie Paynter , who himself had been with West Ham in a number of roles since 1897 and who went on to serve the team in this role until 1950 for a total of 480 games . The club spent most of the next 30 years in this division , first under Paynter and then later under the leadership of former player Ted Fenton . Fenton succeeded in getting the club once again promoted to the top level of English football in 1958 , and , with the considerable input of player Malcolm Allison , helped develop both the initial batch of future West Ham stars and West Ham 's approach to the game . 
 = = = Glory years = = = 
 Ron Greenwood was appointed as Fenton 's successor in 1961 and soon led the club to two major trophies , winning the FA Cup in 1964 . The team was led by the young Bobby Moore . They also won the European Cup Winners ' Cup . During the 1966 FIFA World Cup , key members of the tournament winners England were West Ham players , including the captain , Bobby Moore ; Martin Peters ( who scored in the final ) ; and Geoff Hurst , who scored the first , and only , hat @-@ trick in a men 's World Cup final . All three players had come through the youth team at West Ham . 
 There is a " Champions " statue in Barking Road , opposite The Boleyn Tavern , commemorating West Ham 's " three sons " who helped win the 1966 World Cup : Bobby Moore , Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters . Also included on the statue is Everton 's Ray Wilson . 
 They also won the FA Cup in 1975 by defeating Fulham 2 – 0 . The Fulham team had former England captains Alan Mullery and West Ham legend Bobby Moore . 
 After a difficult start to the 1974 – 75 season , Greenwood moved himself " upstairs " to become general manager and , without informing the board , appointed his assistant John Lyall as team manager . The result was instant success – the team scored 20 goals in their first four games combined and won the FA Cup , becoming the last team to win the FA Cup with an all @-@ English side when they beat Fulham 2 – 0 in the 1975 final . Lyall then guided West Ham to another European Cup Winners ' Cup final in 1976 , though the team lost the match 4 – 2 to Belgian side Anderlecht . Greenwood 's tenure as general manager lasted less than three years , as he was appointed to manage England in the wake of Don Revie 's resignation in 1977 . 
 = = = Ups and downs = = = 
 In 1978 , West Ham were again relegated to Division Two , but Lyall was retained as manager and led the team to an FA Cup Final win against Arsenal in 1980 , their last major honour . They reached the final by defeating Everton in the semi @-@ final . The Hammers won 1 – 0 , with a goal scored from a header by Trevor Brooking in the 13th minute . This is notable as no team outside the top division has won the trophy since . West Ham were promoted to Division One in 1981 , and finished in the top ten of the first division for the next three seasons before achieving their highest @-@ ever league finish of third in 1985 – 86 ; a group of players which came to be known as The Boys of 86 . However , they suffered relegation again in 1989 , which resulted in Lyall 's sacking . He was awarded an ex gratia payment of £ 100 @,@ 000 but left the club in what Lyall described as " upsetting " circumstances , meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme . Lyall left West Ham after 34 years service . 
 After Lyall , Lou Macari briefly led the team , though he resigned after less than a single season in order to clear his name of allegations of illegal betting while manager of Swindon Town . He was replaced by former player Billy Bonds . In Bonds ' first full season , 1990 – 91 , West Ham again secured promotion to Division One . Now back in the top flight , Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons . With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme , there was crowd unrest . West Ham finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season . However , they rebounded strongly in 1992 – 93 . With Trevor Morley and Clive Allen scoring 40 goals , they guaranteed themselves second place on the last day of the season with a 2 – 0 home win against Cambridge United , and with it promotion to the Premier League . 
 With the team in the Premier League , there was a need to rebuild the team . Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was recruited for a fee of £ 1 @.@ 2 million . Shortly after arriving at the club , however , he became unhappy , citing homesickness from his native Oxford as the reason . Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed , never @-@ say @-@ die approach ; providing for Bonds ' further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player . Fifty @-@ eight days later , Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club @-@ record combined fee of £ 800 @,@ 000 , which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction . Whitbread was valued at £ 750 @,@ 000 in the deal . 
 Assistant manager Harry Redknapp was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players , with the club 's approval . With rumours of his old club Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position , the West Ham board and their managing director , Peter Storrie , made a controversial move . The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp 's services and offered Bonds a place away from the day @-@ to @-@ day affairs of the club — on the West Ham board . This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager . Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club . His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill @-@ feeling . Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly , saying , " If Harry had gone to Bournemouth , there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway , so we were in a no @-@ win situation . We 're sad that Bill is going , and it 's a big blow but it 's time to move on and we have appointed a great manager . " Redknapp became manager on 10 August 1994 . 
 Redknapp 's time at West Ham was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall . Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager , producing a net transfer fee deficit of £ 16 million even after the £ 18 million sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United . Some were notably successful , such as the signings of Stuart Pearce , Trevor Sinclair , Paolo Di Canio , John Hartson , Eyal <unk> and Ian Wright . Meanwhile , some were expensive , international players who failed at West Ham , such as Florin <unk> ; Davor Šuker , who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances ; Christian Bassila , who cost £ 720 @,@ 000 and played only 86 minutes of football ; Titi Camara ; Gary Charles , whose wages amounted to £ 4 @.@ 4 million but made only three starts for the club ; Rigobert Song ; Paulo <unk> ; and Marco Boogers , a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League . His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks , while his third season would also see another relegation battle . Always willing to enter the transfer market , Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson who added the impetus needed at the season 's end . 
 In 1999 , West Ham finished fifth , their highest position in the top flight since 1986 . They also won the Intertoto Cup beating French club Metz to qualify for the 1999 – 2000 UEFA Cup . Things began to falter for Redknapp with the sale for £ 18 million to Leeds United of Rio Ferdinand in November 2000 . Redknapp used the transfer money poorly with purchases such as Ragnvald Soma , who cost £ 800 @,@ 000 and played only seven league games , Camera and Song . Redknapp felt he needed more funds with which to deal in the transfer market . Chairman Brown lost patience with Redknapp due to his demands for further transfer funds . In June 2001 , called to a meeting with Brown expecting to discuss contracts , he was fired . His assistant Frank Lampard left too , making the sale of his son Frank Lampard , Jr . , inevitable ; in the summer of 2001 , he joined Chelsea for £ 11 million . 
 With several names , such as former player Alan Curbishley , now linked with the job , Chairman Brown recruited from within the club , appointing reserve team coach Glenn Roeder as manager on 9 May 2001 . He had already failed in management with Gillingham , where he lost 22 of the 35 games he managed , and Watford . His first big signings were the return of Don Hutchison for £ 5 million and Czech centre back Tomáš <unk> . Finishing 7th in his first season Roeder , in his office at Upton Park , suffered a blocked blood vessel in his brain . Now needing medical help and recuperation , former stalwart Trevor Brooking stood in as caretaker manager . Despite not losing another game , the Hammers were relegated on the last day of the season at Birmingham City with a record for a relegated club of 42 points . Ten seasons of top tier football were over . Many top players including Joe Cole , Di Canio and <unk> all left the club . 
 The next season , now in the second tier , Roeder resumed his stint as manager . Results were still poor , however , and after an away defeat to Rotherham United , he was sacked on 24 August 2003 . Brooking again took over as caretaker . He lost only one game , a 2 – 0 away defeat to Gillingham and is known as " the best manager West Ham never had . " Former Crystal Palace player and manager of Reading Alan Pardew was lined up to be the next bench boss . Reading and their chairman , John Madejski , however , were reluctant to let him leave . After serving a period of notice and gardening leave , and with West Ham paying Reading £ 380 @,@ 000 in compensation , he was appointed manager on 18 October 2003 , their tenth manager . Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in Nigel Reo @-@ Coker , Marlon Harewood and Brian Deane . In his first season in charge , they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace . His signings of Bobby Zamora , Matthew Etherington and veterans Chris Powell and Teddy Sheringham saw West Ham finishing sixth and subsequently beat Preston North End 1 – 0 thanks to a Zamora goal in the 2005 playoff final , securing a return to the Premier League . After ensuring promotion , Pardew said , " It 's a team effort . We defended well and we 're back where we belong . "

 On their return to the top division , West Ham finished in ninth place , The highlight of the 2005 – 06 season , however , was reaching the FA Cup final and taking favourites Liverpool to a penalty shootout after a 3 – 3 draw . West Ham lost the shootout , but nonetheless gained entry to the following season 's UEFA Cup as Liverpool had already qualified for the Champions League . In August 2006 , West Ham completed a major coup on the last day of the transfer window after completing the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano . The club was eventually bought by an Icelandic consortium , led by Eggert Magnússon , in November 2006 . Manager Alan Pardew was sacked after poor form during the season and was replaced by former Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley . 
 The signings of Mascherano and Tevez were investigated by the Premier League , who were concerned that details of the transfers had been omitted from official records . The club was found guilty and fined 5 @.@ 5 million pounds in April 2007 . However , West Ham avoided a points deduction which ultimately became critical in their avoidance of relegation at the end of the 2006 – 07 season . Following on from this event , Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan , supported by other sides facing possible relegation , including Fulham and Sheffield United , threatened legal action . West Ham escaped relegation by winning seven of their last nine games , including a 1 – 0 win over Arsenal , and on the last day of the season defeated newly crowned League Champions Manchester United 1 – 0 with a goal by Tevez to finish 15th . 
 In the 2007 – 08 season , West Ham remained reasonably consistently in the top half of the league table , with Fredrik Ljungberg in the team , despite a slew of injuries ; new signing Craig Bellamy missed most of the campaign , while Kieron Dyer was out from August 2007 . The last game of the season , at the Boleyn Ground , saw West Ham draw 2 – 2 against Aston Villa , ensuring a tenth @-@ place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur . It was a five @-@ place improvement on the previous season , and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation . 
 After a row with the board over the sale of defenders Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney to Sunderland , manager Alan Curbishley resigned on 3 September 2008 . His successor was former Chelsea striker Gianfranco Zola , who took over on 11 September 2008 to become the club 's first non @-@ British manager . In the 2008 – 09 season , West Ham finished ninth , a single place improvement . 
 In the 2009 – 10 season , West Ham started strongly with a 2 – 0 win over newly promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers with goals from Mark Noble and newly appointed captain Matthew Upson . A League Cup match against old rivals Millwall brought about violent riots outside the ground as well as pitch invasions and crowd trouble inside Upton Park . In August 2009 , the financial concerns of Icelandic owners parent companies left the current owners unable to provide any funds until a new owner was found . The club 's shirt sponsor SBOBET provided the club with help purchase a much needed striker , the Italian Alessandro <unk> . 
 West Ham had a poor season which involved a prolonged battle against relegation . They finally secured their survival with two games remaining by defeating Wigan 3 – 2 . The club managed to take 35 points from 38 games , seven fewer than the total they had when relegated seven years prior . On 11 May 2010 , two days after the end of the 2009 – 10 season , West Ham announced the termination of Zola 's contract with immediate effect . On 3 June 2010 , Avram Grant signed a four @-@ year deal to become the next manager of West Ham subject to a work permit . West Ham 's form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone , placing Grant 's future as manager under serious doubt . A 4 – 0 Football League Cup quarter @-@ final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright spot in a disappointing season . West Ham 's form in the Premier League did not affect their form in the two domestic cups . The Hammers reached the semi @-@ final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter final of the FA cup before a 2 – 1 defeat at Stoke City . 
 On 15 May 2011 , West Ham 's relegation to the Championship was confirmed after a comeback from Wigan at the DW Stadium . With West Ham leading 0 – 2 at half @-@ time through two Demba Ba goals , Wigan battled back to win 3 – 2 thanks to an added @-@ time strike from Charles N <unk> . Following the loss , West Ham announced the sacking of manager Avram Grant just one season into his tenure . On 1 June 2011 , Sam Allardyce was appointed as manager as Grant 's replacement . 
 The club finished third in the 2011 – 12 Football League Championship with 86 points and took part in the play @-@ offs . They beat Cardiff City in the play off semi @-@ final 5 – 0 on aggregate to reach the final against Blackpool at Wembley on 19 May 2012 . Carlton Cole opened the scoring , and although Blackpool equalised early in the second half , Ricardo Vaz Tê scored the winner for West Ham in the 87th minute . 
 West Ham , on their return to the Premier League , signed former players James <unk> and George McCartney on permanent deals , as well as record signing Matt Jarvis and Andy Carroll on loan . They won their first game of the season , on 18 August 2012 , 1 – 0 against Aston Villa thanks to a Kevin Nolan goal . The highlight of the first half of the season was a 3 – 1 home win against reigning European champions Chelsea on 1 December 2012 which saw them in eighth position and 12th at the end of the year . On 22 March 2013 , West Ham secured a 99 @-@ year lease deal on the Olympic Stadium , with it planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016 – 17 season . Tenth place was secured at the end of the season with nine home wins and only three away from home . Only 11 away goals were scored , the lowest of the entire league . In June 2013 , West Ham again broke their record transfer fee with the signing of Andy Carroll on a six @-@ year contract for a fee of £ 15 million . 
 In 2013 – 14 , West Ham finished 13th in the Premier League . They also reached the semi @-@ finals of the League Cup before losing 9 – 0 on aggregate to eventual cup @-@ winners Manchester City . A feature of the season were the criticisms of manager Sam Allardyce by supporters relating to his perceived negative playing tactics . West Ham finished 12th in the 2014 – 15 Premier League , one place higher than the previous season . Minutes after the last game of the season , on 24 May 2015 , the club announced that Allardyce 's contract would not be renewed and that they were seeking a new manager . By winning the Premier League Fair Play table for 2014 – 15 , West Ham qualified for the 2015 – 16 UEFA Europa League , entering at the first qualifying round . On 9 June 2015 , former West Ham player Slaven Bilić was appointed as manager on a three @-@ year contract . In Bilić 's fourth game in charge , the team won at Anfield for the first time in 52 years , beating Liverpool 0 – 3 , with goals from Manuel <unk> , Mark Noble and <unk> Sakho . In Bilić 's first season as manager , West Ham finished 7th in the Premier League . The team broke several records for the club in the Premier League era , including the highest number of points with 62 , the highest number of goals in a season with 65 , the least number of games lost in a season with eight and the lowest number of away defeats with five . Following Manchester United 's win in the 2016 FA Cup Final , West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2016 @-@ 17 UEFA Europa League . 
 = = Crest and colours = = 
 = = = Crest = = = 
 The original club crest was a crossed pair of rivet hammers ; tools commonly used in the iron and shipbuilding industry . A castle was later ( circa 1903 – 04 ) added to the crest and represents a prominent local building , Green Street House , which was known as " Boleyn Castle " through an association with Anne Boleyn . The manor was reportedly one of the sites at which Henry VIII courted his second queen , though in truth there is no factual evidence other than the tradition of rumour . 
 The castle may have also been added as a result of the contribution made to the club by players of Old Castle Swifts , or even the adoption ( in 1904 ) of Boleyn Castle FC as their reserve side when they took over their grounds on the site . 
 The crest was redesigned and updated by London design agency Springett Associates in the late 1990s , featuring a wider yellow castle with fewer cruciform " windows " along with the peaked roofs being removed ; the tops of the towers had previously made the castle appear more akin to Disneyland 's Sleeping Beauty 's Castle than a functioning fortress . The designer also altered other details to give a more substantial feel to the iconography . 
 When the club redesigned the facade of the stadium ( construction finished 2001 – 02 ) the " castle " from the later badge was incorporated into the structure at the main entrance to the ground . A pair of towers were prominent features of the ground 's appearance , both bearing the club 's modern insignia ( which was also located in the foyer and other strategic locations ) . 
 A new badge was approved by supporters in July 2014 and was introduced following the end of the 2015 – 16 season , when the club moved into the Olympic Stadium . It removes the Boleyn Castle due to the club moving away , leaving just the crossed hammers , which the club says is inspired by the crest during the career of Bobby Moore . The word " London " will be introduced below to " establish the club firmly on the international stage , " and the more minimalist approach is to give a " strong statement that is instantly West Ham United . " The shape of the crest is that of the hull of HMS Warrior , the first ironclad warship in the Royal Navy , which was built by Thames Ironworks . 
 = = = Colours = = = 
 The original colours of the team were dark blue , due to Thames Ironworks chairman Arnold Hills being a former student of Oxford University . However , the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks , as well as sky blue or white kit . 
 The Irons permanently adopted claret and blue for home colours in the summer of 1899 . Thames Ironworks right @-@ half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove , who was a professional sprinter of national repute , as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks . Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham , close to Villa Park , the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players , who wagered money that one of them would win . 
 Bill Dove defeated them and , when they were unable to pay the bet , one of the Villa players who was responsible for washing the team 's kit offered a complete team 's " football kits " to Dove in payment . The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was " missing . " This , however , is often disputed . The predecessors of Thames Ironworks , Old Castle Swifts FC , played in pale blue shirts , white shorts and claret socks as early as 1892 , around the same time Aston Villa played in said same colours . 
 Thames Ironworks , and later West Ham United , retained the claret yoke / blue sleeves design , but also continued to use their previously favoured colours for their away kits . 
 = = = = Shirt sponsors and kit suppliers = = = = 
 Since January 2015 West Ham 's shirts have been sponsored by <unk> . Previous sponsors have included <unk> Trust ( 1983 – 89 ) , BAC Windows ( 1989 – 93 ) , Dagenham Motors ( 1993 – 97 ) , Dr. Martens ( 1998 – 2003 ) , <unk> ( 2003 – 07 ) , <unk> ( 2007 – 08 ) , SBOBET ( 2008 – 13 ) , and Alpari FX ( 2013 – 15 ) . The deal with XL ended early due to the XL Leisure Group being placed in administration in September 2008 . During this period , players had their squad numbers ironed over the existing sponsorship logo , before a deal with SBOBET was finalised . The deal with Alpari also ended early , because of the sponsor entering liquidation . 
 The current kit manufacturers , Umbro , have made West Ham 's kit from 2007 – 10 , and from 2015 to the present . Previous manufacturers have been Admiral ( 1976 – 80 ) , Adidas ( 1980 – 87 , 2013 – 15 ) , Scoreline ( 1987 – 89 ) , Bukta ( 1989 – 93 ) , Pony ( 1993 – 99 ) , Fila ( 1999 – 2003 ) , Reebok ( 2003 – 07 ) , and Macron ( 2010 – 13 ) .

 The team 's supporters are famous for their rendition of the chorus of their team 's anthem , " I 'm Forever Blowing Bubbles " introduced to the club by former manager Charlie Paynter in the late 1920s . A Pears soap commercial featuring the curly haired child in the Millais ' " Bubbles " was well known at the time . The child resembled a player , Billy J. " Bubbles " Murray , from local schoolboy team , Park School , where the headmaster was Cornelius Beal . Beal was known locally for his music and rhyme and wrote special words to the tune of " I 'm Forever Blowing Bubbles " whenever any player was having a good game . 
 Beal was a friend of Paynter , while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played football at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as Jim Barrett . Through this contrivance of association the club 's fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games , sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play the refrain by Charlie Paynter . 
 There is a slight change to the lyrics sung by the Upton Park faithful . The second line 's " nearly reach the sky " is changed to " they reach the sky " , " Then like my dreams " is also changed to " And like my dreams " . In addition the fans begin a chant of " United , United ! " to cap it off . 
 The 1975 FA Cup version – which contains the original lyrics , and features vocals from the team 's then @-@ current players – is always played before home games , with the home crowd joining in and carrying the song on after the music stops at the verse line " Fortune 's always hiding " . Bubbles was published as a waltz whereas during the game the crowd sing it in common time . 
 Like other teams , the team also have a history of adopting or adapting popular songs of the day to fit particular events , themes , players or personas . These have included serious renditions of theatre and movie classics such as " The Bells are Ringing , " along with more pun @-@ laden or humorous efforts , such as chanting former player Paolo Di Canio 's name to the canzone " La donna è mobile " by Giuseppe Verdi , or D.I. Canio to the tune of <unk> 's " <unk> , " or the chant of " Who Let The Potts Out ? " to the tune of Baha Men 's " Who Let the Dogs Out ? " when Steve Potts could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career , or " That 's Zamora " to the tune of Dean Martin 's 1953 " That 's Amore " in honour of former striker Bobby Zamora . Other former players to be serenaded include Christian Dailly with vastly @-@ altered lyrics to Frankie Valli 's " Can 't Take My Eyes Off You , " Joe Cole with Spandau Ballet 's " Gold " song title sung as " Cole " and <unk> <unk> . A song for West Ham favourite Bobby Moore , " Viva Bobby Moore , " is also sung based on The Business 's " Oi ! " rendition of the song , based on The Equals ' 1969 release " Viva Bobby Joe . " In 2016 , supporters adapted the lyrics of Billy Ray Cyrus ' Achy Breaky Heart in honour of Dimitri Payet 
 Fans gained national attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham in his first away match of 1998 – 99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone . Coinciding with the game , there were claims ( and an image taken ) that fans , organised by a hardcore , had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub . Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South @-@ East London , the heartland of West Ham 's greatest rivals Millwall . The West Ham fans did boo Beckham 's every touch of the ball during the game , however . 
 They have also displayed a particular zeal when it comes to abusing former players particularly those who are perceived to have abandoned the club , or performed some disservice . Famously Paul Ince , Frank Lampard , Jermain Defoe , and Nigel Reo @-@ Coker have borne the brunt of verbal assaults and a guaranteed hostile reception at Upton Park . However , players such as Joe Cole , Michael Carrick , Rio Ferdinand , Bobby Zamora and Carlos Tevez receive applause and even standing ovations in honour of their contributions during their time at the club . Joe Cole subsequently rejoined West Ham from Liverpool midway through the 2012 – 13 season .

 The origins of West Ham 's links with organised football @-@ related violence starts in the 1960s with the establishment of The Mile End Mob ( named after an area of the East End of London ) . During the 1970s and 1980s ( the main era for organised football @-@ related violence ) , West Ham gained further notoriety for the levels of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans , and the police . During the ' 70s in particular , rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games , most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham . 
 The Inter City Firm were one of the first " casuals , " so called because they avoided police supervision by not wearing football @-@ related clothing and travelled to away matches on regular InterCity trains , rather than on the cheap and more tightly policed " football special " charter trains . The group were an infamous West Ham @-@ aligned gang . As the firm 's moniker " inter city " suggests violent activities were not confined to local derbies – the hooligans were content to cause trouble at any game , though nearby teams often bore the brunt . 
 The 2005 independent film Green Street starring Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam focuses on a firm of West Ham hooligans . 
 = = = Rivalries = = = 
 West Ham have strong rivalries with several other clubs . Most of these are with other London clubs , especially with Tottenham Hotspur in an East versus North London derby and with Chelsea in an East versus West London rivalry . The rivalry between West Ham and Tottenham has been fuelled by players such as Michael Carrick , Martin Peters , Paul Allen , Jermain Defoe and Scott Parker leaving the Hammers to join Tottenham . The rivalry deepened with the appointment of former Hammers manager Harry Redknapp as Tottenham 's manager . Since the 2006 – 07 Premier League season , West Ham have developed a strong rivalry with Yorkshire club Sheffield United due to the dubious circumstances surrounding the transfer of Carlos Tevez , who helped West Ham avoid relegation at Sheffield United 's expense . 
 The oldest and fiercest rivalry is with Millwall . The two sides are local rivals , having both formed originally around local companies , with players living in the same localities . The early history of both clubs are intertwined , with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time , resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall . Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final . Later in the 1920s , the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs @-@ based companies ( i.e. Millwall fans ) refused to support , breeding ill will between the two camps , the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years . In 1972 , a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans . 
 The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall has involved considerable violence and is one of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism . The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009 – 10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park . This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other , and the first ever in the League Cup . Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground , resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium , with serious injuries , include the stabbing of a Millwall supporter , damage to property and several arrests reported by police . There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game . In January 2010 West Ham were fined £ 115 @,@ 000 after being found guilty of violent , threatening , obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play . Millwall were cleared of all charges .

 Until 2016 , West Ham were based at the Boleyn Ground , commonly known as Upton Park , in Newham , East London . The capacity of the Boleyn Ground was 35 @,@ 016 , and had been West Ham 's ground since 1904 . Prior to this , in their previous incarnation of Thames Ironworks , they played at Hermit Road in Canning Town and briefly at Browning Road in East Ham , before moving to the Memorial Grounds in Plaistow in 1897 . They retained the stadium during their transition to becoming West Ham United and were there for a further four seasons before moving to the Boleyn Ground in 1904 . 
 Former chairman Eggert Magnússon made clear his ambition for West Ham to move to the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Olympics , a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical move for the Government as it was in the borough of Newham . 
 In February 2010 , however , the British Olympic Minister stated that West Ham would not get the stadium , and it would instead be used for track and field . On 17 May 2010 , West Ham and Newham London Borough Council submitted a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company for the use of the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Olympic Games . The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60 @,@ 000 which would retain a competition athletics track . The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics , Ed Warner , who said , " I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics . I think you 'd find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldn 't look like you had a track between you and the pitch . " 
 On 30 September 2010 , the club formally submitted its bid for the Olympic Stadium with a presentation at 10 Downing Street , and on 8 October 2010 the world 's largest live entertainment company , Live Nation , endorsed the club 's Olympic Stadium plans . Three days after Live Nation 's endorsement , UK Athletics confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid to take over the Olympic Stadium in legacy mode . In November 2010 , West Ham United commenced a search for potential developers for " informal discussions " about what would happen to the ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games . According to the club , the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by the summer of 2014 . On 11 February 2011 , the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham United as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games . 
 The decision in favour of West Ham 's bid was unanimous , although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue . However , hopes of moving to the stadium were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient . With Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing less than a mile away from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and put them out of business . However both clubs appeal for a judicial review were rejected on 23 June 2011 . On 3 March 2011 West Ham United 's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and Mayor of London Boris Johnson . 
 On 8 June 2011 , it was confirmed that the Westfield Shopping Centre had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium . West Ham announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 2014 – 15 season . In August 2011 , an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games . However , on 29 June 2011 Tottenham Hotspur announced they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West Ham the stadium , in an oral hearing , to try and overturn the original high court appeal being rejected . On 25 August 2011 Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review , by the High Court , into the Olympic Stadium bidding process . On the 11 October 2011 the deal to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure , and the government deciding the stadium will stay in public ownership . Six days later Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed . 
 Once the original deal collapsed a new process to select a tenant was begun . West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium . By March 2012 , West Ham was one of the four bidders for the Stadium . With a decision due by the Olympic Park Legacy Company in May 2012 , Boris Johnson delayed the final selection of future tenants until completion of the 2012 Olympics stating that it was " overwhelmingly likely " that the tenants would be West Ham United . 
 It was announced on 22 March 2013 that the team signed a 99 @-@ year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra £ 25 million towards the costs of converting the site . It is seen as a massive step forward for the club . They plan to move into the Stadium before the start of the 2016 – 17 season . Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham 's tenancy , arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the arrangement . In September 2015 , however , the government rejected holding such an inquiry . 
 = = The Academy of Football = = 
 The club promotes the popular idea of West Ham being " The Academy of Football , " with the moniker adorning the ground 's new stadium façade . The comment predominantly refers to the club 's youth development system which was established by manager Ted Fenton during the 1950s , that has seen a number of international players emerge through the ranks . Most notably the club contributed three players to the World Cup winning England side of 1966 including club icon Bobby Moore , as well as Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst who between them scored all of England 's goals in the eventual 4 – 2 victory . Other academy players that have gone on to play for England have included Trevor Brooking , Alvin Martin , Tony Cottee and Paul Ince . 
 Since the late 1990s , Rio Ferdinand , Frank Lampard , Joe Cole , Michael Carrick and Glen Johnson began their careers at West Ham and all went on to play for much bigger clubs . Most recently , the likes of first teamers Mark Noble and James Tomkins , as well as Welsh international Jack Collison , have emerged through the Academy . <unk> for fans and managers alike , the club has struggled to retain many of these players due to ( predominantly ) financial reasons . West Ham , during the 2007 – 08 season , had an average of 6 @.@ 61 English players in the starting line up , higher than any other Premier League club , which cemented their status as one of the few Premier League clubs left that were recognised to be bringing through young English talent and were recognised as having " homegrown players . " Between 2000 and 2011 , the club produced eight England players , as many as Manchester United and one fewer than Arsenal . Much of the success of The Academy has been attributed to Tony Carr , who has been West Ham youth coach since 1973 .
