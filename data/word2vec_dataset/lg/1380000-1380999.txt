 The role was the most difficult to cast , and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese , noting " Who would you rather make the argument [ to Klaatu ] for mankind than John Cleese ? " Stoff , a producer , had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect . The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him , and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age . He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in <unk> with normal human speech patterns . Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often <unk> about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters . Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard : " The trouble is , I had to be able to write the equation , because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years . I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all . In A Fish Called Wanda , I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means . " 
 Jon Hamm as Dr. Michael Granier , a NASA official who recruits Helen into his scientific team investigating Klaatu . Granier is fascinated by Klaatu , but is torn between his official obligation to detain the alien and protect his country . 
 Hamm acknowledged science fiction was a niche genre when the original film was made , and that it used science fiction to make topical issues more approachable . Hamm had the same feelings for this remake . Originally , Hamm 's character was French and named Michel . Although he is interested in math and science , Hamm found his technical dialogue difficult and had to film his lines repeatedly .

 In 1994 , 20th Century Fox and Erwin Stoff had produced the successful Keanu Reeves film Speed . Stoff was at an office at the studio when he saw a poster for the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still , which made him ponder a remake with Reeves as Klaatu . By the time David Scarpa started writing a draft of the script in 2005 , Thomas Rothman was in charge of Fox and felt a responsibility to remake the film . Scarpa felt everything about the original film was still relevant , but changed the allegory from nuclear war to environmental damage because " the specifics of [ how ] we now have the capability to destroy ourselves have changed . " Scarpa noted the recent events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 informed his mindset when writing the screenplay . He scrapped Klaatu 's speech at the conclusion of the story because " audiences today are [ un ] willing to tolerate that . People don 't want to be preached to about the environment . We tried to avoid having our alien looking out over the garbage in the lake and crying a silent tear [ from the 1970s Keep America Beautiful ads ] . " 
 Director Scott Derrickson admired the original film 's director Robert Wise , whom he met as a film student . He generally dislikes remakes , but he enjoyed the script , which he decided was a retelling of the story and not a true remake . He also explained that The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a widely seen classic film , unlike The Wizard of Oz , which he would not bother remaking . Derrickson 's benchmark was Philip Kaufman 's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers . Klaatu was made more menacing than in the original , because the director felt he had to symbolize the more complex era of the 2000s . There was debate over whether to have Klaatu land in Washington , D.C. , as in the original ; but Derrickson chose New York City because he liked the geometry of Klaatu 's sphere landing in Central Park . Derrickson also did not write in Gort 's original backstory , which was already absent from the script he read . He already thought the script was a good adaptation and didn 't want the negative connotations of fascism from the original film . 
 Astronomer Seth Shostak served as scientific consultant on the film , reviewed the script several times for errors , gave suggestions for making the scientists appear less dry , and noted that they would refer to one another on a first @-@ name basis . He said , " Real scientists don 't describe an object entering the solar system as ' notable for the fact that it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse , but moving at nearly three times ten to the seventh meters per second . ' More likely , they would say that there was ' a goddamned rock headed our way ! ' " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming took place from December 12 , 2007 , to March 19 , 2008 , at Vancouver Film Studios , Vancouver Forum , Deer Lake , Jericho Park , and Simon Fraser University . The film was originally scheduled for release on May 9 , 2008 , but it was delayed until December 12 , 2008 , because filming commenced later than scheduled . By the time preproduction had started , Scarpa had written 40 drafts of the script . The film was mostly shot on sets because it was winter in Vancouver . 
 Derrickson was fascinated by color schemes . He chose blue @-@ green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still . The missile silo converted by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange , which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field . Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film , and rendered the colors in post @-@ production to make them more subtle , for realism . 
 To film Barnhardt and Klaatu writing equations on a blackboard , general relativity sums were drawn by Marco <unk> from the University of Minnesota and William Hiscock of Montana State University in faint pencil marks . Keanu Reeves and John Cleese drew over these in chalk . 
 As Fox had a mandate to become a carbon neutral company by 2011 , The Day the Earth Stood Still 's production had an environmentally friendly regimen . " Whether it was because of this movie thematically or it was an accident of time , there were certain things production @-@ wise we 've been doing and been asked to do and so on , " said Erwin Stoff . To prevent the wasting of paper , concept art , location stills and costume tests were posted on a website created by the production for crew members to reference . Costumes were kept for future Fox productions or given to homeless shelters , rather than thrown away . Hybrid vehicles were used and crew members had orders to turn off their car engines if they sat in their vehicles for more than three minutes . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Weta Digital created the majority of the effects , with additional work by Cinesite and Flash Film Works . The machines of Klaatu 's people have a biological basis rather than a mechanical one , as Derrickson theorized that their mastery of ecology would demonstrate their level of sophistication . Derrickson deemed a modern audience would find the original 's flying saucer amusingly obsolete and unique to the original 's milieu . The director also noted that the original The Day the Earth Stood Still had influenced many films , so his technicians needed to bring new ideas to the remake . 
 The effects team approached the new spacecraft 's design as inter @-@ dimensional portals resembling orbs . The script had specified the inside of the orbs as a " white limbo @-@ y thing " , but visual @-@ effects consultant Jeff Okun explained this was deleted for being too " cheesy " . Derrickson felt not showing the inside of the ship , unlike the original , would make the audience more curious . As well as computer @-@ generated spheres — such as Klaatu 's 300 @-@ foot ( 91 m ) ship , or a 3 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 910 m ) tall orb that rises from the sea — 700 @-@ pound ( 320 kg ) spheres , 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) in diameter , were sculpted by Custom Plastics , which built spheres for Disney theme parks . The spheres were split in two to make transportation easier . It was difficult placing lights inside them without making them melt . The visual @-@ effects team looked at natural objects , including water droplets and the surfaces of Jupiter and Saturn for the spheres ' texture . 
 Derrickson emphasized a Trinity @-@ like relationship between the sphere , Klaatu , and Gort . Klaatu is initially depicted as a radiant focus of sentient light . He is then depicted as a 7 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) gray " walking womb " shape which finally takes on a completely human appearance . The filmmakers conceived the transitional form because they pondered the idea of humans mistaking space suits for alien skin . Computer @-@ generated imagery and practical effects achieved the transformation . Todd Masters ( Slither ) directed the creation of the alien form , using thermal plastic and silicone . 
 The script described Gort as nanotechnology by the time the director signed on , although it did not specify Gort 's appearance . The 15th draft of the script had depicted the robot as a four @-@ legged " Totem " that stands upright after firing its weapon beam . Okun explained there were many more " horrific " or " amazing " concepts , but it made sense that the robot would assume a familiar human shape . He cited the Monolith from 2001 : A Space Odyssey as an inspiration for Gort 's texture , noting " it 's a simple shape , it has no emotion [ ... ] it just simply is " , which makes Gort more frightening because the audience cannot tell what he is thinking . The animators estimated the computer @-@ generated robot as 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) tall , whereas in the original he was played by the 7 @-@ foot @-@ 7 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 31 m ) tall Lock Martin . Gort 's computer model was programmed to reflect light , and the filmmakers spent time on motion @-@ capture sessions to guide the performance . An actor wore weights on his hands and feet , allowing the animators to bring a sense of weight and power to Gort . His destructive capabilities were based on locust swarms , although the idea of metal @-@ eating insects goes back to Stephen Vincent Benét 's 1933 poem " Metropolitan Nightmare " .

 The Day the Earth Stood Still : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was orchestrated and conducted by Timothy Williams . Tyler Bates was brought in to compose the score for The Day the Earth Stood Still after Derrickson heard his work on The Devil 's Rejects and Slither . Instead of imitating the original score by Bernard Herrmann , Bates decided to try to convey the updated message of the new film , and he assumed that most people would not even realize it was a remake . Bates said , " People revere an original property and feel that it 's sacred , but frankly , there 's a good story to be retold , as it applies to the climate of the world now . If that 's something beyond the scope of a person 's ability to take in , on a new level , without necessarily using the original as a criteria for whether or not they 're going to enjoy it , then they probably shouldn 't bother themselves with it . " The origins for the sound on the new score came from Bates attending the filming of a few scenes with Reeves and Smith . When he got back to L.A. , he created a sound loop on his <unk> to which Derrickson responded , " I think that 's the score ! " , when it was played for him . Bates utilized the theremin , which Herrmann heavily used for the original film 's score . Bates and the theremin player he hired used the instrument in a manner reminiscent of a sound effect , especially during Klaatu 's surgery . A short segment from Bach 's Goldberg Variations is heard playing in the background of the Professor 's home when Klaatu visits the Professor which was not included in the film 's accompanying soundtrack release .

 According to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ( NJDEP ) , two developed lake communities in the Papakating Creek watershed — Lake Neepaulin and the nearby Clove Acres Lake contribute to phosphorus loading in the waters of Papakating Creek . The phosphorus loading may originate from the runoff of fertilizer applications on residential lawns , nearby agricultural operations , or from large populations of geese that inhabit the lakes .

 On October 23 , 2002 , West was in a California recording studio producing music for Beanie Sigel , <unk> <unk> , and The Black Eyed Peas .

 = Jack Warhop = 
 John Milton Warhop ( July 4 , 1884 – October 4 , 1960 ) was an American baseball pitcher who played eight seasons in Major League Baseball from 1908 to 1915 for the New York Highlanders / New York Yankees . He is best known for giving up Babe Ruth 's first two career home runs . 
 Considered by baseball insiders and historians as an unlucky pitcher , Warhop had a career 69 – 92 win – loss record , but with a 3 @.@ 12 earned run average while playing for mostly second division Highlanders / Yankees teams . Of his 92 losses , the Yankees did not score a run in 23 , and he holds the MLB record for losing the most 1 – 0 games with five in 1914 . He was released after the 1915 season and played a number of seasons in minor league baseball and semi @-@ professional teams until his late 40s or early 50s . 
 Warhop had an underhand submarine delivery , which gave him the nickname " Crab " . He was also known for his rather small size , which is a subject of some conflict , although most historians and statisticians agree that he measured between 5 feet , 8 inches , used by several historians like Marty Appel or 5 feet 9 inches , used by Baseball @-@ Reference.com. 
 = = Early life = = 
 Warhop was born in Hinton , West Virginia . He spent his early life working as a coal miner for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad . Warhop played for local semi @-@ professional teams sponsored by the railway company . He drew the attention of several minor league teams , and in 1906 , Warhop signed with the Class @-@ D Freeport Pretzels of the Wisconsin – Illinois League in 1906 to start his professional career . His debut campaign included a no @-@ hitter on Independence Day against the La Crosse Pinks . From 1906 to 1908 , Warhop had an 82 – 20 win – lost record and 330 strikeouts , with a career high 30 wins in 1907 . After pitching to a 29 – 7 record for the Williamsport Millionaires in 1909 , people throughout both the National and American League started to take notice of his ability . As many as a dozen teams were interested in Warhop , and he signed a $ 1000 contract with the Detroit Tigers . However , they soon sold Warhop to the Highlanders without appearing in a single game with the Tigers .

 = = = 1908 – 1912 = = = 
 Warhop made his debut on September 9 , 1908 . He ended up with a 1 – 2 win – loss record with a 4 @.@ 46 earned run average ( ERA ) in five games that year . Warhop became a regular fixture in the starting rotation in 1909 . He pitched a three hitter against the Cleveland <unk> on August 10 , 1909 and finished the year with a 13 – 15 win – loss record , a 2 @.@ 40 ERA , and 21 complete games in 36 games pitched as the Highlanders finished fifth in the American League ( AL ) . However , Warhop led the AL in hit batsmen in 1909 ( 26 ) and 1910 ( 18 ) , which might have been caused by his unorthodox pitching style . In 1910 , Warhop pitched to a 14 – 14 win – loss record , a 3 @.@ 00 ERA and 11 errors ( the most among AL pitchers ) . He was respected throughout baseball , and Baseball Magazine once called him the " unluckiest pitcher in the American League " . 
 The 1911 season saw Warhop post a 12 – 13 record , a 4 @.@ 16 ERA and 15 hit batsmen ( the third highest in the league ) . His starts throughout the season were mixed ; some were poor or marred by bad luck . He was shelled on May 9 in a 10 – 0 loss against a Detroit Tigers lineup featuring Ty Cobb , Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty , giving up runs in each of the first four innings . However , he improved a few weeks later on May 20 , when he limited the St. Louis Browns to four hits . This began a quality stretch for Warhop , who won five consecutive games by July 17 — a result of an improvement in his control . Then , during an August 21 road game against the Tigers , he lost a 5 – 4 walk @-@ off game in the eleventh inning , in part due to his own unsuccessful strategy in fielding two bunts . On both occasions , he threw to second base but was too late , and the baserunners were able to advance safely and load the bases . The Highlanders lost when Earle Gardner booted a routine ground ball by Bill Donovan in an rushed attempt to throw out the go @-@ ahead runner at home plate . His desperation culminated in him unsuccessfully requesting the league at the end of the season to change his win – loss record to 14 – 11 , under the mistaken belief that his 12 – 13 record was incorrect . 
 Warhop 's penchant for tough luck was best exemplified in the 1912 season , when he finished with a 10 – 19 record — the second highest number of losses in the AL — despite compiling a 2 @.@ 86 ERA and 6 @.@ 7 Wins Above Replacement ( WAR ) . Both his ERA and WAR were tenth best in the AL , though he also finished second in hit batsmen ( 16 ) and fifth in errors as a pitcher ( 7 ) . In a July 5 road game against the Washington Senators , he entered the game in the second inning and lost 6 – 5 in a walk @-@ off , despite dueling Walter Johnson up to the 16th inning . Then , in a game on August 22 , he held the Chicago White Sox to just two hits and no runs in the first five innings . While pitching with a 3 – 0 lead , Warhop surrendered one run in the sixth inning , before getting shelled in the seventh , giving up four runs and the lead . After another four runs were given up in the ninth inning , the Highlanders lost the game 9 – 4 . Towards the end of the season , Warhop was again on the losing side of a bad luck game , when he lost a 3 – 0 pitchers ' duel against the St. Louis Browns , having held them scoreless for the first five innings . 
 = = = 1913 – 1915 = = = 
 A sore arm in 1913 caused Warhop to pitch ineffectively and have just seven games started . He recovered by 1914 ; however , Warhop was on the unfortunate end of a hard @-@ luck campaign . He had an 8 – 15 win – loss record with a 2 @.@ 37 ERA . However , the Yankees were one of the worst offensive and defensive teams in baseball , which caused Warhop to be on the losing end of five 1 – 0 games , a present @-@ day Major League Baseball record shared with five other pitchers . In one of those games , on July 25 , Warhop shutout the Chicago White Sox for twelve innings before losing 1 – 0 in the thirteenth , due to two errors — one of which was committed by himself on an errant throw to first base after a sacrifice bunt . His first win of the season finally came on June 25 against the Boston Red Sox . He led the American League in home runs allowed at the end of the season with eight , a very high number in the dead @-@ ball era . His pitching style included an underhand , submarine delivery which he abandoned by 1914 . 
 He gave up Babe Ruth 's first career home run on May 6 , 1915 , while Ruth was a member of the Boston Red Sox . Warhop threw a fastball in the third inning , and Ruth hit the ball to the upper right field stands . Warhop won the game 4 – 3 in extra innings . When interviewed about it many years later , Warhop shrugged it off , stating " that 's one way to be remembered " . A little over three weeks later , on June 2 , he gave up Ruth 's second career home run in a 7 – 1 Yankee defeat . In what would be his final season in Major League Baseball , Warhop had a 7 – 9 win – loss record and a 3 @.@ 96 ERA , while leading the American League in home runs allowed ( 7 ) for the second consecutive year . He was released alongside first baseman Charlie Mullen and catcher Ed Sweeney on August 14 and then sold to Jack Dunn of the Richmond Climbers in the International League , but Warhop didn 't play a game with them . According to one historian , however , Warhop was released because Yankee management thought he was a " jinx " to the club , as during Warhop 's tenure — with the exception of the 1910 season — the Highlanders / Yankees finished no higher than fifth in the division . 
 Warhop led the Yankees in games pitched four times ( 1908 , 1909 , 1912 , 1914 ) , saves three times ( 1909 , 1910 , 1912 ) , and complete games once ( 1909 ) . His 114 career hit batsmen is a Yankees team record and ranks 37th on the MLB all @-@ time hit batsmen list . 
 = = Later life = = 
 After leaving the Yankees , Warhop played in the minor leagues , including stints in the Pacific Coast League and the International League , until the late 1920s . He was player – manager for the Class @-@ B Norfolk Tars of the Virginia League in 1921 and won 20 games for the team . In 1927 , he pitched and won both games of a doubleheader , a rare achievement , while with Bridgeport of the Eastern League at age 42 . In 1928 , Warhop became the manager for the Sally League Spartanburg team . He played semi @-@ professional baseball until the age of 50 , when he retired and became a butler for a large house in Long Island . 
 He married Grace Nichols on November 23 , 1907 . They later divorced , and he married Frances <unk> in 1918 . Warhop died at age 76 in Freeport , Illinois , where his professional baseball career began . 
 = Oklahoma City bombing = 
 The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist bomb attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City , in the U.S. state of Oklahoma , on April 19 , 1995 . Carried out by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols , the bombing destroyed one @-@ third of the building , killed 168 people , and injured more than 680 others . The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16 @-@ block radius , shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings , and destroyed or burned 86 cars , causing an estimated $ 652 million worth of damage . Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local , state , federal , and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing , and substantial donations were received from across the country . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces , consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations . 
 Within 90 minutes of the explosion , McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession . Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack ; Nichols was arrested , and within days both were charged . Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices . McVeigh , a U.S. militia movement sympathizer who was a Gulf War veteran , had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building . McVeigh 's co @-@ conspirator , Nichols , had assisted in the bomb preparation . Motivated by his hatred of the U.S. federal government and angered by its handling of the 1993 Waco siege and the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 , McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas . 
 The official investigation , known as " OKBOMB " , saw FBI agents conduct 28 @,@ 000 interviews , amass 3 @.@ 5 short tons ( 3 @.@ 2 tonnes ) of evidence , and collect nearly one billion pieces of information . The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997 . McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11 , 2001 , and Nichols was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 . Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols ; Michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the United States government , and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony . 
 As a result of the bombing , the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States , as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks . On April 19 , 2000 , the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building , commemorating the victims of the bombing . Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the explosion occurred . It was the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil until the September 11 attacks and still remains the deadliest domestic terrorism incident in United States history .

 = = = Motivation = = = 
 The chief conspirators , Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols , met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic training for the U.S. Army . Michael Fortier , McVeigh 's accomplice , was his Army roommate . The three shared interests in survivalism . They expressed anger at the federal government 's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge as well as the Waco siege — a 1993 51 @-@ day standoff between the FBI and Branch Davidian members which began with a botched ATF attempt to execute a search warrant leading to a fire fight ( it is unknown whether ATF agents or Branch <unk> fired the first shot ) and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75 others . In March 1993 , McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff , and then again after its conclusion . McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids . 
 = = = Target selection = = = 
 McVeigh later said that he had contemplated the assassinations of Attorney General Janet Reno , Lon Horiuchi , and others in preference to attacking a building , and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead . He initially intended only to destroy a federal building , but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing . McVeigh 's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies : the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , or the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies , such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service , as a bonus . 
 McVeigh , a resident of Kingman , Arizona , considered targets in Missouri , Arizona , Texas , and Arkansas . McVeigh stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non @-@ governmental casualties , so he ruled out a 40 @-@ story government building in Little Rock , Arkansas , because of the presence of a florist 's shop on the ground floor . In December 1994 , McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh 's target : the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building . The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant , The Sword , and the Arm of the Lord , including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell . The group had plotted to park " a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer . " After Snell 's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied , he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing . 
 The nine @-@ story building , built in 1977 , was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies including the DEA , ATF , Social Security Administration , and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps . The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front — which was expected to shatter under the impact of the blast — and its adjacent large , open parking lot across the street , which might absorb and dissipate some of the force , and protect the occupants of nearby non @-@ federal buildings . In addition , McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes . The attack was planned to take place on April 19 , 1995 , to coincide with the anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord . 
 = = = Gathering materials = = = 
 McVeigh and Nichols purchased or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bomb , which they stored in rented sheds . In August 1994 , McVeigh obtained nine <unk> from gun collector Roger E. Moore , and ignited the devices with Nichols outside Nichols ' home in Herington , Kansas . On September 30 , 1994 , Nichols bought forty 50 @-@ pound ( 23 kg ) bags of ammonium nitrate from Mid @-@ Kansas Coop in McPherson , Kansas ; this would be enough to fertilize 4 @.@ 25 acres of farmland at a rate of 160 pounds of nitrogen per acre , an amount commonly used for corn . Nichols bought an additional 50 @-@ pound ( 23 kg ) bag on October 18 , 1994 . McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist with the bombing project , but he refused . 
 They robbed gun collector Roger E. Moore in his home of $ 60 @,@ 000 worth of guns , gold , silver , and jewels , transporting the property in the victim 's own van . McVeigh wrote a letter to Moore in which he claimed that the robbery had been committed by government agents . Items that were stolen from Moore were later found in Nichols ' home and in a storage shed that he had rented . 
 In October 1994 , McVeigh showed Michael Fortier and his wife , Lori , a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build . McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than 5 @,@ 000 pounds ( 2 @,@ 300 kg ) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer , mixed with about 1 @,@ 200 pounds ( 540 kg ) of liquid nitromethane and 350 pounds ( 160 kg ) of Tovex . Including the weight of the sixteen 55 @-@ U.S.-gallon drums in which the explosive mixture was to be packed , the bomb would have a combined weight of about 7 @,@ 000 pounds ( 3 @,@ 200 kg ) . McVeigh had originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel , but it proved to be too expensive . In October 1994 , posing as a motorcycle racer , McVeigh obtained three 55 @-@ U.S.-gallon ( 46 imp gal ; 210 L ) drums of nitromethane on the pretense that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing . 
 McVeigh rented a storage space , in which he stockpiled seven crates of 18 @-@ inch @-@ long ( 46 cm ) Tovex sausages , 80 spools of shock tube , and 500 electric blasting caps , which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion , Kansas . He decided not to steal any of the 40 @,@ 000 pounds ( 18 @,@ 000 kg ) of ANFO ( ammonium nitrate / fuel oil ) he found at the scene , as he did not believe it to be powerful enough ( although he did obtain seventeen bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb ) . McVeigh made a prototype bomb using a plastic Gatorade jug containing ammonium nitrate <unk> , liquid nitromethane , a piece of Tovex sausage , and a blasting cap . The prototype was detonated in the desert to avoid detection . 
 Later , speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations , he said , " You learn how to handle killing in the military . I face the consequences , but you learn to accept it . " He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , rather than the attack on Pearl Harbor , reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost . Plus , 1995 also marked the 50th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings . 
 On April 14 , 1995 , McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City , Kansas . The following day he rented a 1993 Ford F @-@ 700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling , an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics , and because it reminded him of the Klingon warriors of Star Trek . On April 16 , 1995 , he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Terry Nichols where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building . The nearby Regency Towers Apartments ' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols ' pickup truck as it drove to the federal building . After removing the license plate from the car , he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number ( VIN ) plate that read , " Not abandoned . Please do not tow . Will move by April 23 . ( Needs battery & cable ) . " Both men then returned to Kansas . 
 = = = Building the bomb = = = 
 On April 17 – 18 , 1995 , McVeigh and Nichols removed their supplies from their storage unit in Herington , Kansas , where Nichols lived . They loaded their bomb supplies into a Ryder rental truck . The two then drove to Geary Lake State Park , where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the 13 barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale . Each filled barrel weighed nearly 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) . McVeigh added more explosives to the driver 's side of the cargo bay , which he could ignite ( killing himself in the process ) at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed . During McVeigh 's trial , Lori Fortier ( the wife of Michael Fortier ) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge . This was achieved by tamping the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building . Specifically , McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards J ; he later said that for pure destructive power , he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building ; however , such an unevenly distributed 7 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 3 @,@ 200 kg ) load might have broken an axle , flipped the truck over , or at least caused it to lean to one side , which could have drawn attention . All or most of the barrels of <unk> contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the <unk> of the explosion . 
 McVeigh then added a dual @-@ fuse ignition system accessible from the truck 's front cab . He drilled two holes in the cab of the truck under the seat , while two holes were also drilled in the body of the truck . One green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab . These time @-@ delayed fuses led from the cab of the truck , through plastic fish @-@ tank tubing conduit , to two sets of non @-@ electric blasting caps which would ignite around 350 pounds ( 160 kg ) of high @-@ grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry . The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck 's livery , and duct @-@ taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside . The fuses were set up to initiate , through shock tubes , the 350 pounds ( 160 kg ) of Tovex <unk> Gel " sausages " , which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels . Of the 13 filled barrels , nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane , and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about 4 U.S. gallons ( 3 @.@ 3 imp gal ; 15 L ) of diesel fuel . Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast . After finishing the truck bomb , the two men separated ; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City . 
 = = Bombing = = 
 McVeigh 's original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11 : 00 am , but at dawn on April 19 , 1995 , he decided instead to destroy the building at 9 : 00 am . As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck , McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries — a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9 : 15 one morning using a truck bomb . McVeigh wore a printed T @-@ shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia , Sic semper <unk> ( " Thus always to tyrants " , according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar , also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln ) and " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants " ( from Thomas Jefferson ) . He also carried an envelope of anti @-@ government materials that included a bumper sticker with the Thomas Jefferson slogan , " When the government fears the people , there is liberty . When the people fear the government , there is tyranny . " Underneath , McVeigh had written , " Maybe now , there will be liberty ! " with a hand @-@ copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty . 
 McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8 : 50 am . At 8 : 57 am , the Regency Towers Apartments ' lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols ' pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building . At the same moment , McVeigh lit the five @-@ minute fuse . Three minutes later , still a block away , he lit the two @-@ minute fuse . He parked the Ryder truck in a drop @-@ off zone situated under the building 's day @-@ care center , exited and locked the truck , and as he headed to his getaway vehicle , dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away . 
 At 9 : 02 am ( 14 : 02 UTC ) , the Ryder truck , containing in excess of 4 @,@ 800 pounds ( 2 @,@ 200 kg ) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer , nitromethane , and diesel fuel mixture , detonated in front of the north side of the nine @-@ story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building . Hundreds of people were killed or injured . One third of the building was destroyed by the explosion , which created a 30 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) , 8 @-@ foot @-@ deep ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) crater on NW 5th Street next to the building . The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 16 @-@ block radius , and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings . The broken glass alone accounted for 5 % of the death total and 69 % of the injuries outside the Murrah Federal Building . The blast destroyed or burned 86 cars around the site . The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homeless and shut down a number of offices in downtown Oklahoma City . The explosion was estimated to have caused at least $ 652 million worth of damage . 
 The effects of the blast were equivalent to over 5 @,@ 000 pounds ( 2 @,@ 300 kg ) of TNT , and could be heard and felt up to 55 miles ( 89 km ) away . <unk> at Science Museum Oklahoma in Oklahoma City , 4 @.@ 3 miles ( 6 @.@ 9 km ) away , and in Norman , Oklahoma , 16 @.@ 1 miles ( 25 @.@ 9 km ) away , recorded the blast as measuring approximately 3 @.@ 0 on the Richter scale . 
 = = Arrests = = 
 Initially , the FBI had three hypotheses regarding who might have been responsible for the bombing . The first was international terrorists , possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier . The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office . The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti @-@ government right @-@ wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government . 
 McVeigh was arrested within 90 minutes of the explosion , as he was traveling north on Interstate 35 near Perry in Noble County , Oklahoma . Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger stopped McVeigh for driving his yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis without a license plate , and arrested him for having a concealed weapon . For his home address , McVeigh falsely claimed he resided at Terry Nichols ' brother James ' house in Michigan . After booking McVeigh into jail , Hanger searched his police car and found a business card McVeigh had hidden while he was handcuffed . Written on the back of the card , which was from a Wisconsin military surplus store , were the words " TNT at $ 5 a stick . Need more . " The card was later used as evidence during McVeigh 's trial . 
 While investigating the VIN from an axle of the truck used in the explosion and the remnants of the license plate , federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City , Kansas . Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot , owner of the agency , the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing . McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel , who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot ; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel , using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station . Before signing his real name at the motel , McVeigh had used false names for his transactions . However , McGown noted , " People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name , they almost always go to write , and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use . That 's what [ McVeigh ] did , and when he looked up I started talking to him , and it threw him . " 
 After an April 21 , 1995 , court hearing on the gun charges , but before McVeigh 's release , federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing . Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing , McVeigh demanded an attorney . Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside , a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail . While McVeigh 's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied , authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City . 
 Federal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh 's father , Bill , after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices . FBI investigators used the resulting information gained , along with the fake address McVeigh had been using , to begin their search for the Nichols brothers , Terry and James . On April 21 , 1995 , Terry learned that he was being hunted , and turned himself in . Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home : ammonium nitrate and blasting caps , the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry , books on bomb @-@ making , a copy of Hunter ( a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce , the founder and chairman of the white nationalist National Alliance ) and a hand @-@ drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City , on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh 's getaway car was hidden were marked . After a nine @-@ hour interrogation , Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial . On April 25 , 1995 , James Nichols was also arrested , but he was released after 32 days due to lack of evidence . McVeigh 's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh , but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him . 
 Ibrahim Ahmad , a Jordanian @-@ American traveling from his home in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19 , 1995 , was also arrested in what was described as an " initial dragnet " . There was concern that Middle Eastern terrorists could have been behind the attack . Further investigation cleared Ahmad of any involvement in the bombing . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 An estimated 646 people were inside the building when the bomb exploded . By the end of the day , 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead , and over 100 injured . The toll eventually reached 168 confirmed dead , not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg . Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building , rather than the bomb blast itself . Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , one person in the Athenian Building , one woman in a parking lot across the street , a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building , and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris . 
 The victims , including three pregnant women , ranged in age from 3 months to 73 years . Of the dead , 99 worked for the federal government . Eight of the victims were federal law enforcement agents . Of those law enforcement agents four were members of the U.S. Secret Service , two were members of the U.S. Customs Service , one was a member of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , and one was a member of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development . Six of the victims were U.S. military personnel ; two members of the U.S. Army , two members of the U.S. Air Force , and two members of the U.S. Marine Corps . The rest of the victims were civilians , including 19 children , of whom 15 were in the America 's Kids Day Care Center . The bodies of the 168 victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene . A team of 24 identified the victims using full @-@ body X @-@ rays , dental examinations , fingerprinting , blood tests , and DNA testing . More than 680 people were injured . The majority of the injuries were abrasions , severe burns , and bone fractures . 
 McVeigh 's later response to the range of casualties was : " I didn 't define the rules of engagement in this conflict . The rules , if not written down , are defined by the aggressor . It was brutal , no holds barred . Women and kids were killed at Waco and Ruby Ridge . You put back in [ the government 's ] faces exactly what they 're giving out . "

 At 9 : 03 : 25 am , the first of over 1 @,@ 800 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 calls related to the bombing was received by Emergency Medical Services Authority ( EMSA ) . By that time , EMSA ambulances , police , and firefighters were already headed to the scene , having heard the blast . Nearby civilians , who had also witnessed or heard the blast , arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers . Within 23 minutes of the bombing , the State Emergency Operations Center ( SEOC ) was set up , consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety , human services , military , health , and education . Assisting the SEOC were agencies such as the National Weather Service , the Air Force , the Civil Air Patrol , and the American Red Cross . Immediate assistance also came from 465 members of the Oklahoma National Guard , who arrived within the hour to provide security , and from members of the Department of Civil Emergency Management . 
 The EMS command post was set up almost immediately following the attack and oversaw triage , treatment , transportation , and decontamination . A simple plan / objective was established : treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible , supplies and personnel to handle a large amount of patients was needed immediately , the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner 's office , and measures for a long @-@ term medical operation needed to be established . The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there . Treatment and transport of the injured was done at a furious pace . Two @-@ hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing . 
 Within the first hour , 50 people were rescued from the Murrah Federal Building . Victims were sent to every hospital in the area . At the end of the first day of rescue efforts , 153 had been treated at St. Anthony Hospital , eight blocks from the blast , over 70 at Presbyterian , 41 at University , and 18 at Children 's . Temporary silences were observed so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats could be used to locate survivors . In some cases , limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics ( avoided because of its potential to cause a deadly coma ) in order to free those trapped under rubble . Periodically the scene had to be evacuated after police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building . Local television media reported two other explosive devices were found in the building that were not denoted , and both were larger than the bomb that exploded . 
 At 10 : 28 am , rescuers found what they believed to be a second bomb . Some rescue workers refused to leave until police ordered the mandatory evacuation of a four @-@ block area around the site . The device was determined to be a three @-@ foot ( .9 @-@ m ) long TOW missile used in the training of federal agents and bomb @-@ sniffing dogs ; although actually inert , it had been marked " live " in order to mislead arms traffickers in a planned law enforcement sting . On examination the missile was determined to be inert , and relief efforts resumed 45 minutes later . The last survivor , a fifteen @-@ year @-@ old girl found under the base of the collapsed building , was rescued at around 7 : 00 pm . 
 In the days following the blast , over 12 @,@ 000 people participated in relief and rescue operations . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces , which consisted of a team of 665 rescue workers . One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after she was hit on the head by debris , and 26 other rescuers were hospitalized because of various injuries . Twenty @-@ four K @-@ 9 units and out @-@ of @-@ state dogs were brought in to search for survivors and bodies in the building debris . In an effort to recover additional bodies , 100 to 350 short tons ( 91 to 318 t ) of rubble were removed from the site each day from April 24 to 29 , 1995 . 
 Rescue and recovery efforts were concluded at 12 : 05 am on May 5 , by which time the bodies of all but three of the victims had been recovered . For safety reasons , the building was initially slated to be demolished shortly afterward . McVeigh 's attorney , Stephen Jones , filed a motion to delay the demolition until the defense team could examine the site in preparation for the trial . At 7 : 02 am on May 23 , more than a month after the bombing , the Murrah Federal building was demolished . The EMS Command Center remained active until the demolition of the Federal Murrah Building and was staffed 24 hours a day . The final three bodies , those of two credit union employees and a customer , were recovered . For several days after the building 's demolition , trucks hauled 800 short tons ( 730 t ) of debris a day away from the site . Some of the debris was used as evidence in the conspirators ' trials , incorporated into memorials , donated to local schools , or sold to raise funds for relief efforts . 
 = = = Humanitarian aid = = = 
 The national humanitarian response was immediate , and in some cases even overwhelming . Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows , bottled water , helmet lights , knee pads , rain gear , and even football helmets were donated . The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop @-@ off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods . The Oklahoma Restaurant Association , which was holding a trade show in the city , assisted rescue workers by providing 15 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 meals over a ten @-@ day period . 
 The Salvation Army served over 100 @,@ 000 meals and provided over 100 @,@ 000 ponchos , gloves , hard hats , and knee pads to rescue workers . Local residents and those from further afield responded to the requests for blood donations . Of the over 9 @,@ 000 units of blood donated 131 units were used , the rest were stored in blood banks .

 At 9 : 45 am , Governor Frank Keating declared a state of emergency and ordered all non @-@ essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties for their safety . President Bill Clinton learned about the bombing at around 9 : 30 am while he was meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Çiller at the White House . Before addressing the nation , President Clinton considered grounding all planes in the Oklahoma City area to prevent the bombers from escaping by air , but decided against it . At 4 : 00 pm , President Clinton declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation : 
 The bombing in Oklahoma City was an attack on innocent children and defenseless citizens . It was an act of cowardice and it was evil . The United States will not tolerate it , and I will not allow the people of this country to be intimidated by evil cowards . 
 He ordered that flags for all federal buildings be flown at half @-@ staff for 30 days in remembrance of the victims . Four days later , on April 23 , 1995 , Clinton spoke from Oklahoma City . 
 No major federal financial assistance was made available to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing , but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the bombing attracted over $ 300 @,@ 000 in federal grants . Over $ 40 million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims . Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet , and the rest was held in trust for longer @-@ term medical and psychological needs . By 2005 , $ 18 million of the donations remained , some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219 children who lost one or both parents in the bombing . A committee chaired by Daniel <unk> of Goodwill Industries provided financial assistance to the survivors .

 International reactions to the bombing varied . President Clinton received many messages of sympathy , including those from Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom , Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization , and Narasimha Rao of India . Iran condemned the bombing as an attack on innocent people , but also blamed U.S. policy for inciting it . Other condolences came from Russia , Canada , Australia , the United Nations , and the European Union , among other nations and organizations . 
 Several countries offered to assist in the rescue efforts and investigation . France offered a special rescue unit , and Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti @-@ terrorist expertise to help in the investigation . President Clinton declined Israel 's offer , believing that to accept it would increase anti @-@ Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim @-@ Americans . 
 = = = Children affected = = = 
 In the wake of the bombing , the national media seized upon the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children , many in the day @-@ care center . At the time of the bombing , there were 100 day @-@ care centers in the United States in 7 @,@ 900 federal buildings . McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day @-@ care center when choosing the building as a target , and if he had known " ... it might have given me pause to switch targets . That 's a large amount of collateral damage . " The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day @-@ care center before the bombing . In April 2010 , Joseph Hartzler , the prosecutor at McVeigh 's trial , questioned how he could have decided to pass over a prior target building because of an included florist shop but at the Murrah building not " ... notice that there 's a child day @-@ care center there , that there was a credit union there and a Social Security office ? " 
 Schools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed . A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant <unk> Almon , who later died in a nearby hospital , was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack . The photo , taken by bank employee Charles H. Porter IV , won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography . The images and media reports of children dying terrorized many children who , as demonstrated by later research , showed symptoms of post @-@ traumatic stress disorder . Children became a primary focus of concern in the mental health response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community , young and old alike . These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40 @,@ 000 students . One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted 7 weeks after the bombing . The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing . This study showed that these students , although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter , had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life , contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims , who suffered from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder . 
 Children were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing . Many children lost one or more parents in the blast , with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent . Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents , foster parents , and other family members . Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally . One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death of one of the at least ten orphaned children . 
 President Clinton stated that after seeing images of babies being pulled from the wreckage , he was " beyond angry " and wanted to " put [ his ] fist through the television " . Clinton and his wife Hillary requested that aides talk to child care specialists about how to communicate with the children regarding the bombing . President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing , saying : " I don 't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing ... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we are going to get through this " . On April 22 , 1995 , the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40 federal agency employees and their children , and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast , addressed their concerns . 
 = = = Media coverage = = = 
 Hundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story . The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident . Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists , such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing . Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent . 
 Before any evidence could be introduced to say otherwise , the media presented stories to the public that accused individuals within Middle Eastern groups . At this time in America , stereotypes that focused on the Arab race had affected many American Arabs within the United States . These stereotypes may have impacted how individuals acted after the bombing , and can explain why the media assumed that Middle Eastern groups were responsible . In the case of the Oklahoma City Bombing , <unk> <unk> , chairman of the American @-@ Arab Anti @-@ Discrimination Committee , blamed the media for the attacks on Muslims and Arabs that took place just days after the bombing . 
 As the rescue effort wound down , the media interest shifted to the investigation , arrests , and trials of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols , and on the search for an additional suspect named " John Doe Number Two . " Several witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect , who did not resemble Nichols , with McVeigh . 
 Those who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war , as in the case of Gore Vidal 's essay The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh . 
 = = Trials and sentencing of the conspirators = = 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) led the official investigation , known as OKBOMB , with Weldon L. Kennedy acting as Special Agent in charge . Kennedy oversaw 900 federal , state , and local law enforcement personnel including 300 FBI agents , 200 officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department , 125 members of the Oklahoma National Guard , and 55 officers from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety . The crime task force was deemed the largest since the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy . OKBOMB was the largest criminal case in America 's history , with FBI agents conducting 28 @,@ 000 interviews , amassing 3 @.@ 5 short tons ( 3 @.@ 2 t ) of evidence , and collecting nearly one billion pieces of information . Federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ordered that the venue for the trial be moved from Oklahoma City to Denver , Colorado , citing that the defendants would be unable to receive a fair trial in Oklahoma . The investigation led to the separate trials and convictions of McVeigh , Nichols , and Fortier . 
 = = = Timothy McVeigh = = = 
 Opening arguments in McVeigh 's trial began on April 24 , 1997 . The United States was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler . In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh 's motivations , and the evidence against him . McVeigh , he said , had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army , after reading The Turner Diaries . His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia 's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill , and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents . The prosecution called 137 witnesses , including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori , and McVeigh 's sister , Jennifer McVeigh , all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh 's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it . Both <unk> testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building . Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date , and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck . 
 McVeigh was represented by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones . According to law professor Douglas O. Linder , McVeigh wanted Jones to present a " necessity defense " — which would argue that he was in " imminent danger " from the government ( that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government , such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents ) . McVeigh argued that " imminent " does not mean " immediate " : " If a comet is hurtling toward the earth , and it 's out past the orbit of Pluto , it 's not an immediate threat to Earth , but it is an imminent threat . " Despite McVeigh 's wishes , Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution 's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt . Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy , and sought to present him as " the designated patsy " , but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense . After a hearing , Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible . In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone , Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime , and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks . Jones presented 25 witnesses over a one @-@ week period , including Dr. Frederic Whitehurst . Although Whitehurst described the FBI 's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence , he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated . 
 A key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing . Although it was initially believed to be from a male , it was later determined to be that of <unk> Levy , a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing . Levy 's coffin had to be re @-@ opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains . The unmatched leg had been embalmed , which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg 's owner . Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber , possibly John Doe # 2 . The prosecution disputed the claim , saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg . 
 Numerous damaging leaks , which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys , emerged . They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press , which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial . A gag order was imposed during the trial , prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence , proceedings , or opinions regarding the trial proceedings . The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517 @-@ page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams , one of the agency 's explosives experts , for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions . The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence . 
 The jury deliberated for 23 hours . On June 2 , 1997 , McVeigh was found guilty on 11 counts of murder and conspiracy . Although the defense argued for a reduced sentence of life imprisonment , McVeigh was sentenced to death . In May 2001 , the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3 @,@ 000 documents to McVeigh 's defense counsel . The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents . On June 6 , federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed . After President George W. Bush approved the execution ( McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners ) , he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex , Terre Haute in Terre Haute , Indiana , on June 11 . The execution was transmitted on closed @-@ circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death . McVeigh 's execution was the first federal execution in 38 years . 
 = = = Terry Nichols = = = 
 Nichols stood trial twice . He was first tried by the federal government in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build a weapon of mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers . After he was sentenced on June 4 , 1998 to life without parole , the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death @-@ penalty conviction on 161 counts of first @-@ degree murder ( 160 non @-@ federal agent victims and one fetus ) . On May 26 , 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges , but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death . Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole . In March 2005 , FBI investigators , acting on a tip , searched a buried crawl space in Nichols ' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested . In 2009 Nichols was being held in the ADX Florence Federal Prison . 
 = = = Michael Fortier = = = 
 Michael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing . In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building , Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver 's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck . Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife . He was sentenced on May 27 , 1998 to twelve years in prison and fined $ 75 @,@ 000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack . On January 20 , 2006 , after serving ten and a half years of his sentence , including time already served , Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity . 
 = = = Others = = = 
 No " John Doe # 2 " was ever identified , nothing conclusive was ever reported regarding the owner of the unmatched leg , and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing . Although the defense teams in both McVeigh 's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved , Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible , relevant , or legally admissible evidence , of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing . When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing , he replied : " Because the truth is , I blew up the Murrah Building , and isn 't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell ? " On the morning of McVeigh 's execution a letter was released in which he had written " For those die @-@ hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this , I turn the tables and say : Show me where I needed anyone else . Financing ? Logistics ? Specialized tech skills ? <unk> ? Strategy ? ... Show me where I needed a dark , mysterious ' Mr. X ' ! " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 It has been estimated that about 387 @,@ 000 people in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area ( a third of the population ) knew someone who was directly affected by the bombing . 
 Within 48 hours of the attack , and with the assistance of the General Services Administration ( GSA ) , the targeted federal offices were able to resume operations in other parts of the city . According to Mark Potok , director of Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center , his organization tracked another 60 domestic smaller @-@ scale terrorism plots from 1995 to 2005 . Several of the plots were uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage , deaths , or other destruction . Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 858 domestic militias and other antigovernment groups but the number had dropped to 152 by 2004 . Shortly after the bombing , the FBI hired an additional 500 agents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks . 
 = = = Legislation = = = 
 In the wake of the bombing the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation , notably the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 . In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out @-@ of @-@ state , the Victim <unk> Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20 , 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing ( and the victims of any other future acts of violence ) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings . In response to passing the legislation , Clinton stated that " when someone is a victim , he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process , not on the outside looking in . " 
 In the years since the bombing , scientists , security experts , and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer , and for sellers to maintain records of its sale . Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer , and as of 2009 , only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers . In June 1995 , Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical <unk> to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer . In 2008 , Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen @-@ based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil . The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer ( <unk> @-@ N 26 ) for commercial use . It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive . 
 = = = = Oklahoma School Curriculum = = = = 
 In the decade following the bombing , there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of mandatory Oklahoma history classes . Oklahoma History is a one @-@ semester course required by state law for graduation from high school ; however , the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks . The state 's PASS standards ( Priority Academic Student Skills ) did not require that a student learn about the bombing , and focused more on other subjects such as corruption and the Dust Bowl . On April 6 , 2010 , " House Bill 2750 " was signed by Governor Brad Henry , requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma , U.S. and world history classes . 
 On the signing , Governor Henry said “ Although the events of April 19 , 1995 may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day , we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day , ” ... “ We owe it to the victims , the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19 , 1995 and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation . ” 
 = = = Building security and construction = = = 
 In the weeks following the bombing the federal government ordered that all federal buildings in all major cities be surrounded with prefabricated Jersey barriers to prevent similar attacks . As part of a longer @-@ term plan for United States federal building security most of those temporary barriers have since been replaced with permanent and more aesthetically considerate security barriers , which are driven deep into the ground for sturdiness . Furthermore , all new federal buildings must now be constructed with truck @-@ resistant barriers and with deep setbacks from surrounding streets to minimize their vulnerability to truck bombs . FBI buildings , for instance , must be set back 100 feet ( 30 m ) from traffic . The total cost of improving security in federal buildings across the country in response to the bombing reached over $ 600 million . 
 The Murrah Federal Building had been considered so safe that it only employed one security guard . In June 1995 , the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities , also known as The Marshals Report , the findings of which resulted in a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1 @,@ 300 federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government . Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 ( minimum security needs ) to Level 5 ( maximum ) . The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building . Among the 52 security improvements were physical barriers , closed @-@ circuit television monitoring , site planning and access , hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance , glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities , and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse . 
 The attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces , improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City 's new federal building . The National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California 's earthquake design codes .

 McVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy . In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996 , the government 's $ 3 @.@ 1 million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing , and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound . McVeigh stated , " Once you bloody the bully 's nose , and he knows he 's going to be punched again , he 's not coming back around . " 
 = = = Conspiracy theories = = = 
 A variety of conspiracy theories have been proposed about the events surrounding the bombing . Some theories allege that individuals in the government , including President Bill Clinton , knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge . Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition ; following the attack , search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities . According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack , a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated . Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing . Additional theories claim the bombing was done by the government to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new <unk> legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat . Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents , particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo @-@ Nazis , were involved in the bombing . Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories . 
 = = Evacuation issues = = 
 Once the explosion took place at the Alfred P. Murrah building , chaotic response filled the surrounding streets . Those who were able to flee the Murrah building did so , while others , stuck in the rubble , awaited the assistance of rescue workers and volunteers . As reported on CNN , other federal buildings in the downtown area were not fully evacuated , but those who were able to leave the city were encouraged to do so . This traffic , along with the people leaving places around the Murrah Building clogged streets , delaying the arrival of rescue crews and relief agencies . Several agencies , including the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing , and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort . Because of the crowded streets , and the number of response agencies sent to the location , communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled . Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting , thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process . The City of Oklahoma City , in their After Action Report , declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations . Following the events of September 11 , 2001 , with consideration of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing , the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians . These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly . By helping civilians out , and rescue workers in , the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased .

 = = = Oklahoma City National Memorial = = = 
 For two years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys , crucifixes , letters , and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building . Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City , but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996 , when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force , composed of 350 members , was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing . On July 1 , 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15 @-@ member panel from 624 submissions . The memorial was designed at a cost of $ 29 million , which was raised by public and private funds . The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg . It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19 , 2000 , exactly five years after the bombing . Within the first year , it had 700 @,@ 000 visitors . 
 The memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates , one inscribed with the time 9 : 01 , the other with 9 : 03 , the pool representing the moment of the blast . On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs — one for each person lost , arranged according to what floor of the building they were on . The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims ' families . The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost . On the opposite side is the " survivor tree " , part of the building 's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it . The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact , allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction . Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast , which had attracted over 800 @,@ 000 personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation , is now on the western edge of the memorial . North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building , which now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum , an affiliate of the National Park Service . The building also contains the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism , a law enforcement training center .

 On a corner adjacent to the memorial is a sculpture titled " And Jesus Wept " , erected by St. Joseph 's Old Cathedral . St. Joseph 's , one of the first brick and mortar churches in the city , was almost completely destroyed by the blast . The statue is not part of the memorial itself . 
 = = = Remembrance observance = = = 
 An observance is held each year to remember the victims of the bombing . An annual marathon draws thousands , and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing . For the tenth anniversary of the bombing , the city held 24 days of activities , including a week @-@ long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24 , 2005 . As in previous years , the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9 : 02 am , marking the moment the bomb went off , with the traditional 168 seconds of silence — one second for each person who was killed as a result of the blast . The service also included the traditional reading of the names , read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City . 
 Vice President Dick Cheney , former President Clinton , Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry , Frank Keating , Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing , and other political dignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphasized that " goodness overcame evil " . The relatives of the victims and the survivors of the blast also made note of it during the service at First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City . 
 President George W. Bush made note of the anniversary in a written statement , part of which echoed his remarks on the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001 : " For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on . " Bush was invited but did not attend the service because he was en route to Springfield , Illinois , to dedicate the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum . Cheney attended the service in his place .

 " Tuscan Leather " is a song recorded by Canadian recording artist Drake for his third studio album , Nothing Was the Same ( 2013 ) . It was written by Drake along with Anthony Palma and Noah Shebib , who produced the song under his production name " 40 " . The song heavily samples " I Have Nothing " performed by Whitney Houston and written by David Foster and Linda Thompson @-@ Jenner , who received writing credits on " Tuscan Leather " . Noted for its unique song structure devoid of any choruses , it is a hip hop song which utilizes influences of R & B and ambient throughout its composition . 
 " Tuscan Leather " received critical acclaim from music critics , who highlighted the song 's production and praised Drake 's growing confidence . The song was a source of controversy due to the song 's lyrics describing Drake 's deteriorating relationship with label mate Nicki Minaj . Despite not being released as a single , " Tuscan Leather " managed to chart due to the release of the album , with its highest peak being at number 23 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap Songs .

 " Tuscan Leather " was written by Drake , Anthony <unk> , and Noah Shebib , and was produced by Drake 's longtime collaborator Noah " 40 " Shebib . It borrows its name from the Tom Ford cologne of the same name , which generally ranges from $ 220- $ 535 . The song utilizes a vocal sample from " I Have Nothing " , written by David Foster and Linda Thompson @-@ Jenner , who receive writing credits , and performed by Whitney Houston . It also contains interpolations of " Serious " , written by Warren McGlone and Lawrence Parker , and samples " When Seasons Change " ( live ) by Curtis Mayfield . 
 It was recorded at Noble Street Studios in Toronto and Metalworks Studios in Missisauga , Ontario , along with Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta , Georgia and Marvin 's Room in Hollywood , California . " Tuscan Leather " was recorded by Shebib and Noel Cadastre , while the pair received assistance from Luke <unk> , Jeff Crake , Miguel Scott , and John <unk> . Lindsey Warner assisted Noel " Gadget " Campbell Toronto 's Studio 306 in mixing the song . Background vocals for the song were provided by <unk> , while Shebib handled all the instrumentation .

 Musically , " Tuscan Leather " is an atmospheric and free @-@ form hip hop song , which contains elements of R & B and ambient , and features " woozy " synth washes , big drum sounds , and an expansive , engrossing beat .

Will Lavin of Gigwise said the song sounded " like a <unk> @-@ produced track circa 2001 , the three key beat changes keeps listeners plugged in to the transparent mood Drake finds himself in . " " Tuscan Leather " has a unique song structure , with three distinct sections and no choruses . The first section features Drake intensely rapping while Houston 's voice , described as " ghostly and beautiful " , floats as if on helium through the chaotic production , noted to be " nostalgic , new , exuberant and menacing " all at once . After a brief pause , the section showcases a shift in both the beat and the lyrics , becoming more sinuous and personal , while a gentle keyboard riff rises underneath the music . During the third verse , the music transforms into a " soft , ambient landscape " which includes crowd noise , before the song finishes with the voice of Curtis Mayfield addressing fans at the end of a 1987 concert in Montreux : 
 As hell below , I 'll see you when you get there 
 Are you enjoying yourself ? 
 If we may we 'd just like to close off with something a bit inspirational 
 Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all

 And of course dying in so many years 
 It don 't mean that we can 't have a good life

During the song he discusses his ever @-@ expanding ambitions in lines such as " On a mission <unk> shift the culture " , while also dismissing those who try to challenge his supremacy : " Just give it time , we ’ ll see who ’ s still around a decade from now " . During the song Drake makes multiple pop culture references including Dwight Howard , University of Nevada , Las Vegas basketball , comparisons to Guy Pearce in Memento , and details of dates with Tatyana Ali . The songs lyrics also allude to a strained relationship with his label <unk> , while some critics noted a subliminal diss towards J. Cole .

 " Tuscan Leather " generated controversy with label mate Nicki Minaj for the line : " Not even talkin ' to Nicki , communication is <unk> ' / I dropped the ball on some personal shit , I need to embrace it / I 'm honest , I make mistakes , I 'd be the second to admit it / Think that 's why I need her in my life , to check me when I 'm trippin ' , " Speaking of the line , Drake said in an interview with MTV News : " That line in ' Tuscan Leather ' isn 't exactly where I am in my life right now , but like a year ago ... eight months , seven months ago , it was how I felt , I 'd done something wrong , and I wasn 't speaking to her . " 
 Throughout their careers Drake and Minaj maintained a close personal and business relationship , and were frequent collaborators . However , while recording Nothing Was the Same , Drake did not work with Minaj or anyone from Cash Money Records , leading her to say : " I 'm Young Money ' til the death of me , Drake can do what Drake do , but Nicki Minaj is a whole different person . I think your team is your team . Who gives a fuck about trying to be different ? I 'm always going to want my team to be a part of my project , no matter what , in some way . " 
 Speaking of their strained relationship during an interview with Hot 97 @.@ 5 , Minaj said : " It gets a little hard to have a real connection when people are on different sides of the world , working on different things . You just never know who people got in their ear or what they 're feeling or maybe they felt wronged in some way . I don 't know . I just know that Drake is my baby , and Wayne is my everything . " However , Drake said their relationship has improved , and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue , saying : " I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up , I had already solved that issue . I wrote that a while ago , and I kinda felt guilty changing it . It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that 's how it should be . The album should start one place and end in another ... I haven 't talked to her since it 's been out . I 'm not sure . I haven 't spoke to her . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Upon release , " Tuscan Leather " received critical acclaim from music critics , recognizing it as one of the most powerful intros to a hip @-@ hop album in years . In her review of the album , Erika Ramirez of Billboard said of the song : " Drake is aware of his greatness , and makes sure listeners are just as aware from the jump . " Andrew Unterberger of Popdust commended the song for being a strong opener , similar to his other album opener 's ; " Fireworks " and " Over My Dead Body " . Unterberger praised the use of the Whitney Houston sample , and finished his review as saying : " How much time is Drake spending on the intro ? As much time as he goddamn pleases , and if he wants to go an hour on the beat , we ’ ll listen for the whole thing and not check our watch once . " Writing for Spin , Brandon Soderberg included " Tuscan Leather " as one of the " Rap Songs of the Week " , calling it " expertly conceptualized " and praised it as properly introducing the album . Will Lavin of Gigwise gave the song a positive review , noting Drake 's in depth discussions about his label , his friends , and his peers . Lavin went on to say : " For Drake , when it comes to album openers , his track record is thought <unk> flawless . " 
 Thomas Britt of PopMatters praised the production on " Tuscan Leather " and noted a rare self @-@ aware " utterance " that positions Drake next to a movie character " . The A.V. Club 's Evan Rytlewski said the song : " opens the record with a six @-@ minute rush of beat flips and kinetic spitting , a reminder of how well Drake can rap when a track demands it . " The Globe and Mail reviewer Brad Wheeler said that Drake was " rewriting the rules " by including no choruses , and called Shebib and Drake 's work on the track " bodacious " . David Berry of the National Post called " Tuscan Leather " the best song on Nothing Was the Same , praising Drake ’ s smart wordplay and Shebib " going Picasso " on a Whitney Houston sample . Writing for Idolator , Bianca Gracie said the song showed a more confident Drake , noting that he channels Jay @-@ Z with " bold lyrics " and a " dizzying production " reminiscent of Kanye West circa 2004 . Robert <unk> of Digital Spy also noted a significant growth in confidence , and called the song : " a piece of atmospheric self @-@ reflection that sets up his current mindset : an artist with plenty of ambition but with a constant nagging fear about losing his way .

 = Pennsylvania Route 378 = 
 Pennsylvania Route 378 ( PA 378 ) is a north @-@ to @-@ south road in Lehigh and Northampton counties . The southern terminus is at PA 309 in Center Valley . Its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 22 ( US 22 ) in Bethlehem . The route heads north from PA 309 as a two @-@ lane undivided road through Upper Saucon Township and Lower Saucon Township before crossing South Mountain into the city of Bethlehem . Here , PA 378 follows city streets through Bethlehem 's South Side , intersecting the northern terminus of PA 412 . The route crosses the Lehigh River and becomes a four @-@ lane freeway that continues north to US 22 . PA 378 is the only highway from US 22 to Center City Bethlehem , and a quick route for visitors traveling to the Sands Casino Resort on the city 's South Side . 
 The portion of PA 378 south of Bethlehem was originally numbered as PA 12 in 1928 and renumbered to PA 191 in 1961 . Construction on the freeway from West Broad Street to US 22 began in 1966 and finished two years later . This freeway was numbered Interstate 378 ( I @-@ 378 ) and served as a spur of I @-@ 78 , which formerly ran along the US 22 freeway . When I @-@ 78 was rerouted from US 22 to south of the city , the spur became disjointed from its parent . I @-@ 378 was downgraded to state route status in 1971 . Three years later , the PA 378 designation replaced PA 191 from Center Valley to Third Street in Bethlehem . The state did not remove the exit tabs for the freeway section , making PA 378 one of only a few state freeways with exit numbers ( another one is PA 309 in Wilkes @-@ Barre ) . The exit numbers also go in the wrong direction : Exit 3 is south of Exit 1 , most likely due to the freeway being built when Pennsylvania still practiced sequential exit numbering . In 2009 , the portion north of the Lehigh River was named the Fred B. Rooney Highway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 PA 378 begins at two separate intersections with PA 309 in the community of Center Valley in Upper Saucon Township , Lehigh County . The route heads northward as a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane , passing through Center Valley and paralleling Old Bethlehem Pike . The road runs through a mix of farm fields and woods with residential and commercial development . After an intersection with Preston Lane , PA 378 turns to the northeast . Farther north , the highway passes to the west of Saucon Valley Country Club . At the intersection with Osgood Avenue , PA 378 turns to the northeast , crossing the Old Bethlehem Pike soon after . After crossing Saucon Valley Road , the highway comes to an intersection with Center Valley Parkway , an arterial boulevard . 
 After that , the highway enters Lower Saucon Township in Northampton County and crosses under I @-@ 78 without an interchange . Past this , PA 378 heads north through the community of <unk> , where it passes homes and businesses as a four @-@ lane road parallel to Old Philadelphia Pike . The road traverses South Mountain where it runs through forested areas with some homes . Descending the mountain , PA 378 bends northwestward as a four lane arterial known as Wyandotte Street until leaving the University Heights area near Holy Ghost Cemetery . PA 378 continues into the city of Bethlehem , where it turns northward into residential areas as a two @-@ lane road and is called Wyandotte Street . In the South Side section of the city , PA 378 intersects with the northern terminus of PA 412 ( Broadway ) . The route continues northward and intersects a ramp to 3rd Street that provides access to PA 412 , at which point it widens to four lanes . PA 378 passes over Norfolk Southern 's Lehigh Line before crossing the Lehigh River on the Hill to Hill Bridge . 
 PA 378 heads northward across the Hill to Hill Bridge , at which point it crosses back into Lehigh County . The route crosses over West Lehigh Street and intersects with the off @-@ ramp to Main Street in Bethlehem . There was formerly a ramp to 2nd Avenue , but that has been closed and is only used by pedestrians . After this interchange , PA 378 becomes a four @-@ lane freeway and is named the Fred B. Rooney Highway . The highway continues northward through the city , crossing under West Broad Street and reaching a southbound interchange with North Street , which leads to Center City and Third Avenue . The freeway continues northward , crossing over and receiving an on @-@ ramp from Union Boulevard . 
 The road turns to the northwest and interchanges with Eighth Avenue at exit 2E and exit 2W northbound and exit 2 southbound . PA 378 turns westward through Bethlehem , paralleling Union Boulevard and crossing under Fourteenth Avenue . The route then turns northward , crossing under Eaton Avenue and a Norfolk Southern rail line and passing the Hal <unk> Memorial Park . PA 378 continues northbound , interchanging with and crossing under <unk> Road . After running to the southwest of Lehigh Valley Hospital at Muhlenberg , the freeway enters an interchange with US 22 ( Lehigh Valley Thruway ) , PA 378 northbound traffic is directed onto US 22 westbound . 
 = = History = = 
 The at @-@ grade portion of PA 378 south of Bethlehem was originally designated in the 1928 numbering as an alignment of PA 12 , a route crossing through Northampton and Monroe Counties . In 1961 , PA 12 was decommissioned in favor of PA 191 , a 90 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 140 km ) highway from Center Valley to the New York state line on the Delaware River . In 1974 , following the decommissioning of I @-@ 378 to PA 378 , PA 191 had its southern terminus moved to US 22 in Brodhead and the former alignment between Center Valley and Bethlehem a southern extension of PA 378 . 
 The current alignment of PA 378 was first constructed from West Broad Street in Bethlehem to the current interchange with the Lehigh Valley Thruway . As part of the Interstate Highway System , the Lehigh Valley Thruway was cosigned as the alignment of I @-@ 78 . Upon completion of the freeway in 1968 , the new highway was designated I @-@ 378 , a spur off of I @-@ 78 . However , in 1970 , as I @-@ 78 was realigned to a new bypass to the south of Bethlehem , I @-@ 378 was decommissioned and replaced with the alignment of PA 378 the following year . 
 Since completion , PA 378 has undergone little major change , but the highway has undergone several rehabilitations . The Hill to Hill Bridge received a minor fire during reconstruction of the bridge , when a piece of equipment had its motor catch fire on April 13 , 2009 , when the bridge was undergoing re @-@ painting . The bridge repainting was completed on May 15 , 2009 , after the closing of a bridge and was re @-@ opened later due to rainfall in the area . 
 On September 23 , 2009 , the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced plans and designs for an upgrade and redesign of PA 378 through Bethlehem at its interchange with West Third Street , although this met public criticism . Part of the project , construction of a new ramp from Wyandotte Street to West Third Street , was completed in September 2011 . Completion of the widening of West Third Street and PA 412 was completed later in 2011 . The $ 5 @.@ 1 million project will also include a widening of PA 412 between Exit 67 on I @-@ 78 and Daly Avenue in Bethlehem to two lanes in each direction . On November 21 , 2009 , the project was given funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act signed by president Barack Obama in 2009 . The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation received $ 1 billion worth of funding from the act .

 = Hairspray ( 2007 film ) = 
 Hairspray is a 2007 American musical romantic comedy film based on the 2002 Broadway musical of the same name , which in turn was based on John Waters 's 1988 comedy film of the same name . Adapted from both Waters ' 1988 script and Thomas Meehan and Mark O 'Donnell 's book for the stage musical by screenwriter Leslie Dixon , the 2007 film version of Hairspray is directed and choreographed by Adam Shankman and stars John Travolta , Michelle Pfeiffer , Christopher Walken , Amanda Bynes , James Marsden , Queen Latifah , Brittany Snow , Zac Efron , Elijah Kelley , Allison Janney and Nikki Blonsky . Hairspray features songs from the Broadway musical written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman , as well as four new Shaiman / Wittman compositions not present in the original Broadway version . Set in 1962 Baltimore , Maryland , the film follows the " pleasantly plump " teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV show and rallies against racial segregation . 
 Opening to positive reviews , Hairspray met with financial success , breaking the record for biggest sales at opening weekend for a movie musical , which the film held until July 2008 when it was surpassed by Mamma Mia ! and later High School Musical 3 : Senior Year in October . Hairspray went on to become the sixth highest grossing musical film in US cinema history , behind the film adaptations of Grease , Chicago , and Mamma Mia ! , and stands as one of the most critically and commercially successful musical films of the last decade . Available in a variety of formats , Hairspray 's Region 1 home video release took place on November 20 , 2007 . USA Network purchased the broadcast rights to Hairspray and was scheduled to debut the film on cable television in February 2010 , but in the end it did not broadcast that month , instead the film was pushed back and premiered on USA on July 24 , 2010 , with sister channel Bravo also showing it multiple times , and in February 2011 aired on ABC for over @-@ the @-@ air broadcasts . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Tracy Turnblad is an overweight high school student living in Baltimore , Maryland ( " Good Morning Baltimore " ) in 1962 . She and her classmate Penny Pingleton frequently watch The Corny Collins Show , a local teen dance television show , together ( " The Nicest Kids in Town " ) .

Amber ’ s mother , Velma , manages WYZT and makes sure Amber is prominently featured . Corny Collins and the dancers on the show are white , and Velma only allows African @-@ American kids on the show once a month on " Negro Day " , hosted by R & B disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle . 
 One day , one of the dancers on the show takes a leave of absence and auditions for a replacement are held . Tracy attends , but is rejected by Velma for being overweight and for supporting integration ( " The Legend of Miss Baltimore Crabs " ) .

 = = Cast = = 
 Main characters 
 Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Edna Turnblad , an optimistic , overweight teenage girl who loves dancing ; Tracy 's racial acceptance leads her to become an active supporter for the integration of The Corny Collins Show . Hairspray is Blonsky 's debut as a professional actress . 
 John Travolta as Edna Turnblad , Tracy 's mother and agent , an <unk> ashamed of her obesity . Travolta 's casting as Edna continues the tradition of having a man in drag portray the character , going back to the original 1988 film , which featured drag queen Divine as Edna and at Hairspray 's Broadway version , which featured Harvey Fierstein as Edna . Executives at New Line Cinema originally expected the part to be filled by an actor accustomed to playing comic roles , tossing around names such as Robin Williams , Steve Martin , and Tom Hanks . However , Travolta was aggressively sought after by producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron for this role because he had starred as Danny Zuko in Grease , the second most successful movie musical to date , beaten only by Mamma Mia ! . 
 Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle , the manager of station WYZT and a racist and <unk> , former beauty queen Velma is interested in keeping her daughter Amber in the spotlight and The Corny Collins Show segregated . Hairspray is the first film featuring Pfeiffer to be released in five years . Stardust , also featuring Pfeiffer , was shot before Hairspray , but released three weeks afterwards . The peculiarity of Pfeiffer and Travolta appearing onscreen together ( Travolta starred in Grease , Pfeiffer in Grease 2 ) was not lost on the production staff ; Travolta requested that Pfeiffer play the part of the villainess . 
 James Marsden as Corny Collins , the host of The Corny Collins Show ; his politically progressive attitudes lead him to fight his show 's imposed segregation . Corny Collins is based upon Baltimore TV personality , Buddy Deane , who hosted an eponymous local teen dance show in the late 1950s and early 1960s . James Marsden beat out both Joey McIntyre and X @-@ Men co @-@ star Hugh Jackman for the part . 
 Christopher Walken as Wilbur Turnblad , Tracy 's father , the easygoing proprietor of the " Hardy @-@ Har Hut " joke shop below the Turnblad family 's apartment . John Travolta had asked that Walken be considered for the part , and he eventually beat out Billy Crystal and Jim Broadbent for the role of Wilbur . 
 Amanda Bynes as Penny Lou Pingleton , Tracy 's best friend , a sheltered girl who falls in love with Seaweed , despite the efforts of her racist , devoutly religious and stern mother , Prudy Pingleton . A young actress famous for appearances on Nickelodeon TV shows and in feature films , Bynes was one of the few movie stars cast among the teen roles . 
 Queen Latifah as Maybelle " Motormouth " Stubbs , a Baltimore rhythm and blues radio DJ who hosts " Negro Day " on The Corny Collins Show . Maybelle also runs a record shop on North Avenue . Queen Latifah appeared in the successful Zadan / Meron film musical Chicago , and worked under Adam Shankman 's direction in Bringing Down the House . She beat out soul legend Aretha Franklin for the role of Maybelle . 
 Brittany Snow as Amber Von Tussle , Velma 's bratty daughter and the lead female dancer on The Corny Collins Show . Amber becomes Tracy 's enemy when Tracy threatens both Amber 's chances of winning the " Miss Teenage Hairspray " crown and Amber 's relationship with her boyfriend , Link . Snow previously worked with Shankman in The Pacifier . Hayden Panettiere was also considered for the part of Amber , but was decided against in part because of her then @-@ upcoming work with the NBC television series Heroes . 
 Zac Efron as Link Larkin , Amber 's boyfriend and the lead male dancer on The Corny Collins Show . Link is a singer who becomes more attracted to Tracy . The character is based in part upon Elvis Presley . Efron , a popular teen actor who played Troy Bolton in the Disney Channel TV film High School Musical , was initially thought by Shankman to be " too Disney " . Shankman 's sister , executive producer Jennifer <unk> , convinced her brother to cast Efron , believing that the teen star would draw a substantial teen crowd . 
 Elijah Kelley as Seaweed J. Stubbs , Maybelle 's son , a skilled dancer who teaches Tracy some dance moves and falls in love with her friend , Penny . Kelley , a relative newcomer to film , overcame other auditioners and several popular R & B stars for the part of Seaweed . 
 Allison Janney as Prudence " Prudy " Pingleton , Penny 's mother , a Christian fundamentalist whose strict parenting keeps Penny from experiencing social life . Her husband is serving a prison sentence for an unspecified crime . Prudy is horrified when her daughter is on TV , and decides to keep her from leaving the house anymore . 
 Minor roles 
 Paul Dooley as Harriman F. <unk> , the owner of the " Ultra Clutch " company and the main sponsor of The Corny Collins Show . Although he prefers to keep The Corny Collins Show segregated , he will follow public opinion if it increases sales . 
 Jayne Eastwood as Miss Wimsey , Tracy ’ s geography teacher ; gives Tracy the detention note that first leads her to Seaweed . 
 Jerry Stiller as Mr. Pinky , the owner of a dress shop called Mr. Pinky 's Hefty Hideaway , who hires Tracy as his <unk> . In the original film , Stiller played Wilbur Turnblad . 
 Taylor Parks as Little Inez Stubbs , Maybelle 's teenage daughter , Seaweed 's younger sister , and a skilled dancer . Inez is based in part upon Ruby Bridges , the first black child to attend a formerly all @-@ white school in the state of Louisiana . 
 George King as Mr. Flak , Amber , Link , and Tracy 's history teacher . He gives Tracy detention when Amber frames Tracy of drawing a picture of him with breasts . He gives Link detention as well for coming to Tracy 's defense .

 Music producer / composer / co @-@ lyricist Marc Shaiman and co @-@ lyricist Scott Wittman were required to alter their Broadway Hairspray song score in various ways in order to work on film , from changing portions of the lyrics in some songs ( e.g. , " ( The Legend of ) Miss Baltimore Crabs " , " Big , Blonde , and Beautiful " , and " You Can 't Stop the Beat " ) to more or less completely removing other songs from the film altogether . 
 " Mama , I 'm a Big Girl Now " , a popular number from the stage musical , features Tracy , Penny , and Amber arguing with their respective mothers . Neither Shankman nor Dixon could come up with a solution for filming " Mama " that did not require a three @-@ way split screen — something they wanted to avoid — and both felt the number did not adequately advance the plot . As a result , " Mama " was reluctantly dropped from the film during pre @-@ production , although it is used by Shaiman as an instrumental number when the Corny Collins kids dance the " Stricken Chicken " . A special version of " Mama " was recorded for the film 's end credits in May 2007 , during the final score recording process , which featured vocals from each of the three women most famous for portraying Tracy Turnblad : Ricki Lake from the 1988 film , Marissa Jaret Winokur from the original Broadway cast , and Nikki Blonsky from the 2007 film . Harvey Fierstein , who portrayed Edna as part of the original Broadway cast , has a brief cameo moment in the end credits version of " Mama " as well . 
 " It Takes Two " , a solo for Link , was moved from its place in the stage musical ( on Tracy 's first day on The Corny Collins Show ) to an earlier Corny Collins scene , although only the coda of the song is used in the final release print , and the song 's background music can be heard immediately after the reprise of " The Nicest Kids in Town " . " Cooties " , a solo for Amber in the stage musical , is present in this film as an instrumental during the Miss Teenage Hairspray dance @-@ off . As with " Mama , I 'm a Big Girl Now " , a version of " Cooties " , performed in a contemporary pop rendition by Aimee Allen , is present during the end credits . 
 The performance of a vintage dance called The Madison , present in both the 1988 film and the stage musical , was replaced for this version by a newly composed song , " Ladies ' Choice " . Portions of the Madison dance steps were integrated into the choreography for the musical number " You Can 't Stop the Beat " , and the song to which the dance is performed on Broadway can be heard during Motormouth Maybelle 's platter party in the film , re @-@ titled " Boink @-@ Boink " . " The Big Dollhouse " was the only song from the musical not used in the film in any way . 
 Shaiman and Wittman composed two new songs for the 2007 film : " Ladies ' Choice " , a solo for Link , and " Come So Far ( Got So Far to Go ) " , a song performed during the end credits by Queen Latifah , Blonsky , Efron , and Kelley . Another " new " song in the 2007 film , " The New Girl in Town " , had originally been composed for the Broadway musical , but was deemed unnecessary and discarded from the musical . Director Shankman decided to use the song to both underscore a rise @-@ to @-@ fame montage for Tracy and to showcase Maybelle 's " Negro Day " , which is never actually seen in either of the earlier incarnations of Hairspray . 
 One additional Shaiman / Wittman song , a ballad entitled " I Can Wait " , was composed for the film as a solo for Tracy , meant to replace the stage musical 's reprise of " Good Morning Baltimore " .

 Following the success of the Broadway musical of the same name , which won eight Tony Awards in 2003 , New Line Cinema , who owned the rights to the 1988 John Waters film upon which the stage musical is based , became interested in adapting the stage show as a musical film . Development work began in late 2004 , while a similarly film @-@ to @-@ Broadway @-@ to @-@ film project , Mel Brooks ' The Producers , was in production . 
 Craig Zadan and Neil Meron , the executive producers of the Academy Award @-@ winning film adaptation of the Broadway musical Chicago , were hired as the producers for Hairspray , and began discussing possibly casting John Travolta and Billy Crystal ( or Jim Broadbent ) as Edna and Wilbur Turnblad , respectively . Thomas Meehan and Mark O 'Donnell , authors of the book for the stage musical , wrote the first draft of the film 's screenplay , but were replaced by Leslie Dixon , screenwriter for family comedies such as Mrs. Doubtfire and Freaky Friday . After a year 's deliberation on who should direct the film , Zadan and Meron finally decided to hire Adam Shankman to both direct and choreograph Hairspray . Upon learning he had been hired , Shankman arranged a meeting with John Waters , who advised him " don 't do what I did , don 't do what the play did . You 've gotta do your own thing . " Despite this , Shankman still noted " all roads of Hairspray lead back to John Waters . " 
 Tony Gardner ( designer ) and his company Alterian , Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta . Costume designer Rita <unk> wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits , so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics . He wore silicone prosthetics on his head and neck , and foam latex arms and legs that connected to a spandex and foam body suit . 
 = = = ( Screen to ) stage to screen changes = = = 
 Dixon was primarily hired to tone down much of the campiness inherent in the stage musical . The 2007 film 's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film , so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version . These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version ( such as Arvin <unk> ( the role Mr. <unk> fills ) , Velma 's husband Franklin , Corny 's assistant Tammy , the beatniks , et al . ) , removing the <unk> Acres amusement park from the story , and placing Velma in charge of the station where The Corny Collins Show is filmed . 
 " Mama , I 'm a Big Girl Now " , a popular number from the stage musical , features Tracy , Penny , and Amber arguing with their respective mothers . Neither Shankman nor Dixon could come up with a solution for filming the song that did not require a three @-@ way split screen — something they wanted to avoid — and both felt the number did not adequately advance the plot . As a result , the song was reluctantly dropped from the film during pre @-@ production , although it is used by Shaiman as an instrumental number when the Corny Collins kids dance the " Stricken Chicken " . A special version of the song was recorded for the film 's end credits in May 2007 , during the final score recording process , which featured vocals from each of the three women most famous for portraying Tracy Turnblad : Ricki Lake from the 1988 film , Marissa Jaret Winokur from the original Broadway cast , and Nikki Blonsky from the 2007 film . Harvey Fierstein , who portrayed Edna as part of the original Broadway cast , has a brief cameo moment in the end credits version of the song as well . 
 " It Takes Two " , a solo for Link , was moved from its place in the stage musical ( on Tracy 's first day on The Corny Collins Show ) to an earlier Corny Collins scene , although only the coda of the song is used in the final release print , and the song 's background music can be heard immediately after the reprise of " The Nicest Kids in Town " . " Cooties " , a solo for Amber in the stage musical , is present in this film as an instrumental during the Miss Teenage Hairspray dance @-@ off . Similar to " Mama , I 'm a Big Girl Now " , a version of " Cooties " , performed in a contemporary pop rendition by Aimee Allen , is present during the end credits . 
 One notable difference between the stage musical , the original film , and the 2007 film version of Hairspray is that Tracy does not go to jail in the 2007 version ( thus eliminating the musical 's song " The Big Dollhouse " ) . In both previous incarnations of Hairspray , Tracy is arrested and taken to jail along with the other protesters . Edna is presented in this version as an insecure introvert , in contrast to the relatively bolder incarnations present in the 1988 film and the stage musical . Among many other elements changed or added to this version are the removal of Motormouth Maybelle 's habit of speaking in rhyming jive talk , and doubling the number of teens in Corny Collins ' Council ( from ten on Broadway to twenty in the 2007 film ) . 
 Dixon restructured portions of Hairspray 's book to allow several of the songs to blend more naturally into the plot , in particular " ( You 're ) Timeless to Me " and " I Know Where I 've Been " . " ( You 're ) Timeless to Me " becomes the anchor of a newly invented subplot involving Velma 's attempt to break up Edna and Wilbur ’ s marriage and keep Tracy off The Corny Collins Show as a result . The song now serves as Wilbur 's apology to Edna , in addition to its original purpose in the stage musical as a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek declaration of Wilbur and Edna 's love for each other . Meanwhile , " I Know Where I 've Been " , instead of being sung by Maybelle alone after being let out of jail , now underscores Maybelle 's march on WYZT ( which takes place in the stage musical only briefly during " Big , Blonde , and Beautiful " ) . 
 The song " Big , Blonde , and Beautiful " was inspired by a line that Tracy delivered in the original film ( " Now all of Baltimore will know : I 'm big , blonde and beautiful ! " ) , but in the stage version and in this film , Motormouth Maybelle performs the song . A reprise of the song was added to the 2007 film , which is sung by Edna and Velma . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production and casting = = = 
 Hairspray was produced on a budget of $ 75 million . An open casting call was announced to cast unknowns in Atlanta , New York City , and Chicago . After auditioning over eleven hundred candidates , Nikki Blonsky , an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old high school senior from Great Neck , New York who had no previous professional acting experience , was chosen for the lead role of Tracy . Relative unknowns Elijah Kelley and Taylor Parks were chosen through similar audition contests to portray siblings Seaweed and Little Inez Stubbs , respectively . John Travolta was finally cast as Edna , with Christopher Walken ultimately assuming the role of Wilbur . Several other stars , including Queen Latifah , James Marsden , Michelle Pfeiffer , and Allison Janney were chosen for the other supporting adult roles of Motormouth Maybelle , Corny Collins , Velma Von Tussle , and Prudy Pingleton , respectively . Teen stars Amanda Bynes , and Zac Efron were cast as Tracy 's friends Penny and Link , and Brittany Snow was cast as her rival , Amber Von Tussle . Jerry Stiller , who played Wilbur Turnblad in the original film , appears as plus @-@ sized women 's clothes retailer Mr. Pinky in this version . 
 Since Hairspray 's plot focuses heavily on dance , choreography became a heavy focus for Shankman , who hired four assistant choreographers , Jamal Sims , Anne Fletcher , and Zach Woodlee , and put both his acting cast and over a hundred and fifty dancers through two months of rehearsals . The cast recorded the vocal tracks for their songs as coached by Elaine <unk> in the weeks just before principal photography began in September . 
 = = = Principal photography = = = 
 Principal photography took place in Toronto , and Hamilton , Ontario , Canada from September 5 @-@ December 8 , 2006 . Hairspray is explicitly set in Baltimore , Maryland and the original 1988 film had been shot on location there , but the 2007 film was shot primarily in Toronto because the city was better equipped with the sound stages necessary to film a musical . The opening shots of the descent from the clouds and the newspaper being dropped onto the stoop are the only times that the actual city of Baltimore is shown in the film . 
 The majority of the film was shot at Toronto 's <unk> Studios . Most of the street scenes were shot at the intersection of Dundas Street West and <unk> Avenue . A PCC streetcar with Toronto Transit Commission livery is seen in the opening sequence . Some of the signs for the 1960s @-@ era stores remain up along the street . Toronto 's Lord Lansdowne Public School was used for all of the high school exteriors and some of the interiors , while the old Queen Victoria School in Hamilton was also used for interiors . Scenes at Queen Victoria were shot from November 22 to December 2 , and the school was scheduled to be demolished after film production was completed . 
 Thinner than most of the other men who have portrayed Edna , Travolta appeared onscreen in a large fat suit , and required four hours of makeup in order to appear before the cameras . His character 's nimble dancing style belies her girth ; Shankman based Edna 's dancing style on the hippo ballerinas in the Dance of the Hours sequence in Walt Disney 's 1940 animated feature , Fantasia . Although early versions of the suit created " a dumpy , Alfred Hitchcock version of Edna , " Travolta fought for the ability to give his character curves and a thick Baltimore accent . Designed by Tony Gardner , the fat suit was created using lightweight synthetic materials , consisting of layered pads and silicone , which was used from the chest upwards . The suit provided the additional benefit of covering Travolta 's beard , eliminating the problem of his facial hair growing through his makeup midday . 
 = = = Shankman 's inspirations = = = 
 Shankman included " a lot of winks " to films that influenced his work on Hairspray : 
 The film 's opening shot — a bird 's eye view of Baltimore that eventually descends from the clouds to ground level — is a combination of the opening shots of West Side Story and The Sound of Music . 
 Before we see a full shot of Tracy , we see individual shots of her upraised right and left arms . This is reminiscent of our first views of Sadie Thompson ( Joan Crawford ) in the 1932 film Rain . 
 Several scenes involving Tracy , such as her ride atop the garbage truck during the " Good Morning Baltimore " number and her new hairstyle during " Welcome to the ' 60s " , are directly inspired by the Barbra Streisand musical film version of Funny Girl . 
 During " Without Love " , Link sings to a photograph of Tracy , which comes to life and sings harmony with him . This is directly inspired from the MGM musical The Broadway Melody of 1938 , in which a young Judy Garland swoons over a photo of actor Clark Gable as she sings " You Made Me Love You " . 
 The dress that Penny wears during " You Can 't Stop the Beat " is made from her bedroom curtains , which can be seen during " Without Love " . This is homage to The Sound of Music , where Maria uses old curtains to make play clothes for the von Trapp children .

 Hairspray has garnered acclaim from film critics such as Roger Ebert , The New York Times , and The Boston Globe , as well as a smaller number of reviews comparing it unfavorably to the Waters original . The film is one of the top picks on Metacritic , with an average of 81 . It scored a 91 % " Certified Fresh " approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , also indicating excellent reviews , making it one of 2007 's best @-@ reviewed films . Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor named it the 4th best film of 2007 . Lou Lumenick of the New York Post named it the ninth best film of 2007 . 
 Ebert gave the film 3 @.@ 5 stars out of 4 , saying that there was " a lot of craft and slyness lurking beneath the circa @-@ 1960s goofiness , " also stating that " The point , however , is not the plot but the energy . Without somebody like Nikki Blonsky at the heart of the movie , it might fall flat , but everybody works at her level of happiness ... " Ebert also noted that this film is " a little more innocent than Waters would have made it ... " Krishna Shenoi , of the Shenoi Chronicle , called the movie " Shankman 's masterpiece , " saying that it moved away from his previous works into a different direction , making a light comedy that deals with serious issues maturely . Shenoi also said that the film was everything he wanted Grease to be . Lou Lumenick of The New York Post hailed Hairspray as " The best and most entertaining movie adaptation of a stage musical so far this century — and yes , I ’ m including the Oscar @-@ winning Chicago , " calling it " one of the best @-@ cast movies in recent memory ... " New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews called the film " A great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions , CGI effects and sequels , sequels , sequels . " The Baltimore Sun review offered Michael Sragow 's opinion that " in its entirety , Hairspray has the funny tilt that only a director @-@ choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie , " pointing out that Shankman skillfully " puts a new @-@ millennial zing behind exact re @-@ creations of delirious period dances like the Mashed Potato . " Dana Stevens from Slate called Hairspray " intermittently tasty , if a little too frantically eager to please . " Stevens noted that " Despite its wholesomeness , this version stays remarkably true to the spirit of the original , with one size @-@ 60 exception : John Travolta as Edna Turnblad , " saying " How you feel about Hairspray will depend entirely on your reaction to this performance ... " 
 The New Yorker 's David Denby felt the new version of Hairspray was " perfectly pleasant , " but compared unfavorably to the Broadway musical , since " [ director Adam Shankman and screenwriter Leslie Dixon ] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor . " Denby criticized the dance numbers , calling them " unimaginatively shot , " and he considered " the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy ’ s hefty mother ... a blandly earnest betrayal . " Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray " reasonably entertaining . But do we really need to be entertained reasonably ? Waters ' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense ; this Hairspray toils needlessly to make sense of that craziness , and something gets lost in the translation . " Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah 's performance of " I Know Where I 've Been " was incorporated into the movie , saying " The filmmakers may believe they 're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material ... [ but ] the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won 't get the movie 's message unless it 's spelled out for them . "

 Despite its critical and commercial success , Hairspray nonetheless garnered some criticism upon its release by individuals in the gay community . Much of this criticism surrounded Travolta 's portrayal of Edna Turnblad , a role played in the original film by celebrated drag performer Divine , and in the stage adaptation by Harvey Fierstein . Kevin Naff , a managing editor for Washington , D.C. / Baltimore area gay newspaper the Washington Blade called for a boycott of the new Hairspray film , alleging that Scientology , in which Travolta believes , was patently homophobic , and allegedly supported workshops designed to " cure " homosexuals . Adam Shankman protested Naff 's proposed boycott , stating that Travolta was not homophobic , as he ( Shankman ) , Waters , Shaiman , Wittman , and several other members of the creative staff were homosexual , and Travolta got along well with the entire crew . " John 's personal beliefs did not walk onto my set , " said Shankman . " I never heard the word ' Scientology . ' "

 Due to Hairspray 's financial success , New Line Cinema had asked John Waters to write a sequel to the film . Waters reunited with director / choreographer Adam Shankman for the project , and songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman were set to compose the film 's musical numbers . 
 The story would have looked at Tracy 's entering the late 1960s era of music and the British Invasion , and used the Hippie movement and Vietnam War as backdrops . While no official casting was announced , New Line said that they hoped to " snag much of the original Hairspray cast . " John Travolta , however , publicly announced that he would not return because he is " not a big sequel guy " . 
 The sequel was set for a mid @-@ July 2010 release by Warner Bros. , which owns New Line Cinema . However in June 2010 , Shankman told British press that Hairspray 2 : White Lipstick was no longer in development . Shankman has also said that there will be no sequel . 
 = Old Church of St Nidan , Llanidan = 
 The Old Church of St Nidan , Llanidan is a medieval church in the community of Llanidan , in Anglesey , North Wales , close to the Menai Strait . The first church on the site was established in the 7th century by St Nidan , the confessor of the monastery at Penmon , Anglesey , but the oldest parts of the present structure , which is now closed and partly in ruins , date from the 14th century . In about 1500 the church was enlarged by the addition of a second nave on the north side , separated from the earlier nave by an arcade of six arches . Between 1839 and 1843 a new church was built nearby to serve the local community , partly due to the cost of repairing the old church . Much of the building was subsequently demolished , leaving only part of the western end and the central arcade . The decision was condemned at the time by Harry Longueville Jones , a clergyman and antiquarian , who lamented the " melancholy fate " of what he called " one of the largest and most important [ churches ] in the island of Anglesey " . Other appreciative comments have been made about the church both before and after its partial demolition . 
 After the new church was opened , the old church was used as a chapel for funerals for a time . It has been restored by the owners of the adjoining house , Plas Llanidan , and is occasionally open to the public . The remaining parts of the church are a Grade II * listed building , a national designation given to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " , in particular because St Nidan 's is regarded as " a good example of a simple medieval rural church , enriched by 15th @-@ century additions " . 
 In the 12th century , Gerald of Wales said that the church possessed a curious stone shaped like a thigh that would always return by the next day no matter how far away it was taken . A Norman earl , he recounted , had chained it to a large rock and thrown it into the sea , only for the stone to return to the church by the following morning . A sandstone chest containing bone fragments , possibly relics of a saint , was found buried beneath the altar . The chest and the church 's 13th @-@ century font were relocated to the new church .

 = = = Foundation and construction = = = 
 St Nidan 's Church is in the south of Anglesey , Wales , near the village of Brynsiencyn . It is about a quarter of a mile ( 400 m ) from the Menai Strait , which divides the mainland of Wales from the island of Anglesey . The authors of a 2009 guide to the buildings of north @-@ west Wales record the tradition that a church was first established at this site in 616 . St Nidan , who founded the church here , was associated with St Seiriol 's monastery at Penmon , on the eastern tip of Anglesey , and was the monastery 's confessor . The area takes its name from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant " enclosure " and then " church " , and " ‑ <unk> " is a modified form of the saint 's name . 
 The church and rectory are mentioned in a charter of 1360 as being owned by the priory at Beddgelert , Gwynedd ; earlier records have been lost and therefore the date of the priory 's acquisition is unknown . As a result , writes the historian Antony Carr , the reason for the " distant community " of Augustinians in Beddgelert possessing Llanidan and three other churches in Anglesey cannot now be discovered . Carr notes that the priory also controlled two churches on the other side of the Menai Strait from Llanidan . Ownership of the church passed to Henry VIII at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1535 . His successor , Elizabeth I , granted the advowson ( the right of a patron to choose the parish priest ) and the grounds surrounding St Nidan 's , including the estate house called Plas Llanidan , to an Edward <unk> and a Peter Ashton ; thereafter , in the following centuries , the right and the land passed by sale , on marriage and by bequest into the hands of the Boston family . 
 The remaining part of the south nave , the oldest section of the present structure , dates from medieval times ; the north doorway and tracery ( patterns of stonework in the windows ) point to the 14th century . In about 1500 , the church was enlarged by the addition of a south porch and a second nave to the north . An arcade ( row of arches ) was constructed between the two naves . Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales . Llanidan is one of three examples on the island ; the others are St Beuno 's , Aberffraw and St Cwyfan 's , Llangwyfan ) . It is uncertain whether St Nidan 's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of the generosity of a benefactor . 
 = = = Replacement and demolition = = = 
 A new church , also dedicated to St Nidan , was built to replace the old one between 1839 and 1843 . This was because the old church required considerable repair and the growing population in Brynsiencyn needed a church closer to their village . Much of the structure of the old church was demolished in 1844 , leaving only the western end ( enclosed by a new wall at the east ) and the arcade . Some walling was constructed at the east end of the arcade to help support the arches , but it sank because it was apparently built over a grave . In 1913 , the tops of the external arches were covered with asphalt and turf in an attempt to make them more weather @-@ proof . One of the voussoirs in the eastern @-@ most arch was replaced at the same time due to its poor condition . 
 Parish worship transferred to the new church , along with some of the fittings . The old church was thereafter used as a mortuary chapel for a time . The churchyard continued to be used for burials until 1902 . In modern times , the owners of Plas Llanidan have restored the church , and it is used by them as a private chapel . The churchyard is kept locked , but the church and the gardens of Plas Llanidan are occasionally opened to the public . 
 The 19th @-@ century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones disputed the need to replace the old church and condemned its " melancholy fate " , describing the reasons for its demise as " pretexts " . In his view the only part of the church that needed repair was the " ruinous " western end ( which had been " badly constructed in the first instance " ) , yet this part was saved while the " good portions of the building " were destroyed . Furthermore , the cost of the new church was more than double the cost of repairs to the medieval church , which could have " endure [ d ] for ages to come " . He added that it might have been thought to be safe , as it was so close to Lord Boston 's house and thus " under the shadow of the lord of the domain " , and he condemned the " evil hour " in which " the ruthless hand of the destroyer was allowed to be lifted against it by those whose first duty it was to see that it took no harm " . He stated that " when buildings , dedicated to God 's service by the piety of former ages , are allowed to be treated in this manner by the constituted authorities of the land ... the institutions to which they are attached cannot be expected to find greater favour at the hands of the fickle and ignorant multitude . " He also noted that the new church was only a little larger than its predecessor . 
 = = = People associated with the church = = = 
 The cleric and antiquarian Henry Rowlands , who wrote a history of Anglesey entitled Mona Antiqua Restaurata , was the vicar of St Nidan 's from 1696 until his death in 1723 . Thomas Williams , a politician and businessman who became wealthy through copper mining in Anglesey , was buried in the churchyard in 1802 , but was reburied at St <unk> 's , <unk> , in the 1830s . Isaac Jones , a cleric and translator of theological texts , was a curate of Llanidan and other churches in the vicinity from 1840 until his death in 1850 . He is buried in the churchyard of St Nidan 's . The sculptor John Gibson ( 1790 – 1866 ) was the son of William Gibson , the fourth of his family to serve as the parish clerk at St Nidan 's . The Gibson family was associated with the church from the early 18th century onwards ; the baptism of Grace , daughter of George Gibson , is recorded in the registers in 1708 .

 = = = Structure = = = 
 St Nidan 's has two naves or aisles divided by a central arcade , and a porch in the south @-@ west corner . It is 38 feet ( 11 @.@ 6 m ) wide , the northern nave being about 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) wider than the other . Before the church 's partial demolition , the church was 78 feet ( 23 @.@ 8 m ) long and had a chapel , 12 by 19 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 by 5 @.@ 8 m ) , on the south side . The walls , about 2 feet 10 inches ( 0 @.@ 86 m ) thick , are built from local rubble masonry with a covering of sandstone . The present wall at the east end was added after the rest of the church was demolished . The western wall has been rebuilt and buttresses added to the south side and north @-@ west corner to help support the structure ; Jones thought that they dated from the 16th century . The roof above the remaining western section is made from slates . At the top of the west end of the roof above the south aisle , there is a stone bellcote with two bells . 
 The south porch contains a water stoup that was said miraculously never to dry up ; the water was traditionally regarded as having healing powers . There is a second entrance on the north side through a 15th @-@ century arched doorway decorated with carved human heads . Two verses from Psalm 84 ( in Welsh ) are written on the wall above the doorway : " For one day in thy Courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a door @-@ keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of <unk> . " These are the only surviving portions of the Biblical texts that once decorated the internal walls . 
 The north wall has a window with two lights ( sections of window separated by mullions ) topped with trefoils ( a pattern of three overlapping circles ) . The two arched east windows , one in each aisle , are decorated with tracery ; the southern window reuses some tracery from the 15th century . The demolished southern chapel had a two @-@ light window similar to that at St Peter 's , Newborough , which Jones considered to be of " very rude workmanship " , and three @-@ light square @-@ headed windows in the east and west walls . Jones also noted the loss of the original window at the end of the northern aisle , which was from the 14th century in his view , and some windows in the north wall " of excellent workmanship " . The southern aisle , he said , had had " a small circular headed window , filled up from a pointed one " at the eastern end ; the east window " was of a design more remarkable for its singularity than its beauty . " 
 Two of the six arches in the arcade are inside the church ; the other four project beyond the east wall , which has been built around one of the octagonal piers that support the arches . The roof dates from the 15th century , although the visible beams are not original ; the roof 's exposed wooden trusses rest on sandstone corbels . A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted 20 memorials from the 17th and 18th centuries . It also recorded the presence of a sundial on a pedestal , dated 1768 , and some stone shields that were not attached to the building , bearing dates of 1561 and 1563 . Most of the fittings now in St Nidan 's are not original , and come from other churches in north @-@ west Wales ; the granite altar is modern .

 The 19th @-@ century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd , who wrote a history of Anglesey in 1833 , recorded the story noted by Gerald of Wales in the late 12th century that the church once possessed a stone " resembling a human thigh " which would return " of its own accord " however far away it was carried . It was sometimes known as the " homing stone " . Gerald said that Hugh d 'Avranches , 1st Earl of Chester ( who died in 1101 ) had tested this story by throwing the stone into the sea , chained to a large rock , only to discover that the stone had returned by the next morning . As a result , the Norman earl issued an order that no @-@ one was to attempt to move it . It was popularly believed that if a couple had sexual intercourse near the stone ( something that Gerald said happened " frequently " ) , it would " sweat large drops of water " and the woman would not become pregnant . Henry Rowlands wrote that the stone had been stolen from the wall of the churchyard ( into which it had been set ) during his time at St Nidan 's . 
 When Rowlands was vicar of St Nidan 's , a small chest was found buried about 2 feet ( 60 cm ) under the altar , containing some bone pieces . His view was that it contained the relics of a saint from St Nidan 's or another church in the region ( St Beuno 's Church , Clynnog Fawr or St Dwynwen 's Church , <unk> ) , and that the chest had placed in St Nidan 's during the time of Edward VI for safe keeping . The sandstone reliquary is now kept at the new church , where local tradition maintains that it holds the remains of St Nidan . Jones said that it was " unique , as far as Wales is concerned . " The 13th @-@ century font , which Jones described as " a singularly beautiful specimen " , was moved to the new church in about 1860 .

 St Nidan 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it is a Grade II * listed building , the second @-@ highest of the three grades of listing , designating " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is regarded as " a good example of a simple medieval rural church , enriched by 15th @-@ century additions . " Cadw , the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists , also notes that although it was partly demolished in the middle of the 19th century , " what remains can be considered a well preserved and important survival of a double @-@ naved church , retaining many 15th @-@ century features such as the central arcade . " 
 The wall around the churchyard is also a listed building , at Grade II – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . According to Cadw , the wall probably dates from the 15th century , from around the time that the church was extended .

 In 1802 the clergyman and antiquarian John Skinner visited Anglesey to see the island 's Celtic remains , beginning his tour by rowing across the Menai Strait to land at Llanidan . His view was that the church " seems superior to the generality of Welsh buildings of the kind " , with its double roof and two bells , but he also said that " the interior of the building has little to attract notice " . Angharad Llwyd described it in 1833 as " a spacious structure , containing several good monuments " . 
 Commenting in 1846 on the church as it had been before demolition started , Harry Longueville Jones said that St Nidan 's was " one of the largest and most important [ churches ] in the island of Anglesey " for its varied architecture , fittings and traditions . He noted the " rather curious " position of the church , in a " nearly circular enclosure " with tall trees around it , and said that " the effect of the western end with the porch , overgrown by an enormous quantity of ivy , was picturesque in the extreme " . 
 = = = Post @-@ demolition comments = = = 
 The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1850 . He said that St Nidan 's , which he described as " now abandoned and in great measure ruinated " , was " a larger and better structure than most of the Anglesey churches . " At the time he saw it , the walls were still largely in place but the only roofed section was the western end ; he commented that most of the church was " open to the skies . " 
 The historian and clergyman Edmund Tyrrell Green , writing a survey of Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929 , described the arcade as " good " and some of the tracery in the windows as " very good " . His view was that the " excellence of the work " at St Nidan 's was because of its link with Beddgelert Priory . 
 The authors of a 1990 book about the lost churches of Wales said that St Nidan 's was " now an evocative shell <unk> mantled with ivy and enclosed by an overgrown graveyard " . They described it as " a dark , dusty and empty place " , but said that the " elegant " arcade " rises from the graveyard like an abstract sculpture . " The quality of the stone carving of the doors and windows , they said , was evidence of " the vanished splendour of Llanidan . " 
 A 2002 book about Welsh churchyards comments that " a pilgrimage undertaken to this churchyard is rewarding " , since there is " little to distract and much to suggest the quiet years of Nidan 's ministry in this secluded spot . " Noting how the site can be reached from the Menai Strait yet hidden from it , the author added that " some stillness still remains in secret places like Llanidan . " A 2005 guide to Wales said that " the romantic yew @-@ encircled ruin " of St Nidan 's " should not be missed . " 
 = Gwen Cooper = 
 Gwen Cooper is a fictional character portrayed by Welsh actress Eve Myles in the BBC science @-@ fiction television programme Torchwood , a spin @-@ off of the long @-@ running series Doctor Who . The lead female character , Gwen featured in every episode of the show 's 2006 @-@ 2011 run , as well as two 2008 crossover episodes of Doctor Who . Gwen appears in Expanded Universe material such as the Torchwood novels and audiobooks , comic books and radio plays . 
 Within the series narrative , Gwen is a South Wales Police officer who discovers the mysterious Torchwood Institute , into which she is recruited by Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) . Gwen initially operates as a field agent , bringing a humane and rounded approach to the team 's investigations of the extraterrestrial . Gwen 's work begins to take a toll on her personal life in series one ( 2006 ) , but her marriage to Rhys ( Kai Owen ) keeps her grounded , even as her responsibilities increase in series two ( 2008 ) . In Children of Earth ( 2009 ) and Miracle Day ( 2011 ) , after Torchwood is destroyed to conceal a government conspiracy , a much hardened Gwen operates under her own mandate as the world undergoes crises linked with unprecedented alien threats . 
 Gwen is introduced as an audience surrogate , in the mould of the " girl next door " archetype , much like the perennial " companion " character in Doctor Who . However , as the series progressed , the production team chose to emphasise contradictory aspects to her character by having Gwen make ethically dubious decisions . As the show progresses , and even after becoming a mother , Gwen evolves into a more militant action heroine and finds herself willing to make tough decisions to protect those closest to her . 
 Reviewers have generally responded positively to the complexity of Gwen 's character and Eve Myles ' portrayal , though critics found fault with her more prosaic characterisation earlier on . Eve Myles ' portrayal of Gwen has been cited as effective in both promoting the country of Wales and combating a perceived prejudice against the Welsh accent . Myles received a Welsh BAFTA for the first series of the show and was nominated for several other acting awards across each of Torchwood 's four series ' .

The Doctor suggests a connection to Gwyneth , a separate character portrayed by Eve Myles in the 2005 Doctor Who episode " The Unquiet Dead " . 
 In Children of Earth , a five @-@ part serial broadcast in 2009 , Gwen is a more militant heroine shaped by the increased responsibilities and pressures of her job .

 = = = Literature = = = 
 Gwen appears in all Torchwood novels published by BBC Books to date . The first wave , Another Life , Border Princes , and Slow Decay , set between the series one episodes of Torchwood , were published in January 2007 . These novels expand on the difficult period in Gwen and Rhys ' relationship . In Border Princes she engages in an affair with the mysterious James Mayer , while Rhys is endangering himself for her in Slow Decay by taking an alien diet pill to impress her . Published in March 2008 , and tying in with the concurrently airing second series of Torchwood , Gwen appears in the novels Trace Memory , The Twilight Streets , and Something in the Water . Gwen 's first day with Andy Davidson as her beat partner is portrayed in a flashback in Trace Memory . In The Twilight Streets an alternate @-@ future Torchwood is depicted ; headed by Gwen and Rhys , after the demise of Tosh , Owen , Ianto and Jack . Three more Torchwood books were released in October 2008 : Pack Animals , SkyPoint , and Almost Perfect . These novels maintain the series chronology : Pack Animals depicts Gwen attempting to plan for her wedding alongside her Torchwood mission . SkyPoint , in which Gwen and Rhys discover an alien threat whilst <unk> , is set soon after their wedding in " Something Borrowed " . Gwen 's continued use of her maiden name is not specifically addressed in the TV show , but SkyPoint sees her consciously reject the name " Mrs Williams " , after the unfamiliarity and awkwardness of hearing Jack address her this way . The novel Almost Perfect is the first to be set after the episode Exit Wounds in which Tosh and Owen are killed ; Gwen becomes concerned at Rhys ' increasing role in her investigations . The May 2009 wave of books consisted of Into the Silence , Bay of the Dead , and The House that Jack Built . Later novels published in October 2009 include Risk Assessment , The Undertaker 's Gift , and Consequences , all set between " Exit Wounds " and Children of Earth . Gwen appears in three Torchwood : Miracle Day prequel novels released in Summer 2011 . In First Born Gwen and Rhys encounter sinister forces in rural Wales whilst adjusting to parenthood and life in hiding . Gwen appears briefly in flashback material in Long Time Dead and The Men Who Sold the World , novels which explore the aftermath of the destruction of Torchwood 's headquarters and the technology left behind . Written by John and Carole Barrowman and published in September 2012 , the novel Exodus Code unites Gwen and Jack in a transatlantic mission following the events of Miracle Day . 
 First published in January 2008 , the monthly Torchwood Magazine included Torchwood comic strips in which Gwen appeared . Gareth David @-@ Lloyd 's comic , " Shrouded " , includes a scene set after Children in Earth , which shows Gwen cradling her young child . As Gwen is busy , Rhys is required to team up with Captain John Hart to save the timeline . During series two , the Torchwood website hosted an interactive online game written by series writer Phil Ford . Eve Myles makes a brief appearance as Gwen towards the end of the game , alongside Gareth David @-@ Lloyd , when her character and Ianto shut down a broadcast from the fictitious Dark Talk studio . Throughout both series one and two , the interactive websites co @-@ written by James Goss featured electronic literature content ( such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters ) which depict aspects of Gwen and the other Torchwood characters ' work and personal lives . The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell — an insider 's look into Torchwood — collects much of this ancillary online literature in hardback form , along with new material , some of which expands on Gwen 's background and life before Torchwood . Details are given of Gwen 's university attendance , a previous boyfriend named Bruce , and her time with Andy in the police force . Photographs are provided of Gwen and Rhys , which were used as set dressing in the TV series , and fictitious in @-@ universe documents such as Gwen 's personnel form and her Torchwood case reports . In a similar vein to The Torchwood Archives , from a real @-@ world perspective , Gary Russell 's The Torchwood Encyclopedia ( 2009 ) expands on " every fact and figure " for Gwen and the Torchwood world .

 Gwen appeared in four original Torchwood audiobooks from BBC Books in 2008 which tied in with the second series of the television drama . The first of these — Hidden and Everyone Says Hello , narrated by Naoko Mori and Burn Gorman respectively — were released in February whilst two further releases — In the Shadows , narrated by Gwen 's portrayer Eve Myles , and The Sin Eaters , narrated by Gareth David @-@ Lloyd — were released in September . Two additional original audiobooks set following the events of the second series — Ghost Train and Department X — were published in March 2011 and narrated by Kai Owen . In Ghost Train Gwen is killed : as Jack is missing Rhys has to work alone to reverse his wife 's fate . Gwen 's investigations after Miracle Day are depicted in 2012 audio books . In Army of One , released in March , written by Ian <unk> and narrated by Kai Owen , Gwen and Rhys are drawn into the investigation of an alien serial killer in Washington DC . In Fallout , released April , written by David Llewellyn and read by Tom Price , Andy has an extraterrestrial investigation of his own in the UK and requires assistance from Gwen by telephone . In May 's release , Red Skies written by Joseph Lidster and narrated by John Telfer , Jack has a premonition that Gwen has been ostensibly shot in the chest . However , in the following installment , Mr Invincible , a brief appearance from Rhys and Gwen reveal that the characters have returned to Wales safely following their time in the United States . 
 Joseph Lidster wrote a Torchwood radio drama , " Lost Souls " , which aired in September 2008 as a Radio 4 Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman , Eve Myles , Gareth David @-@ Lloyd and Freema Agyeman ( Martha ) . Set after the events of the 2008 series , Gwen and the team make their first international adventure in CERN in Geneva , as part of Radio 4 's special celebration of the switching on of the Large Hadron Collider . The special radio episode 's plot focuses both on the Large Hadron Collider 's activation and the doomsday scenario some warned it might cause , and the team 's mourning of Toshiko and Owen 's recent deaths . Between 1 and 3 July 2009 , Radio 4 aired three further audio dramas in the Afternoon Play time @-@ slot , titled " Asylum " , " Golden Age " and " The Dead Line " , bridging the gap between Series 2 and 3 . " The Dead Line " depicts Gwen working together with Rhys to investigate a mysterious case ; she identifies him as a member of Torchwood during the mission . To tie in with the show 's fourth series , Torchwood : Miracle Day , the BBC produced three more radio plays , airing between 11 and 13 July 2011 . Titled " The Devil and Miss Carew " , " Submission " and " House of the Dead " , these plays fill narrative gaps between " Exit Wounds " and Miracle Day and feature the voices of Myles , Barrowman and David @-@ Lloyd .

The third release of the series , Forgotten Lives , co @-@ stars Kai Owen as Rhys and re @-@ introduces the characters four years after the events of Miracle Day . 
 = = Casting and initial characterisation = = 
 Lead writer and executive producer Russell T Davies initially had the idea of an unnamed policewoman stumbling across a team of alien investigators in an alley as a premise , before Torchwood or the 2005 revival of Doctor Who were commissioned . Having been enamoured by her television performances , most notably in the 2005 episode of Doctor Who in which she guest @-@ starred , Davies wrote the character of Gwen specifically for Eve Myles . Myles stated that having the part written for her was like her " own personal Oscar " . Part of the attraction of playing Gwen for Myles was that she had the opportunity to play an action hero with her own accent . Speaking on the casting of Welsh actors on Torchwood , Davies commented that it was deliberately intended , to make the Welsh accent mainstream , " to make it as acceptable as Scottish or Irish " . In an analysis of Welsh mythology in Torchwood , Lynette Porter observes that Gwen 's national consciousness forms part of her characterisation : her knowledge of local myths " highlights her Welsh heritage and common knowledge from her experience and formal education . " Discussing the international co @-@ production behind series four , executive producer Julie Gardner commented that Myles ' continued involvement helped ensure that the " flavour of Wales " remained evident . 
 In the first series of Torchwood , Gwen functioned as an audience surrogate . Russell T Davies likened her character type to that of 2005 – 06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) : " She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal . " Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman , who at the same time embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype . Her distinct role within the team stems from the fact that " she 's there for the people " , who she feels " instinctive and passionate " about . Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more " human empathy " than the more mercenary members of the team , who are seen to be " technology @-@ and @-@ alien @-@ obsessed " . In this vein , lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a " little bit of soul " back to Jack . Describing the ways in which Gwen 's methods differ from the rest of the team , Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job : " she deals with the families , she deals with profiling , she deals with searching people 's backgrounds . It 's a new way of working she brings in " . Myles stated that Gwen would have made a " fantastic policewoman " prior to joining Torchwood , drawing on the character 's ability to get vulnerable characters to " open up by making them feel comfortable " . Myles perceived Gwen to be " the heart and emotion of Torchwood " , and " Torchwood 's social worker " who can " run and fight and stand in her own corner and win " . Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity , Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her , just as she needs them . Gwen 's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one , as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman . Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood , and Myles feels his later appearances " takes you right back to the beginning , it reminds you where she came from , how Jack found Gwen " . Myles observed that Gwen 's many facets prevent her from getting bored ; she feels constantly challenged " physically " , " mentally " and " morally " through portraying the character . 
 Eve Myles previously appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who episode " The Unquiet Dead " as Gwyneth , a 19th @-@ century clairvoyant . Gwyneth had a connection to the Cardiff Rift , which later became a central plot device in Torchwood . In response to questions about the similarity of the characters ' names , Russell T Davies denied they were connected , stating they are " just two names beginning with " G " . " Subsequently however , Davies ' 2008 Doctor Who episode " Journey 's End " alluded to a familial relationship between the characters ( with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was ) , explaining their physical resemblance as the result of " spatial genetic multiplicity " . Eve Myles said of the two characters , " it was never on the cards as such , but something in the back of my head always said that they were going to be connected somehow . " Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal , stating that " It 's not familial as we understand it " instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as " an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift . "

 = = = Morality = = = 
 Despite being promoted as the show 's heart and moral conscience , the flaws in Gwen 's own morality are explored throughout the series ; a press release noted that she is both selfless and selfish . The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper . Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode " <unk> " was deliberately structured in order to make the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life . For Davies , the dalliance is a " human " one , told in an adult manner characterised by " lust and anger and hurt and the joy you get out of the initial stages of having an affair " . Myles commented that Gwen 's compromised morality , as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience , and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were " safe " from temptation . Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen 's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character . Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate , Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a " one @-@ dimensional paragon of virtue " . Instead , the writers made Gwen more " realistic " by giving her " distinct human failings " , which Walker felt made her " arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars " . He identified these failures as her " tendency towards egotism " , " self @-@ righteousness " , and " selfishness " , evident in her " highly questionable treatment " of boyfriend Rhys Williams . Walker cited her affair with Owen as an example , as well as the scene in " Combat " where she confesses this betrayal to Rhys after dosing him with the amnesia drug Retcon so he won 't remember . 
 Linnie Blake felt that Gwen 's had a passive role in her own affair ; as with her lesbian clinch with an alien and her <unk> impregnation ; she argues that the Gothic situations in Torchwood continually parallels in the " invasion " of her sexuality . Valerie Estelle Frankel argued that Gwen finds " the missing side of herself " with her immersion into the world of Torchwood , represented by " affairs and homosexuality and the threat of death " rather than her ordinary domestic life with Rhys . Daniel Rawcliffe noted that Indira Varma 's character Suzie , featured in the premiere episode and in " They Keep Killing Suzie " , is used as a " doppelgänger " for Gwen , ( a trope of Gothic fiction – compare with the terms " Gothic double " and literary foil ) . Suzie 's actions , and parallels with Gwen , help to illuminate some of Gwen 's own ethically ambiguous decisions in the first series . Gwen must constantly fight against Suzie , and Suzie 's example , " if she is to be proved worthy of working alongside Captain Jack " . According to Frankel Gwen 's confrontation with Suzie mirrored her confrontation with her " inner self " ; her literal journey into death gave her " the wisdom and duality of both worlds , life and death , mundane and magical " and allowed her to become stronger . 
 Whilst Lynette Porter thought that Gwen became a " fallen woman " through her affair with Owen , she observed that this made Gwen 's role in relation to Jack in " End of Days " , analogous to that of Mary Magdalene to Jesus , reinforcing a prevalent biblical subtext . Gwen keeps a vigil at Jack 's " Torchwood tomb " and like Magdalene is rewarded for her loyalty by being the first to lay eyes upon the risen saviour . Valerie Frankel surmised that " Gwen 's journey is one we all face [ ... ] she discovers the dominant intuition within , and then embraces it within the darkest caves of her inner self " . David Cornelius stated that Gwen 's Torchwood adventures take her to the brink , and additionally show " she 's strong enough to pull herself back " . Stephen James Walker also felt that Gwen is still a redeemable character because she recognises her own moral failings , as seen in " Combat " where she sits alone sobbing over pizza , before picking herself up and trying to do better in the future . On this track , Torchwood actor Kai Owen justified Gwen 's treatment of Rhys in her darkest moments by arguing that Gwen 's intentions always remained pure , no matter how badly she treated Rhys . 
 Ahead of the fourth series , Russell T Davies acknowledged that the character of Gwen can be both loved and hated by the audience . He stated that as an actress Myles isn 't preoccupied with her character being presented in a sympathetic light , being able " to take that extraordinary deep breath and not care " . io9 's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the TV episode " The Categories of Life " , written by Jane Espenson , exposed the character 's " human vanity " by showing that she has " started to believe her own hype " . In Anders ' eyes , the character is responsible for her father 's second heart attack because of her rash actions . Anders felt that later episodes in the fourth series continued to illuminate flaws in Gwen 's character , describing her as someone with an " addictive personality " who " treats her Torchwood adventures like a drug that she craves " though she knows they " ruin her relationships with her husband and child " . 
 = = = Rhys and Jack = = = 
 Much of Gwen 's characterisation centers on her developing relationship with her partner Rhys . Eve Myles describes the character as Gwen 's " normality base " . The relationship is tested by Gwen 's affair with colleague Owen Harper ( Gorman ) , a betrayal which Myles believes to be " completely out of character " for Gwen , explaining that the guilt experienced over her actions tears her to pieces . The production team had originally planned for Rhys to die in the first series but he was given a reprieve . Producer Richard Stokes explains that Rhys ' presence keeps Gwen from losing her " heart " and that without him " it simply becomes a sci @-@ fi show about sci @-@ fi people , running around and hunting aliens " . Julie Gardner adds that in the discussion , the writers had felt they could not have written Gwen as ever recovering from Rhys ' loss , and so chose not to kill off the character . In his analysis of Gwen , Daniel Rawcliffe opines that Rhys helps to keep her mental health intact , and argues that his presence prevents her from undergoing the same psychological deterioration as Suzie . 
 Despite her ongoing relationship with Rhys , the series explores possibilities of a romantic connection between Gwen and her boss Jack . In a 2007 interview , Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a " palpable love " and stated that " it 's the real thing and they 're going to make you wait for that . " AfterElton 's Locksley Hall interprets Jack 's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by " her warmth , her sense of justice , her very ordinariness and lack of glamour " , whilst Myles states of Gwen 's interest in Jack that " the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him " . Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode " Ghost Machine " as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement . Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and " fights every day to be with [ Rhys ] " even though Jack remains " a huge temptation " . Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme ; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between " Rhys , the sweet , kind handsome prince , and Jack , the compelling trickster " . She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of " steady prince " for Gwen . John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her " he 'd have to commit completely " ; this is why he does not act on his feelings , because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people , he could " never afford to do anything more " . 
 Stephen James Walker feels that Gwen 's decision not to wipe Rhys ' memory a second time in the episode " Meat " marks the end of any potential relationship between Gwen and Jack . As Davies felt it was essential that Rhys became enlightened to Gwen 's true occupation , the episode " Meat " focused on Rhys discovering and coming to terms with Torchwood . Richard Edwards of SFX magazine comments that this development allows their relationship to become the most convincing on the show and makes it clear why Gwen would want to marry him . Ben Rawson @-@ Jones of Digital Spy comments that overall , the relationship serves to create " a nice contrast with the fantastical elements of the show " ; whilst Jason Hughes opines that their marriage is " handled in a painfully honest way " and serves as " a true definition of ' love ' written with subtlety and perfection " . When asked about her character 's complex relationship with both Jack and Rhys , Myles explains that Gwen wouldn 't be as much of a " strong character " without her ordinary life with Rhys . Davies felt that the relationship furthered the shows exploration of human sexuality stating that " open sexuality has to include everything " including " a husband / wife great big crime @-@ fighting team ... happily in love " . 
 In 2009 Myles stated that to have Jack and Gwen act on their feelings would be " like feeding the baby when it 's not hungry " . Reinforcing this view , Julie Gardner feels the love between Gwen and Jack to be self @-@ evident and that it did not need to be spoken . Lynette Porter argues that Gwen 's apotheosis of Jack causes him to flee Earth , as hero is a role he cannot play because he feels responsible for the deaths of those he loved . A press release ahead of the 2011 series stated that though Gwen retreats to a rural idyll with her family , she still retains feelings for Jack and misses the exciting life she once led alongside him . Ahead of the fourth series Myles explains that Gwen and Jack 's relationship is a " love @-@ hate @-@ love relationship " , which she believes to be reminiscent of , concurrently , a sibling relationship , a husband and wife relationship and " the best friendship known to mankind " . Myles feels that Gwen is not complete without Jack and that they are like " two missing parts of a jigsaw " and because the relationship works on so many different levels it cannot be labelled . Episode seven of Miracle Day features a scene where Gwen states that she would have Jack killed to save her daughter . Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters ' differing needs means that they inevitably " clash like steel blades " .

 Original lead writer Chris Chibnall feels Gwen develops into a stronger character between series one and series two , becoming less " wide @-@ eyed " over events happening around her . Frankel writes that " she is a whole woman now , integrated with all the parts of herself " . In the second series , Eve Myles states , Gwen now " knows where her feet are " . Costume Designer Ray Holman explains that these developments are reflected in how the production team dresses the character . In the first series Gwen is dressed in a " faded high street look " and keeps away from leather clothing . As she becomes more confident in her new vocation , her clothes becomes " a lot more designer and heroic looking " . In the second series she wears more leather from brands such as Diesel and G @-@ star which Holman describes as " sexy " and " practical " . The overall effect is that Gwen 's leathers " toughen her up a bit , but keep her stylish at the same time " . For fourth series Miracle Day , costume designer Shawna Trpcic declared her intention to take Eve Myles " out of the nunnery " . Myles recalled vetoing a brassiere she was asked to wear because she felt it to be unnecessarily sexualised and impractical for action sequences . She added that she views Gwen as " a real woman " and " not about tits and arse " . 
 Children of Earth director Euros Lyn remarks that by the third series Gwen has grown so that " she now is on a par with Jack , in terms of having the knowledge and the experience to make decisions and to be a heroine " . Daniel Martin of The Guardian opines that her characterisation in the serial " shows just how far she 's come " , whilst Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times feels that she is a " soulful leather @-@ jacketed action heroine " . Myles states that Gwen becomes a harsher character , but she feels that , " if she wasn 't , people would die " . David Cornelius observes that Gwen is no longer the kind @-@ hearted outsider she was when she first joined Torchwood . By Children of Earth she has become " colder and much more aggressive " . Her horrific experiences turn her into " a biting cynic " ; when both government and army betray the British people , Gwen claims to understand finally why the Doctor does not save humanity from world crises . She believes he " must look at this planet and turn away in shame " . A press release stated that Miracle Day had Gwen " make the most terrible decisions , on behalf of all mankind " . This is evident in " The Blood Line " , where her character is shown to be willing to sacrifice the entire Torchwood team , in addition to her dying father , for the good of the world . Commenting on Gwen 's characterisation in this episode , Dan Martin notes that " Gwen sees transition into the Earth Mothering Tank Girl become complete , as she plays God and appears to love it . " 
 Press releases describe Gwen in light of contradictions between her heroic and conventionally feminine roles in the series ; despite becoming a " tough , ruthless warrior , who loves the thrill of the fight " Gwen remains a " funny , salty , earthy woman who loves home and family " . Children of Earth sees Gwen become pregnant by husband Rhys ; a storyline which IGN writer Asham Haque thought provided " one of the few hope @-@ giving threads " in the serial . She gives birth to a baby girl , Anwen , between the third and fourth series . Both Eve Myles and creator Russell T Davies have described this plot development as emblematic of a contradiction at the heart of Gwen 's character . Myles , believing that motherhood gives Gwen a greater sense of responsibility , says it makes Gwen " even more human , and yet even more of a wonder woman " . Whilst talking about the show 's fourth series , Davies suggested that it would be " irresistible " to use the image of " Gwen Cooper with baby in one arm and gun in the other " as promotion . The production team have continued to emphasise this contradictory aspect to Gwen 's character , which has proved popular with critics and viewers . For example , a promotional clip for Miracle Day features Gwen firing from her gun in one hand while protectively holding her baby in the other . Zap2it 's Mikey O 'Connell praised this as one of the trailer 's best aspects , praising Gwen as " the coolest mum ever . " Reviewing the opening episodes of Miracle Day Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times identified " the dark humor " of the sequence as representative of " the top notes of the British Torchwood " . The Daily Telegraph 's Catherine Gee praised the dichotomy between the character 's two roles , stating that " Eve Myles 's homely yet badass agent is incredibly charming " . 
 Critics have drawn comparisons with famous screen action heroines such as Ellen Ripley , portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien trilogy . Ripley is seen as a ground @-@ breaking depiction of a heroine , whose heroism is neither derived from male support nor hampered by femininity . Rawcliffe writes that Gwen 's strength of character makes her a " half Ripley " , insofar as she possesses all of Ripley 's strength , and yet " is hampered by her reliance on the male characters of Jack , Rhys and Owen " . Gwen has been compared , at least superficially , to Buffy Summers , as portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar . Reflecting on a scene from Miracle Day , one critic comments that Gwen is " channeling Season Two Buffy the Vampire Slayer " when she shoots at a helicopter from her bazooka ( recalling the sequence depicted in Buffy episode " Innocence " ) . Gwen has attracted implicit comparisons with Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider video game and film franchise . Commenting on the first episode of Torchwood : Miracle Day Den of Geek 's Simon Brew states that " whoever Hollywood producers cast in the planned reboot of the Tomb Raider movie franchise , I 'm fully confident that Myles could kick their ass . Twice . Before breakfast . " While critical of the typical portrayal of British female science fiction characters , The Guardian 's <unk> Nellis singles out Gwen and Doctor Who 's River Song ( Alex Kingston ) as positive depictions of strong female characters , stating , " It 'd be difficult to find two <unk> in less need of a man to save them . "

 Eve Myles has enjoyed an increased profile since being cast as Gwen Cooper in Torchwood and is now considered one of Wales ' greatest drama exports . On casting her , Russell T Davies described Myles as " Wales best kept secret , " and the actress has been described as a " Welsh icon " since appearing in Torchwood , with the Western Mail listing Myles ' turn as " Torchwood 's feisty female lead " as a contributing factor in making her one of Wales ' sexiest women , as well as a national institution . In an analysis of Welsh representation in television , Geraint <unk> Davies cited Myles ' role in Torchwood , coupled with the popularity of sitcom Gavin and Stacey , as combating prejudice against the Welsh accent . Backing up this claim , Samantha Bennet of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette describes Myles ' " silvery , flowing " accent as " exotic " and Myles herself as a bona fide star . Shortly after Torchwood 's premiere , Conservative MP Michael Gove described Gwen Cooper as a " Celtic <unk> " and an example of Welsh sensuality , while in 2006 , Wales on Sunday named Myles as its " Bachelorette of the Year " . In July 2011 , The Scotsman 's Aidan Smith described Gwen Cooper as " the sexiest woman in Wales " . 
 The Guardian 's " Organ Grinder " reviewer was full of praise for Myles ' performance in " Everything Changes " , expressing the opinion that , through her portrayal of Gwen Cooper , she managed to outshine Captain Jack . The character was described by The Stage as " the solid , down to earth character needed to anchor Torchwood to the real world " whilst functioning well as a foil to Captain Jack . Some reviews mocked the prosaic characterisation . Verity <unk> , a technology columnist for online newspaper The Register , wrote a parody of Torchwood called Under Torch Wood ( in the style of Dylan Thomas ' Under Milk Wood ) . The piece mocks Gwen 's role as " the viewer proxy " describing her as " <unk> pop @-@ eyed " and her boyfriend Rhys as ' Barry Backstory ' . Jan Ravens played a parody version of Gwen in the impressionist television series Dead Ringers , in which she displays a badge labelling her with what Jon Culshaw 's Captain Jack describes as her sole characteristic : Welsh . In November 2006 Jim Shelley from The Mirror stated Gwen to be " neither as interesting nor as sexy as she should be . " A plot development that saw Gwen respond to the advances of an alien sex @-@ gas in another woman 's body was <unk> by Karman Kregloe of AfterEllen as characterising " nearly every negative lesbian stereotype imaginable " . Kregloe considers Gwen 's inability to satiate the alien as a " play on a traditional , sexist social construct " , and the fact that Gwen never again mentions this experience is also criticised . 
 The more assertive Gwen in Torchwood 's third series attracted praise from reviewers : Paul Collins of Total Sci @-@ Fi expressed the opinion that Children of Earth finally shows Gwen 's heroic characteristics in a way that had been missing in the first two series , while Daniel Martin from the Guardian stated that " it 's great to see Gwen being so completely badass " . David Cornelius wrote that Gwen succeeds as a strongly written female character that does not pander to stereotypes because writers avoid defining her by any aspect of her adventures . Reviewers commented on Myles ' standing as a leading lady : Comic Book Resources ' Remy <unk> describes Gwen as " the true heart of Torchwood " , while Scott Lewinski from Wired magazine described Myles ' portrayal as the conscience of the Torchwood team , and the show itself . Total Sci @-@ Fi 's Jonathan Wilkins felt that the five part serial marked the emergence of Eve Myles as a star in her own right and opined that she could potentially carry the show without co @-@ star Barrowman . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune stated her belief that the third series ' climax showed that Eve Myles has " grown into the role " of Gwen , describing her performance as " outstanding " . Ryan later gave an " Honourable Mention " to Gwen when discussing Sci @-@ Fi TV 's Most Memorable Female Characters , making her the only Doctor Who franchise character to receive a mention . Critical response to the character remained positive in the fourth series . Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph felt Myles " took the acting honours with a bravura performance " , whilst Charlie Jane Anders stated Gwen to have the strongest moments in the finale which led to " a new appreciation for her character " . 
 Eve Myles won the 2007 Bafta Cymru Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Gwen Cooper , winning over the parent series ' actress Billie Piper . She was nominated again for the award in 2008 , and again in 2010 . In 2010 Myles won the ' Best Actress " award in the SFX Reader 's Awards poll , and was crowned best actress in the 11th annual Airlock Alpha Portal Awards . For her role as Gwen Cooper in Torchwood : Miracle Day Myles was nominated for a Satellite Award in the Best Television Actress category , and reached the shortlist for the 2012 UK National Television Awards . She has also received a nomination for Best Actress In Television at the 38th Saturn Awards , held in June 2012 . Action figures of Gwen have been created in her likeness , which Myles ' describes as " bizarre and wonderful " and at the same time " really kind of strange " . In a reader 's awards poll in the sixth issue of Torchwood Magazine , Gwen was voted second favourite Torchwood character behind Captain Jack , a ranking she received in a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live interview with writer John Fay . Myles , describing her experiences at various science @-@ fiction conventions , has praised the fan response as " incredible " and " just extraordinary " . Some fans have taken to blacking out their teeth at conventions to mimic her gap toothed appearance , which Myles finds particularly flattering . 
 = Adriatic Sea = 
 The Adriatic Sea / <unk> / is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges . The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea , extending from the Strait of Otranto ( where it connects to the Ionian Sea ) to the northwest and the Po Valley . The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Italy , Croatia , Albania , Montenegro , Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , and Slovenia . The Adriatic contains over 1 @,@ 300 islands , mostly located along its eastern , Croatian , coast . It is divided into three basins , the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest , with a maximum depth of 1 @,@ 233 metres ( 4 @,@ 045 ft ) . The Otranto Sill , an underwater ridge , is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas . The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto , along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western ( Italian ) coast . Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight , although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally . The Adriatic 's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean 's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean , acting as a dilution basin . The surface water temperatures generally range from 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) in summer to 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) in winter , significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin 's climate . 
 The Adriatic Sea sits on the Apulian or Adriatic <unk> , which separated from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era . The plate 's movement contributed to the formation of the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate . In the Late Oligocene , the Apennine Peninsula first formed , separating the Adriatic Basin from the rest of the Mediterranean . All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic , with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast . The western coast is alluvial or terraced , while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification . There are dozens of marine protected areas in the Adriatic , designed to protect the sea 's karst habitats and biodiversity . The sea is abundant in flora and fauna — more than 7 @,@ 000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic , many of them endemic , rare and threatened ones . 
 The Adriatic 's shores are populated by more than 3 @.@ 5 million people ; the largest cities are Bari , Venice , Trieste and Split . The earliest settlements on the Adriatic shores were Etruscan , Illyrian , and Greek . By the 2nd century BC , the shores were under Rome 's control . In the Middle Ages , the Adriatic shores and the sea itself were controlled , to a varying extent , by a series of states — most notably the Byzantine Empire , the Serbian Empire , the Republic of Venice , the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire . The Napoleonic Wars resulted in the First French Empire gaining coastal control and the British effort to counter the French in the area , ultimately securing most of the eastern Adriatic shore and the Po Valley for Austria . Following Italian unification , the Kingdom of Italy started an eastward expansion that lasted until the 20th century . Following World War I and the collapse of Austria @-@ Hungary and the Ottoman Empire , the eastern coast 's control passed to Yugoslavia and Albania . The former disintegrated during the 1990s , resulting in four new states on the Adriatic coast . Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on their maritime boundaries by 1975 and this boundary is recognised by Yugoslavia 's successor states , but the maritime boundaries between Slovenian , Croatian , Bosnian – Herzegovinian and Montenegrin waters are still disputed . Italy and Albania agreed on their maritime boundary in 1992 . 
 Fisheries and tourism are significant sources of income all along the Adriatic coast . Adriatic Croatia 's tourism industry has grown faster economically than the rest of the Adriatic Basin 's . Maritime transport is also a significant branch of the area 's economy — there are 19 seaports in the Adriatic that each handle more than a million tonnes of cargo per year . The largest Adriatic seaport by annual cargo turnover is the Port of Trieste , while the Port of Split is the largest Adriatic seaport by passengers served per year . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Adriatic Sea is a semi @-@ enclosed sea , bordered in the southwest by the Apennine or Italian Peninsula , in the northwest by the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli @-@ Venezia Giulia , and in the northeast by Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , Montenegro , and Albania — the Balkan peninsula . In the southeast , the Adriatic Sea connects to the Ionian Sea at the 72 @-@ kilometre ( 45 mi ) wide Strait of Otranto . The International Hydrographic Organization ( IHO ) defines the boundary between the Adriatic and the Ionian seas as a line running from the <unk> River 's mouth ( latitude 39 ° <unk> ) in Albania to the <unk> Cape in Corfu , through this island to the <unk> Cape ( these two capes are in latitude 39 ° <unk> ) , and on to the Santa Maria di Leuca Cape ( latitude 39 ° <unk> ) . It extends 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) from the northwest to the southeast and is 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) wide . It covers 138 @,@ 600 square kilometres ( 53 @,@ 500 sq mi ) and has a volume of 35 @,@ 000 cubic kilometres ( 8 @,@ 400 cu mi ) . The Adriatic extends northwest from 40 ° to 45 ° 47 ' north , representing the Mediterranean 's northernmost portion . The sea is geographically divided into the Northern Adriatic , Central ( or Middle ) Adriatic , and Southern Adriatic . The Adriatic Sea drainage basin encompasses 235 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 91 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , yielding a land – sea ratio of 1 @.@ 8 . The drainage basin 's mean elevation is 782 metres ( 2 @,@ 566 ft ) above sea level , with a mean slope of 12 @.@ 1 ° . Major rivers discharging into the Adriatic include the Po , Soča , Krka , Neretva , Drin , Bojana , and <unk> . In the late 19th century , Austria @-@ Hungary established a geodetic network with an elevation benchmark using the average Adriatic Sea level at the Sartorio pier in Trieste , Italy . The benchmark was subsequently retained by Austria , adopted by Yugoslavia , and retained by the states that emerged after its dissolution . 
 The Adriatic Sea contains more than 1300 islands and islets , most along the Adriatic 's eastern coast — especially in Croatia , with 1 @,@ 246 counted . The number includes islands , islets , and rocks of all sizes , including ones emerging at ebb tide only . The Croatian islands include the largest — Cres and Krk , each covering about the same area of 405 @.@ 78 square kilometres ( 156 @.@ 67 sq mi ) — and the tallest — Brač , whose peak reaches 780 metres ( 2 @,@ 560 ft ) above sea level . The islands of Cres and the adjacent Lošinj are separated only by a narrow navigable canal dug in the time of classical antiquity ; the original single island was known to the Greeks as <unk> . The Croatian islands include 47 permanently inhabited ones , the most populous among them being Krk , Korčula and Brač . The islands along the Adriatic 's western ( Italian ) coast are smaller and less numerous than those along the opposite coast ; the best @-@ known ones are the 117 islands on which the city of Venice is built . The northern shore of the Greek island of Corfu also lies in the Adriatic Sea as defined by the IHO . The IHO boundary places a few smaller Greek islands ( ones northwest of Corfu ) in the Adriatic Sea . 
 = = = Bathymetry = = = 
 The Adriatic Sea 's average depth is 259 @.@ 5 metres ( 851 ft ) , and its maximum depth is 1 @,@ 233 metres ( 4 @,@ 045 ft ) ; however , the North Adriatic basin rarely exceeds a depth of 100 metres ( 330 ft ) . The North Adriatic basin , extending between Venice and Trieste towards a line connecting Ancona and Zadar , is only 15 metres ( 49 ft ) deep at its northwestern end ; it gradually deepens towards the southeast . It is the largest Mediterranean shelf and is simultaneously a dilution basin and a site of bottom water formation . The Middle Adriatic basin is south of the Ancona – Zadar line , with the 270 @-@ metre ( 890 ft ) deep Middle Adriatic Pit ( also called the Pomo Depression or the Jabuka Pit ) . The 170 @-@ metre ( 560 ft ) deep Palagruža Sill is south of the Middle Adriatic Pit , separating it from the 1 @,@ 200 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) deep South Adriatic Pit and the Middle Adriatic basin from the South Adriatic Basin . Further on to the south , the sea floor rises to 780 metres ( 2 @,@ 560 ft ) to form the Otranto Sill at the boundary to the Ionian Sea . The South Adriatic Basin is similar in many respects to the Northern Ionian Sea , to which it is connected . <unk> , the Adriatic Sea is also asymmetric : the Apennine peninsular coast is relatively smooth with very few islands and the Monte <unk> and Gargano promontories as the only significant protrusions into the sea ; in contrast , the Balkan peninsular coast is rugged with numerous islands , especially in Croatia . The coast 's ruggedness is exacerbated by the Dinaric Alps ' proximity to the coast , in contrast to the opposite ( Italian ) coast where the Apennine Mountains are further away from the shoreline . 
 = = = Hydrology = = = 
 The coastal water dynamics are determined by the asymmetric coasts and the Mediterranean seawater 's inflow through the Straits of Otranto and further on along the eastern coast . The smooth Italian coast ( with very few protrusions and no major islands ) allows the Western Adriatic Current 's smooth flow , which is composed of the surface 's relatively freshwater mass and the bottom 's cold and dense water mass . The coastal currents on the opposite shore are far more complex , due to the jagged shoreline , several large islands and the Dinaric Alps ' proximity to the shore . The last produces significant temperature variations between the sea and the hinterland , which leads to the creation of local jets . The tidal movement is normally slight , usually remaining below 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) . The <unk> point is at the mid @-@ width east of Ancona . 
 The normal tide levels are known to increase significantly in a conducive environment , leading to coastal flooding ; this phenomenon is most famously known in Italy — especially Venice — as <unk> <unk> . Such tides can exceed normal levels by more than 140 centimetres ( 55 in ) , with the highest tide level of 194 centimetres ( 76 in ) observed on 4 November 1966 . Such flooding is caused by a combination of factors , including the alignment of the Sun and Moon , meteorological factors such as sirocco related storm surges , and the basin 's geometric shape ( which amplifies or reduces the astronomical component ) . Moreover , the Adriatic 's long and narrow rectangular shape is the source of an oscillating water motion ( French : seiche ) along the basin 's minor axis . Finally , Venice is increasingly vulnerable to flooding due to coastal area soil subsidence . Such unusually high tides resulting in flooding have also been observed elsewhere in the Adriatic Sea , and have been recorded in recent years in the towns of Koper , Zadar and Šibenik as well . 
 It is estimated that the Adriatic 's entire volume is exchanged through the Strait of Otranto in 3 @.@ 4 ± 0 @.@ 4 years , a comparably short period . ( For instance , approximately 500 years are necessary to exchange all the Black Sea 's water . ) This short period is particularly important as the rivers flowing into the Adriatic discharge up to 5 @,@ 700 cubic metres per second ( 200 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ) . This rate of discharge amounts to 0 @.@ 5 % of the total Adriatic Sea volume , or a 1 @.@ 3 @-@ metre ( 4 ft 3 in ) layer of water each year . The greatest portion of the discharge from any single river comes from the Po ( 28 % ) , with an average discharge from it alone of 1 @,@ 569 cubic metres per second ( 55 @,@ 400 cu ft / s ) . In terms of the annual total discharge into the entire Mediterranean Sea , the Po is ranked second , followed by the Neretva and Drin , which rank as third and fourth . Another significant contributor of freshwater to the Adriatic is the submarine groundwater discharge through submarine springs ( Croatian : <unk> ) ; it is estimated to comprise 29 % of the total water flux into the Adriatic . The submarine springs include thermal springs , discovered offshore near the town of Izola . The thermal <unk> is rich with hydrogen sulfide , has a temperature of 22 to 29 @.@ 6 ° C ( 71 @.@ 6 to 85 @.@ 3 ° F ) , and has enabled the development of specific ecosystems . The inflow of freshwater , representing a third of the freshwater volume flowing into the Mediterranean , makes the Adriatic a dilution basin for the Mediterranean Sea . The Middle and South Adriatic <unk> ( SAG ) , are significant cyclonic circulation features , with the former being intermittent and the latter permanent . The SAG measures 150 kilometres ( 93 miles ) in diameter . It contributes to the flow of bottom water from the Adriatic to the Levantine Basin through the Ionian Sea . Through that process , the Adriatic Sea produces most of the East Mediterranean deep water . 
 = = = Temperature and salinity = = = 
 The Adriatic 's surface temperature usually ranges from 22 to 30 ° C ( 72 to 86 ° F ) in the summer , or 12 to 14 ° C ( 54 to 57 ° F ) in the winter , except along the western Adriatic coast 's northern part , where it drops to 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) in the winter . The distinct seasonal temperature variations , with a longitudinal gradient in the Northern and transversal gradient in the Middle and Southern Adriatic , are attributed to the continental characteristics of the Adriatic Sea : it is shallower and closer to land than are oceans . During particularly cold winters , sea ice may appear in the Adriatic 's shallow coastal areas , especially in the Venetian Lagoon but also in isolated shallows as far south as <unk> ( south of Zadar ) . The Southern Adriatic is about 8 to 10 ° C ( 14 to 18 ° F ) warmer during the winter than the more northerly regions . The Adriatic 's salinity variation over the year is likewise distinct : it ranges between 38 and 39 <unk> . The southern Adriatic is subjected to saltier water from the Levantine Basin . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 According to the Köppen climate classification , the upper half of the Adriatic is classified as humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) , with wetter summers and colder and drier winters , and the southern Adriatic are classified as hot @-@ summer Mediterranean climate ( Csa ) . The air temperature can fluctuate by about 20 ° C ( 36 ° F ) during a season . 
 The predominant winter winds are the bora and sirocco ( called <unk> along the eastern coast ) . The bora is significantly conditioned by wind gaps in the Dinaric Alps bringing cold and dry continental air ; it reaches peak speeds in the areas of Trieste , Senj , and Split , with gusts of up to 180 kilometres per hour ( 97 kn ; 110 mph ) . The sirocco brings humid and warm air , often carrying Saharan sand causing rain dust . 
 = = = Population = = = 
 On the Adriatic Sea 's coasts and islands , there are numerous small settlements , and a number of larger cities . Among the largest are Bari , Venice , Trieste , and Rimini in Italy , Split , Rijeka and Zadar in Croatia , Durrës and Vlorë in Albania and Koper in Slovenia . In total , more than 3 @.@ 5 million people live on the Adriatic coasts . There are also some larger cities that are located very near the coast , such as the Italian cities of Ravenna and Lecce . 
 = = Coastal management = = 
 Venice , which was originally built on islands off the coast , is most at risk due to subsidence , but the threat is present in the Po delta as well . The causes are a decrease in sedimentation rate due to loss of sediment behind dams , the deliberate excavation of sand for industrial purposes , agricultural use of water , and removal of ground water . 
 The sinking of Venice slowed after artesian wells were banned in the 1960s , but the city remains threatened by the <unk> <unk> floods . Recent studies have suggested that the city is no longer sinking , but a state of alert remains in place . In May 2003 , then @-@ Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi inaugurated the <unk> project ( Italian : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , an experimental model for evaluating the performance of inflatable gates . The project proposes laying a series of 79 inflatable pontoons across the sea bed at the three entrances to the Venetian Lagoon . When tides are predicted to rise above 110 centimetres ( 43 in ) , the pontoons will be filled with air and block the incoming water from the Adriatic Sea . This engineering work is due to be completed by 2014 . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Geophysical and geological information indicate that the Adriatic Sea and the Po Valley are associated with a tectonic microplate — identified as the Apulian or Adriatic Plate — that separated from the African Plate during the Mesozoic era . This separation began in the Middle and Late Triassic , when limestone began to be deposited in the area . Between the Norian and Late Cretaceous , the Adriatic and Apulia Carbonate Platforms formed as a thick series of carbonate sediments ( dolomites and limestones ) , up to 8 @,@ 000 metres ( 26 @,@ 000 ft ) deep . Remnants of the former are found in the Adriatic Sea , as well as in the southern Alps and the Dinaric Alps , and remnants of the latter are seen as the Gargano Promontory and the <unk> mountain . In the Eocene and early Oligocene , the plate moved north and north @-@ east , contributing to the Alpine orogeny ( along with the African and Eurasian Plates ' movements ) via the tectonic uplift of the Dinarides and Alps . In the Late Oligocene , the motion was reversed and the Apennine Mountains ' orogeny took place . An unbroken zone of increased seismic activity borders the Adriatic Sea , with a belt of thrust faults generally oriented in the northeast – southwest direction on the east coast and the northeast – southwest normal faults in the Apennines , indicating an Adriatic counterclockwise rotation . An active 200 @-@ kilometre ( 120 mi ) fault has been identified to the northwest of Dubrovnik , adding to the Dalmatian islands as the Eurasian Plate slides over the Adriatic microplate . Furthermore , the fault causes the Apennine peninsula 's southern tip to move towards the opposite shore by about 0 @.@ 4 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) per year . If this movement continues , the seafloor will be completely consumed and the Adriatic Sea closed off in 50 – 70 million years . In the Northern Adriatic , the coast of the Gulf of Trieste and western Istria is gradually subsiding , having sunk about 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) in the past two thousand years . In the Middle Adriatic Basin , there is evidence of Permian volcanism in the area of <unk> on the island of Vis and the volcanic islands of Jabuka and <unk> . Earthquakes have been observed in the region since the earliest historical records . A recent strong earthquake in the region was the 1979 Montenegro earthquake , measuring 7 @.@ 0 on the Richter scale . Historical earthquakes in the area include the 1627 Gargano peninsula and the 1667 Dubrovnik earthquakes , both followed by strong tsunamis . In the last 600 years , fifteen tsunamis have occurred in the Adriatic Sea . 
 = = = Seafloor sediment = = = 
 All types of seafloor sediments are found in the Adriatic Sea . The Northern Adriatic 's comparatively shallow seabed is characterised by relict sand ( from times when the water level was lower and the area was a sandy beach ) , while a muddy bed is typical at depths below 100 metres ( 330 ft ) . There are five geomorphological units in the Adriatic : the Northern Adriatic ( up to 100 metres ( 330 ft ) deep ) ; the North Adriatic islands area protected against sediments filling it in by outer islands ( pre @-@ Holocene karst relief ) ; the Middle Adriatic islands area ( large Dalmatian islands ) ; the Middle Adriatic ( characterized by the Middle Adriatic Depression ) ; and the Southern Adriatic consisting of a coastal shelf and the Southern Adriatic Depression . Sediments deposited in the Adriatic Sea today generally come from the northwest coast , being carried by the Po , Reno , Adige , <unk> , Tagliamento , Piave and Soča rivers . The volume of sediments carried from the eastern shore by the Rječina , Zrmanja , Krka , Cetina , Ombla , Dragonja , Mirna , <unk> and Neretva rivers is negligible , because these sediments are mostly deposited at the river mouths . The Adriatic 's western shores are largely either alluvial or terraced , whereas the eastern shores are predominantly rocky , except for the southernmost part of the shore located in Albania that consists of sandy coves and rocky capes . 
 = = = Coasts = = = 
 The eastern Adriatic shore 's Croatian part is the most indented Mediterranean coastline . Most of the eastern coast is characterised by a karst topography , developed from the Adriatic Carbonate Platform 's exposure to weathering . Karstification there largely began after the Dinarides ' final uplift in the Oligocene and the Miocene , when carbonate deposits were exposed to atmospheric effects ; this extended to the level of 120 metres ( 390 ft ) below the present sea level , exposed during the Last Glacial Maximum . It is estimated that some karst formations are from earlier sea level drops , most notably the Messinian salinity crisis . Similarly , karst developed in Apulia from the Apulian Carbonate Platform . 
 The largest part of the eastern coast consists of carbonate rocks , while flysch ( a particular type of sedimentary rock ) is significantly represented in the Gulf of Trieste coast , especially along Slovenia 's coast where the 80 @-@ metre ( 260 ft ) Strunjan cliff — the highest cliff on the entire Adriatic and the only one of its type on the eastern Adriatic coast — is located , on the Kvarner Gulf coast opposite Krk , and in Dalmatia north of Split . Rocks of the same type are found in Albania and on the western Adriatic coast . 
 There are alternations of maritime and alluvial sediments occurring in the Po Valley , at the Adriatic 's north @-@ west coast , and as far west as Piacenza , dating to the Pleistocene as the sea advanced and receded over the valley . An advance began after the Last Glacial Maximum , which brought the Adriatic to a high point at about 5 @,@ 500 years ago . Since then , the Po delta has been prograding ( expanding / extending ) . The rate of coastal zone <unk> between 1000 BC and 1200 AD was 4 metres ( 13 ft ) per year . In the 12th century , the delta advanced at a rate of 25 metres ( 82 ft ) per year . In the 17th century , the delta began to become a human @-@ controlled environment , as the excavation of artificial channels started ; the channels and new distributaries of the Po have been prograding at rates of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) per year or more since then . There are more than 20 other rivers flowing into the Adriatic Sea in Italy alone , also forming alluvial coastlines , including the lagoons of Venice , Grado and <unk> . There are smaller eastern Adriatic alluvial coasts — in the deltas of the Dragonja , Bojana and Neretva rivers . 
 = = Biogeography and ecology = = 
 The Adriatic Sea is a unique water body in respect of its overall biogeochemical physiognomy . It exports inorganic nutrients and imports particulate organic carbon and nitrogen through the Strait of Otranto — acting as a mineralization site . The exchange of the substances is made more complex by bathymetry of the Adriatic Sea — 75 % of water flowing north through the strait <unk> at the Palagruža Sill and North Adriatic adds no more than 3 – 4 % of water to the South Adriatic . This is reflected in its biogeography and ecology , and particularly in the composition and properties of its ecosystems . Its main biogeographic units are the Northern Adriatic , the Central Adriatic , and the Southern Adriatic . 
 = = = Flora and fauna = = = 
 The unique nature of the Adriatic gives rise to an abundance of endemic flora and fauna . The Croatian National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan identified more than 7 @,@ 000 animal and plant species in the Adriatic Sea . The Central Adriatic is especially abundant in endemic plant species , with 535 identified species of green , brown and red algae . Four out of five Mediterranean seagrass species are found in the Adriatic Sea . The most common species are <unk> nodosa and Zostera <unk> , while Zostera marina and Posidonia oceanica are comparably rare . 
 A number of rare and threatened species are also found along the Adriatic 's eastern coast ; it is relatively clearer and less polluted than the western Adriatic coast — in part because the sea currents flow through the Adriatic in a counterclockwise direction , thus bringing clearer waters up the eastern coast and returning increasingly polluted water down the western coast . This circulation has significantly contributed to the biodiversity of the countries along the eastern Adriatic coast ; the common bottlenose dolphin is frequent in the eastern coast 's waters only , and the Croatian coast provides refuge for the critically endangered monk seal and sea turtles . Recent studies revealed that cetaceans and other marine <unk> , that were once thought to be vagrants to Adriatic Sea , migrate and live in the semi @-@ closed sea on larger scales . Largest of these live normally is the fin whale , and sperm whale , the largest of toothed whales also migrate but less common than fin whales , followed by Cuvier 's beaked whales . Basking sharks and manta rays are some of migrant species to the sea . 
 The Northern Adriatic in particular is rich in endemic fish fauna . Around thirty species of fish are found in only one or two countries bordering the Adriatic Sea . These are particularly due to or dependent upon the karst morphology of the coastal or submarine topography ; this includes inhabiting subterranean habitats , karst rivers , and areas around freshwater springs . There are 45 known subspecies endemic to the Adriatic 's coasts and islands . In the Adriatic , there are at least 410 species and subspecies of fish , representing approximately 70 % of Mediterranean taxa , with at least 7 species endemic to the Adriatic . Sixty @-@ four known species are threatened with extinction , largely because of overfishing . Only a small fraction of the fish found in the Adriatic are attributed to recent processes such as Lessepsian migration , and escape from mariculture . 
 = = = Protected areas = = = 
 The biodiversity of the Adriatic is relatively high , and several marine protected areas have been established by countries along its coasts . In Italy , these are Miramare in the Gulf of Trieste ( in the Northern Adriatic ) , Torre del <unk> and Isole Tremiti in the Middle Adriatic basin and Torre Guaceto in southern Apulia . The Miramare protected area was established in 1986 and covers 30 hectares ( 74 acres ) of coast and 90 hectares ( 220 acres ) of sea . The area encompasses 1 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) of coastline near the Miramare promontory in the Gulf of Trieste . The Torre del <unk> protected area was created in 2009 , extending 3 nautical miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ; 3 @.@ 5 mi ) into the sea and along 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) of coastline . Various zones of the protected area cover 37 square kilometres ( 14 sq mi ) of sea surface . The Isole Tremiti reserve has been protected since 1989 , while the Tremiti islands themselves are part of the Gargano National Park . The Torre Guaceto protected area , located near Brindisi and <unk> , covers a sea surface of 2 @,@ 227 hectares ( 5 @,@ 500 acres ) and is adjacent to the Torre Guaceto State Reserve covering 1 @,@ 114 hectares ( 2 @,@ 750 acres ) of coast and sharing an 8 @-@ kilometre ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) coastline with the marine protected area . Furthermore , there are 10 internationally important ( Ramsar ) wetland reserves in Italy located along the Adriatic coast . 
 There are seven marine protected areas in Croatia : Brijuni and the Lim Canal off the Istria peninsula 's coast , near Pula and Rovinj respectively ; Kornati and Telašćica in the Middle Adriatic basin , near Zadar ; and Lastovo , Bay of Mali Ston ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> ) and Mljet in southern Dalmatia . The Brijuni national park encompasses the 743 @.@ 3 @-@ hectare ( 1 @,@ 837 @-@ acre ) archipelago itself and 2 @,@ 651 @.@ 7 hectares ( 6 @,@ 552 acres ) of surrounding sea ; it became a national park in 1999 . The Lim Canal is a 10 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) ria of the Pazinčica river . The Kornati national park was established in 1980 ; it covers approximately 220 square kilometres ( 85 sq mi ) , including 89 islands and islets . The marine environment encompasses three quarters of the total area , while the island shores ' combined length equals 238 kilometres ( 148 mi ) . Telašćica is a nature park established on <unk> Otok in 1988 . The park covers 69 kilometres ( 43 mi ) of coastline , 22 @.@ 95 square kilometres ( 8 @.@ 86 sq mi ) of land and 44 @.@ 55 square kilometres ( 17 @.@ 20 sq mi ) of sea . The Bay of Mali Ston is located at the border of Croatia and Bosnia – Herzegovina , north of the Pelješac peninsula . The marine protected area covers 48 square kilometres ( 19 sq mi ) . The Lastovo nature park was established in 2006 , and it includes 44 islands and islets , 53 square kilometres ( 20 sq mi ) of land and 143 square kilometres ( 55 sq mi ) of sea surface . The Mljet national park was established in 1960 , covering a 24 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 9 @.@ 3 sq mi ) marine protection area . In addition , there is a Ramsar wetland reserve in Croatia — the Neretva river 's delta . 
 In Slovenia , the marine and coastal protected nature areas are the <unk> Salina Landscape Park , Strunjan Landscape Park , <unk> Inlet Nature Reserve , and the <unk> <unk> , Cape Madona and Lakes in <unk> natural monuments . The <unk> Salina Landscape Park was established in 1990 , covers 721 hectares ( 1 @,@ 780 acres ) , and includes four nature reserves . In 1993 , the area was designated a Ramsar site ; it is also a site of international importance for waterbird species . The 429 @-@ hectare ( 1 @,@ 060 @-@ acre ) Strunjan Landscape Park was established in 2004 and comprises two nature reserves . It includes a 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) long cliff , the northernmost Mediterranean salt field and the only Slovenian lagoon system . It is also the northernmost point of growth of some Mediterranean plant species . The <unk> Inlet Nature Reserve was established in 1998 and covers 122 hectares ( 300 acres ) . The <unk> <unk> natural monument covers 24 hectares ( 59 acres ) , the Cape Madona natural monument covers 12 hectares ( 30 acres ) , and the Lakes in <unk> natural monument , with the coastal lake as the only brackish lake in Slovenia , covers 2 @.@ 1 hectares ( 5 @.@ 2 acres ) . 
 In 2010 , Albania established its first marine protection area , the Karaburun @-@ Sazan National Marine Park at the Karaburun Peninsula where the Adriatic and Ionian Seas meet . The park covers a total of 12 @,@ 570 hectares ( 31 @,@ 100 acres ) . Two additional marine protection areas are planned in Albania : the Cape of <unk> ( Albanian : Kepi i <unk> ) and Porto Palermo . In addition , Albania is home to two Ramsar wetland reserves : <unk> Lagoon , and Butrint . Neither Bosnia – Herzegovina nor Montenegro have or plan to establish any marine protection areas . 
 = = = Pollution = = = 
 The Adriatic Sea ecosystem is threatened by excessive input of nutrients through drainage from agricultural land and wastewater flowing from cities ; this includes both along its coast and from rivers draining into the sea — especially from the Po River . Venice is often cited as an example of polluted coastal waters where shipping , transportation , farming , manufacturing and wastewater disposal contribute to polluting the sea . A further risk is presented by ballast water discharge by ships , especially tankers . Still , since most of the cargo handled by the Adriatic ports , and virtually all liquid ( tanker ) cargo handled by the ports , is coming to — not coming from — the Adriatic Basin , the risk from ballast water ( from tankers expelling ballast water then loading in the Adriatic ) remains minimal . However , proposed export oil pipelines were objected to specifically because of this issue . Oil spills are a major concern in terms of potential environmental impact and damage to tourism and fisheries . It is estimated that if a major oil spill happened , a million people would lose their livelihoods in Croatia alone . An additional risk is presented by oil refineries in the Po River basin where oil spills have occurred before , in addition to accidents occurring in the Adriatic already , so far with no significant environmental consequences . Since 2006 , Italy has been considering the construction of an offshore and an onshore LNG terminal in the Gulf of Trieste , as well as a pipeline , in the immediate vicinity of the Slovenian – Italian border . The Slovenian government and municipalities , the municipal council of Trieste , and non @-@ governmental organisations have voiced concern over their environmental hazards , effect on transport and effect on tourism . 
 Another source of pollution of the Adriatic is solid waste . Drifting waste — occasionally relatively large quantities of material , especially waste plastic — is transported northwest by the sirocco . Air pollution in the Adriatic Basin is associated with the large industrial centres in the Po River valley and the large industrial cities along the coast . 
 Italy and Yugoslavia established a joint commission to protect the Adriatic Sea from pollution in 1977 ; the organization later changed with Slovenia , Croatia and Montenegro replacing Yugoslavia . Future pollution hazards are addressed and pollution hotspots are assessed not only by nations in the basin but also through regional projects with World Bank support . 27 such hotspots have been determined as of 2011 , 6 warranting an urgent response . 
 = = Name = = 
 The origins of the name Adriatic are linked to the Etruscan settlement of Adria , which probably derives its name from the Illyrian <unk> meaning water or sea . In classical antiquity , the sea was known as Mare <unk> ( Mare <unk> , also sometimes simplified to Adria ) or , less frequently , as Mare <unk> , " [ the ] upper sea " . The two terms were not synonymous , however . Mare <unk> generally corresponds to the Adriatic Sea 's extent , spanning from the Gulf of Venice to the Strait of Otranto . That boundary became more consistently defined by Roman authors — early Greek sources place the boundary between the Adriatic and Ionian seas at various places ranging from adjacent to the Gulf of Venice to the southern tip of the Peloponnese , eastern shores of Sicily and western shores of Crete . Mare <unk> on the other hand normally encompassed both the modern Adriatic Sea and the sea off the Apennine peninsula 's southern coast , as far as the Strait of Sicily . Another name used in the period was Mare <unk> , applied to waters off the coast of Dalmatia or Illyricum . 
 Names for the sea in the languages of the surrounding countries include : Albanian : <unk> <unk> ; Croatian : <unk> more ; <unk> @-@ Romanian : marea <unk> ; Italian : mare Adriatico ; Slovene : <unk> <unk> ; Greek : <unk> <unk> <unk> Thalassa . In Croatian , Montenegrin and Slovene , the sea is often referred to simply as <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 Settlements along the Adriatic dating to between 6100 and 5900 BC appear in Albania and Dalmatia on the eastern coast , related to the Cardium Pottery culture . During classical antiquity , Illyrians inhabited the eastern Adriatic coast , and the western coast was inhabited by the peoples of Ancient Italy , mainly Etruscans , before the Roman Republic 's rise . Greek colonisation of the Adriatic dates back to the 7th and 6th centuries BC when <unk> and Apollonia were founded . The Greeks soon expanded further north establishing several cities , including Epidaurus , Black Corcyra , Issa and Ancona , with trade established as far north as the Po River delta , where the <unk> ( trading station ) of Adria was founded . 
 = = = Roman era = = = 
 Roman economic and military influence in the region began to grow with the creation by 246 BC of a major naval base at Brundisium ( now Brindisi ) , which was established to bar Carthaginian ships from the Adriatic during the Punic Wars . This led to conflict with the Illyrians , who lived in a collection of semi @-@ Hellenized kingdoms that covered much of the Balkans and controlled the eastern shore of the sea , resulting in the Illyrian Wars from 229 – 168 BC . The initial Roman intervention in 229 BC , motivated in part by a desire to suppress Illyrian piracy in the Adriatic , marked the first time that the Roman navy crossed that sea to launch a military campaign . Those wars ended with the eastern shore becoming a province of the Roman Republic . However , resistance to Roman rule continued sporadically and Rome did not completely consolidate control of the region until Augustus 's general Tiberius put down the Great Illyrian Revolt , a bitter struggle waged from 6 to 9 AD . Following the repression of the revolt the Roman province of Illyricum was split into Dalmatia and Pannonia . Most of the eastern shore of the Adriatic was part of Dalmatia , except for the southernmost portion , part of the province of Macedonia , and the peninsula of Istria on the northern part of the eastern shore ; Istria contained the important Roman colony at Pula and was incorporated into the province of Italy . 
 During the Roman period Brundisium , on the western shore , and Apollonia and Dyrrachium ( originally called <unk> , now Durrës in Albania ) on the eastern shore became important ports . Brundisium was linked by the Via Appia road to the city of Rome , and Dyrrachium and Apollonia were both on the Via Egnatia , a road that by about 130 BC the Romans had extended eastward across the Balkans to Byzantium ( later Constantinople , now Istanbul ) . This made the sea passage across the Adriatic between Brundisium and Dyrrachium ( or Apollonia ) a link in the primary route for travelers , trade , and troop movements , between Rome and the East . This route played a major role in some of the military operations that marked the end of the Roman Republic and start of the imperial period . Sulla used it during the First Mithridatic War . During Caesar 's Civil War , there was a three @-@ month delay in Caesar 's Balkan campaign against Pompey caused when winter storms on the Adriatic and a naval blockade held up Mark Antony from reaching him from Brundisium with reinforcements ; after the reinforcements finally arrived Caesar made an unsuccessful attempt to capture Dyrrachium before the campaign moved inland . Marc Antony and Octavian ( later Augustus ) crossed the Adriatic to Dyrrachium with their armies in their campaign against two of Caesar 's assassins , Brutus and Cassius , that culminated in the Battle of Philippi . Brundisium and Dyrrachium remained important ports well after the Roman period , but an earthquake in the 3rd century AD changed the path of a river causing Apollonia 's harbor to silt up , and the city to decline . 
 Another city on the Italian coast of the Adriatic that increased in importance during the Roman era was Ravenna . During the reign of Augustus it became a major naval base as part of his program to re @-@ organize the Roman navy to better protect commerce in the Mediterranean . During the 4th century AD the emperors of the Western Roman Empire had moved their official residence north from Rome to Mediolanum ( now Milan ) in order to be better able to control the military frontier with the Germanic tribes . In 402 AD , during a period of repeated Germanic invasions of Italy , the capital was shifted to Ravenna because nearby marshes made it more defensible , and the Adriatic provided an easy escape path by sea . When the Western Empire fell in 476 AD Ravenna became the capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 In the Early Middle Ages , after the Roman Empire 's decline , the Adriatic 's coasts were ruled by Ostrogoths , Lombards and the Byzantine Empire . The Ostrogothic Kingdom ruled Italy following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD . However , during the reign of Justinian the Byzantine Empire sent an army under the general Belisarius to regain control of Italy , resulting in the Gothic War ( 535 – 554 ) . The Byzantines established the Exarchate of Ravenna and by 553 AD their viceroy ( Exarch ) ruled almost the entire Italian peninsula from that city . In 568 AD the Lombards invaded northern Italy , and over the course of the next century or so the importance of the Exarchate declined as the territory under Lombard control expanded and as the Byzantine outpost of Venice became increasingly independent . In 752 AD the Lombards overthrew the Exarchate , ending the influence of the Byzantine Empire on the western shore of the Adriatic for a few centuries . 
 The last part of the period saw the rise of the Carolingian Empire and then the Frankish Kingdom of Italy , which controlled the Adriatic Sea 's western coast , while Byzantine Dalmatia on the east coast gradually shrunk following the Avar and Croatian invasions starting in the 7th century . The Republic of Venice was founded during this period and went on to become a significant maritime power after receiving a Byzantine tax exemption in 1082 . The end of the period brought about the Holy Roman Empire 's control over the Kingdom of Italy ( which would last until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 ) , the establishment of an independent Kingdom of Croatia and the Byzantine Empire 's return to the southern Apennine peninsula . In addition , the Papal States were carved out in the area around Rome and central Italy in the 8th century . 
 The High Middle Ages in the Adriatic Sea basin saw further territorial changes , including the Norman conquest of southern Italy ending the Byzantine presence on the Apennine peninsula in the 11th and 12th centuries ( the territory would become the Kingdom of Naples in 1282 ) and the control of a substantial part of the eastern Adriatic coast by the Kingdom of Hungary after a personal union was established between Croatia and Hungary in 1102 . In this period , the Republic of Venice began to expand its territory and influence . In 1202 , the Fourth Crusade was diverted to conquer Zadar at the behest of the Venetians — the first instance of a Crusader force attacking a Catholic city — before proceeding to sack Constantinople . In the 13th century , Venice established itself as a leading maritime nation . During much of the 12th and 13th centuries , Venice and the Republic of Genoa were engaged in warfare culminating in the War of <unk> , ousting the Genoese from the Adriatic . Still , the 1381 Treaty of Turin that ended the war required Venice to renounce claims to Dalmatia , after losing the territory to Hungary in 1358 . In the same year , the Republic of Ragusa was established in Dubrovnik as a city @-@ state after it was freed from Venetian suzerainty . 
 Venice regained Dalmatia in 1409 and held it for nearly four hundred years , with the republic 's apex of trading and military power in the first half of the 15th century . The 15th and the 16th centuries brought about the Byzantine Empire 's destruction in 1453 and the Ottoman Empire 's expansion that reached Adriatic shores in present @-@ day Albania and Montenegro as well as the immediate hinterland of the Dalmatian coast , defeating the Hungarian and Croatian armies at Krbava in 1493 and Mohács in 1526 . These defeats spelled the end of an independent Hungarian kingdom , and both Croatian and Hungarian nobility chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as their new ruler , bringing the Habsburg Monarchy to the shore of the Adriatic Sea , where it would remain for nearly four hundred years . The Ottomans and Venetians fought a series of wars , but until the 17th century these were not fought in the Adriatic area . Ottoman raids on the Adriatic coasts effectively ceased after the massive setback in the Battle of Lepanto in October 1571 . 
 = = = Early modern period = = = 
 In 1648 , the Holy Roman Empire lost its claim on its former Italian lands , formally ending the Kingdom of Italy ; however , its only outlet on the Adriatic Sea , the Duchy of Ferrara , was already lost to the Papal States . The 17th century 's final territorial changes were caused by the Morean or Sixth Ottoman – Venetian War , when in 1699 Venice slightly enlarged its possessions in Dalmatia . In 1797 , the Republic of Venice was abolished after the French conquest . The Venetian territory was then handed over to Austria and briefly ruled as part of the Archduchy of Austria . The territory was turned back over to France after the Peace of Pressburg in 1805 , when the territory in the Po valley became an integral part of the new Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy . The new kingdom included the province of Romagna , thus removing the Papal State from the Adriatic coast ; however , Trieste , Istria and Dalmatia were joined into a set of separate provinces of the French Empire : the Illyrian Provinces . These were created in 1809 through the Treaty of Schönbrunn ; they represented the end of Venetian rule on the eastern Adriatic coast , as well as the end of the Republic of Ragusa . The Adriatic Sea was a minor theatre in the Napoleonic Wars ; the Adriatic campaign of 1807 – 1814 involved the British Royal Navy contesting the Adriatic 's control by the combined navies of France , Italy and the Kingdom of Naples . During the campaign , the Royal Navy occupied Vis and established its base there in Port St. George . The campaign reached its climax in the 1811 Battle of Lissa , and ended with British and Austrian troops seizing the coastal cities on the eastern Adriatic coast from the French . Days before the Battle of Waterloo , the Congress of Vienna awarded the Illyrian Provinces ( spanning from the Gulf of Trieste to the Bay of Kotor ) to Austria . The Congress of Vienna also created the Kingdom of Lombardy – Venetia which encompassed the city of Venice , the surrounding coast and a substantial hinterland , and was controlled by Austria . In the Apennine peninsula 's south , the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was formed in 1816 by unifying the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily . 
 = = = Modern period = = = 
 The process of Italian unification culminated in the Second Italian War of Independence , resulting in the Kingdom of Sardinia annexing all territories along the western Adriatic coast south of Venetia in 1860 , and the 1861 establishment of the Kingdom of Italy in its place . The Kingdom of Italy expanded in 1866 : it annexed Venetia , but its navy was defeated in the Adriatic near Vis . Following the Austro @-@ Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Croatian – Hungarian Settlement of 1868 , the control of much of the eastern Adriatic coast was redefined . The <unk> ( Austrian ) part of Austria @-@ Hungary spanned from the Austrian Littoral to the Bay of Kotor , with the exception of the Croatian Littoral mainland . In the territory outside the Austrian Littoral , special status was given to Fiume ( modern day Rijeka ) as a separate part of the Kingdom of Hungary . The rest of the territory was made a part of the Kingdom of Croatia @-@ Slavonia , which in turn was also in the Transleithanian part of the dual monarchy . The Adriatic coastline controlled by the Ottoman Empire was reduced by the Congress of Berlin in 1878 , through recognition of the independence of the Principality of Montenegro , which controlled the coast south of the Bay of Kotor to the Bojana River . The Ottoman Empire lost all territories along the Adriatic following the First Balkan War and consequent 1913 Treaty of London that established an independent Albania . 
 The World War I Adriatic Campaign was largely limited to blockade attempts by the Allies and the effort of the Central Powers to thwart the British , French and Italian moves . Italy joined the Allies in April 1915 with the Treaty of London , which promised Italy the Austrian Littoral , northern Dalmatia , the port of Vlorë , most of the eastern Adriatic islands and Albania as a protectorate . The treaty provided the basis for all the following divisions between Italy and Yugoslavia . In 1918 , the Montenegrin national assembly voted to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia , giving the latter access to the Adriatic . Another short @-@ lived , unrecognised state established in 1918 was the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs , formed from parts of Austria @-@ Hungary , comprising most of the former monarchy 's Adriatic coastline . Later that year , the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs formed the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes — subsequently renamed Yugoslavia . The proponents of the new union in the Croatian parliament saw the move as a safeguard against Italian expansionism as stipulated in the Treaty of London . The treaty was largely disregarded by Britain and France because of conflicting promises made to Serbia and a perceived lack of Italian contribution to the war effort outside Italy itself . The 1919 Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye did transfer the Austrian Littoral and Istria to Italy , but awarded Dalmatia to Yugoslavia . Following the war , a private force of demobilized Italian soldiers seized Rijeka and set up the Italian Regency of Carnaro — seen as a harbinger of Fascism — in order to force the recognition of Italian claims to the city . After sixteen months of the Regency 's existence , the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo redefined the Italian – Yugoslav borders , among other things transferring Zadar and the islands of Cres , Lastovo and Palagruža to Italy , securing the island of Krk for Yugoslavia and establishing the Free State of Fiume ; this new state was abolished in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome that awarded Fiume ( modern Rijeka ) to Italy and Sušak to Yugoslavia . 
 = = = Late 20th century = = = 
 During World War II , the Adriatic saw only limited naval action , starting with the Italian invasion of Albania and the joint Axis invasion of Yugoslavia . The latter led to the annexation of a large part of Dalmatia and nearly all the eastern Adriatic islands by Italy and the establishment of two puppet states , the Independent State of Croatia and the Kingdom of Montenegro , which controlled the remainder of the former Yugoslav Adriatic coast . In 1947 , after the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces and the war 's end , Italy ( now a republic ) and the Allies signed the Treaty of Peace with Italy . The treaty reversed all wartime annexations , guaranteed the independence of Albania , created the Free Territory of Trieste ( FTT ) as a city @-@ state , and gave communist Yugoslavia most of the Slovenian Littoral , as well as Istria , the islands of Cres , Lastovo and Palagruža , and the cities of Zadar and Rijeka . The FTT was partitioned in 1954 : Trieste itself and the area to the North of it were placed under Italian control , while the rest came under Yugoslav control . This arrangement was made permanent in the 1975 Treaty of Osimo . 
 During the Cold War , the Adriatic Sea became the southernmost flank of the Iron Curtain as Italy joined NATO , while the Warsaw Pact established bases in Albania . After the fall of communism , Yugoslavia broke apart : Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991 , and Bosnia – Herzegovina followed in 1992 , while Montenegro remained in a federation with Serbia , officially called Serbia and Montenegro . The ensuing Croatian War of Independence included limited naval engagements and a blockade of Croatia 's coast by the Yugoslav Navy , leading to the Battle of the Dalmatian channels and a later withdrawal of Yugoslav vessels . Montenegro declared itself independent in 2006 , effectively land @-@ locking Serbia . The period also saw the Adriatic Sea as the theatre of several NATO operations , including the blockade of Yugoslavia , intervention in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina and the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia . 
 = = Boundaries = = 
 Italy and Yugoslavia defined their Adriatic continental shelf delimitation in 1968 , with an additional agreement signed in 1975 on the Gulf of Trieste boundary , following the Treaty of Osimo . The boundary agreed in 1968 extends 353 nautical miles ( 654 km ; 406 mi ) and consists of 43 points connected by straight lines or circular arc segments . The additional boundary agreed upon in 1975 consists of 5 points , extending from an end point of the 1968 line . All successor states of former Yugoslavia accepted the agreements . In the Adriatic 's southernmost areas the border was not determined in order to avoid prejudicing the location of the tripoint with the Albanian continental shelf border , which remains undefined . Before the breakup of Yugoslavia , Albania , Italy and Yugoslavia initially proclaimed 15 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 28 km ; 17 mi ) territorial waters , subsequently reduced to international @-@ standard 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) and all sides adopted baseline systems ( mostly in the 1970s ) . Albania and Italy determined their sea border in 1992 according to the equidistance principle . Following Croatian EU membership , the Adriatic became an internal sea of the EU . The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defines the Adriatic Sea as an enclosed or semi @-@ enclosed sea . 
 = = = Adriatic Euroregion = = = 
 The Adriatic Euroregion was established in Pula in 2006 to promote trans @-@ regional and trans @-@ national cooperation in the Adriatic Sea area and serve as an Adriatic framework to help resolve issues of regional importance . The Adriatic Euroregion consists of 23 members : the Apulia , Molise , Abruzzo , Marche , Emilia @-@ Romagna , Veneto and Friuli @-@ Venezia Giulia regions of Italy ; the municipality of Izola in Slovenia ; the Istria , Primorje @-@ Gorski Kotar , Lika @-@ Senj , Zadar , Šibenik @-@ Knin , Split @-@ Dalmatia and Dubrovnik @-@ Neretva counties of Croatia ; the Herzegovina @-@ Neretva Canton of Bosnia – Herzegovina ; the municipalities of Kotor and Tivat in Montenegro ; the Fier , Vlorë , Tirana , Shkodër , Durrës and Lezhë counties of Albania ; and the Greek prefectures of <unk> and Corfu . 
 = = = Disputes = = = 
 The former Yugoslav republics ' land borders were decided by demarcation commissions implementing the AVNOJ decisions of 1943 and 1945 , but the exact course has not been agreed upon by the successor states , which makes the maritime boundaries ' definition difficult ; the maritime borders were not defined at all in the time of Yugoslavia . In addition , the maritime boundary between Albania and Montenegro was not defined before the 1990s . 
 Croatia and Slovenia started negotiations to define maritime borders in the Gulf of Piran in 1992 but failed to agree , resulting in a dispute . Both countries also declared their economic zones , which partially overlap . Croatia 's application to become an EU member state was initially suspended pending resolution of its border disputes with Slovenia . These disputes with Slovenia were eventually settled with an agreement to accept the decision of an international arbitration commission set up via the UN , enabling Croatia to progress towards EU membership . Aside from the EU membership difficulty , even before its settling the dispute has caused no major practical problems . 
 The maritime boundary between Bosnia – Herzegovina and Croatia was formally settled in 1999 , but a few issues are still in dispute — the <unk> peninsula and two islets in the border area . The Croatia – Montenegro maritime boundary is disputed in the Bay of Kotor , at the Prevlaka peninsula . This dispute was exacerbated by the peninsula 's occupation by the Yugoslav People 's Army and later by the ( Serbian – Montenegrin ) FR Yugoslav Army , which in turn was replaced by a United Nations observer mission that lasted until 2002 . Croatia took over the area with an agreement that allowed Montenegrin presence in the bay 's Croatian waters , and the dispute has become far less contentious since Montenegro 's independence in 2006 .

Overfishing is a recognised problem — 450 species of fish live in the Adriatic Sea , including 120 species threatened by excessive commercial fishing , a problem exacerbated by pollution and global warming . <unk> species include common <unk> , red scorpionfish , monkfish , John Dory , blue shark , spiny dogfish , mullet , red mullet , Norway lobster , as well as European hake , and sardines . Turtles and common bottlenose dolphins are also being killed by fishing nets . The depleted fish stock , and Croatia 's Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone ( ZERP ) contributed to accusations of overfishing exchanged between Italian and Croatian fishermen . ZERP was introduced in 2003 , but its application to EU member states was suspended in 2004 . The depleted stocks of fish are being addressed through a new proposed EU fisheries policy that was scheduled to take effect in 2013 , when Croatia acceded to the EU , and restore the stocks to sustainable levels by 2015 . 
 The largest volume of fish harvesting was in Italy , where the total production volume in 2007 stood at 465 @,@ 637 tonnes ( 458 @,@ 283 long tons ) . In 2003 , 28 @.@ 8 % of Italian fisheries production volume was generated in the Northern and central Adriatic , and 24 @.@ 5 % in Apulia ( from the Southern Adriatic and Ionian Sea ) . Italian fisheries , including those operating outside the Adriatic , employed 60 @,@ 700 in the primary sector , including aquaculture ( which comprises 40 % of the total fisheries production ) . The total fisheries output 's gross value in 2002 was $ 1 @.@ 9 billion . 
 In 2007 , Croatia 's production in live weight reached 53 @,@ 083 tonnes ( 52 @,@ 245 long tons ) . In 2006 , the total Croatian fisheries production volume was 37 @,@ 800 tonnes ( 37 @,@ 200 long tons ) of catch and 14 @,@ 200 tonnes ( 14 @,@ 000 long tons ) from marine aquaculture . Croatian fisheries employed approximately 20 @,@ 000 . The 2006 marine capture catch in Croatian waters consisted of sardines ( 44 @.@ 8 % ) , anchovies ( 31 @.@ 3 % ) , tunas ( 2 @.@ 7 % ) , other pelagic fish ( 4 @.@ 8 % ) , hake ( 2 @.@ 4 % ) , mullet ( 2 @.@ 1 % ) , other demersal fish ( 8 @.@ 3 % ) , crustaceans ( largely lobster and Nephrops norvegicus ) ( 0 @.@ 8 % ) , shellfish ( largely oysters and mussels ) ( 0 @.@ 3 % ) , cuttlefish ( 0 @.@ 6 % ) , squids ( 0 @.@ 2 % ) and octopuses and other cephalopods ( 1 @.@ 6 % ) . Croatian marine aquaculture production consisted of tuna ( 47 @.@ 2 % ) , oysters and mussels ( 28 @.@ 2 % combined ) and bass and bream ( 24 @.@ 6 % combined ) . 
 In 2007 , Albanian fisheries production amounted to 7 @,@ 505 tonnes ( 7 @,@ 386 long tons ) , including aquaculture production , which reached 1 @,@ 970 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 940 long tons ) in 2006 . At the same time , Slovenian fisheries produced a total of 2 @,@ 500 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 460 long tons ) with 55 % of the production volume originating in aquaculture , representing the highest ratio in the Adriatic . Finally , the Montenegrin fisheries production stood at 911 tonnes ( 897 long tons ) in 2006 , with only 11 tonnes coming from aquaculture . In 2007 , the fisheries production in Bosnia – Herzegovina reached volume of 9 @,@ 625 tonnes ( 9 @,@ 473 long tons ) and 2 @,@ 463 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 424 long tons ) in Slovenia . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 The countries bordering the Adriatic Sea are significant tourist destinations . The largest number of tourist overnight stays and the most numerous tourist accommodation facilities are recorded in Italy , especially in the Veneto region ( around Venice ) . Veneto is followed by the Emilia @-@ Romagna region and by the Adriatic Croatian counties . The Croatian tourist facilities are further augmented by 21 @,@ 000 nautical ports and moorings ; nautical tourists are attracted to various types of marine protected areas . 
 All countries along the Adriatic coast , except Albania and Bosnia – Herzegovina , take part in the Blue Flag beach certification programme ( of the Foundation for Environmental Education ) , for beaches and marinas meeting strict quality standards including environmental protection , water quality , safety and services criteria . As of January 2012 , the Blue Flag has been awarded to 103 Italian Adriatic beaches and 29 marinas , 116 Croatian beaches and 19 marinas , 7 Slovenian beaches and 2 marinas , and 16 Montenegrin beaches . Adriatic tourism is a significant source of income for these countries , especially in Croatia and Montenegro where the tourism income generated along the Adriatic coast represents the bulk of such income . The direct contribution of travel and tourism to Croatia 's GDP stood at 5 @.@ 1 % in 2011 , with the total industry contribution estimated at 12 @.@ 8 % of the national GDP . For Montenegro , the direct contribution of tourism to the national GDP is 8 @.@ 1 % , with the total contribution to the economy at 17 @.@ 2 % of Montenegrin GDP . Tourism in Adriatic Croatia has recently exhibited greater growth than in the other regions around the Adriatic . 
 = = = Transport = = = 
 There are nineteen Adriatic Sea ports ( in four different countries ) that each handle more than a million tonnes of cargo per year . The largest cargo ports among them are the Port of Trieste ( the largest Adriatic cargo port in Italy ) , the Port of Venice , the Port of Ravenna , the Port of Koper ( the largest Slovenian port ) , the Port of Rijeka ( the largest Croatian cargo port ) , and the Port of Brindisi . The largest passenger ports in the Adriatic are the Port of Split ( the largest Croatian passenger port ) and ports in Ancona ( the largest Italian passenger seaport in the Adriatic ) . The largest seaport in Montenegro is the Port of Bar . In 2010 , the Northern Adriatic seaports of Trieste , Venice , Ravenna , Koper and Rijeka founded the North Adriatic Ports Association to position themselves more favourably in the EU 's transport systems . 
 = = = Oil and gas = = = 
 Natural gas is produced through several projects , including a joint venture of the Eni and INA companies that operates two platforms — one is in Croatian waters and draws gas from six wells , and the other ( which started operating in 2010 ) is located in Italian waters . The Adriatic gas fields were discovered in the 1970s , but their development commenced in 1996 . In 2008 , INA produced 14 @.@ 58 million <unk> per day of gas . About 100 offshore platforms are located in the Emilia @-@ Romagna region , along with 17 in the Northern Adriatic . Eni estimated its concessions in the Adriatic Sea to hold at least 40 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 1 @.@ 4 × 1012 cu ft ) of natural gas , adding that they may even reach 100 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 3 @.@ 5 × 1012 cu ft ) . INA estimates , however , are 50 % lower than those supplied by Eni . Oil was discovered in the Northern Adriatic at a depth of approximately 5 @,@ 400 metres ( 17 @,@ 700 ft ) ; the discovery was assessed as not viable because of its location , depth and quality . These gas and oil reserves are part of the Po basin Province of Northern Italy and the Northern Mediterranean Sea . 
 In the 2000s , investigation works aimed at discovering gas and oil reserves in the Middle and Southern Adriatic basins intensified , and by the decade 's end , oil and natural gas reserves were discovered southeast of the Bari , Brindisi — <unk> and Giove oil discoveries . Surveys indicate reserves of 3 billion barrels of oil in place and 5 @.@ 7 × 1010 cubic metres ( 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of gas in place . The discovery was followed by further surveys off the Croatian coast . In January 2012 , INA commenced prospecting for oil off Dubrovnik , marking the resumption of oil exploration along the eastern Adriatic coast after surveys commenced in the late 1980s around the island of Brač were cancelled because of Yugoslavia 's breakup and war in Croatia . Montenegro is also expected to look for oil off its coast . As of January 2012 , only 200 exploration wells had been sunk off the Croatian coast , with all but 30 in the Northern Adriatic basin . 
 = Howling Bells = 
 Howling Bells are an indie rock band that formed in Sydney in 2004 . The band obtained moderate popularity in the United Kingdom following the release of its 2006 self @-@ titled debut album . The lineup consists of Juanita Stein ( vocals , rhythm guitar ) , Glenn Moule ( drums ) , Juanita 's brother Joel Stein ( lead guitar ) , and Gary Daines ( bass guitar ) . 
 Originally called Waikiki , the band changed its name and musical style preceding its move from Australia to England . Howling Bells ' debut album , Howling Bells , was produced by Ken Nelson . The album charted in the Top 100 in the UK and just outside the Top 50 in Australia , and it was included on Album of the Year lists for a number of publications . The band 's next release , Radio Wars ( 2009 ) , received mixed reviews , although it charted higher than its predecessor in both the UK and Australia . The band supported Coldplay on the third leg of the North American Viva la Vida Tour . In 2009 , Gigwise named Juanita Stein " the sexiest woman in rock . " Their third album , The Loudest Engine ( 2011 ) , received largely favourable reviews but underperformed on the charts in comparison to the bands ' two prior releases . In 2011 , original Howling Bells bass guitarist , Brendan Picchio , left the band . 
 Howling Bells are notable for a doom @-@ and @-@ gloom , country @-@ and @-@ rock music style , and they have been labelled as melodic blues and country @-@ goth . They are influenced by The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix , and they are often compared to Mazzy Star and The Velvet Underground . Their fourth album , Heartstrings , was released in June 2014 .

 = = = Formation = = = 
 In 1999 , Glenn Moule , Joel Stein , and Juanita Stein formed the pop rock group Waikiki . They toured the Australian eastern states as a trio and released an EP , Presents , in 2000 . In 2002 , with a rhythm guitarist , they issued the Top 50 album I 'm Already Home . With four members , the band then toured Australia and New Zealand . Shortly thereafter , Brendan Picchio joined Waikiki as a bassist , and Juanita switched to rhythm guitar . The group soon became dissatisfied with its material , so the members chose a new direction for their music . They wrote a number of new songs and made a wish list of producers with whom they would like to work . In 2004 , the band changed its name to Howling Bells , as its members felt that phrase better embodied its newly adapted indie rock style . 
 Demos of the new material were sent to British producer Ken Nelson ( Coldplay , Gomez ) . The band members considered him to be an unattainable candidate as a producer , but he responded favourably . Upon learning that he was interested in working with them , they moved to London . At the time , Nelson was occupied working with Coldplay . For eight to ten months , the band lived in adverse conditions in one room in a house in London . During this period , the members took up menial employment opportunities . Picchio sold double @-@ glazing over the telephone . Moule worked in a pub and in a car workshop , and Joel worked on a farm . 
 = = = Howling Bells ( 2005 – 2008 ) = = = 
 Howling Bells waited for almost a year while Nelson worked on Coldplay 's X & Y album . Frustrated by the unforeseen delay , they considered returning to Australia . However , in early 2005 , Nelson became available , and they recorded their first album at Parr Street Studios , Liverpool . Howling Bells exhibited a brooding sound , and it was a departure from the poppier style of music demonstrated by Waikiki . The long delay and the experience of a cold British winter had affected the tone of their music . 
 By July 2005 , the band was not yet signed to a record label . Howling Bells toured for ten months prior to the release of the album . They played sporadically in clubs in Australia and North America , and they toured Europe and the UK with Editors . The group played extensive UK club shows with many artists , including The Young Knives and Hank & Lily . Howling Bells also played Camden Crawl and the 2006 NME New Music Tour . 
 The album was released in May 2006 in the United Kingdom on the Bella Union label and in Australia in July through Liberation . It received critical acclaim , including a perfect 5 / 5 from musicOMH . NME rated it 9 / 10 and wrote in a review , " By turns beguiling and enthralling , this is an extraordinary album . " Howling Bells peaked in the Top 100 of the UK Albums Chart and just outside the Top 50 of the Australian Albums Chart . At the time , it was the fastest selling album on the Bella Union label . The release appeared on Album of the Year lists for a number of different publications . In its 22 March 2007 issue , Rolling Stone named Howling Bells one of their three bands to watch out for that year . 
 Howling Bells spent much of the next two years touring the UK , Europe , Australia , and the US . They played at the 2007 NME Awards Show . They performed at numerous festivals during the northern hemisphere 's summer months in 2006 and 2007 , including Reading and Leeds and Latitude . They supported Placebo in Europe and Australia and The Futureheads in the UK . The band also supported Mercury Rev , Snow Patrol , and The Killers across three different continents . 
 = = = Radio Wars ( 2008 – 2009 ) = = = 
 Howling Bells parted ways with Bella Union and , in 2008 , signed a deal with record label Independiente . The band worked with producer and mixer Dan Grech @-@ Marguerat ( Radiohead , Paul McCartney ) and recorded its follow @-@ up album , Radio Wars , at several different recording studios . At times , the members found it difficult to work with their new producer . However , they have stated that in retrospect , they learned a great deal from him and felt fortunate for having the experience of collaborating with him . 
 Radio Wars was first released in the UK in March 2009 , and it appeared in several other countries shortly thereafter . The album signalled a change in direction . The band 's music had become brighter and more accessible and placed a greater emphasis on keyboards . Consequently , reviews were mixed . BBC Music claimed " the second chance may well have been squandered . " Gigwise called it " an album of mashed @-@ up half ideas . " In a positive review , ABC described it as " anthemic , edgy , stomping indie rock at its best . " It peaked in the Top 30 in Australia and just outside the Top 50 in the UK . 
 Howling Bells headlined a tour of the UK in March 2009 , supported by The Joy Formidable and Chew Lips . They played V Festival in Australia in April and were then invited to support Coldplay in May and June in North America . The band played more festivals in Europe , including Hop Farm , Hard Rock Calling , and Pukkelpop . They supported Coldplay again for three nights of their European leg in August and September . The group returned to Australia to write music for its third album and to tour in December . Howling Bells received much praise from bands they supported on tour . Coldplay 's Chris Martin advised his audiences to download Howling Bells ' song " Nightingale . " In July , Snow Patrol 's Gary Lightbody named the group as his " Band of the Week " in Q magazine . 
 Juanita made the decision to develop her on @-@ stage persona in 2008 and 2009 . She became more confident , animated , and outgoing in her interactions with the audience and in her choice of clothes and hairstyles . In March 2009 , Gigwise proclaimed her " the sexiest woman in rock . " She also placed among the top ten of Clash magazine 's " Top Woman of 2009 " list . 
 = = = The Loudest Engine ( 2010 – 2012 ) = = = 
 Howling Bells began writing material for The Loudest Engine in mid – 2009 , and expressed hope that 2010 would see the release of the album , but it did not . Juanita labelled the band 's new writing as " real organic , real jammy ... very melodic , but very raw . " They played new material during their December 2009 Australian tour . One critic described it as " a more rollicking , rock and roll approach . " In 2010 , the band severed its partnership with Independiente and later negotiated a contract agreement with Cooking Vinyl . 
 In September 2010 , Howling Bells started recording The Loudest Engine at the Killers @-@ owned Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas . It was produced by bassist Mark Stoermer , whom the group had met while it toured with The Killers . The relationship between Stoermer and Howling Bells strengthened after the band disembarked from its flight to Las Vegas . The flight had been delayed by more than 12 hours , but he had nonetheless waited for them at the airport . Howling Bells were impressed by his style of work . Rather than overproducing , he kept the amount of takes to a minimum and allowed the band just to play , which kept the sessions very natural . The band members became less conscious of trying to please other people , made the record that they wanted , and hoped that it would change people 's attitudes toward the band . 
 The Loudest Engine was first issued in Australia in September 2011 . The album received mostly favourable reviews from music critics , but it did receive its share of negative response as well . Mojo magazine rated the release 8 / 10 and praised it as the band 's finest album to date . On the opposite end of the spectrum , NME rated it 2 / 10 and claimed that it " [ fell ] flat in a puddle of MOR . " The Loudest Engine charted in both the UK and Australia . To coincide with the release of the album , Howling Bells played a short six @-@ date tour of the UK . In November , they supported Elbow in Europe , and later that month they returned to Australia , where they headlined shows in December . Following this , bass guitarist Brendan Picchio left the band and was eventually replaced with Gary Daines . 
 = = = Heartstrings ( 2013 @-@ 2014 ) = = = 
 Heartstrings materialized following a brief hiatus by Howling Bells , whereupon the band members worked on other projects . Additionally , Juanita became a first @-@ time mother after giving birth . This , along with frustration from the long period of inactivity and creation inspired her and she started to write songs again , at which point she got the other members of the band involved . They made demos and sent them out to prospective producers , one being Alan Moulder ( Nine Inch Nails , The Smashing Pumpkins ) . Moulder was busy at the time so he recommended that the band contact an assistant of his , Catherine J. Marks ( Foals , The Killers ) , who after meeting , Howling Bells chose to produce the album . 
 In November 2013 , Howling Bells recorded Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios , in London . The album was primarily produced by Marks , but Moulder supported the effort and was given credit as co @-@ producer . Marks set the tone of the environment in the recording studio and the band felt extremely open and comfortable in her presence . Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band , more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously . The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records , a small , independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer , Nick Hodgson . 
 Heartstrings was released worldwide in June 2014 . The album received generally favourable reviews from music critics . NME rated it 7 / 10 and professed , " Howling Bells aren 't back to their best , but they 're within touching distance " . Q magazine rated it 3 / 5 and commented , " Heartstrings lacks the killer song that would bring Howling Bells the success they undoubtedly crave " . The album failed to chart in any nation . Howling Bells headlined shows throughout the UK in May and June . They played V Festival in the UK in August and a short series of shows in Australia and New Zealand in September . 
 = = Influences and musical style = = 
 Members of Howling Bells have cited The Beatles , Charles Mingus , Peter Green , Vinnie Colaiuta , and Jimi Hendrix as influences . The catalyst for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel 's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia . They saw this band shrouded in red lights , and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction . The band 's style has been compared to that of Siouxsie and the Banshees , PJ Harvey , The Velvet Underground , Nick Cave , Mazzy Star , and The Duke Spirit . Their music has been called folk rock , melodic blues , and country @-@ goth . Juanita disagrees with the group 's gothic characterization . 
 The style of Howling Bells was greatly influenced by film . The Steins and Picchio have expressed admiration of French films in particular . Juanita has stated that she enjoyed bringing the strange and ethereal energy from those films into their music . To describe the sound of Howling Bells ' debut album , critics used terms like dark , brooding , and Americana . NME described it as " the sound of PJ Harvey hitching a ride with The Velvet Underground through Twin Peaks . " 
 The second album , Radio Wars , in which the band experimented with synthesizers and drum machines , had a more electronic pop sound . They also incorporated arrangements of string and brass into the album . Their goals were to make a different kind of record by exploring other genres of music and to create something more insightful and futuristic . Not unlike the first record , Radio Wars contained elements of dark subject matter . " Cities Burning Down , " the darkest track from the album , was a song that Juanita and Moule wrote together . Its lyrics were inspired by the apocalyptic sound of the music , which they created first . 
 The Loudest Engine features a sound adapted to the genres of folk and rock , more so than the previous two Howling Bells records . Juanita explained that the band relied less on the sound technology that was prominent in Radio Wars , instead returning to the more organic state of Howling Bells . For the new album , Joel was inspired by prog rock and krautrock acts such as Amon <unk> and Aphrodite 's Child . Howling Bells were inspired by The Doors documentary When You 're Strange , which the members watched just before beginning to record The Loudest Engine . 
 Heartstrings , like the first record , was very much influenced by film , and is recognized for its cinematic quality . Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album to sound like a soundtrack to a movie . Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris , Texas and Blue Velvet , in an effort to replicate the mood , emotion , and atmosphere of these two films in particular . Other films that played a significant role in the making of Heartstrings include , Badlands , Bonnie and Clyde , Klute , Léon : The Professional , Nashville , Pleasantville , The Last Picture Show , and Vivre sa vie .

 = Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier = 
 Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier ( Chinese : <unk> ) , often referred to as the " Star Ferry " Pier , was a pier in Edinburgh Place , Central , Hong Kong , serving the Star Ferry . The pier , with its clock tower , was a prominent waterfront landmark . Built in 1957 at the height of the Modern Movement , it was the third generation of the Star Ferry Pier in Central , and was located near the City Hall and the General Post Office . 
 The pier was the central flashpoint of the Hong Kong riots in 1966 , and 40 years later became the focus of a confrontation between conservationists and the government , which wanted to demolish the pier to allow for reclamation . The ferry service from the pier was suspended on 11 November 2006 , and moved to piers 7 and 8 of Central Piers . Demolition commenced on 12 December , and was completed in early 2007 . 
 = = History = = 
 The entire waterfront where the " third generation " pier was situated was created in the late 1950s following a major land reclamation . The shoreline was shifted from its position at the time , level to the Mandarin Hotel . The pier was built in 1957 in Edinburgh Place , at the height of the Modern Movement , near the City Hall complex which was being planned at the time . 
 The Star Ferry Pier was designed by a local Chinese architect , Hung Yip Chan ( born in 1921 ) . He worked in the Architectural Office ( AO ) of the Hong Kong Government from 1952 to 1957 as an assistant architect . He designed the façade of the pier , and the Chief Architect , Michael Wright , added the Clock Tower to make the pier more balanced and practical . 
 The chimes of the turret clock installed at the pier marked every quarter @-@ hour since the pier 's inauguration in 1957 . The clock was a gift from John Keswick , who had in turn received it from the Prince of Belgium . The mechanism was manufactured by British company Edward John Dent , which also provided the mechanical signature to " Big Ben " of London . 
 There is a major bus terminus on the Kowloon side , which is conveniently situated close to the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier . Thousands of residents passed through this principal gateway to Hong Kong Island from the Kowloon Peninsula daily from 1957 until 2006 . However , the inauguration of the Cross Harbour Tunnel in 1972 popularised vehicular travel across the harbour and reduced the flow of passengers . From 1972 to 2006 , the ferry was still used by many as the shortest route from Tsim Sha Tsui ( <unk> ) to Central District , and a daily average of 74 @,@ 000 passenger trips were made across the harbour in 2004 . 
 On the island side , various routes of the <unk> , Citybus , and public light buses connected to many destinations on Hong Kong Island . 
 = = Relocation = = 
 The plan to relocate the Central Ferry Piers dates back to July 1999 , when proposed amendments to the draft Central District ( Extension ) Outline Zoning Plan covering the Central Reclamation III area were published . Both the third generation Star Ferry Pier and Queen 's Pier would be demolished and 16 hectares of land directly in front of the fourth @-@ generation pier reclaimed to make way for a six @-@ lane road and a low @-@ rise shopping centre . The cost was estimated at HK $ 3 @.@ 5 billion . The Government said that the historical significance of the third @-@ generation pier would be recognised and promised to recreate the landmark on the new waterfront . 
 In 2001 , an impact assessment for the Central Reclamation recommended the relocation of the Star Ferry Pier , and this was approved by the Antiquities Advisory Board in 2002 . 
 = = = Demolition = = = 
 3D Laser Scanning Technology in digital recording of structures was applied to capture three @-@ dimensional images of the pier before the demolition . 
 Following the pier 's decommissioning on 12 November 2006 , demolition work started amidst protests . The demolition was originally scheduled for the early part of 2007 , but demolition was brought forward by 3 months , to 12 December 2006 . The government ignored a nonbinding motion in September in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong urging it to retain the pier and clock tower . 
 The demolition crew took control of the site by erecting scaffolding on 6 December 2006 , and demolition commenced on 12 December . Workers took down the clock mechanism and clock face , leaving a gaping hole , and then proceeded to lift the clock tower off in one piece . After the protesters had been dispersed , the remainder of the pier was completely dismantled , away from the glare of publicity . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 Although the scale of the phase 3 reclamation in Central was cut back from 32 to 18 hectares , the fate of the piers was sealed by the reclamation . The pier became the centre of a bitter struggle between the Government and conservationists , who opposed either further destruction of the harbour or the further loss of historical buildings . 
 Consultants who prepared the Environmental Impact Assessment report in 2001 for the Central reclamation noted the pier 's significant role in Hong Kong 's transport history . The Government was warned that a public backlash could be expected when the full implications of the reclamation were known . 
 The Pier , especially its clock tower , is a visually important landmark in Hong Kong . It is an eye @-@ catching icon within the beautiful Hong Kong Harbour particularly for tourists and locals crossing it via Star Ferries from Tsim Sha Tsui . It is a must on their itinerary . No other ferry pier along the harbour could possibly perform such a symbolic function as this clocktower pier . The removal of the Star Ferry Pier to Piers 4 @-@ 7 leading to its destruction would likely raise public objection and dismay . 
 However , the Government had maintained that the Pier and its tower was not old enough to be classified as " historical " and that people were not necessarily " concerned about the building itself " . To some extent , it was not wrong , since the activists were mainly fighting for the preservation of a public place and against the methods and urban planning policies of its government , perceived to favour business interests over the public interest . The struggle to preserve the Star Ferry and , later , the Queen 's Pier , was the occasion to raise questions on Hong Kong 's history , the question of colonialism , and that of democracy in the <unk> . 
 The Government had grossly underestimated the very strong public sentiment about this 49 @-@ year @-@ old landmark in the " collective memory " of Hong Kong residents . By its own retrospective admission , it lacked legitimacy : a Government spokesman conceded that the it had failed to gain the moral high ground . 
 = = = Loss of convenience = = = 
 Ferry passengers would face a lengthier trek to reach the new pier . By relocating the new piers 300 m away , it is estimated that the Star Ferry could lose perhaps 13 percent or more of passengers due to its inconvenience . On the Tsim Sha Tsui side of the harbour , the proposed relocation of the bus terminus which acts as a feeder for the ferry is forecast to further reduce passenger numbers by one @-@ fifth . 
 This loss , totalling one @-@ third of its passengers , would translate into revenue loss of some HK $ 17 million per annum for Star Ferry . 
 = = = Architectural importance = = = 
 Architects and conservationists argued that the pier was architecturally significant to Hong Kong as one of the last remaining examples of a Streamline Moderne public building ( along with the Central Market and Wan Chai Market which have been earmarked for demolition ) ; culturally the pier was widely recognised as a part of local collective memory . The Hong Kong Institute of Architects warned against the destruction of Hong Kong 's heritage , saying it would be an irreversible mistake . Public opinion has resulted in alternatives put forward to preserve the clock tower , including moving the proposed six @-@ lane road or relocating the clock tower to the front of the new pier as a memorial . 
 = = = State of the clock = = = 
 One reason cited by the Government against the relocation of the turret clock and tower was that an expert feasibility study advised that there was " no guarantee the clock and chimes would continue to work after relocation , due to their age and obsolete components " . However , Neil <unk> Wright of Thwaites & Reed , the world 's longest operating clockmaking firm , who arrived from England on 18 December 2006 to examine the clock , said that his firm had restored far worse . 
 The Government promised that it would " rebuild " the chimes of the clock , complete with the restitution of the original clock faces and mechanism at some nearby location . 
 = = Public sentiment = = 
 The public outcry , anticipated by the consultancy report for the Antiquities and Monuments Office , was to become reality . With the imminent threat of demolition , the local community rallied to save pier , to widespread media coverage . In the weeks running up to the cessation of service from the pier , thousands of Hong Kong residents arrived to post banners and other messages in support of retention . 
 There were some 150 @,@ 000 nostalgic visitors to the Pier and harbour crossing on the night of 11 November 2006 . To mark the special occasion , Star Ferry hosted a " last ride " before the pier was closed @-@ down , with the last four ferries leaving this pier on the stroke of midnight . Eighteen hundred Hongkongers willingly paid up $ 88 ( 40 times the normal fare ) for the last ride , whose proceeds were designated for charity . 
 = = = Protest movement = = = 
 On 19 November 2006 , the Civic Party , Democratic Party , Harbour @-@ front Enhancement Committee , Hong Kong Institute of Architects , People 's Sustainable Development Committee , Clear the Air , and Earth Care jointly met to urge the public to fight for the preservation of the pier . Over 1 @,@ 000 signatures were collected on that one day alone , in a petition to be submitted to Chief Executive Donald Tsang and other senior officials . In addition , a group of protesters began a peaceful sit @-@ in that day . So Sau Chung , veteran campaigner ( now a monk ) , whose hunger strike against Star Ferry fare increases triggered the riots in 1966 , came by to lend his support . 
 Further spurred by the start of demolition on the afternoon of 12 December 2006 , more protesters started gathering spontaneously after workers removed the bell and the clock face from the tower , leaving a big hole . Activists , including " Long Hair " Leung Kwok @-@ hung , rushed into and occupied part of the demolition site , chanting slogans from the roof of an excavator and demanded to meet Secretary for Housing , Planning and Lands , Michael Suen Ming @-@ yeung . 
 In addition to the public , Civic Party legislators , and Choy So @-@ yuk , a councillor from the pro @-@ government Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong , showed up to lend support . 
 The demolition drew widespread condemnation from the public , legislators , and conservationists , all of whom claimed the government action was contrary to the wishes of the public . Legco members tabled motions to immediately halt the demolition , pending further consultation . The Government denied a last @-@ minute reprieve , reiterating that there has been " adequate consultation " , and forged ahead with demolition . The Conservancy Association claimed it made its objection known in 1996 when Government proposed to construct a temporary road through the Edinburgh Place and that the Government has never consulted the public regarding demolition of the pier , or the adjacent Queen 's Pier . 
 After the demolition of the pier , the government said that it would consider the memories of the citizens and not the historic value of the building / structure before demolishing it . 
 Conservationists vowed to take the fight to Queen 's Pier , and a number of other historical sites threatened with a similar fate . At the end of 2006 , in a testament to how the protests have struck a chord with the public , the Ferry protesters were voted " Person of the Year " by RTHK Radio 3 . Local Action , the group of rather young cultural and media activists which formed the core of the movement , were to later influence social movements , in Hong Kong as well as in the mainland : part of the more militant " post 80s " generation , they are critical of government business collusion , a one @-@ sided development approach , Hong Kong 's subordinate status within China and the perceived lack of democracy in the territory , and have been involved in the fight for real political reform in Hong Kong , and against the Express Rail link to Guangzhou .

 Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back is a platform game in which the player character is the titular Crash Bandicoot . The goal of the game is to gather 25 crystals for Crash 's nemesis Doctor Neo Cortex . The crystals are scattered between 25 different levels , accessible via " Warp Rooms " , which are hub areas of the game . A level is cleared by collecting its respective crystal and reaching the end of its path , which returns Crash to the Warp Room . Each Warp Room contains 5 levels . When all five levels are cleared , the player must defeat a boss character before gaining access to the next Warp Room . The player is given a certain amount of lives , which are lost when Crash is attacked by an enemy , or falls into water or a pit . If all lives are lost at any point in the game , the " Game Over " screen will appear , at which point the character may continue from the last level . 
 Crash has the ability to jump into the air and land on an enemy character , spin in a tornado @-@ like fashion to knock enemies off @-@ screen , slide across the ground , and perform a body slam to break certain objects . Crash can jump higher than he normally can if he jumps immediately following a slide . All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most enemies , whom serve to deter Crash 's progress . Enemies with deadly topsides cannot be jumped on , while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam . Enemies with sharp necklines ( such as frill @-@ necked lizards or long @-@ legged robots with heated circumferences ) can only be defeated if Crash slides into them . 
 Boxes play a prominent role in Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back and can be broken with all of Crash 's techniques . Most boxes in the game contain " Wumpa Fruit " , which give the player an extra life if 100 of them are collected . Some boxes contain a Witch Doctor 's Mask , which shields Crash from one enemy 's attack while it is in his possession . If three of these masks are collected in a row , Crash is given temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers . If jumped upon , boxes with arrows pointing up propel Crash further into the air than he can ordinarily reach , and such boxes can be broken only with Crash 's spin attack . Boxes with an exclamation mark ( ! ) on them cause previously intangible objects in the area to solidify . TNT Boxes explode after a three @-@ second fuse when jumped on , while Nitro Boxes explode upon any physical contact . All of the Nitro Boxes in a level can be detonated at once if a green @-@ colored box with an exclamation mark ( ! ) on it is touched . Check Point boxes allow Crash to return to the point where the first Check Point box has been opened upon losing a life . If more than one Check Point box has been opened in a stage , Crash returns to the last Check Point box that has been opened . The player will earn a gem if they manage to destroy all the boxes , including Nitro Boxes and boxes on alternate routes , in a level . Certain gems can be acquired by other means , like reaching the end of a level within a certain time parameter , or completing a level without breaking any boxes . 
 " Bonus Paths " , signified by platforms with a question mark ( ? ) on them , lead Crash to a secret region of the level . In these areas , numerous Wumpa Fruit and extra lives can be earned if the player successfully navigates to the end of the path . If Crash falls off @-@ screen or is otherwise killed off , the player is unable to keep whatever was collected in the Bonus Path and is returned to the level from which the Bonus Path was accessed , keeping all lives the Player had previously collected .

 After Crash Bandicoot defeats Doctor Neo Cortex and rescues his girlfriend Tawna , Cortex falls from his lair down towards the Earth , his maniacal bid for world domination thwarted . After crashing , Cortex awakens in a dark cavern filled with glowing crystals . Convinced that they hold tremendous power , Cortex takes one and returns to his laboratory to examine it . He discovers that the planets will soon align , creating a catastrophic solar flux that threatens to destroy Earth itself . Learning that the crystals are the only means of containing this force , Cortex enlists the aid of his old colleague Doctor N. Gin and they design a new , upgraded , crystal @-@ powered " Cortex Vortex " to capture the stellar energy . Realizing they need 25 more crystals to power the device , Cortex devises a plot to manipulate Crash into retrieving the crystals for him . 
 One year later , Crash is living with his younger sister Coco on N. Sanity Island , one of the islands owned by Cortex in the previous game . After Coco 's laptop battery dies , she forces a sleeping Crash to get her a new one . While doing so , Crash is abducted by a bright light and finds himself in an old Warp Room hidden in Cortex 's castle , where a holographic projection of Cortex instructs him to bring him the crystals by traveling through the Warp Room 's doors . After Crash collects a crystal , Cortex informs Crash of the upcoming destructive force and assigns him the task of bringing all of the crystals to him so that he may contain it . After retrieving a gem , Crash is greeted by a hologram from Doctor Nitrus Brio , Cortex 's former assistant from the previous game , who is now out to stop Cortex 's plans for world domination . Brio explains that the Earth contains gems in addition to crystals , and that collecting 42 gems will allow Brio to fire a laser beam that can destroy the Cortex Vortex . 
 As Crash gathers the remaining crystals , he is attacked by several mutated animals dispatched by Brio , including the demented kangaroo Ripper Roo , the scimitar @-@ wielding Komodo Brothers Moe and Joe , and the <unk> Tiny Tiger . During Crash 's progression , Coco occasionally hacks into his holograph projector and warns Crash of her uncertainty of Cortex 's true intentions . It is not until Crash has gathered the crystals that Coco is able to reveal Cortex 's ultimate plan : with the energy harnessed from the planetary alignment , Cortex will power the gigantic Cortex Vortex built onto his space station and brainwash everyone on Earth into serving his army . Crash manages to defeat Cortex before the crystals can be used , but leaves the Cortex Vortex drifting aimlessly into space . Crash redeems himself by collecting the world 's gems for Brio , who reveals that the gems can harness planetary energy as well and invites him to the completion of his laser device ; Crash activates the laser and destroy the Cortex Vortex , breaking the space station apart . 
 = = Development = = 
 Production of Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back began in October 1996 . Development took place over the course of 13 months on a budget of $ 2 million . The concept art for the game 's environments was mainly created by Naughty Dog employees Bob Rafei , Eric Iwasaki , Erick <unk> , Charlotte Francis and Jason Rubin . The jungle levels were originally to have featured ground fog , but this was abandoned when magazines and the public began to criticize other developers for using fog to hide polygon count . Sunlight and depth accentuation was experimented with for these levels . Naughty Dog created the sewer levels as a way to work some " dirty " locations in the game . Color contrast was added to the levels to show depth and break up the monotony of sewer pipes . The character of Coco Bandicoot was created by Naughty Dog as a counterbalance to Tawna ( Crash 's girlfriend in the first game ) that would appease Sony Computer Entertainment Japan , who weren 't comfortable with a " super sexy " character being alongside Crash . Character designer Charles Zembillas drew the first sketches of Coco on March 18 , 1997 . 
 For the game , Crash Bandicoot co @-@ creator Andy Gavin programmed a new engine named " Game @-@ Oriented Object LISP 2 " ( <unk> 2 ) ; being three times faster than the previous game 's engine , it could handle ten times the animation frames and twice the polygon count . A flat plane z @-@ buffer was created for the game ; because the water surfaces and mud in the jungle had to be a flat plane and be exactly flat on the Y @-@ axis , there could be no waves and the subdividing plane could not be at an odd angle . The effect only worked on objects in the foreground and was only used on Crash , some enemies and a few boxes at the same time . 
 The soundtrack of Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back was written by Josh Mancell from Mutato Muzika , while the sound effects were created by Universal Sound Studios ( consisting of Mike Gollom , Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears ) . The characters were designed by Charles Zembillas of American Exitus , Incorporated . Clancy Brown provided the voice of Doctor Neo Cortex , while Brendan O 'Brien voiced the dual role of Crash Bandicoot , Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nitrus Brio and Vicki Winters voiced Coco Bandicoot . The game was unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta , Georgia on June 1997 to a positive response from the game industry . The game went into the alpha stage on August 1997 . Around that time , Dan Arey , the lead designer of Gex : Enter the Gecko , joined Naughty Dog and streamlined the level design . A death animation in which Crash is squashed into a stunned head and feet was altered for the Japanese version of the game due to its resemblance to the severed head and shoes left by a serial killer loose in Japan at the time .

 Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back received generally positive reviews from critics . John Broady of GameSpot considered the game to be superior to its predecessor , commenting positively on the Warp Room concept , improved game @-@ saving system and variety of the levels . The staff of IGN praised the " spot on " control and noted the decreased linearity of the game and increased intuition of the bonus levels compared to the first game . Mark Cooke of Game Revolution described the game as " undeniably fun " .
