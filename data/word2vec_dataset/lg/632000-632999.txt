 After the battle , the Turkish vizier of Niš , <unk> Pasha , ordered that the heads of Sinđelić and his men be skinned , stuffed and sent to the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II . The skulls were then returned to Niš , where the Turks built Skull Tower as a warning to future generations intending to revolt against the Ottoman Empire . The tower stands 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high , and originally consisted of 952 skulls embedded on four sides in fourteen rows . In the ensuing years , many skulls fell out from the tower walls , some were taken away for burial by relatives thinking they could identify the skulls of their deceased family members , and some were taken by souvenir hunters . Once the Ottomans withdrew from Niš in 1878 , the tower was roofed over to protect it from the elements . In 1892 , a chapel designed by the architect Dimitrije Leko was built over the tower with donations from across Serbia . A plaque dedicated near the chapel in 1904 reads : " To the first Serbian liberators after Kosovo . " The chapel was renovated in 1937 , and a bust of Sinđelić was added the following year . In 1948 , Skull Tower and the chapel enclosing it were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and came under the protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia . Further renovation of the chapel occurred again in 1989 . As of 2014 , 54 skulls remain on the tower , and the one that is said to belong to Sinđelić rests in a glass container .

 In the centuries following its construction , the tower has become a symbol of Serbian independence and a pilgrimage site for Serbs . It is considered one of the most visited places in Serbia , with 30 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 tourists visiting it annually . In the early 1830s , French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine wrote of the tower upon visiting Niš , which was at the time still part of the Ottoman Empire , saying : 
 I saw a large tower rising in the midst of the plain , as white as Parian marble ... [ R ] <unk> my eyes to the monument , I discovered that the walls , which I supposed to be built of marble or white stone , were composed of regular rows of human skulls ; these skulls bleached by the rain and sun , and cemented by a little sand and lime , formed entirely the triumphal arch which now sheltered me from the heat of the sun . In some places portions of hair were still hanging and waved , like lichen or moss , with every breath of wind . The mountain breeze , which was then blowing fresh , penetrated the innumerable cavities of the skulls , and sounded like mournful and plaintive sighs . My eyes and my heart greeted the remains of those brave men whose cut @-@ off heads made the cornerstone of the independence of their homeland . May the Serbs keep this monument ! It will always teach their children the value of the independence of a people , showing them the real price their fathers had to pay for it . 
 In 1849 British traveler Alexander William Kinglake described Skull Tower as the building that captivated him most in all of Ottoman Serbia , saying he was impressed by the " simple grandeur of the architect 's conception " and that he was struck by the " exquisite beauty of the fretwork . " An exhibition at the Military Museum in Belgrade contains a replica of the tower . Prior to the dissolution of Yugoslavia , tens of thousands of schoolchildren from across Yugoslavia visited the original in Niš .

 = Chalciporus piperatus = 
 Chalciporus piperatus , commonly known as the peppery bolete , is a small pored mushroom of the family Boletaceae found in mixed woodland in Europe and North America . It has been recorded under introduced trees in Brazil , and has become naturalised in Tasmania and spread under native Nothofagus cunninghamii trees . A small bolete , the fruit body has a 1 @.@ 6 – 9 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) orange @-@ fawn cap with cinnamon to brown pores underneath , and a 4 – 9 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 7 in ) high by 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 5 in ) thick stipe . The rare variety hypochryseus , found only in Europe , has yellow pores and tubes . 
 Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790 as Boletus piperatus , it is only distantly related to other members of the genus Boletus and was reclassified as Chalciporus piperatus by Frédéric Bataille in 1908 . The genus Chalciporus was an early branching lineage in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with parasitic properties . Previously thought to be ectomycorrhizal ( a symbiotic relationship that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species ) , C. piperatus is now suspected of being parasitic on Amanita muscaria . The flesh of C. piperatus has a very peppery taste , and can be used as a condiment or flavouring . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 French mycologist Pierre Bulliard described the species as Boletus piperatus in 1790 . In its taxonomic history , it has been transferred to the genera Leccinum ( Samuel Frederick Gray , 1821 ) , Viscipellis ( Lucien Quélet , 1886 ) , Ixocomus ( Quélet , 1888 ) , Suillus ( Otto Kuntze , 1898 ) , and Ceriomyces ( William Alphonso Murrill , 1909 ) . It was reclassified and given its current binomial name in 1908 by Frédéric Bataille when he made it the type species of the newly circumscribed genus Chalciporus . The species name piperatus means " peppery " in Latin . It is commonly known as the " peppery bolete " . 
 Chalciporus piperatus is a member of the genus Chalciporus , with which the genus <unk> form a group of fungi that is an early offshoot in the Boletaceae . Many members of the group appear to be parasitic . 
 Two varieties have been described . Chalciporus piperatus var. hypochryseus was originally described as Boletus hypochryseus by Czech mycologist Josef Šutara in 1993 , and was moved to Chalciporus a year later by Regis Courtecuisse . Wolfgang <unk> and Irmgard <unk> @-@ <unk> reclassified it as a variety of C. piperatus in 2006 , although some sources continue to regard it as a distinct species . Variety amarellus , first published by Quélet as Boletus amarellus in 1883 and later transferred to Chalciporus by Bataille in 1908 , was described as a variety of C. piperatus in 1974 by Albert Pilát and Aurel Dermek . Authorities disagree as to whether or not it has independent taxonomic significance . 
 = = Description = = 
 One of the smaller boletes , Chalciporus piperatus has an orange @-@ fawn 1 @.@ 6 – 9 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) cap that is initially convex before flattening out in age . The cap surface can be furrowed ; shiny when dry , it can be a little sticky when wet . The colour of the pore surface ranges from cinnamon to dark reddish brown in maturity . When bruised , the pore surface stains brown . Individual pores are angular , measuring about 0 @.@ 5 – 2 mm wide , while the tubes are 3 – 10 mm deep . Slender for a bolete , the stipe measures 4 – 9 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 7 in ) long by 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 5 in ) thick , and is either roughly the same width throughout its length , or slightly thicker near the base . The colour of the stem is similar to the cap , or lighter , and there is yellow mycelium at the base . The flesh is yellow , sometimes with reddish tones , maturing to purplish brown . It has no odour . The spore print is brown to cinnamon . Variety hypochryseus is essentially identical to the main form except for its bright yellow tubes and pores . Variety amarellus has pinker pores and a taste that is bitter rather than peppery . 
 The spores are smooth , narrowly fusiform ( fuse @-@ shaped ) , and measure 7 – 12 by 3 – 5 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) measure 20 – 28 by 6 – 8 µm and are hyaline ( translucent ) , four @-@ spored , and narrowly club @-@ shaped , with many internal oil droplets . Cystidia are fusiform , sometimes with a rounded tip , and have dimensions of 30 – 50 by 9 – 12 µm . Some are more or less hyaline , while others are encrusted with a golden pigment . The cap cuticle is a trichodermium , an arrangement in which the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel , like hairs , perpendicular to the cap surface . These hyphae are 10 – 17 µm wide and have elliptical to cylindrical cells at their ends that are not gelatinous . Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The fruit body of the North American species Chalciporus <unk> are similar , but can be distinguished by its flesh and pores staining blue after cutting or bruising . It has a less peppery taste . Another mild @-@ tasting relative , C. <unk> , has brighter colours than C. piperatus , including completely red tubes . One European species , C. <unk> , has a shape similar to C. piperatus , but has red pores and a stem covered in red dots . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Fruit bodies of Chalciporus piperatus occur singly , scattered , or in groups on the ground . The fungus occurs naturally in or near coniferous or beech and oak woodlands , often on sandy soils . Fruit bodies appear in Europe in late summer and autumn from August to November . The fungus is widespread across North America , fruiting from July to October in the eastern states and from September to January on the Pacific Coast . It is found in Mexico and Central America . In Asia , it has been collected from Pakistan , West Bengal ( India ) , and Guangdong Province ( China ) . In South Africa , it is known from the southwestern Cape Province and the eastern Transvaal Province . 
 Chalciporus piperatus grows in conifer plantations associated with the fly agaric ( Amanita muscaria ) and the chanterelle ( Cantharellus cibarius ) . It has been recorded under introduced loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ) plantations in Santa Catarina and Paraná states in southern Brazil , and under introduced trees in the Los Lagos Region of Chile . It has also spread into native forest in northeastern Tasmania and Victoria , having been found growing with the native myrtle beech ( Nothofagus cunninghamii ) . The rare variety hypochryseus occurs only in Europe , including Austria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Italy , and Spain . Also rare , variety amarellus is widespread in European coniferous forests , where it usually found near pines , spruce , and sometimes fir . 
 Fruit bodies can be parasitised by the mould Sepedonium <unk> , a highly specialised <unk> that is only known to infect this bolete . Infections result in necrotic mushroom tissue and the production of copious yellow conidia . 
 Initially thought to be ectomycorrhizal ( symbiotic with plants , like most Boletaceae ) , C. piperatus has not been confirmed as such in multiple synthesis studies or in isotope fractionation studies . There is some speculation that C. piperatus is a <unk> on the mycorrhiza of Amanita muscaria . In New Zealand , A. muscaria is thought to have been introduced with Pinus radiata , and has made a host jump to the native Nothofagus trees ; C. piperatus has since been observed fruiting near Nothofagus trees with A. muscaria associations . <unk> lignicola is in the same clade as C. piperatus and is thought to be a parasite as well , strengthening the evidence that C. piperatus and its relatives may be <unk> . 
 = = Uses = = 
 This mushroom is edible but very peppery . The Italian chef Antonio Carluccio recommends only using it to add flavour to other mushrooms . It has been used as a condiment in many countries . The mushroom should be well @-@ cooked before consumption to minimize the risk of gastric symptoms ; the peppery taste is lost with cooking . In powdered form , it loses its peppery taste quickly . Some guidebooks classify C. piperatus as inedible . Fruit bodies can be used for mushroom dyeing ; depending on the mordant used , yellow , orange , or greenish @-@ brown dyes can be made . 
 = = Chemistry = = 
 <unk> , a pigment compound originally isolated from the common <unk> ( Scleroderma citrinum ) , is the major contributor to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of C. piperatus fruit bodies . Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include norbadione A , <unk> , xerocomic acid , variegatic acid , variegatorubin , and another yellow pigment , <unk> . <unk> is responsible for the bitter taste of the fruit bodies . The pigments <unk> , <unk> , and norbadione A are derived biosynthetically from xerocomic acid . Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the <unk> isomers <unk> and <unk> . 
 A field study of fungi growing in polluted sites in the Czech and Slovak Republics found that C. piperatus fruit bodies growing near lead smelters and on mine and slag dumps had the greatest ability to bioaccumulate the element antimony . In one collection , an " extremely high " level of the element was detected — 1423 milligrams of antimony per kilogram of dried mushroom . In comparison , the antimony levels detected in other common terrestrial fungi from the same area , both saprobic and ectomycorrhizal , were more than an order of magnitude smaller . 
 = Clinton D. " Casey " Vincent = 
 Clinton D. " Casey " Vincent ( November 29 , 1914 – July 5 , 1955 ) was an American flying ace who became the second youngest general officer in United States Army Air Forces history . Vincent was one of Claire Chennault 's two top fighter commanders in the China Burma India Theater of World War II , and served as the model for two comic strip characters by Milton Caniff : " Colonel Vince Casey " , and " Brigadier General P.G. ' Shanty ' Town " . 
 Vincent planned and carried out daring offensive air tactics in China , forming the 14th Air Force Forward Echelon which staged out of forward airfields to attack the enemy unexpectedly . The successful concept was twinned and reorganized by Chennault into two mixed @-@ aircraft groups , with Vincent commanding one of them , the 68th Composite Wing . A string of Allied victories throughout 1943 caused the Japanese to plan a major retaliatory move . Beginning in May 1944 , the airmen were hit repeatedly and forced into retreat as the Japanese implemented Operation Ichi @-@ Go . Vincent 's men demolished their valuable airbases and fell back to Chennault 's stronghold at Kunming . Vincent returned to the U.S. afterward , his tour of duty complete . 
 Back home , Vincent was put in command of a training wing and in 1946 was asked to teach at the Air War College . Following this , he held the position of second @-@ in @-@ command of the Western Air Defense Force . Vincent died of a heart attack in 1955 . The United States Air Force ( USAF ) named an air base after him in 1956 : the Vincent Air Force Base in Yuma , Arizona . The airfield was turned over to the Marines in 1962 , and is today the very busy Marine Corps Air Station Yuma ( Vincent Field ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Clinton Dermott Vincent was born in 1914 in the small town of Gail , Texas . His parents , Carvin Wyoming Vincent and the former Rosa Lee Burgess , produced 10 or 11 children — Vincent was the youngest . He was nicknamed " Casey " from youth . While still a small child , Vincent moved with his family to Natchez , Mississippi , where he went to school . After excelling in high school , Vincent was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point , becoming a cadet on July 1 , 1932 . Vincent graduated on June 12 , 1936 , and became a second lieutenant . 
 Vincent transferred to the Air Corps and took primary flight training at Randolph Field in Texas , about 500 miles ( 800 km ) from his parents back home . In January 1937 , during his primary training , his mother died in Natchez at the age of 65 . Following primary , Vincent took the attack course in advanced flying at Kelly Field in San Antonio , Texas . During a dance held at the officer 's club , he met Margaret " Peggy " Hennessey , a young woman with an infant daughter , and fell in love . In November 1937 , he was posted operations officer for the 19th Pursuit Squadron at Wheeler Field near Pearl Harbor . Hennessey traveled to Hawaii to be with him , and on February 10 , 1938 , they married — the couple celebrated the birth of a daughter named Thayer on December 17 . The young father rose in rank to first lieutenant in June 1939 , then was promoted to captain on October 7 , 1940 . In November 1940 , Vincent transferred to the newly formed 35th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field in Northern California where he served as squadron commander . The Group trained in several fighter aircraft types , including Seversky P @-@ 35s , P @-@ 36 Hawks , P @-@ 39 Airacobras and P @-@ 40 Warhawks . Vincent advanced to group operations officer , then executive officer , then in December 1941 was made group commander . 
 On December 5 , two days before the attack on Pearl Harbor , Vincent 's wife pinned the gold leaves of a major on his shoulders . That evening , the 35th Pursuit Group shipped out for overseas duty in Manila , to join the group 's 21st and 34th Squadrons already there . The next day Peggy Vincent began to drive her two daughters to San Antonio to be with family . On December 7 when Hawaii was attacked by Japanese naval forces , the unarmed ship carrying Vincent , traveling with no escort , was ordered to return immediately to San Francisco Bay . Vincent remained in California for another month , joined by his wife and daughter , during which time he learned that Manila had fallen , and that fellow Group pilot Sam <unk> , a friend from West Point , had died in its defense . On January 12 , 1942 , the USS Mariposa sailed in convoy with Vincent aboard , headed for the Far East . 
 = = China = = 
 Vincent arrived in Melbourne , Australia , in early February , then sailed in a different convoy to Perth . In March , he sailed to Karachi , India , and was posted to Karachi American Air Base , one of the more distant ports that supplied The Hump . There , Vincent served as Director of Pursuit Training for the Tenth Air Force at the rank of lieutenant colonel . Wishing for a combat post , in November 1942 he was ordered by Clayton Bissell , commander Tenth Air Force , to transfer to China to join General Claire Chennault and his China Air Task Force ( CATF ) , a group formed from the Flying Tigers . Bissell 's orders specified Vincent take the position of Chennault 's executive officer , to apply a dose of West Point regimen to the haphazard CATF paperwork , but Chennault , irked at this maneuver by his 2 @,@ 200 @-@ mile ( 3 @,@ 500 km ) distant superior , instead assigned Vincent operations officer . Three days into the new job , Vincent wrote in his diary , " Any similarity between the China Air Task Force and a military organization is purely accidental . " He observed that administrative procedures were poor . " ... the Group just runs by itself . All Colonel Scott ( Robert Lee Scott , Jr . ) cares about is fighting — and he is good at that ! " 
 Vincent cared little what title he served under — he just wanted to fly in combat . After instituting procedural changes regarding the format of official reports originating from CATF , he assigned himself his first air combat flight on November 22 , escorting bombers against the harbor of Haiphong on the coast of French Indochina , during which he dropped a bomb from his fighter into the harbor 's dock area . Five days later , he scored his first aerial victory : a fixed @-@ undercarriage Japanese fighter he encountered during an attack on Canton in which 10 B @-@ 25s and 22 P @-@ 40s downed some 16 to 22 enemy aircraft . Vincent noted that he was effectively serving three desk jobs — " ' <unk> ' , ' Intelligence ' , and ' Operations ' " — but that Chennault was pleased to find his new administrator a skilled pilot eager to fight . 
 In the final weeks of 1942 , the CATF was often grounded by bad weather . Vincent flew combat in Peggy I on December 12 , but two days later he was ordered by Chennault , at Bissell 's insistence , to refrain from flying a mission he had planned . Another pilot took Peggy I on that mission but belly @-@ landed the aircraft on a road . Vincent borrowed a different aircraft to fly reconnaissance missions on December 17 and 19 , but stayed on the ground again during a short visit by Bissell , to satisfy his expectations . General Joseph Stilwell flew in on December 22 to award Chennault the Distinguished Service Medal , and to take him to Chungking , the provisional wartime capital of China . Left in charge of CATF for the rest of December , Vincent led the combat missions he put together . On December 24 he was awarded the Silver Star for his combat performance . 
 In early January 1943 , Vincent was officially made executive officer of the CATF , taking over the multiple leadership roles held previously by Scott and by Merian C. Cooper , who were both heading home . He checked out in a C @-@ 53 transport , flew it to Chungking for a " short visit with Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ Shek " , and was promoted to colonel . On January 24 , Albert " Ajax " <unk> flew a captured and repaired Mitsubishi A6M Zero from Kweilin , and Vincent put it through its paces to become one of only five pilots in the " Zero Club " — China @-@ based U.S. pilots who test @-@ flew this particular aircraft . Starved of fuel and supplies in February , the CATF mounted few missions ; during the same period , Commanding General of the USAAF Henry H. Arnold visited with Chennault and Vincent to inform them that a group of fuel @-@ hungry heavy bombers were to be assigned to the CATF , under Colonel Royden Eugene Beebe , Jr . 
 = = = Fourteenth Air Force = = = 
 On March 10 , 1943 , the China Air Task Force became the Fourteenth Air Force , and Vincent was made chief of staff . He prevailed upon Chennault to let him take a fighter squadron deeper into enemy territory via advance bases where the fliers would stop to refuel and re @-@ arm . In May 1943 , a forward echelon commanded by Vincent with Tex Hill as vice commander was flown out of bases in east China , along the Hengyang – Kweilin line . This bold thrust into enemy @-@ held territory put all major Japanese airbases from north China to Indochina and Thailand under threat of U.S. air attack . Flying Peggy II , a new P @-@ 40K he received on June 2 , Vincent racked up four more aerial victories , making him an ace , then number six on August 26 , 1943 . For this , he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Legion of Merit ; the latter " for outstanding leadership of a small force , which , against numerically superior air strength , succeeded in disrupting enemy communications and routing troop columns . " Chennault forbade him from any further combat missions . 
 Meanwhile , back home in San Antonio , Texas in early 1943 , Peggy Vincent wrote to cartoonist Milton Caniff to tell him that her husband was working under Chennault in China , much like the characters in Caniff 's comic strip Terry and the Pirates . Peggy Vincent sent Caniff photographs of her husband and told the cartoonist about his flying exploits . Caniff worked the flier into his comic strip as " Colonel Vince Casey " around March 1943 . In September and October 1943 , Vincent was rotated back home on leave during which he met Caniff . Nine months after the visit , a second daughter was born to the Vincents , named Patricia . 
 Upon his return to CBI , Vincent was informed that reconnaissance flights over Formosa ( Taiwan ) showed a growing concentration of Japanese aircraft . To Vincent , they appeared vulnerable to attack from advance bases , so he and Hill planned a long @-@ range mission . On Thanksgiving Day , November 25 , 1943 , Vincent sent Hill in command of a mixed force of eight early Allison @-@ engined P @-@ 51 Mustangs , eight P @-@ 38 Lightnings and fourteen B @-@ 25 Mitchells against 100 bombers and 112 fighters at Hsinchu Air Base — the attackers destroyed 15 of 20 defending fighters as well as 27 enemy bombers on the ground without loss to themselves . Four days later flying escort to B @-@ 24 Liberator heavy bombers , Vincent led the 23d Fighter Group against Tien Ho airdrome at Canton — the group shot down 13 of 20 defending fighters . 
 The Formosa attack was one of the most devastating in the CBI Theater — it catalyzed the Japanese to lay plans to invade and seize the advance airfields Vincent had developed in east China . These plans became one of the two primary goals of Operation Ichi @-@ Go , Japan 's 1944 invasion of east China . 
 As an expansion of the 14th Air Force Forward Echelon , the 68th Composite Wing was formed in December 1943 . Vincent commanded the 68th for its first year . The mixed unit was composed of fighters , fighter bombers and medium bombers , flown by both American and Chinese airmen . Vincent flew a B @-@ 25 Mitchell bomber to lead his men in some of the bombing raids . More than 500 @,@ 000 tons of Japanese shipping were sunk by Vincent 's airmen , and the Japanese air power was greatly reduced south of the Yangtze River . On June 2 , 1944 , Vincent was promoted to temporary brigadier general , the second youngest general officer in the USAAF . It had taken him only seven years to rise from second lieutenant to general . An article about the meteoric rise of young military officers was printed in Time on June 19 , 1944 . Among other officers mentioned , Vincent was described as 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) tall , 175 pounds ( 80 kg ) , a six @-@ kill ace and the prototype for the cartoon character Vince Casey . Of Vincent , Caniff said that he " picked his brain " about living and fighting conditions in China . 
 Vincent commanded the 68th Composite Group with Tex Hill as his deputy during the whole of the Japanese Operation Ichi @-@ Go of 1944 . The Americans in their advance bases were thrown on the defensive . In late June , Vincent ordered the evacuation of the base built at Hengyang , destroying it with explosives so that the Japanese could not make use of the buildings or the airstrip . Directly afterward , Vincent was called to attend a formal dinner with American and Chinese generals and ambassadors , honoring Vice President Henry A. Wallace who was on a fact @-@ finding mission . Meeting after dinner in his office , Vincent told Wallace " the unvarnished truth — that , barring a miracle , the Japanese will have all of east China by July 15 ! " 
 Japanese supply problems in east China were as critical as American ones , and the Japanese advance was slowed until September when Vincent was forced to retreat and destroy his advance base at <unk> . The same treatment befell his own headquarters at Kweilin in October . As he circled Kweilin one final time in his command B @-@ 25 , he said to Time magazine writer Theodore H. White ( who was evacuating as well ) , " I 'm going to write a book about this campaign . I 'm going to call it Fire and Fall Back . " A month later , Vincent 's HQ , relocated to <unk> , was abandoned , with the 68th retreating to the 14th Air Force stronghold at Kunming . On December 13 , 1944 , both Hill and Vincent completed their tours of duty and left China , Vincent to command the 30th Training Wing at Turner Field in Georgia . 
 = = Postwar career = = 
 In 1946 , Vincent reverted to the permanent rank of captain and began teaching at the Air War College . During this time , the United States Air Force ( USAF ) was formed from the USAAF . From 1949 to 1955 , Vincent rose in rank , reaching temporary brigadier general once again in 1951 . A son was born to him , named Clinton D. Vincent , Jr . , nicknamed Casey Junior . 
 In 1951 Caniff , who started a new comic strip entitled Steve Canyon four years earlier , used Vincent as a model for a new character , this time making him the youthful " Brigadier General P.G. ' Shanty ' Town " . Caniff made General Town into a hard @-@ working peacetime general , concerned with the defense of America . 
 In 1953 , Vincent was placed second in command under Major General Walter E. Todd , Commander Western Air Defense Force . Todd 's station was at Hamilton Air Force Base near San Francisco . As Vice Commander , Vincent took an active role in defense developments such as the EC @-@ 121 Warning Star , a large radar @-@ equipped aircraft that held a rotating crew of 31 for extended flights , used to detect the approach of enemy aircraft and to coordinate fighter interception . Vincent held the position until mid @-@ 1955 . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 In 1955 , Vincent was ordered to Ent Air Force Base in Colorado Springs , Colorado where he was to serve as deputy chief of staff for operations of the Continental Air Command . On July 5 at the age of 40 , after one full day at his new post , Vincent went to bed at his residence on the air base and died of a heart attack in his sleep . His wife , three daughters and one son were still at their residence on Hamilton AFB in California , preparing to move , when they received word . Caniff responded to the tragic news by having his character General Town die from overwork . 
 On September 1 , 1956 , Yuma Air Force Base was renamed Vincent Air Force Base in Vincent 's honor . A plaque commemorating the event was unveiled by Vincent 's widow , Peggy Vincent , at a ceremony held on October 12 . 
 In 1975 , Vincent 's war diaries were made into a book : Fire and Fall Back : the World War Two " CBI " story of " Casey " Vincent , compiled and edited by author Glenn E. McClure . " Tex " Hill said of Vincent and the diaries " He was strong , smart — just one hell of a good man . He was never recognized for what he did . He handled it well in China . But you could tell in his diary that he felt like he 'd been left hanging . " 
 = 1920 Louisiana hurricane = 
 The 1920 Louisiana hurricane was a strong tropical cyclone that caused significant damage in parts of Louisiana in September 1920 . The second tropical storm and hurricane of the annual hurricane season , it formed from an area of disturbed weather on September 16 , 1920 , northwest of Colombia . The system remained a weak tropical depression as it made landfall on Nicaragua , but later intensified to tropical storm strength as it moved across the Gulf of Honduras , prior to making a second landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula . Once in the Gulf of Mexico , the storm quickly intensified as it moved towards the north @-@ northwest , reaching its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) prior to making landfall near Houma , Louisiana with no change in intensity . Afterwards , it quickly weakened over land , before dissipating on September 23 over eastern Kansas . 
 As it approached the United States Gulf Coast , the hurricane forced an estimated 4 @,@ 500 people to evacuate off of Galveston Island , and numerous other evacuations and precautionary measures to occur . At landfall , the hurricane generated strong winds along a wide swath of the coast , uprooting trees and causing damage to homes and other infrastructure . Heavy rainfall associated with the storm peaked at 11 @.@ 9 in ( 300 mm ) in Robertsdale , Alabama . The heavy rains also washed out railroads , leading to several rail accidents . Across the Gulf Coast , damage from the storm totaled to $ 1 @.@ 45 million , and one death was associated with the hurricane . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In mid @-@ September , a trough moved across the central Caribbean Sea and into the vicinity of the Colombian islands . Becoming more organized , it developed a closed circulation on September 16 , and as such was classified as a tropical depression at 0600 UTC that day . For much of its early existence the depression remained weak , with winds remaining at 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure below 1 @,@ 005 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . The weak disturbance later made landfall at that intensity on the Mosquito Coast near the border of Honduras and Nicaragua by 0600 UTC on September 18 . The small system gained intensity as it moved over Honduras , attaining tropical storm strength on September 19 prior to entering the Gulf of Honduras near Trujillo , Colón . In the Gulf of Honduras , the tropical storm slightly intensified to maximum sustained winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) on September 20 , and later made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula as it accelerated towards the north @-@ northwest . Despite initially being reported to have maintained intensity across the peninsula , a reanalysis of the storm determined that it had weakened to minimal tropical storm strength , before entering the Gulf of Mexico late on September 20 . 
 The weakened tropical storm began to intensify once in the Gulf of Mexico . On September 20 at 0600 UTC , the storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern day Category 1 hurricane . Continuing to intensify in the Gulf , the hurricane attained Category 2 hurricane intensity at 0000 UTC on September 22 , and subsequently reached its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and an estimated minimum pressure of 975 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) . The hurricane later made landfall at peak intensity near Houma , Louisiana at 0100 UTC later that day . Maximum winds spanned 32 mi ( 51 km ) from the center at landfall . Ships offshore the Louisiana coast also reported an eye associated with the hurricane . Once over land , the system began to quickly weaken , degenerating to tropical storm strength by 0600 UTC the same day , while located near Iberville Parish . Continuing to accelerate towards the north @-@ northwest , it is estimated that the tropical cyclone dissipated on September 23 over Kansas , based on observations from nearby weather stations .

 Hurricane warnings were initially issued for areas of the Gulf Coast between Morgan City , Louisiana and Corpus Christi , Texas , but were later moved eastward to coastal regions between Pensacola , Florida and New Orleans as the hurricane progressed closer to the coast . Additional marine warnings were also issued for offshore regions that could be potentially affected by the hurricane , and boats were evacuated into Gulf Coast ports . Onshore , freight trains on Galveston Island were moved to the mainland in preparation for the storm . Interurban railways also evacuated people out of the island , with an estimated 4 @,@ 500 people being evacuated . The United States Coast Guard were ordered to be ready for immediate service in the event of an emergency , while the US National Guard on strike duty in Galveston 's Camp Hutchings were transferred to a barracks in Fort Crockett . Oil companies abandoned operations in coastal oil fields in advance of the hurricane . People along Lake Ponchartrain evacuated into New Orleans , causing hotels to overflow and forcing refugees to take shelter in other public buildings including post offices . 
 Strong winds and gusts were reported across the Gulf Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico . A ship reported a minimum central barometric pressure of 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) just prior to the storm 's intensification into a hurricane . Grand Isle , Louisiana reported sustained winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) , and winds of at least 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) were reported as far east as Bay St. Louis , Mississippi . As a result , numerous trees were uprooted and power lines were downed . One death occurred New Orleans after being electrocuted by an electric wire that had been downed by the hurricane 's strong winds . The downed power lines also caused a lack of communication from areas affected , hampering relief efforts . In New Orleans , at least 2 @,@ 500 telephones were without service , and homes were unroofed by the strong winds . Along the coast and further inland , rainfall was concentrated primarily on the eastern half of the cyclone , with most rain occurring from September 21 to the 23rd . In Robertsdale , Alabama , 11 @.@ 9 in ( 300 mm ) of rain was recorded , the most associated with the hurricane . A 24 – hour September rainfall record was set when 1 @.@ 60 in ( 41 mm ) of rain was measured in Kelly , Louisiana . However , due to the system 's rapid dissipation over land , rainfall amounts remained generally less than 2 in ( 51 mm ) in interior regions of Louisiana . In Texas , rainfall peaked at 1 @.@ 20 in ( 30 mm ) in Beaumont . The heavy rains caused washouts and damage to railroads across Louisiana . A train running from Louisville , Kentucky to Nashville , Tennessee was left stranded after being washed out near Chef <unk> Pass , and other rail operations were stopped between New Orleans and Mobile , Alabama . Tides of 5 – 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 8 m ) above average were reported in Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound as the hurricane moved over the coast , while tides of 5 @.@ 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) above average were reported in Biloxi , Mississippi . The strong storm surge caused considerable damage to Grand Isle and Manilla Village , Louisiana . Due to the hurricane 's landfall near low tide , however , major storm surge impacts were mitigated . Overall infrastructural damage caused by the hurricane totaled to $ 750 @,@ 000 , while crop related damage , particularly to rice and sugar cane , totaled to $ 700 @,@ 000 . 
 = Courageous @-@ class aircraft carrier = 
 The Courageous class , sometimes called the Glorious class , was the first multi @-@ ship class of aircraft carriers to serve with the Royal Navy . The three ships — Furious , Courageous and Glorious — were originally laid down as " large light cruisers " ( battlecruisers ) to be used in the Baltic Project during the First World War . While very fast , their minimal armour and few guns limited their long @-@ term utility in the post @-@ war Royal Navy and they were laid up after the war . They were considered capital ships by the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy . Rather than scrap them , the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty . 
 Furious , already partially converted during the war , began her reconstruction in 1921 , before the Treaty came into effect . She was given a three @-@ quarters @-@ length flight deck . In attempt to minimize air turbulence she was given no superstructure or " island " . This was not entirely satisfactory and a small island was added in 1939 . Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel ; instead , her boiler uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck , or the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress . The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been . Her half @-@ sisters , Courageous and Glorious , began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion . They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel , increasing their aircraft capacity by one @-@ third and making it safer to land . 
 As the first large , or " fleet " , carrier completed by the Royal Navy , Furious was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures , including the first @-@ ever carrier night @-@ landing in 1926 . Courageous became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was torpedoed in September 1939 by a German submarine . Glorious unsuccessfully hunted the German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee in the Indian Ocean in 1939 . She participated in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940 , but was sunk by two German battleships in June when she was unwisely allowed to sail home with minimal escort . Furious spent the first months of the war hunting for German raiders and escorting convoys before she began to support British forces in Norway . She spent most of 1940 in Norwegian waters making attacks on German installations and shipping , and most of 1941 ferrying aircraft to West Africa , Gibraltar and Malta before refitting in the United States . She ferried aircraft to Malta as part of the Malta Convoys during 1942 and provided air support to British forces during Operation Torch . Furious spent most of 1943 training with the Home Fleet , but made numerous air strikes against the German battleship Tirpitz and other targets in Norway in 1944 . The old ship was worn out by late 1944 , so she was reduced to reserve status in September before being paid off in 1945 and sold for scrap in 1948 . 
 = = Careers as battlecruisers = = 
 The first two ships of the class , Courageous and Glorious , spent the First World War on North Sea patrols , climaxing in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 . Their half @-@ sister Furious was designed with a pair of 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) guns — as opposed to four 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) — but was modified while being built to hold a flying @-@ off deck and hangar in lieu of her forward turret and barbette . She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added . Her aircraft attacked Zeppelin sheds during the Tondern raid in July 1918 . 
 All three ships were reduced to reserve after the war . The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage ; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped . However , up to 66 @,@ 000 long tons ( 67 @,@ 000 t ) of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers , and the Royal Navy decided to utilize the Courageous @-@ class ships due to their high speed . Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s . 
 = = Conversions = = 
 Furious had been fitted during the First World War with a flying @-@ off and landing deck , but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel . She was laid up after the war , but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925 . Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers : Argus , less than three years old , and Eagle , which had only carried out 143 deck landings during preliminary sea trials in 1920 . 
 Furious 's superstructure , masts , funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a 576 @-@ by @-@ 92 @-@ foot ( 175 @.@ 6 by 28 @.@ 0 m ) flight deck that extended over three @-@ quarters of her length . This flight deck was not level ; it sloped upwards about three @-@ quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft , which had no brakes at the time it was designed . That era 's fore @-@ and @-@ aft arresting gear , initially 320 feet ( 97 @.@ 5 m ) long on Furious , was not intended to stop landing aircraft — the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind — but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck . Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence . To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck , Furious was flush @-@ decked and lacked an island , like Argus ; instead she was provided with a retractable <unk> at the forward end of the flight deck . 
 A two @-@ level hangar was built under the flight deck , each level being 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high . The lower hangar was 550 feet ( 167 @.@ 6 m ) long by 35 – 50 feet ( 10 @.@ 7 – 15 @.@ 2 m ) wide and the upper was 520 by 50 feet ( 158 @.@ 5 by 15 @.@ 2 m ) . Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers . Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck , or , when landing operations were in progress , out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship . This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space , made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree . Her original flying @-@ off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks . Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck . Two 47 @-@ by @-@ 46 @-@ foot ( 14 @.@ 3 by 14 @.@ 0 m ) lifts ( elevators ) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars . Two 600 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 2 @,@ 700 l ; 720 US gal ) ready @-@ use petrol tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship 's boats on the upper deck . An additional 20 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 91 @,@ 000 l ; 24 @,@ 000 US gal ) of petrol were in bulk storage . The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard Furious in 1926 had shown that deck @-@ edge palisades were effective in reducing cross @-@ deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side . Furious 's long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations , and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry . 
 Glorious and Courageous were converted to aircraft carriers after Furious began her reconstruction , Courageous at Devonport starting on 29 June 1924 , and Glorious at Rosyth on 14 February 1924 . The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after Furious was finished . Their design was based on Furious with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed . All superstructure , guns , and fittings down to the main deck were removed . A two @-@ storey hangar , each level 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) high and 550 feet ( 167 @.@ 6 m ) long , was built on top of the remaining hull ; the upper hangar level opened onto a short " flying @-@ off deck " , below and forward of the main flight deck . Two slightly larger 46 @-@ by @-@ 48 @-@ foot ( 14 @.@ 0 by 14 @.@ 6 m ) lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck . An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge , flying control station , and funnel , as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared . By 1939 both ships could carry 34 @,@ 500 imperial gallons ( 157 @,@ 000 l ; 41 @,@ 400 US gal ) of petrol .

 The Courageous @-@ class ships had an overall length of 786 feet 9 inches ( 239 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 90 feet 6 inches ( 27 @.@ 6 m ) , and a draught of 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) at deep load . These were increases of 9 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 9 m ) in beam and over 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers . They displaced 24 @,@ 210 long tons ( 24 @,@ 600 t ) at normal load and 26 @,@ 990 long tons ( 27 @,@ 420 t ) at deep load , increases of over 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) . Their metacentric height declined from 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) at deep load to 4 @.@ 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 3 m ) and the ships had a complete double bottom . In 1939 , Courageous had a complement of 807 officers and enlisted men , plus 403 men in her air group . 
 Their half @-@ sister Furious was the same length , but had a beam of 89 feet 0 @.@ 75 inches ( 27 @.@ 1 m ) , and an average draught of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) at deep load , two feet deeper than before the conversion . She displaced 22 @,@ 500 long tons ( 22 @,@ 900 t ) at normal load and 26 @,@ 500 long tons ( 26 @,@ 900 t ) at deep load , over 3 @,@ 000 long tons more than her previous displacement of 19 @,@ 513 long tons ( 19 @,@ 826 t ) at load and 22 @,@ 890 long tons ( 23 @,@ 260 t ) at deep load . Furious 's metacentric height was 3 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load , a reduction of 1 @.@ 48 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) after her conversion . In 1932 , Furious had a complement of 738 officers and enlisted men , plus 468 men in her air group . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Courageous @-@ class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines . Arranged in two engine rooms , each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts . Furious 's propellers were 11 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by 18 Yarrow small @-@ tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 90 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 67 @,@ 000 kW ) at a working pressure of 235 psi ( 1 @,@ 620 kPa ; 17 kgf / cm2 ) . No significant changes to the machinery were made during the conversion process to any of the three ships , but their increased displacement reduced their speed to approximately 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . 
 Furious 's fuel capacity was increased by 700 long tons ( 710 t ) during her reconstruction , which increased her range to 7 @,@ 480 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 850 km ; 8 @,@ 610 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The maximum fuel capacity of Courageous and Glorious was increased during the conversion to 3 @,@ 800 long tons ( 3 @,@ 900 t ) of fuel oil , giving them an endurance of 6 @,@ 630 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 280 km ; 7 @,@ 630 mi ) at 10 knots . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Furious retained ten of her original eleven breech @-@ loading BL 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk I guns , five on each side , for self @-@ defence from enemy warships . They fired 82 @-@ pound ( 37 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 790 ft / s ( 850 m / s ) . Their maximum range was 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) at their maximum elevation of 25 ° , and the rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute . 
 Half a dozen QF 4 @-@ inch Mark V guns replaced her original anti @-@ aircraft guns . Four were mounted on the sides of the flying @-@ off deck and two on the quarterdeck . They had a maximum depression of − 5 ° and a maximum elevation of 80 ° . The guns fired a 31 @-@ pound ( 14 kg ) high explosive ( HE ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 387 ft / s ( 728 m / s ) at a rate of 10 to 15 rounds per minute . The guns had a maximum ceiling of 31 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 400 m ) , but an effective range of much less . The four guns on the flying @-@ off deck were removed during trials of the lower flight deck in 1926 – 27 , but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded . 
 Four single QF 2 @-@ pounder pom @-@ poms were installed by 1927 . During Furious 's September 1930 – February 1932 refit , her anti @-@ aircraft outfit was changed by the substitution of two eight @-@ barrel 2 @-@ pounder pom @-@ pom mounts for the forward 4 @-@ inch guns on the flying @-@ off deck removed earlier . The Mark V mount could depress to − 10 ° and elevate to a maximum of 80 ° . The Mark VIII 2 @-@ pounder gun fired a 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) .91 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 41 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 920 ft / s ( 590 m / s ) to a distance of 3 @,@ 800 yards ( 3 @,@ 500 m ) . The gun 's rate of fire was approximately 96 – 98 rounds per minute . 
 The 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 mm ) and 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns were replaced during Furious 's refit in early 1939 by a dozen QF 4 @-@ inch Mk XVI guns in twin dual @-@ purpose Mark XIX mounts . One mount each was on the former flying @-@ off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side . The Mark XIX mount could depress to − 10 ° and elevate to a maximum of 80 ° . The Mark XVI gun fired 15 – 20 35 @-@ pound ( 16 kg ) HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 660 ft / s ( 810 m / s ) . Against surface targets it had a range of 19 @,@ 850 yards ( 18 @,@ 150 m ) and a maximum ceiling of 31 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 400 m ) , but an effective anti @-@ aircraft range of much less . Two more Mark V 2 @-@ pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time . 
 During the Second World War , Furious , the only surviving ship of the three , received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic 20 mm Oerlikon light anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns , which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50 @-@ calibre machine gun mount . The Oerlikon fired a .272 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 123 kg ) HE shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 750 ft / s ( 840 m / s ) . The maximum ceiling was 10 @,@ 000 feet and the maximum range was 4 @,@ 800 yards ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) although the effective range was under 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) . The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute , but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload magazines . 
 A mix of single @-@ purpose anti @-@ surface and anti @-@ aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for Courageous and Glorious by the Admiralty , but was ultimately rejected for a dual @-@ purpose armament of sixteen QF 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mark VIII guns in single high @-@ angle mounts . One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck . The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship . These mounts could depress to − 5 ° and elevate to a maximum of 90 ° . The Mark VIII guns fired a 50 @-@ pound ( 23 kg ) HE shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 457 ft / s ( 749 m / s ) at a rate of eight to twelve rounds per minute . The guns had a maximum ceiling of 32 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 800 m ) , but an effective range of much less . They had a maximum range of 16 @,@ 160 yards ( 14 @,@ 780 m ) against surface targets . 
 During refits in the mid @-@ 1930s , both ships received multiple 2 @-@ pounder pom @-@ pom mounts . Courageous received three quadruple Mark VII mounts , one on each side of the flying @-@ off deck , forward of the 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns , and one behind the island on the flight deck ( two of these were transferred from the battleship Royal Sovereign ) . Glorious received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations . Both ships received four water @-@ cooled .50 @-@ calibre Mark III machine guns in a single quadruple mounting . This mount could depress to − 10 ° and elevate to a maximum of 70 ° . The machine guns fired a 1 @.@ 326 @-@ ounce ( 37 @.@ 6 g ) bullet at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 520 ft / s ( 770 m / s ) . This gave the gun a maximum range of about 5 @,@ 000 yards ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) , although its effective range was only 800 yards ( 730 m ) . Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war , in 1939 and 1940 , respectively . 
 = = = Fire control and radar = = = 
 To assist its weapon systems in hitting their target , Furious was completed with one fire @-@ control system for each side , with separate directors for low @-@ angle and high @-@ angle guns . The 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns were centrally controlled by a Dreyer Fire @-@ Control Table on the lower deck while the 4 @-@ inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors . The existing fire @-@ control directors were removed when Furious received her new dual @-@ purpose 4 @-@ inch mountings in 1939 . New high @-@ angle directors , including two for the pom @-@ poms , were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck . Over the course of the war Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on top of the high @-@ angle directors . She also received a Type 290 air @-@ search radar . 
 Courageous was initially fitted only with low @-@ angle directors for her guns , but these were replaced by dual @-@ purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930 . ( Glorious , completed later , had hers from the beginning . ) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 Little armour other than that of the barbettes was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers . The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes . The flight deck was .625 inches ( 15 @.@ 9 mm ) in thickness . 
 Unlike other British battlecruisers , the bulk of the armour of the Courageous @-@ class ships was made from high @-@ tensile steel ( HTS ) , a type of steel used structurally in other ships . Their waterline belt consisted of 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of HTS covered by a 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) thick mild steel skin . It protected roughly the middle two @-@ thirds of the ship with a one @-@ inch extension forward to the two @-@ inch forward transverse bulkhead well short of the bow . The belt had a height of 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) , of which 18 inches ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) was below the designed waterline . From the former forward barbette a three @-@ inch bulkhead extended out to the ship 's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well . Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from 0 @.@ 75 to 3 inches ( 19 to 76 mm ) , thickest over the magazines and the steering gear . After the Battle of Jutland , 110 long tons ( 110 t ) of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines . 
 The torpedo bulkheads were increased during building from 0 @.@ 75 inches ( 19 mm ) to 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) in thickness . All three ships were fitted with a shallow anti @-@ torpedo bulge integral to the hull , which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface , away from the ship . However , later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion .

 Normally , Furious could carry only about 36 aircraft . In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight ( squadrons after 1932 ) of fighters ( Fairey Flycatcher ) , two of spotters ( Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison ) , one spotter reconnaissance ( Fairey IIID ) and two flights of torpedo bombers ( Blackburn Dart ) . In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with Hawker Nimrods and Hawker Ospreys , one squadron of Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters . During the Second World War , the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types , although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions . 
 Courageous and Glorious were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft . They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as Furious , although they are also known to have flown the Fairey Seal , the Blackburn Shark , and the Blackburn Ripon .

 Furious was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925 , although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) inventory . These included landing and flying @-@ off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes , with and without wheels , to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats . The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty . A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily . The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards . Deck @-@ edge palisades ( windbreaks ) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather . The first carrier night @-@ landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard Furious . 
 The ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932 , focused on refitting her machinery and re @-@ tubing her boilers . In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck , the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars . Upon completion she ran a full @-@ power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was 28 @.@ 8 knots ( 53 @.@ 3 km / h ; 33 @.@ 1 mph ) from a total of 89 @,@ 754 shaft horsepower ( 66 @,@ 930 kW ) . 
 Furious was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November . Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid @-@ 1930s . She was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet from May to October 1934 . Furious was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI . She became a deck @-@ landing training carrier in 1937 , although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport , where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward . During the Munich Crisis in September 1938 , she embarked Nos. 801 , 821 and 822 Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow , before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair . 
 She was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns and palisades , mounted AA guns on her flying @-@ off deck , plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar , and gave her a small island on the starboard side . Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939 . 
 Courageous was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930 . She was relieved by Glorious and refitted from June to August 1930 . The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936 . In the early 1930s , transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic catapults on the upper flight deck before March 1934 . Courageous was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her pom @-@ pom mounts . She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review . She became a training carrier in December 1938 when Ark Royal joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War . 
 Glorious was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet , but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930 . She relieved Courageous in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939 . In a fog on 1 April 1931 Glorious rammed SS Florida amidships while steaming at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . The impact crumpled 60 feet ( 18 @.@ 3 m ) of the flying @-@ off deck and forced Glorious to put into Gibraltar for temporary repairs . She had to sail to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931 . Sometime in the early 1930s , transverse arresting gear was installed . She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults , her flight deck was extended to the rear , her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple pom @-@ pom mounts . Glorious also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean .

 In the early days of the war , hunter @-@ killer groups were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U @-@ boats . On 17 September 1939 , two torpedoes from U @-@ 29 turned the tables , and Courageous became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War . As Ark Royal had been surprised by a near miss 7 days earlier , the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty . 
 = = = Glorious = = = 
 Force J , including Glorious , was organised to hunt for the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the Indian Ocean . They were not successful , and Glorious remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean . Glorious was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in Norway . Gloster Gladiators of No. 263 Squadron RAF were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases . Glorious and Ark Royal arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the Trondheim area before Glorious had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft . She returned on 1 May , but had been unable to load new aircraft because of poor weather . The task force was under heavy air attack by the Luftwaffe all day and was withdrawn that evening . 
 Glorious returned on 18 May with six Supermarine Walrus amphibious flying boats of 701 Squadron and 18 Hawker Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadron RAF . The Walruses were quickly flown off to Harstad , but the airfield at <unk> was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when Glorious returned to Scapa on 21 May . Glorious came back to the Narvik area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were quickly flown off . 
 However , even this success proved to be ephemeral , and British forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later . The evacuation ( Operation Alphabet ) began in the north on the night of 3 / 4 June , and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support . She only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for self @-@ defence , as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if at all possible . Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes . This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier . 
 Captain Guy D 'Oyly @-@ Hughes requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June . On the way back across the North Sea , Glorious and her two escorting destroyers , Acasta and Ardent , were found by the two German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau . No combat air patrol was being flown , no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the crow 's nest . The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews , although Acasta managed to torpedo Scharnhorst before she was sunk . Only 43 men from Glorious survived . 
 = = = Furious = = = 
 Until 2 October 1939 , Furious remained on training duties , combined with anti @-@ submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland . She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken Courageous and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the Gneisenau and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway . Furious departed her berth adjacent to the battleship Royal Oak in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October , the day before Royal Oak was sunk by U @-@ 47 in Scapa Flow . Furious served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain in mid @-@ December 1939 . 
 Furious joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days . She refuelled at Tromsø on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April , her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April . Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April , and the damage was more serious than initially thought . After quick repairs , Furious returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron ; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at Bardufoss was ready . She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off . 
 On 14 June , carrying only half of 816 Squadron for her own protection , Furious sailed unescorted for Halifax , Nova Scotia carrying £ 18 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in gold bullion . On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for Iceland from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft , spare parts and munitions . On his own initiative , Captain Troubridge ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain . She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Tromsø through October 1940 . Furious loaded 55 aircraft in Liverpool on 7 November and sailed for Takoradi , Gold Coast , on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending Egypt . By 15 December , Furious was back in Liverpool , where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi . She sailed on the 21st and joined up with Convoy WS 5A which encountered the German cruiser Admiral Hipper on the 25th . The German ship was driven off by the escorts , and Furious reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941 . She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit . She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March . 
 Now with a new destination for her ferry trips , Furious transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to Ark Royal to be flown off for Malta . She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May . Some of these fighters were moved to Ark Royal via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern . This time she accompanied Ark Royal and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia . She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June through September 1941 . In July and August , however , Furious and Victorious attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses . Following her last ferry mission she was sent to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , to refit . 
 Furious arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months working up . In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in Operation Pedestal , but she was only to sail far enough with them to allow her 38 Supermarine Spitfires to reach Malta . This she did , just as Eagle was torpedoed , but Furious turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully . She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south @-@ east of the Balearic Islands . After this mission Furious was sent back to Home Fleet for training . One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before Operation Torch , and she arrived on 27 October . She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch . 
 Providing cover for the Central Task Force , Furious 's aircraft neutralised the airfields at La <unk> and <unk> , both near Oran , Algeria . She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war . In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the Allied invasion of Sicily ; Furious 's role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down . She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training . 
 On 3 April 1944 , Fairey Barracudas from Furious and Victorious attacked the German battleship Tirpitz in Altafjord , Norway , as part of Operation Tungsten . Tirpitz was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs , although four aircraft were lost in the attack . The Home Fleet tried another attack on Tirpitz later in the month , but bad weather prevented any attack from being made . Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at Bodø , but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships . Three operations against targets in northern Norway , including two against Tirpitz , had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May , but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire . Furious and other carriers made another attempt to sink the Tirpitz on 17 July , but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences . Four more attacks on Tirpitz were made in August , but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made . 
 As the war progressed , the ship 's age and limitations became increasingly apparent , and Furious was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944 . She was paid off in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship 's structure . She was sold in 1948 for scrapping , completed in 1954 at Troon .

 Christopher Vincent " Chris " Metzen ( born November 22 , 1973 ) is an American game designer , artist , voice actor and author known for his work creating the fictional universes and scripts for Blizzard Entertainment 's three major award @-@ winning media franchises : Warcraft , Diablo and StarCraft . On occasion , Metzen has published his art under the alias " <unk> " . Metzen was hired by Blizzard Entertainment as an animator and an artist ; his first work for the company was with the video game Justice League Task Force . 
 Metzen is currently the Senior Vice President of Story and Franchise Development at Blizzard Entertainment and has assisted the company 's projects by providing voice talent for a number of characters , as well as contributing to artistic character design . Outside of Blizzard Entertainment , Metzen authored a graphic novel series based on a futuristic second American civil war . 
 In his most recent work , Metzen co @-@ authored graphic novels , Transformers : Autocracy and Transformers Monstrosity with author Flint Dille and artist Livio <unk> . 
 = = Career = = 
 Metzen began his career in design after applying to Blizzard Entertainment , then known as Chaos Studios , on the recommendation of a friend who had seen his work . He was quickly recruited by the company , although Metzen states that at the time he did not really know what Blizzard Entertainment dealt with , assuming it was a graphic design studio rather than a video game developer . 
 Metzen 's first work for the company was with the game Justice League Task Force , in which he provided artwork and character animation . Around the same time , Metzen also contributed to 1994 's Warcraft : Orcs and Humans by working on artwork , illustrations and the game 's documentation . Later video games by Blizzard Entertainment would frequently include Metzen 's work in manual design , illustration and concept art . However , Metzen 's role in developing later Warcraft games increased significantly with 1995 's Warcraft II : Tides of Darkness , which gave him the opportunity to work on the game 's fantasy @-@ based fictional universe in addition to designing the game 's various scenarios and missions . 
 In 1996 , Blizzard Entertainment launched its second major franchise with the role @-@ playing game Diablo . Diablo 's fictional universe was created by both Metzen and fellow designer Bill Roper , and Metzen also provided voice acting for some of the game 's characters . On occasion , Metzen would provide voice talent for later video games . In 1998 he took the role of lead designer on the science fiction strategy game StarCraft . Along with James Phinney , Metzen again provided the game 's extensive story and script , as well as organizing the voice casting for the game . In 1999 , Metzen wrote a short story set in the StarCraft universe with fellow Blizzard Entertainment employee Sam Moore . The story , entitled Revelations , was published in the spring issue of Amazing Stories with cover artwork by Samwise Didier . Returning to the Diablo series in 2000 with Diablo II , Metzen worked on the game 's story , script and artwork . In 2001 , he published a novel set in the Warcraft universe , entitled Of Blood and Honor . 
 With 2002 's Warcraft III : Reign of Chaos , Metzen was the creative director , a role he would hold in all of Blizzard 's later video games , and provided the game 's story concept and script . Metzen 's work with 2004 's massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game World of Warcraft was not as extensive as his earlier work , but he still contributed with script writing , artwork and voice work . 
 Metzen announced in early 2005 that he was working on a graphic novel series independent of Blizzard Entertainment . The series , entitled Soldier : 76 , is set in a second American civil war in 2010 , with increased domestic and global terror threats and the increase in power for the US federal government over that of local state governments serving as a background . Metzen wrote the series ' script , while Brazilian artist Max <unk> was responsible for the illustration and painting of the book . Soldier : 76 would later appear as a character in Overwatch , Blizzard 's online first @-@ person shooter game , released in May 2016 . 
 Chris Metzen teamed with author Flint Dille and artist Livio <unk> to create the 12 @-@ part , bi @-@ weekly digital comic series , Transformers : Autocracy . Autocracy , published by IDW Publishing was published in 2012 . The series focuses on the days just before the Great War . It is set after Megatron Origin , and presents the Decepticons as an established force , sowing dissent across Cybertron primarily through terrorist actions . The series focuses on Orion Pax , an Autobot commander charged with rooting out these cells . Transformers : Autocracy was released as a collected Trade Paperback in July 2012 with a bonus forward authored by Metzen . The same team is current working on the follow @-@ up series , " Transformers : Monstrosity " . 
 Metzen made a cameo appearance in the 2016 Warcraft film , as a turbaned perfume vendor in <unk> .

 He first started creating comics at the age of twelve , but that he had held an interest in drawing since at least six . He states that he still retains a habit of spending " an average of thirty @-@ five dollars per week " on comics books . A fan of Dungeons & Dragons , Metzen cites the Dragonlance series of novels and Star Wars as the primary inspirations for his fantasy and science fiction creations , and names fantasy and comic book artists such as Walt Simonson and Keith Parkinson as his artistic inspirations . 
 He defines his artistic style as having been " heavily influenced by Walt Simonson 's and Jim Lee 's <unk> styles for form " while preferring the " costuming , themes and general feel of Larry Elmore and Keith Parkinson 's fantasy paintings " . In addition to art , Metzen 's interests include pop and rock music , the nightlife , and dirt bikes . On April 21 , 2013 , Metzen married his longtime girlfriend Kat Hunter , who is a licensing project manager at Blizzard Entertainment .

 = Norse @-@ American medal = 
 The Norse @-@ American medal was struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1925 , pursuant to an act of the United States Congress . It was issued for the 100th anniversary of the voyage of the ship Restauration , bringing early Norwegian immigrants to the United States . 
 Minnesota Congressman Ole Juulson Kvale , a Norse @-@ American , wanted a commemorative for the centennial celebrations of the Restauration journey . Rebuffed by the Treasury Department when he sought the issuance of a special coin , he instead settled for a medal . Sculpted by Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser , the medals recognize those immigrants ' Viking heritage , depicting a warrior on the obverse and a vessel on the reverse . They also recall the early Viking explorations of North America . 
 Once authorized by Congress , they were produced in various metals and sizes , for the most part prior to the celebrations near Minneapolis in June 1925 . Only 53 were issued in gold , and they are rare and valuable today ; those struck in silver or bronze are much less expensive . They are sometimes collected as part of the commemorative coin series . 
 = = Background and inception = = 
 On July 4 or 5 , 1825 , the vessel Restauration sailed from Stavanger , Norway for the United States , with 45 emigrants aboard . According to what The New York Times deemed " bacchanalian " legends of its passage , the expedition anchored off an English seacoast village and traded ashore some of its rum , only to depart in haste when local officials took an interest . Off Madeira , expedition leader Lars Larsen is said to have fished a cask from the sea , which proved to be filled with rare wine that was thoroughly enjoyed by those aboard . After they arrived in New York on October 9 , 1825 , the ship was seized pursuant to a court order , as the passengers exceeded the permitted number for a ship of its size by 21 , counting a baby girl born to the <unk> en route . In addition , a fine was to be imposed , but because the immigrants spoke no English and had no knowledge of American laws , President John Quincy Adams issued a pardon , releasing the ship and remitting the fine . Initially settling on land they purchased near the shore of Lake Ontario , about 35 miles ( 56 km ) from Rochester , New York , the passengers were the first of many Norse @-@ Americans who crossed the Atlantic , especially to the northern and western United States . 
 Ole Juulson Kvale was a Minnesota congressman of the Farmer @-@ Labor Party , and a proud Norse @-@ American . Kvale was a member of the Norse @-@ American Centennial Commission , which was to organize a 100th anniversary celebration of the Restauration 's voyage . This celebration was important to a Norse @-@ American community that had been perceived as antiwar during World War I , and was attempting to display both ethnic pride and assimilation . Kvale , a Lutheran minister , was also a member of the House Committee on Coinage , Weights , and Measures , and in January 1925 approached the Treasury Department , seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary . He was told that the Treasury would oppose it . Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups were unlikely to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 Huguenot @-@ Walloon Tercentenary half dollar , seen by some as Protestant propaganda . 
 On February 3 , 1925 , Kvale and his son Paul met with Treasury officials , bringing a draft bill authorizing the Bureau of the Mint to strike commemorative medals for the anniversary . Acting Mint Director Mary M. O 'Reilly and Treasury Undersecretary Garrad Winston were dubious about the idea of striking silver medals that would be between the quarter and half dollar in size . Paul Kvale suggested making the medal octagonal or hexagonal . O 'Reilly and Winston favored the idea , and , after Congressman Kvale met with legal counsel to the Treasury and with other officials , he was assured of the department 's full support . Kvale also successfully lobbied the Post Office Department for the issuance of commemorative stamps ; he told Third Assistant Postmaster General Warren I. Glover that , in a broader sense , the medal recognized the North American explorations of the Vikings around the year 1000 . Kvale declared that in seeking the souvenir medal and stamps , he was contributing to the " growth of the Norwegian heritage by having it ' preserved in metal ' as well as ' paper time capsules ' . " 
 = = Legislation = = 
 Kvale introduced a bill for a Norse @-@ American medal in the House of Representatives on February 4 , 1925 . It was referred to the Committee on Coinage , Weights , and Measures . On behalf of that committee , Kvale reported it favorably to the full House on February 10 . In the report , Kvale stated that the 40 @,@ 000 medals would be struck without expense to the government , and that Treasury officials supported the bill . " In view of the importance of this celebration to the many descendants of the Norse immigrants into this country , and through these to the State of Minnesota , which is officially sponsoring the event , and to the great Northwest , which they have been such a large factor in developing , the committee believes that such a medal is fitting and proper and that this bill should be enacted into law . " 
 South Dakota Senator Peter Norbeck also introduced legislation for a Norse @-@ American medal on February 5 , 1925 . It was referred to the Committee on the Library . On the 6th , that committee was discharged of responsibility for the bill and it was referred instead to the Committee on Banking and Currency . Norbeck , on behalf of the Banking Committee , reported the bill favorably and without amendment to the Senate on February 13 . It was passed by the Senate without objection or amendment on the 18th . 
 The Senate @-@ passed bill then was transmitted to the House of Representatives , and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20 . It was brought forward on February 27 , 1925 . When the Speaker , Frederick H. Gillett , asked if there was objection to the consideration of the bill , Ohio 's James T. Begg asked if there was anyone who could give him information about it , and if there was not , he would object . Kvale stated that he could , and when Begg asked if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill , assured the Ohioan that this was so . Kvale had the Senate @-@ passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced , and it received the House 's endorsement without objection or amendment . It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2 , 1925 . 
 The act provided for a maximum of 40 @,@ 000 medals , to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint , from design models prepared by the Norse @-@ American Centennial Commission . Medals would be turned over to a designated agent of the commission on payment of the cost of making them . They were to be made subject to the provisions of section 52 of the Coinage Act of 1873 . That section permitted medals of a national character to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint , but forbade Mint personnel from making dies for private medals , and was enacted after Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Franklin Peale had for some years run a private medals business on Mint premises , prior to his firing in 1854 . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Kvale hoped that his friend and fellow Minnesotan , Senator Henrik <unk> , could persuade sculptor Gutzon Borglum to design the medal for no fee or a nominal one . Borglum , who was busy with construction at Stone Mountain in Georgia ( he would later sculpt Mount Rushmore ) , had designed the Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar ; he had no time to accept the work . Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser , a member of the Commission of Fine Arts , was engaged for a fee of $ 1 @,@ 500 , about the usual for a commemorative coin . 
 Fraser prepared designs and submitted them to the Mint ; O 'Reilly sent them to the Commission of Fine Arts on April 14 , 1925 . The commission approved them ; its only suggestion was that the first " the " be removed from the inscription on the reverse , " <unk> BY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA " , and this was done . Sketches had been printed in the Minneapolis Journal on March 29 , provoking some reaction from those who felt that the design implied that Norwegians still dressed like Vikings in 1825 , and that the date , 1000 , should be moved from reverse to obverse to eliminate the confusion . The public objections had no effect on events . 
 = = Design = = 
 The obverse of the medal shows a Norwegian Viking chieftain who has just come ashore from his ship ( seen behind him ) and is armed for war , with horned helmet , shield , sword , and <unk> ( dagger ) . He is intended to be landing at Vinland , the lands in the Americas explored and to some extent settled by the Vikings about the year 1000 . The helmet is most likely an anachronism , as they are not believed to have been used for two millennia prior to the Vinland landing , and were probably ceremonial , rather than intended for battle . The centennial and the years are recognized on the obverse . The reverse shows a Viking ship , along with the authorization by Congress and the approximate year in which Vinland was settled . " <unk> <unk> " ( Fraser 's work ) , the artist 's signature , is to the left of the ship . 
 Numismatist Anthony Swiatek , in his volume on commemoratives , wonders if Leif Erikson , the famed explorer of that period , would not have been a superior choice . He concludes that Kvale would not have supported such a depiction , because " he was interested in pure romanticization . He saw a Viking ship and his chieftain in full regalia " . 
 Julie Shultz , in her journal article on the 1925 celebration , finds it significant that the medal has nothing to do with the arrival of the Restauration in an already @-@ formed United States , but symbolizes ethnic pride in the early explorers . Noting that one of the stamps depicts a Viking ship and the other the Restauration , she concludes of these three government issues for the celebration : " Though outwardly , these souvenirs were to symbolize the Norwegian immigrant heritage that began in 1825 , they actually invert the dominant narrative by using an American form to proclaim that Norwegians were the first Europeans to land on American soil . " 
 = = Production , distribution , and collecting = = 
 Six thousand silver medals on a thin ( 1 @.@ 6 mm ) planchet were struck between May 21 and 23 , 1925 , at the Philadelphia Mint . They were handled like ordinary coins : they were counted , bagged , and transported to the Fourth Street National Bank of Philadelphia for the centennial commission 's use . Between May 29 and June 13 , a total of 33 @,@ 750 pieces were struck on a thick ( 2 mm ) silver planchet . The reason for the two varieties is uncertain ; Swiatek theorizes that the Norse @-@ American Centennial Commission might not have liked how the thin ones looked , or might have wanted collectors to buy two medals . One hundred were struck in gold , on June 3 and 4 — Kvale received the second one struck . The medals cost the commission 30 cents each for the thin ones , 45 cents for the thick , and $ 10 @.@ 14 for the gold . The retail price of the thin ones is uncertain ( Swiatek estimates $ 1 @.@ 75 ) , the thick ones are known to have cost $ 1 @.@ 25 , and the gold pieces about $ 20 . They were sold by mail order ; none were sold at the celebrations or in person . There was a sales limit of one per person , but purchasers could buy on behalf of as many family members as they wanted . The thin pieces were not offered for sale until November or December 1925 , and sold mostly to numismatists — the commission 's secretary , J.A. <unk> , was frustrated that more " Norsemen " were not buying the medal . After the celebrations , Kvale took 5 @,@ 000 medals to New York , hoping to sell them , but was not successful . Of the 100 gold pieces struck , 47 were eventually returned to the Treasury when they could not be sold , and some of the silver pieces ( most likely thick ones ) were as well . 
 The Norse @-@ American Immigration Centennial Celebration was held at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds near Minneapolis from June 6 – 9 , 1925 . Automobile caravans were organized to bring attendees from the Red River Valley , bearing the slogan , " The Norsemen are Coming ! " President Coolidge was present ; he called the Viking explorers " these sons of Thor and Odin " , and told attendees , " the pledge of the Norwegian people has never yet gone unredeemed . I have every faith that through the vigorous performance of your duties you will add new lustre to your glories in the days to come . " The New York Times noted that commemorative stamps and a congressionally authorized medal had been issued for the celebration . " Seldom before has the celebration of a similar event been so honored by the Government , as has this centennial . " 
 The Times had inaccurately described the medal as " the first commemorative medal to be issued in the history of the mint " . The publicity people for the celebration had billed it as the first medal to be issued pursuant to an act of Congress , but in October 1925 , Mint Director Robert J. Grant learned that a medal had been authorized by Congress for the centennial of American independence in 1876 , and it had been issued in different sizes . He informed Kvale , who was intrigued by the fact that the independence medal had been issued in a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) size . The congressman felt that the larger size would allow the detail of his medal to be better shown , which would help when one was exhibited in a museum display case . Not all members of his board were enthusiastic about the idea , but between 60 and 75 of these larger medals were struck , likely in December at the Philadelphia Mint , with Kvale undertaking to purchase any that were not sold . They were plated in silver by a private firm in Washington , D.C. , and about 30 were presented or mailed to dignitaries , including one to President Coolidge . 
 The Norse @-@ American medal is not a coin , and is not legal tender . Due to its similarity to a coin , and the fact that it was authorized by Congress , it is sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative coin series . Though the silver ones can be purchased for less than $ 100 up to $ 500 , and the silver @-@ plated one for between $ 500 and $ 3 @,@ 500 , the gold specimen has sold for as high as $ 40 @,@ 000 . Some medals were used as pocket pieces or worn in mountings to the fair , and display damage or wear . 
 = SMS Amazone = 
 SMS Amazone was the sixth member of the ten @-@ ship Gazelle class , built by the Imperial German Navy . She was built by the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel , laid down in 1899 , launched in October 1900 , and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in November 1901 . Armed with a main battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , Amazone was capable of a top speed of 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) . 
 Amazone served in the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet during her peacetime career . After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was deployed as a coastal defense ship . In 1916 , she was disarmed and used as a training ship , and was converted into a barracks ship in 1917 . She was retained by the Reichsmarine after the end of the war and served on active duty with the new German Navy through the 1920s . She was reduced to secondary duties after 1931 , and remained in service as a barracks ship into the 1950s ; Amazone was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1954 .

 Amazon was 104 @.@ 8 meters ( 344 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 12 @.@ 2 m ( 40 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 12 m ( 16 @.@ 8 ft ) forward . She displaced 3 @,@ 082 t ( 3 @,@ 033 long tons ; 3 @,@ 397 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two triple @-@ expansion engines . They were designed to give 8 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 7 @,@ 891 shp ; 5 @,@ 884 kW ) , for a top speed of 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) . The engines were powered by ten coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers . Amazone carried 560 tonnes ( 550 long tons ) of coal , which gave her a range of 3 @,@ 560 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 590 km ; 4 @,@ 100 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts .

 Amazone was ordered under the contract name " F " and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1899 and launched on 6 October 1900 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 15 November 1901 . After her commissioning , Amazone was employed in the reconnaissance forces of the German fleet . In 1902 , she was assigned to the Cruiser Division of the I Squadron of the German home fleet . The Division consisted of the armored cruiser Prinz Heinrich , the flagship , Freya , Victoria Louise , and the light cruisers Hela , and Niobe . The Division participated in the summer fleet maneuvers of August – September 1902 . By 1905 , her sisters Ariadne and Medusa had replaced Hela and Niobe . She continued in the fleet reconnaissance role until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , when she was reduced to a coastal defense vessel . 
 On 8 May 1915 , Amazone was patrolling off Cape Arkona when she was attacked by the British submarine HMS E1 . The submarine fired a torpedo from a range of 1 @,@ 100 m ( 3 @,@ 600 ft ) , but it missed Amazone . On 9 September , another British submarine , HMS E18 , unsuccessfully attacked Amazone during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga . 
 In 1916 , Amazone was disarmed and used as a basic training ship for naval cadets . The following year , she was converted into a barracks ship , based in Kiel , a role she filled until the end of the war . The Treaty of Versailles permitted Germany to retain six light cruisers , and Amazone was among those kept in service of the newly reorganized Reichsmarine . She was modernized at the Reichsmarine Werft in Wilhelmshaven in 1921 – 1923 , and had her ram bow replaced with a clipper bow . She was also rearmed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in U @-@ boat mountings and two 50 cm ( 20 in ) torpedo tubes in deck launchers . 
 Amazone served with the Reichsmarine from 1923 to 1930 . Korvettenkapitän Alfred <unk> took command of the ship in 1926 ; he later went on to become a senior admiral during World War II . Amazone was stricken from the naval register on 31 March 1931 . The ship was then used as a floating barracks for the Submarine Acceptance Commission in Kiel , and later as an auxiliary for the Warship Construction Test Office , submarine group . She survived World War II and after 1945 , she was again used as a barracks ship in Bremen . The old cruiser was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1954 in Hamburg .

 " The Doctor 's Wife " is the fourth episode of the sixth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , which was broadcast on 14 May 2011 in the United Kingdom , and later the same day in the United States . It was written by Neil Gaiman and directed by Richard Clark . 
 In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) and his companions Amy Pond ( Karen Gillan ) and Rory Williams ( Arthur Darvill ) receive a distress call from a living Time Lord , though all other members of the Doctor 's race were thought to be extinct . However , they discover that the call was bait to lure the Doctor to an asteroid outside the universe , where previously the energy of Time Lords ' TARDISes has been consumed by an entity called the House ( voiced by Michael Sheen ) . The matrix of the Doctor 's TARDIS is removed and placed in the body of a woman named Idris ( Suranne Jones ) , who proceeds to help them escape . 
 " The Doctor 's Wife " was originally intended to be produced as part of the previous series , but was pushed back due to budget constraints . Gaiman revised the script many times , having to add and remove characters and events as production saw fit . The episode was filmed in the autumn of 2010 and featured a makeshift TARDIS control room which was the design from a winner of a contest on the children 's programme Blue Peter . The episode was seen by 7 @.@ 97 million viewers in the UK and was met with positive reviews from critics . The episode won the 2011 Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation and the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form .

 While in deep space , the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) and his companions , Amy ( Karen Gillan ) and Rory ( Arthur Darvill ) , receive a communication cube containing a distress call from a Time Lord . Tracing the source of the call to a rift leading outside the universe , the Doctor deletes parts of the TARDIS to generate enough energy to traverse the rift . After landing in a junkyard on a solitary asteroid , the TARDIS shuts down and its matrix disappears . The three travellers explore the asteroid and meet its strange inhabitants : Uncle , Auntie , a green @-@ eyed Ood called Nephew , and an excited young woman named Idris . Idris fawns all over the Doctor , whom she calls " my thief " and then bites him . While Nephew locks up Idris , Amy and Rory return to the TARDIS . The Doctor follows the distress signal and finds a cabinet containing a large number of message cubes . Upon further investigation of Uncle and Auntie , the Doctor finds they are constructed of body parts from other beings , including Time Lords . They are controlled by the asteroid , called House , which is sentient and able to possess other technology around it . House led the Doctor there and removed the TARDIS 's matrix , initially intending to consume its <unk> energy . Upon learning that the Doctor is the last Time Lord and that no more will ever arrive , House transfers itself into the TARDIS to escape from the rift . Amy and Rory are trapped inside as the House @-@ controlled TARDIS dematerialises . 
 The Doctor learns that Idris contains the personality of the TARDIS ' matrix and that they can talk to each other for the first time . Without House 's support meanwhile , Uncle and Auntie die , and Idris 's body only has a short time before it too will fail . Idris reveals that House had stranded many TARDISes before , and that its universe is hours away from collapsing . The Doctor and Idris work together to construct a makeshift TARDIS from scraps , and then pursue House . 
 Aboard the Doctor 's TARDIS , House threatens to kill Amy and Rory . He plays with their senses as they try to flee through the corridors , and then sends Nephew after them . Idris makes a psychic connection with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room , where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS 's shields without House 's interference . This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift console in the secondary control room , which <unk> Nephew . House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift , which the Doctor anticipates . The TARDIS 's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room , where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS 's matrix back to the TARDIS , destroying House . A remnant of the TARDIS 's matrix , in Idris ' body , sadly states that she will not be able to speak to the Doctor again but will be there for him . Idris 's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored . 
 The Doctor installs a security field around the matrix to prevent it from being compromised again . Rory tells the Doctor that some of Idris 's final words were " the only water in the forest is the river " , which the Doctor doesn 't understand . After Amy and Rory leave to find a new bedroom ( the original having been purged by House ) , the Doctor talks to the TARDIS , and in response a nearby lever moves on its own , sending the TARDIS to its next destination . 
 = = = Continuity = = = 
 The Doctor refers to altering the control room 's appearance as changing the desktop theme , as the Fifth Doctor does in " Time Crash " . Like the Third Doctor in Inferno , the Doctor and Idris operate a TARDIS console without an outer TARDIS shell . The Doctor also jettisons TARDIS rooms to create thrust , as he had done previously in stories such as Logopolis and <unk> . The Doctor admits he killed all of the Time Lords , alluding to the events of the Time War . In The War Games , the Second Doctor contacted the Time Lords using a cube similar to those seen in this episode . The Doctor refers to himself as " a madman with a box " , reprising Amy 's and his own description of himself in " The Eleventh Hour " . The Doctor refers to Nephew as " another Ood I failed to save " ; in " The Satan Pit " the Doctor commented that he did not have time to save the Ood . Idris ' cryptic words , " the only water in the forest is the river " , are explained in the mid @-@ series finale , " A Good Man Goes to War " .

 The episode was written by Neil Gaiman . After Steven Moffat replaced Russell T Davies as the showrunner of Doctor Who , being a fan of Gaiman 's blog , Moffat met with Gaiman and Gaiman asked to write an episode . In an interview Gaiman stated " I came up with something that was one of those things where you thought that nobody 's done that before . " The episode was originally titled " The House of Nothing " before Gaiman sat down to write it , but that was changed to " Bigger on the Inside " . This title remained until about six weeks before the episode aired , but the crew was beginning to worry that " Bigger on the Inside " would give away the surprise that Idris was the TARDIS , so it was changed . " The Doctor 's Wife " was also a fake title attached to the 1984 serial The Caves of Androzani ; then @-@ producer John Nathan @-@ Turner had changed the title to that on his planning board in an attempt to weed out a suspected leak in his office . 
 Gaiman suggested they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself , which was not done before for the entire series since it began in 1963 . The original plan focused on the idea of the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS , but went through several subsequent changes ; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor 's knowledge of his ship making it too easy for him to escape his enemy , made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple ' cat @-@ and @-@ mouse ' game , and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS 's mind during this attack . The central idea was a " what if " scenario to see what would happen if the Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together . Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman , believing this to be the " ultimate love story " for the Doctor . 
 Gaiman began writing the episode before Matt Smith was even cast as the Eleventh Doctor ; Gaiman had envisioned David Tennant 's performance in the first draft , knowing Smith would play the Doctor differently . Despite this he had no issue writing the dialogue . The episode was originally slated for the eleventh episode of the fifth series . However , it was delayed to the sixth series because of budget issues ; the eleventh episode would be replaced with " The Lodger " . Even so , Gaiman was forced to operate with less money than he would have liked ; for instance , he had to scrap a scene set in the TARDIS ' swimming pool , and instead of being able to use a monster of his own design he had to use an Ood . 
 The move to the sixth series also meant Gaiman had to include Rory , who had ceased to exist in the original slot in the fifth series . With Rory included , Gaiman had to " reshape " much of the second half of the episode , featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS . In the original draft where Amy was the only companion , Gaiman added a " heartbreaking monologue " by the character , further stating " you get to see what it 's like to be the companion from the companion 's point of view , and she got to talk about essentially in that version how sad it is , in some ways . One day something will happen to her , she 'll get married , she 'll get eaten by monsters , she 'll die , she 'll get sick of this , but he 'll go on forever . " At a certain point , Gaiman became tired of re @-@ writing drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help . Moffat wrote in what Gaiman called " several of [ the episode 's ] best lines " and rapidly rewrote several scenes when budget problems harmed filming locations . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 In September 2010 , Suranne Jones announced she was cast a guest spot on Doctor Who as Idris for an episode of the sixth series of Doctor Who . Jones previously played Mona Lisa in The Sarah Jane Adventures episode Mona Lisa 's Revenge . Some time after appearing on The Sarah Jane Adventures , Jones was contacted to appear on Doctor Who at Gaiman 's request , because they were looking for an actress who " is odd ; beautiful but strange @-@ looking , and quite funny . " Moffat meanwhile described Idris as " sexy plus motherly plus utterly mad plus serene . " During a read @-@ through of the script , the producers asked her to " neutralise [ her accent ] a bit , " because they did not want Jones to " be a Northerner " or have a standard accent , but to act " kinda like the Doctor . " Later , in March 2011 , Gaiman confirmed Michael Sheen would also guest star in the episode to voice a character . Adrian Schiller previously appeared in the Eighth Doctor audio drama Time Works where he played <unk> . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 " The Doctor 's Wife " was planned as the third episode in the 2011 series but the order was changed during the production process . Initial production occurred in September , with Gaiman visiting the set during the production period and filming for the associated Confidential . Additional filming took place in October 2010 , with guest star Suranne Jones having been filmed for green screen special effects . The scenes where Amy and Rory are on the run allowed the audience to explore the TARDIS outside the control room , something the producers had wanted to do for a while . A series of corridors was constructed and retained for future use . The episode also featured the return of the older TARDIS control room from the Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant era . Gaiman had originally wanted to reconstruct a console room from the original series , but the cost proved prohibitive . The set was retained after filming for " The Eleventh Hour " , but has since been removed to become part of the Doctor Who Experience exhibit . Arthur Darvill noted the floor of the older set had a cheese grater @-@ like quality to it , so when the scene called for the cast to fall on it , they found it uncomfortable to stay down for a long period of time . 
 " The Doctor 's Wife " features a makeshift TARDIS console , which was piloted by the Doctor and Idris . The console was designed by Susannah Leah , a schoolgirl from Todmorden , who won a competition on Blue Peter , a children 's programme that challenged its viewers to imagine a TARDIS console based on household objects . Leah 's design was selected by Moffat , Edward Thomas , the production designer for the previous series , and Tim <unk> , a Blue Peter editor , along with final input among the three age @-@ group winners from Smith . Michael <unk> , the production designer for Series 6 , commented that Leah 's design captured the nature of " bits and pieces " of what TARDIS consoles have been in the past , as well as the nature of the makeshift console needed for this episode . The drawing was redesigned faithfully by the production team into the prop for the show , including the use of a coat hanger to start the makeshift TARDIS . Leah was brought by Blue Peter to see both the set under construction and on location during filming of the makeshift TARDIS scenes , meeting Smith and the other actors and production crew . Character Options will release a toy playset based on Leah 's console later in 2011 . The House planetoid in the pocket universe was filmed on location at a quarry outside Cardiff .

 The episode was positively received , with many praising Jones 's performance as the TARDIS . The Guardian 's Dan Martin said : " With so many wild ideas at play , this would have been so easy to get wrong ... yet in every sense it was pitched perfectly " . He praised Suranne Jones in particular , saying she was " electrifying throughout " . Martin later rated it the third best episode of the series , though the finale was not included in the list . The A.V. Club gave the episode a score of " A " , saying it was a " pretty terrific [ episode ] ... a brisk , scary , inventive adventure filled with clever concepts and witty dialogue . And a lot of heart when in the way it deals with an important relationship rarely addressed on the series " . He admired the cleverness of the " Idris / TARDIS " characterisation and found the relationship " quite touching " . Gavin Fuller of The Telegraph praised the acting of Smith , Jones , and Sheen , and called the episode " hugely enjoyable " . Neela Debnath of The Independent praised Gaiman for mixing " romance , tragedy and horror , managing to strike a balance while telling a simple story " , though she criticised the frequent deaths of Rory . 
 SFX magazine reviewer Russell Lewin gave " The Doctor 's Wife " four and a half out of five stars , labelling it as " non @-@ stop intrigue and carefully @-@ controlled suspense all the way " . He particularly praised Smith 's energetic performance , saying " he pings and fizzes around the screen like a Technicolor firework , lighting up every scene he adorns " . IGN 's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10 and concluded , " Sweet , touching , intelligent , different , utterly imaginative and accessible by both hardcore fans and newbies alike — this is not only Doctor Who , but sci @-@ fi telly at its finest " . He also praised Gaiman 's script for being " a simple idea executed brilliantly " . Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times admitted he was unsure if he was going to like it with the " grungy setting , wacko characters and peculiar dialogue " , but ended up " captivated " . He particularly enjoyed seeing more of the TARDIS ' interior and called it an " instant oddball classic " . 
 Digital Spy 's Morgan Jeffery rated it four out of five stars , saying it " isn 't perfect , but you 'd be hard @-@ pressed to fault its ambition " . He was critical of Jones ' performance of Idris , as " her early eccentric behavior tends to grate rather than amuse " though her performance calmed down later in the episode . His other " slight criticism " was that Gillan and Darvill were " sidelined " , but praised their performances . Jeffery felt that the strength of the episode was in character rather than in plot , and cited the defeat of the House as a " slightly disappointing " deus ex machina . 
 The episode won the 2011 Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation . It also won the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ) .

 The Amazing Jeckel Brothers is the fifth studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse , released on May 25 , 1999 , by Island Records , in association with Psychopathic Records . Recording sessions for the album took place from 1998 to 1999 . The album is the fifth Joker 's Card in the group 's Dark Carnival mythology . The album 's lyrics focus on the 9 circles of hell , and the morality of man as he is torn between righteousness and evil . The album 's titular Jeckel Brothers are spirits who juggle balls of fire , representing the sins committed during the mortal life of the dead . 
 The Amazing Jeckel Brothers was the second studio album Insane Clown Posse released by Island , and features a more hip hop @-@ based sound , as opposed to the rock @-@ oriented sound of its predecessor , The Great Milenko ( 1997 ) . The Amazing Jeckel Brothers features guest appearances by rappers Ol ' Dirty Bastard and Snoop Dogg , and additional contributions by The Jerky Boys and Twiztid .

Manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the Walt Disney Company @-@ owned label Hollywood Records , which reportedly paid US $ 1 million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery / Jive Records . 
 After recording and releasing The Great Milenko , Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release , despite having sold 18 @,@ 000 copies and reaching # 63 on the Billboard 200 . It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church . The church claimed Disney was turning its back on family values . 
 In due time , labels such as Interscope Records wanted to sign the group , but Island Records ' Chris Blackwell came to the group 's rescue and agreed to release The Great Milenko as it was originally intended . Thanks to the controversy , and additional promotion by Island , over one million copies of The Great Milenko had been sold by 1998 , and Insane Clown Posse was ready for the fifth Joker 's Card , The Amazing Jeckel Brothers .

 Working with Mike E. Clark and Rich " Legz Diamond " Murrell , Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler developed their album with the highest of hopes . Hoping to receive the respect Bruce and Utsler felt they deserved , they planned to feature well @-@ known , respected rappers on their album . Bruce stated outright that he wanted to involve Snoop Dogg , Ol ' Dirty Bastard , and Ice @-@ T. Snoop Dogg requested that Insane Clown Posse not pay his then @-@ current record label , No Limit Records , and said that he would appear on the album if Bruce and Utsler gave him $ 40 @,@ 000 in a briefcase . Insane Clown Posse agreed , and Snoop Dogg appeared on the song " The Shaggy Show " , which also featured the ska band Gangster Fun playing music before each of the song 's faux commercial breaks . Insane Clown Posse also unsuccessfully attempted to contact Ice Cube to collaborate with them . 
 Snoop Dogg also helped them contact Ol ' Dirty Bastard , who was paid $ 30 @,@ 000 for his appearance . Ol ' Dirty Bastard recorded his track in a matter of two days ; however , his recording consisted of nothing more than him rambling about " bitches . " It took Bruce and Utsler a week to assemble just four rhymes out of his rambling , using Pro Tools because his raps were out of synch with Clark 's beat . The duo eventually had to re @-@ record their lines and re @-@ title the song " Bitches " . Finally , Insane Clown Posse contacted Ice @-@ T. However , he charged them only $ 10 @,@ 000 . The group felt that Ice @-@ T 's song did not belong on the album , and was instead released on the compilation , <unk> from Outer Space ( 2000 ) . The song " Echo Side " was originally released at an Insane Clown Posse concert in Garden City , Michigan as the first ever single from Dark Lotus . 
 To help increase their positive publicity , Island Records hired the Nasty Little Man publicity team . The team set up a photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was to appear on the cover of Alternative Press magazine in Cleveland . On the set of the photo shoot , a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in the song " Fuck the World " , the lyric that stated " Fuck the Beastie Boys and the Dalai Lama " needed to be changed . Insulted , Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again – referring to Disney 's previous requirement of censure . Nasty Little Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends , and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric . In response , Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot .

" 
 To produce the album , Insane Clown Posse once again teamed up with renowned Detroit record producer and DJ Mike E. Clark , who utilized standard hip hop techniques such as record scratching and samples ranging from 1970s funk to calliope music . " Another Love Song " was based upon Beck 's song " Jack @-@ Ass " , which itself was derived from a sample of Bob Dylan 's " It 's All Over Now , Baby Blue " . Bruce loved the song and wanted to rewrite it in his own style . Although the group " lifted the riff from Beck " , since Beck 's song sampled the Dylan composition , Insane Clown Posse 's sample was cleared with Dylan rather than Beck . Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote that Clark 's production incorporates elements of " carnival organ riffs , power chords and shotgun blasts ... <unk> plucking and Van Halen @-@ esque guitar squeals .

 During the two years between The Great Milenko and The Amazing Jeckel Brothers , Insane Clown Posse had become nationally known , but were not taken very seriously . While the controversy over The Great Milenko allowed the duo to attract the attention of Island Records , it also attracted Insane Clown Posse to public criticism for their style and lyrics . Bruce recalls the period as an angry era for the group due to all of the negativity directed toward them . He says that they " used to keep two piles of press at [ their ] office . One pile was all the positive press [ they 've ] gotten , which was under an inch tall . Then [ they ] had the negative press pile , which was spilling over the side of a full basket . " As a result , The Amazing Jeckel Brothers was recorded as a release for their anger . 
 The Amazing Jeckel Brothers focuses on the 9 circles of hell , and the morality of man as he is torn between righteousness and evil . Jack " the sinister " and Jake " the just " ( bad and good ) emerge from the flame of a candle to determine the fate of the dead . The Jeckel Brothers juggle fire balls . For every sin committed during the mortal life of the dead , another ball is added . Jack attempts to throw Jake curves in an attempt to see a ball drop . If a soul witnesses Jake drop one of the balls , he will be damned to hell . Souls who see Jake successfully complete the act ascend to heaven .

 The Amazing Jeckel Brothers debuted and peaked at # 4 on the Billboard 200 . In order to promote the album , Island released multiple collectible versions of The Amazing Jeckel Brothers , emphasizing the faces of Jake or Jack Jeckel . In 2008 , it achieved platinum certification . 
 The album received mostly negative reviews from critics . NME wrote that " the slick , dumbed @-@ down Dungeons & Dragons rap @-@ rock schtick [ ... ] is often unbearable " . College Music Journal writer Matt Ashare described the album as " Cirque de so @-@ lame " . Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters gave the album two out of five stars , writing that " no musical sleight of hand can disguise the fact that Shaggy and J remain the ultimate wack MCs . " In The Great Rock Discography , Martin Charles Strong gave the album four out of ten stars . 
 PopMatters reviewer Brendan Maher accused Insane Clown Posse of misogyny and described The Amazing Jeckel Brothers as " music to strangle your ex @-@ girlfriend to " . Robert Christgau gave the album a C + , writing " Though they claim clown , they rarely get funnier than ' I 'd cut my head off but then I would be dead ' . " However , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a four out of five star rating , writing that " [ Insane Clown Posse ] actually delivered an album that comes close to fulfilling whatever promise their ridiculous , carnivalesque blend of hardcore hip hop and shock @-@ metal had in the first place " .

 <unk> Klub Maribor ( English : Maribor Football Club ) , commonly referred to as NK Maribor or simply Maribor , is a professional football club based in Maribor , Slovenia . Founded on 12 December 1960 , Maribor is one of only three football clubs in the country who have never been relegated from the Slovenian top flight 1 . SNL since its establishment in 1991 . They are regarded as a symbol of Slovenian football , particularly in their home region of Styria ( Slovene : Štajerska ) in the northeastern Slovenia . 
 Maribor is the most successful club in the country , having won 13 Slovenian <unk> titles , nine Slovenian Cups and four Slovenian <unk> . The club 's most successful period was in the late 1990s and early 2000s , when they overwhelmingly dominated domestic football , winning seven successive league titles and three national cups . Following the 2008 – 09 season , Maribor became the dominant force in Slovenian football for the second time , having won six out of eight championships since then . Since 2011 the club also enjoys a fair amount of success in European football , reaching the group stage of the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Europa League for four consecutive seasons between 2011 and 2014 . Prior to Slovenia 's independence in 1991 , Maribor played in the Yugoslav football system , where the club , apart from winning the Yugoslav second division in 1967 , had no major success during that period . They are one of only three Slovenian teams who participated in the country 's highest division , Yugoslav First League , between the end of World War II in 1945 and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 . In addition , they are the only Slovenian club and one of only four clubs from the former Yugoslavia who participated in group stage of the UEFA Champions League . 
 They have maintained a fierce rivalry with Olimpija from the capital Ljubljana , with whom they contested the Eternal Derby ( Večni derbi ) . Their other rivalry was against Mura from Murska Sobota and matches between the two were dubbed as the <unk> – Styrian derby ( <unk> @-@ <unk> derbi ) . However , both Olimpija and Mura folded and were dissolved following the 2004 – 05 season . In 2005 , the " successor " clubs , Bežigrad ( later renamed to Olimpija Ljubljana ) and Mura 05 were established , who regarded themselves as the continuation of the former clubs . Maribor also have a loyal and passionate fan base and the club has the highest average all @-@ time attendance in Slovenia . 
 The club 's home ground is the Ljudski vrt stadium , which has a capacity of 12 @,@ 702 seats . It was originally built in 1952 and later underwent a series of major reconstructions in the 1990s and 2000s .

Maribor 's nicknames are The Purples ( Vijoličasti ) and The Violets ( <unk> ) , both referring to their primary colour purple . The club 's motto is One club , one honour ( En <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) .

 Maribor football club was founded on 12 December 1960 . The board of the newly established club then organized the presidential elections and Dr. <unk> Koren was appointed as the first club president , while Andrija <unk> was appointed as the first head coach and Oto <unk> as the first team captain . The club played their first match on 5 February 1961 , when they defeated city rivals <unk> 2 – 1 ( 0 – 0 ) , with Stefan <unk> scoring both goals . Although the team colours , purple and white , were chosen from the beginning , the team played its first match in a green and blue combination , as their violet jerseys were not available in time for the first match . The team won the Slovenian Republic League ( third tier of Yugoslav football ) in their first season and therefore won the right to contest the qualifications for the Yugoslav Second League . Andrija <unk> was the head coach of the team that won the Republic league . However , he had to step down from the position right before the start of the promotion play @-@ off due to illness . His successor was Vladimir Šimunić , the man who eventually guided the team to their promotion to the Yugoslav First League six years later . Maribor won the first two rounds of the qualifying play @-@ off and eventually defeated Croatian side <unk> from Pula in the final qualifying phase with the score 2 – 1 on aggregate , therefore securing the right to play in the second Yugoslav division . 
 In 1961 the club received a new stadium named Ljudski vrt . On 2 September of that year football fans across Slovenia witnessed the birth of a new rivalry between Maribor and Olimpija Ljubljana . The first match between the two clubs was played in Ljubljana and ended in a 1 – 1 draw . Matches between these two clubs later became known in Slovenia as the Eternal derby ( Večni derbi ) . After five seasons , the average attendance of home matches was around 8 @,@ 000 spectators , and under the guidance of coach <unk> , the club won the second division title and managed to reach the Yugoslav first league , between the end of World War II in 1945 and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 . 
 = = = Yugoslav top division = = = 
 The club 's first match in the Yugoslav top division was played in 1967 against Macedonian side Vardar in Skopje ( 1 – 1 ) ; Maras scored the only goal for Maribor . The first top level home match was played on 27 August 1967 against Proleter Zrenjanin in front of 8 @,@ 000 spectators and Maribor won with the score 3 – 0 . The goals were scored by Kranjc , <unk> and <unk> . During the same season , football fans across Slovenia witnessed the first ever match in the Yugoslav top flight involving two clubs from Slovenia , when Maribor hosted a match against their rivals Olimpija Ljubljana in front of 13 @,@ 000 spectators ( 0 – 0 ) . Every match between the two clubs during this period would be sold out , with crowd attendance sometimes as high as 20 @,@ 000 . The team finished their first season in Yugoslav top flight in 12th place . 
 During their five years in the top division , Maribor played a total of 166 matches and achieved 40 wins , 57 draws and 69 defeats , with a goal difference of 166 – 270 . Maribor 's highest league position was in the 1969 – 70 season when the club finished in 10th place in an 18 @-@ club league . The average league placement of the club in Yugoslav top flight was 13 @.@ 8 . The 1971 – 72 season was their last season in top division as the team finished last with 20 points . Mladen Kranjc , one of the best players in history of the club , was the best goalscorer for the team in each of its five seasons spent in the Yugoslav top division , having scored a total of 54 league goals , which eventually led to his transfer to one of the top Yugoslav clubs , Dinamo Zagreb . 
 In the next season , Maribor played in the second Yugoslav division and finished as the runners @-@ up , which meant that they qualified for the Yugoslav first division promotion play @-@ off . In the first qualifying round against Montenegrin side <unk> , Maribor won on penalties and qualified for the decisive round against Proleter . The first leg was played in Maribor on 8 July 1973 , and is acknowledged as one of the most historic matches in history of the club as it still holds the club 's attendance record . There were 20 @,@ 000 spectators , 15 @,@ 000 of whom were already present in the stands almost three hours before kick off , eventually helping Maribor win the game 3 – 1 . However , the two @-@ goal advantage proved to be insufficient as Proleter won the second leg in Zrenjanin 3 – 0 and earned promotion with the score 4 – 3 on aggregate . In the second leg match when the score was 1 – 0 for the home team , Maribor had scored an equaliser in the 23rd minute , but the goal was disallowed . The later TV replay showed that the ball had actually crossed the goal line and that the goal should have stood . 
 After the dramatic play @-@ off against Proleter , the club entered a period of stagnation . During this period Maribor were again close to promotion to top division in the 1978 – 79 season when they finished in second place , six points behind Bosnian side <unk> .

The club had a secret fund that was used for bribing officials and opponents . The fund was abolished in 1968 after the club was promoted to the first division , but was later established again in 1976 . Some club officials were keeping track of the bribery expenses in their black book , which was later confiscated by the authorities . From the book it is clear that Maribor had bribed a total of 31 people . After the scandal and the subsequent relegation to third division , Maribor spent the following years bouncing between the second and third Yugoslav leagues until the independence of Slovenia in 1991 . 
 In 1988 Maribor joined MŠD Branik organization , to form Maribor Branik . Although the club uses only the name Maribor in domestic and international competitions it is still officially registered as NK Maribor Branik to this day . The club always had close ties to MŠD Branik as NK Branik Maribor , an association football club which was part of MŠD Branik , had been dissolved only a couple of months before Maribor was established and , many fans who had supported Branik simply switched to supporting Maribor as they viewed the club as the successor of Branik . In October that year Mladen Kranjc was involved in a tragic motorcycle accident in <unk> <unk> . Considered to be one of the best goalscorers in the history of the club , he died at the age of 43 .

Maribor were drawn into the same group with Dynamo Kiev , Bayer Leverkusen and Lazio . To date , Maribor is one of only four clubs ( along with Dinamo Zagreb , Partizan and Hajduk Split ) from the former SFR Yugoslavia who participated in UEFA Champions League group stages since the breakup of the country in 1991 . 
 = = = Financial difficulties = = = 
 The 2003 – 04 Slovenian Cup was the last trophy won by Maribor before the darkest era of the club began . Between 2004 and 2008 , the club was plagued by financial difficulties , and Maribor even came close to being disbanded at one point . However , the club did not follow their rivals Olimpija Ljubljana and Mura on that path . 
 Due to their large debts , which at one point amounted to 4 million euros , the club could not afford to buy new players . As a consequence , the first team at the time consisted mostly of youth players mixed with a couple of foreign players brought to the club on free transfers . In the autumn of 2006 , the leadership of the club changed , with the debt still amounting to over 3 million euros , and it was not until January 2011 that the club announced that the debt had been paid in full . During this period , Maribor never finished above third place in the Slovenian league , and were runners @-@ up in the Slovenian Cup twice . They were , however , one of the 11 winners of the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup , in which they defeated Spanish side Villarreal in the final round , only a couple of months after Villareal had played in the semi @-@ final of the UEFA Champions League .

 From the 2007 – 08 season onwards , Slovenian football legends Zlatko <unk> as the sport director , and soon afterwards , Darko <unk> as the head coach , and former Maribor player Ante <unk> as the assistant coach , were appointed to head the club 's sports department . On 10 May 2008 , the club re @-@ opened the renovated Ljudski vrt , which had undergone a major reconstruction that lasted almost 20 months . The first match played in the newly refurbished stadium was a league match against <unk> and was won 3 – 1 in front of 12 @,@ 435 spectators . At the start of 2008 – 09 season , Maribor entered history books as the first club who won 1 @,@ 000 points in the Slovenian top division , after a 2 – 1 away win against Rudar <unk> on 26 July 2008 . Under the guidance of head coach Darko <unk> , Maribor won all three domestic trophies available to them ( the Slovenian League , Cup , and Supercup ) in only two seasons with the club , thus becoming the first coach with all three domestic trophies won in Slovenian football . On 12 December 2010 , the club celebrated its 50th anniversary . With the 2 – 1 away victory over Primorje , on 21 May 2011 , Maribor secured its ninth Slovenian league title .

This was the third time that Maribor managed to win The Double and the first time since the 1998 – 99 season . 
 At the beginning of the 2012 – 13 season , Maribor played in their fourth successive Supercup final . The match was played on 8 July 2012 at Ljudski vrt stadium . Unlike in the previous two seasons , when the club finished as the runners @-@ up , they managed to win their second Supercup trophy this time , defeating their " eternal rivals " Olimpija Ljubljana 2 – 1 . Maribor qualified to the group stages of the 2012 – 13 UEFA Europa League for the second season in a row as one of the losers in the play @-@ off round of the 2012 – 13 UEFA Champions League , where they were eliminated by Dinamo Zagreb . They managed to get four points this time , defeating Panathinaikos and drawing with Tottenham Hotspur , both at home . Maribor confirmed their eleventh league title on 11 May 2013 , when they defeated Olimpija Ljubljana 2 – 1 . Like in the previous season , they again defeated Celje in the 2013 Cup Final , securing their fourth " Double " in the history . 
 In the 2013 – 14 season , Maribor qualified to the group stages of the Europa League for the third consecutive time after losing to Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League play @-@ off stage . This time , the team earned seven points and progressed through the group stages for the first time after defeating Wigan Athletic 2 – 1 in the final matchday .

 = = = Kit and colours = = = 
 Throughout the entire history of Maribor the club 's main colour was purple . At the beginning of the club some officials were favouring the red and white colours , while the traditional colours of Branik were black and white . Because of the fact that many football teams in SFR Yugoslavia wore red @-@ white or black @-@ white jerseys , most notably Crvena Zvezda and Partizan , Maribor officials decided for a new and fresh combination . They decided to follow the example of Fiorentina , which at the time was one of the most successful clubs in Europe , and their purple and white combination . Oto <unk> , the first captain in history of the club , was the one who proposed the combination after seeing the Italian side play . Eventually they changed the secondary colour to yellow . Today , Maribor play their home matches in purple and away matches in white kits . The team is nicknamed The Purples ( Vijoličasti ) ; another common nickname is The Violets ( <unk> ) , both referring to their primary colour purple , present on players ' jerseys and in the club crest . The club is also continuously referred to as the Pride of Styria ( <unk> <unk> ) and as The Viole , the latter being popular predominantly in the region of the former Yugoslavia . <unk> ' current kit manufacturer is Adidas . 
 = = = Crest = = = 
 The badge of the club is one of the most recognizable sport symbols in Slovenia . It is based on the official emblem of the city of Maribor , which is turn based on a 14th @-@ century seal with minor differences . The badge is formed in a shape of a shield , and shows the former <unk> Castle with open doors that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished at the end of the 18th century . A violet blossom forms the backdrop . Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor , the current badge of the club does not represent a white dove facing downwards to the castle but an athlete . At the top of the shield the name of the club and the year of its foundation is inscribed . The entire badge uses only two colours , purple and yellow . Previous versions of the crest included the colour white , a traditional third colour of the club , in the form of a white castle in the centre and a white ball that was on top of the shield . Since May 2012 , the official badge includes a yellow star above the crest , which indicates the first ten Slovenian League titles won by the club . 
 = = Stadium = = 
 The Ljudski vrt ( English : People 's Garden , German : <unk> ) stadium is the only stadium in Maribor that lies on the left bank of the river Drava . The stadium is a natural , cultural , architectural and sports landmark of the city . The stadium is named after a public park previously located in the area . A cemetery was also located on the same area before the stadium was built . The stadium was opened in 1952 and underwent a major reconstruction in the early 1960s . The club first started to compete in the Ljudski vrt in 1961 , when the current main stand was still under construction . The stand is notable for its 129 @.@ 8 metres long and 18 @.@ 4 m high concrete arch and is still the main stand of the stadium . In 1994 floodlights were installed and the stadium hosted its first evening match . Since then the stadium went through several renovations . The most notable was the one in 2008 when the stadium was completely refurbished . Presently , it has a capacity of 12 @,@ 702 seats . 
 Beside being the home ground of Maribor , the stadium also hosts matches of the Slovenia national football team and was their main venue used for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches . It was one of two stadiums in the country which hosted the national team in UEFA Euro 2012 , 2014 FIFA World Cup , and UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers . The record attendance in the Yugoslav era was 20 @,@ 000 spectators , while the record for a Slovenian League match is 14 @,@ 000 spectators , achieved in the last match of the 1996 – 97 season . 
 = = Supporters = = 
 Since their inception in 1960 , Maribor have developed a loyal , passionate and dedicated fanbase and Maribor 's fans are considered the best in the country . After Slovenia declared independence in 1991 , most of the town 's industry perished and over 25 % of the population was unemployed . Still , the people remained loyal to the club . The club is by far the most popular football team in the country and is , in number of football supporters , second only to the Slovenia national football team . Besides the city of Maribor and the surrounding area , the club also has a large fan base in the regions of Styria ( Štajerska ) and Carinthia . A small number of supporters are also present in Ilirska Bistrica in the Slovenian Littoral ( <unk> ) . Soon after the foundation of Maribor , the club was branded as the citizens club , while their city rivals <unk> Maribor has always been branded as the club of the working class . This was mainly because Maribor was seen , by the fans , as the successor of Branik Maribor , a club that folded in 1960 . Many fans of Branik then started to cheer for Maribor , a club that was founded only couple of months later . 
 Since the establishment of the Slovenian league , <unk> , Maribor had the highest average attendance in almost every season to date ( 20 out of 25 ) , and , overall , had more spectators on its home matches than the second and third most viewed clubs in the league combined . The highest attendance was in the 1996 – 97 season , when on average 5 @,@ 289 people attended Maribor 's matches , which is still a record in Slovenian club football . The highest attendance in a Slovenian league match was on 1 June 1997 , when Maribor played against <unk> ( 14 @,@ 000 ) . In addition , they are the only club that gathered over one million people on their matches in Slovenian league , since its foundation in 1991 . 
 In April 2013 the club began with a project <unk> ( <unk> ) , a joint project of Maribor and their fans with the goal of spreading fan awareness and loyalty towards the club and to establish violet bases ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) throughout the country , where Maribor fans would be able to hang out . The bases are usually pubs that were already gathering points for Maribor fans in the past . With the status of the official violet base , those pubs are now able to sell tickets for Maribor 's home and away matches and official fan merchandise or to organize fan zones during Maribor 's matches broadcast on television . Ljudski vrt is regarded as the main base , with 10 others across the eastern part of Slovenia opened as of November 2014 . The first violet base was opened on 29 April 2013 in <unk> Dvor , a small settlement couple of kilometers to the southeast of Maribor . Of the current 10 bases , nine are located in Styria and one in Carinthia . 
 The club also has an ultras group called Viole Maribor established in 1989 which is , by numbers and organization , considered the biggest in Slovenia . An apolitical group , the core of Viole consists of around 250 members , while the whole group has around 1 @,@ 000 registered members . They are located on the southern stand of the stadium which has a capacity of just over 2 @,@ 000 . The most Maribor fans gathered on an away match in domestic competitions was in 2001 , when 3 @,@ 000 fans gathered in Ljubljana , while the most fans gathered on an away match abroad was in 2014 during the club 's UEFA Champions League campaign , when 1 @,@ 500 fans gathered in London . Their biggest rivals are the Green Dragons of Olimpija Ljubljana . Since early 2000s another fan group emerged to support Maribor at their matches . The group is called ESS ( East Side Supporters ) and consists mostly of former members of Viole Maribor , now season tickets holders . They are , as the name implies , located at the east stand of the stadium .

 = = Rivalries = = 
 = = = Eternal derby = = = 
 Maribor 's biggest rivalry was with Olimpija Ljubljana , against whom they contested the Eternal derby ( Večni derbi ) . Olimpija folded and was dissolved in 2004 . Today , the continuation of the rivalry is considered as the matches between Maribor and the new Olimpija Ljubljana , established in 2005 as NK Bežigrad . The rivalry traced its roots back to the early 1960s , when the first match between the two clubs was played . The two teams represented the two largest cities in Slovenia , the capital city of Ljubljana and the second largest city Maribor , and both teams always had the largest fan bases in the country . Traditionally , Ljubljana represents the richer western part of the country , while Maribor is the center of the poorer eastern part . In addition , Ljubljana was always the cultural , educational , economic and political center of the country and Olimpija and its fans were considered as the representatives of the upper class . Maribor , on the other hand , was one of the most industrialized cities in Yugoslavia , and the majority of its fans were the representatives of the working class , which means that the rivalry usually had political , social , and cultural tensions as well . 
 The old rivalry reached its peak in the final round of the 2000 – 01 season , when one of the most celebrated matches in Slovenian League history was played . Olimpija met Maribor at their home stadium , Bežigrad , and both teams were competing for their fifth Slovenian League title . The home team needed a win for the title , while a draw was enough for Maribor . The atmosphere was electric days before the kick @-@ off , and the stadium with a capacity of 8 @,@ 500 was completely sold out . At the end , the match ended with a draw ( 1 – 1 ) and Maribor started to celebrate their fifth consecutive title in front of 3 @,@ 000 of their fans that gathered in Ljubljana that day . 
 An additional intensity to the rivalry is the fact that both Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups , called Viole Maribor ( supporting Maribor ) , and the Green Dragons , who support Olimpija . The two groups are the largest in the country , and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police . On many occasions , before or after the matches , the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets . One of the worst incidents , in April 2010 after a match , resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who , with a group of friends , got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana 's railway station . However , to date , there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence . 
 Because the new Olimpija is supported by most of the fans of the previous Olimpija , including their ultras group , the Green Dragons , who have a long @-@ standing rivalry with Maribor 's own ultras group Viole Maribor , many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name . However , there are many fans , either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana , that do not share the same view and do not share similar beliefs , including part of the media such as RTV Slovenija and <unk> . The overall statistics of the old and the new Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1 . SNL . The first match between Maribor and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter @-@ final match that was won by Maribor , 3 – 1 . At the time Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad . Statistically , Maribor is the more successful club either in the case of matches only from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day . Maribor is also much more successful in case of the matches against Olimpija , established in 2005 as Bežigrad . 
 = = = <unk> – Styrian derby = = = 
 The other major rivalry of the club was that against Mura from Murska Sobota . Similar to Olimpija , Mura also folded and was dissolved in 2004 and today the continuation of the rivalry is considered as the matches between Maribor and <unk> Mura , established in 2012 , who consider themselves , together with the fans of the old Mura , as the spiritual continuation of the dissolved club . The match between the two clubs was first played in 1967 in the time of SFR Yugoslavia . Although the first match was played in the late 1960s it was not until the independence of Slovenia in 1991 when most of the matches were played . Before the establishment of the 1 . SNL in 1991 both clubs had never played together in the top division and the rivalry became apparent only after the independence of Slovenia , when both clubs were among the top teams of the newly established national league . Mura comes from a small , rural town of Murska Sobota in eastern Slovenia which is the center of the poorest region in the country , Prekmurje . Prekmurje was , for about a thousand years , part of the Kingdom of Hungary , unlike other Slovene Lands . It therefore maintains certain specific linguistic , cultural and religious features that differentiate it from other traditional Slovenian regions . The Mura river , which runs on the border between Styria ( Štajerska ) , the capital of which is Maribor , and Prekmurje was therefore not just a natural barrier , but political as well . During the 1990s and early 2000s the two clubs were the most successful and popular teams in the eastern part of the country . The rivalry reached its peak in 2003 – 04 season when Mura hosted Maribor at home in the final round of the season . Before the match Maribor was leading the table and was close in winning their eighth consecutive title while the mid table position of Mura was predetermined before the final round . However , Mura won the match 2 – 1 and Maribor eventually finished the season on third place , losing the title by two points . 
 Mura also has support during their matches from their ultras group , named the Black Gringos . Statistically , both teams always enjoyed one of the biggest attendances on their matches and , in term of numbers , both teams had one of the largest fan bases in the country . The fact that Prekmurje is one of the smallest and least populated regions in Slovenia has made Mura 's fans labeled , by the general public , as one of the most loyal in the country . Statistically , Maribor is the more successful club , considering either the case of matches from the period from 1967 to 2005 , or the whole period from 1967 to present day .

It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components . Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop , the company whose products Peart currently endorses . 
 In addition to being a musician , Peart has published several memoirs about his travels . Peart is also Rush 's primary lyricist . In writing lyrics for Rush , Peart addresses universal themes and diverse subject matter including science fiction , fantasy , and philosophy , as well as secular , humanitarian and libertarian themes . All five of his books are travel @-@ based non @-@ fiction , though they diverge into his life and these subjects as well . Peart currently resides in Santa Monica , California , with his wife , photographer Carrie Nuttall , and daughter , Olivia Louise . He also has a home in the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec , Canada , and spends time in Toronto for recording purposes . 
 On December 7 , 2015 , Peart announced his retirement from music in an interview with Drumhead Magazine , though bandmate Geddy Lee suggests Peart 's comments are taken out of context . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early childhood = = = 
 Peart was born in a Hamilton hospital to Glen and Betty Peart and lived his early years on his family 's farm in <unk> , on the outskirts of Hamilton . The first child of four , his brother Danny and sisters Judy and Nancy were born after the family moved to St. Catharines when Peart was two years old . At this time his father became parts manager for Dalziel Equipment , an International Harvester farm machinery dealer . In 1956 the family moved to the Port Dalhousie area of the town . Peart attended <unk> School and later Lakeport Secondary School , and describes his childhood as happy and says he experienced a warm family life . By early adolescence he became interested in music and acquired a transistor radio , which he would use to tune into pop music stations broadcasting from Toronto , Hamilton , Welland , Ontario and Buffalo , New York . 
 His first exposure to musical training came in the form of piano lessons , which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him . He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks , so for his 13th birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks , a practice drum and some lessons , with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit . 
 His parents bought him a drum kit for his 14th birthday and he began taking lessons from Don George at the Peninsula Conservatory of Music . His stage debut took place that year at the school 's Christmas pageant in St. Johns Anglican Church Hall in Port Dalhousie . His next appearance was at Lakeport High School with his first group , The Eternal Triangle . This performance contained an original number titled " LSD Forever " . At this show he performed his first solo . 
 Peart got a job in Lakeside Park , in Port Dalhousie on the shores of Lake Ontario , which later inspired a song of the same name on the Rush album Caress of Steel . He worked on the Bubble Game and Ball Toss , but his tendency to take it easy when business was slack resulted in his termination . By his late teens , Peart had played in local bands such as <unk> ’ Sumpthin ’ , the Majority , and JR Flood . These bands practiced in basement recreation rooms and garages and played church halls , high schools and roller rinks in towns across Southern Ontario such as Mitchell , Seaforth , and Elmira . They also played in the northern Ontario city of Timmins . Tuesday nights were filled with jam sessions at the Niagara Theatre Centre . 
 = = = Career before joining Rush = = = 
 At eighteen years of age , after struggling to achieve success as a drummer in Canada , Peart travelled to London , England hoping to further his career as a professional musician . Despite playing in several bands and picking up occasional session work , he was forced to support himself by selling trinkets to tourists in a souvenir shop called The Great Frog on Carnaby Street . 
 While in London he came across the writings of novelist and Objectivist Ayn Rand . Rand 's writings became a significant early philosophical influence on Peart , as he found many of her writings on individualism and Objectivism inspiring . References to Rand 's philosophy can be found in his early lyrics , most notably " Anthem " from 1975 's Fly by Night and " 2112 " from 1976 's 2112 . 
 After eighteen months of dead @-@ end musical gigs , and disillusioned by his lack of progress in the music business , Peart placed his aspiration of becoming a professional musician on hold and returned to Canada . Upon returning to St. Catharines , he worked for his father selling tractor parts at Dalziel Equipment . 
 = = = Joining Rush = = = 
 After returning to Canada , Peart was recruited to play drums for a St. Catharines band known as Hush , who played on the South Ontario bar circuit . Soon after , a mutual acquaintance convinced Peart to audition for the Toronto @-@ based band Rush , which needed a replacement for its original drummer John <unk> . Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson oversaw the audition . His future band mates describe his arrival that day as somewhat humorous , as he arrived in shorts , driving a battered old Ford Pinto with his drums stored in <unk> . Peart felt the entire audition was a complete disaster . While Lee and Peart hit it off on a personal level ( both sharing similar tastes in books and music ) , Lifeson had a less favourable impression of Peart . After some discussion , Lee and Lifeson accepted Peart 's maniacal British style of drumming , reminiscent of The Who 's Keith Moon . 
 Peart officially joined the band on July 29 , 1974 , two weeks before the group 's first US tour . Peart procured a silver Slingerland kit which he played at his first gig with the band , opening for Uriah Heep and Manfred Mann in front of over 11 @,@ 000 people at the Civic Arena , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania on August 14 , 1974 . 
 = = = Early career with Rush = = = 
 Peart soon settled into his new position , also becoming the band 's primary lyricist . Before joining Rush , he had written few songs , but , with the other members largely uninterested in writing lyrics , Peart 's previously underutilized writing became as noticed as his musicianship . The band was working hard to establish themselves as a recording act , and Peart , along with the rest of the band , began to undertake extensive touring . 
 His first recording with the band , 1975 's Fly by Night , was fairly successful , winning the Juno Award for most promising new act , but the follow @-@ up , Caress of Steel , for which the band had high hopes , was greeted with hostility by both fans and critics . In response to this negative reception , most of which was aimed at the B side @-@ spanning epic " The Fountain of <unk> " , Peart responded by penning " 2112 " on their next album of the same name in 1976 . The album , despite record company indifference , became their breakthrough and gained a following in the United States . The supporting tour culminated in a three @-@ night stand at Massey Hall in Toronto , a venue Peart had dreamed of playing in his days on the Southern Ontario bar circuit and where he was introduced as " The Professor on the drum kit " by Lee . 
 Peart returned to England for Rush 's Northern European Tour and the band stayed in the United Kingdom to record the next album , 1977 's A Farewell to Kings in Rockfield Studios in Wales . They returned to Rockfield to record the follow @-@ up , Hemispheres , in 1978 , which they wrote entirely in the studio . The recording of five studio albums in four years , coupled with as many as 300 gigs a year , convinced the band to take a different approach thereafter . Peart has described his time in the band up to this point as " a dark tunnel . " 
 = = = Playing style reinvention = = = 
 In 1992 , Peart was invited by Buddy Rich 's daughter , Cathy Rich , to play at the Buddy Rich Memorial Scholarship Concert in New York City . Peart accepted and performed for the first time with the Buddy Rich Big Band . Peart remarked that he had little time to rehearse , and noted that he was embarrassed to find the band played a different arrangement of the song than the one he had learned . Feeling that his performance left much to be desired , Peart decided to produce and play on two Buddy Rich tribute albums titled Burning for Buddy : A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich in 1994 and 1997 in order to regain his aplomb . 
 While producing the first Buddy Rich tribute album , Peart was struck by the tremendous improvement in ex @-@ Journey drummer Steve Smith 's playing , and asked him his " secret . " Smith responded he had been studying with drum teacher Freddie Gruber . 
 In early 2007 , Peart and Cathy Rich again began discussing yet another Buddy tribute concert . At the recommendation of bassist Jeff Berlin , Peart decided to once again augment his swing style with formal drum lessons , this time under the tutelage of another pupil of Freddie Gruber , Peter Erskine , himself an instructor of Steve Smith . On October 18 , 2008 , Peart once again performed at the Buddy Rich Memorial Concert at New York 's Hammerstein Ballroom . The concert has since been released on DVD . 
 = = = Family tragedy and recovery = = = 
 On August 10 , 1997 , soon after the conclusion of Rush 's Test for Echo Tour on July 4 , 1997 , Peart 's first daughter and then @-@ only child , 19 @-@ year @-@ old Selena Taylor , was killed in a single @-@ car accident on Highway 401 near the town of Brighton , Ontario . His common @-@ law wife of 22 years , Jacqueline Taylor , succumbed to cancer only 10 months later on June 20 , 1998 . Peart attributes her death to the result of a " broken heart " and called it " a slow suicide by apathy . She just didn 't care . " 
 In his book Ghost Rider : Travels on the Healing Road , Peart writes that he told his bandmates at Selena 's funeral , " consider me retired . " Peart took a long sabbatical to mourn and reflect , and travelled extensively throughout North and Central America on his motorcycle , covering 88 @,@ 000 km ( 55 @,@ 000 mi ) . After his journey , Peart decided to return to the band . Peart wrote the book as a chronicle of his geographical and emotional journey . 
 Peart was introduced to photographer Carrie Nuttall in Los Angeles by long @-@ time Rush photographer Andrew <unk> . They married on September 9 , 2000 . In early 2001 , Peart announced to his bandmates that he was ready to return to recording and performing . The product of the band 's return was the 2002 album Vapor Trails . At the start of the ensuing tour in support of the album , it was decided amongst the band members that Peart would not take part in the daily grind of press interviews and " meet and greet " sessions upon their arrival in a new city that typically monopolize a touring band 's daily schedule . Peart has always shied away from these types of in @-@ person encounters , and it was decided that exposing him to a lengthy stream of questions about the tragic events of his life was not necessary . 
 Since the release of Vapor Trails and his reunion with bandmates , Peart has returned to work as a full @-@ time musician . Rush released an all @-@ covers EP , Feedback in June 2004 and their 18th studio album Snakes & Arrows in May 2007 , supported by tours in 2004 , 2007 , and 2008 . 
 In the June 2009 edition of Peart 's website 's News , Weather , and Sports , titled " Under the Marine Layer " , he announced that he and Nuttall were expecting their first child . Olivia Louise Peart was born later that year . 
 Peart and the rest of the band toured North America , South America and Europe on the Time Machine Tour , which concluded on July 2 , 2011 , at The Gorge Amphitheatre in George , Washington . Following this tour , the band released their most recent studio album , Clockwork Angels on June 12 , 2012 . On January 22 , 2015 , the band officially announced the Rush <unk> Tour , celebrating the fortieth anniversary of Peart 's membership in the band . 
 In the mid @-@ 2010s , Peart acquired American citizenship . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 Peart announced his retirement in an interview in December 2015 : 
 Lately Olivia has been introducing me to new friends at school as ' My dad — He 's a retired drummer . ' True to say — funny to hear . And it does not pain me to realize that , like all athletes , there comes a time to ... take yourself out of the game . I would rather set it aside than face the predicament described in our song ' Losing It ' … 
 Peart had been suffering from chronic tendonitis and shoulder problems . Bandmate Geddy Lee 's interpretation of Peart 's announcement was that Peart was merely confirming his retirement from touring . 
 = = Musicianship = = 
 = = = Style and influences = = = 
 Peart 's drumming skill and technique are well @-@ regarded by fans , fellow musicians , and music journalists . His influences are eclectic , ranging from Pete Thomas , John Bonham , Michael Giles , Ginger Baker , Phil Collins , Steve Gadd , Stewart Copeland , Michael <unk> and Keith Moon , to fusion and jazz drummers Billy Cobham , Buddy Rich , Bill Bruford and Gene Krupa . The Who was the first group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums . Peart is distinguished for playing " butt @-@ end out " , reversing stick orientation for greater impact and increased rimshot capacity . " When I was starting out " , Peart said , " if I broke the tips off my sticks I couldn 't afford to buy new ones , so I would just turn them around and use the other end . I got used to it , and continue to use the heavy end of lighter sticks – it gives me a solid impact , but with less ' dead weight ' to sling around . " 
 Peart had long played matched grip , but shifted to traditional as part of his style reinvention in the mid @-@ 1990s under the tutelage of jazz coach Freddie Gruber . He played traditional grip throughout his first instructional DVD A Work in Progress , and on Rush 's Test For Echo studio album . Peart went back to using primarily matched , though he does switch to traditional from time to time when playing songs from Test for Echo and during moments when he feels traditional grip is more appropriate , such as the rudimentary snare drum section of his drum solo . He discusses the details of these switches in the DVD Anatomy of a Drum Solo . 
 = = = Equipment = = = 
 With Rush , Peart has played Slingerland , Tama , Ludwig , and Drum Workshop drums , in that order . 
 Peart played Zildjian A @-@ series cymbals and Wuhan china cymbals until the early 2000s when he switched to Paragon , a line created for him by Sabian . In concert , Peart uses an elaborate 360 @-@ degree drum kit , with a large acoustic set in front and electronic drums to the rear . 
 During the late 1970s , Peart augmented his acoustic setup with diverse percussion instruments including orchestra bells , tubular bells , wind chimes , crotales , timbales , timpani , gong , temple blocks , bell tree , triangle , and melodic cowbells . Since the mid @-@ 1980s , Peart has replaced several of these pieces with MIDI trigger pads . This was done in order to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area . Some purely electronic non @-@ instrumental sounds are also used . One classic MIDI pad used is the <unk> Express which is a two @-@ octave electronic MIDI device that resembles a xylophone or piano . The <unk> Express is composed of rubber pads for the " keys " so that any stick can be used . Beginning with 1984 's Grace Under Pressure , he used Simmons electronic drums in conjunction with Akai digital samplers . Peart has performed several songs primarily using the electronic portion of his drum kit . ( e.g. " Red Sector A " , " Closer to the Heart " on A Show of Hands and " Mystic Rhythms " on R30 . ) Peart 's drum solos also feature sections performed primarily on the electronic portion of his kit . 
 Shortly after making the choice to include electronic drums and triggers , Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit : a rotating drum riser . During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit ( traditional acoustic in front , electronic in back ) . A staple of Peart 's live drum solos has been the in @-@ performance rotation @-@ and @-@ swap of the front and back kits as part of the solo itself . This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat for the audience . 
 In the early 2000s , Peart began taking full advantage of the advances in electronic drum technology , primarily incorporating Roland V @-@ Drums and continued use of samplers with his existing set of acoustic percussion . His digitally @-@ sampled library of both traditional and exotic sounds has expanded over the years with his music . 
 In April 2006 , Peart took delivery of his third DW set , configured similarly to the R30 set , in a Tobacco Sunburst finish over curly maple exterior ply , with chrome hardware . He refers to this set , which he uses primarily in Los Angeles , as the " West Coast kit " . Besides using it on recent recordings with Vertical Horizon , he played it while composing parts for Rush 's album , Snakes & Arrows . It features a custom 23 @-@ inch bass drum ; all other sizes remain the same as the R30 kit . 
 On March 20 , 2007 Peart revealed that Drum Workshop prepared a new set of red @-@ painted DW maple shells with black hardware and gold " Snakes & Arrows " logos for him to play on the Snakes & Arrows Tour . 
 Peart has also designed his own signature series drumstick with Pro @-@ Mark . The <unk> <unk> , Neil Peart Signature drumsticks , are made of Japanese White Oak , which adds more weight than a standard hickory stick . They have the thickness of a standard 5A ( 0 @.@ 551 " , 1 @.@ 4 cm ) but are longer ( 16 @.@ 25 " , 41 @.@ 3 cm ) with a thicker taper and larger olive shaped wooden tip . When Rush held their Time Machine Tour , Pro @-@ Mark released three limited edition sticks , each with one of the three designs selected from Peart 's " Steam Punk " tour kit printed with copper ink . Some other artists who use the Neil Peart Signature series include Ben Johnston of Biffy Clyro , Richie Hayward of Little Feat and Paul <unk> of The Kooks . 
 During the 2010 @-@ 11 Time Machine Tour Peart used a new DW kit which was outfitted with copper @-@ plated hardware and time machine designs to match the tour 's steampunk themes . Matching Paragon cymbals with clock imagery were also used . 
 = = = Solos = = = 
 Peart is noted for his distinctive in @-@ concert drum solos , characterized by exotic percussion instruments and long , intricate passages in odd time signatures . His complex arrangements sometimes result in complete separation of upper- and lower @-@ limb patterns ; an ostinato dubbed " The Waltz " is a typical example . His solos have been featured on every live album released by the band . On the early live albums ( All the World 's a Stage & Exit ... Stage Left ) , the drum solo was included as part of a song . On all subsequent live albums through Time Machine 2011 : Live in Cleveland , the drum solo has been included as a separate track . The Clockwork Angels Tour album includes three short solos instead of a single long one : two interludes played during other songs and one standalone . 
 Peart 's instructional DVD Anatomy of a Drum Solo is an in @-@ depth examination of how he constructs a solo that is musical rather than indulgent , using his solo from the 2004 R30 30th anniversary tour as an example . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 Peart is the main lyricist for Rush . Literature has always heavily influenced his writings and , as such , he has tackled a wide range of subjects . In his early days with Rush , much of his lyrical output was influenced by fantasy , science fiction , mythology and philosophy . However , nearly as much would deal with real world or personal issues such as life on the road and parts of his adolescence . 
 The song " 2112 " focuses on the struggle of an individual against the collectivist forces of a totalitarian state . This became the band 's breakthrough release , but also brought unexpected criticism , mainly because of the credit of inspiration Peart gave to Ayn Rand in the liner notes . " There was a remarkable backlash , especially from the English press , this being the late seventies , when collectivism was still in style , especially among journalists , " Peart said . " They were calling us ' Junior fascists ' and ' Hitler lovers . ' It was a total shock to me " . 
 Weary of ideological fealty to Rand 's philosophy of Objectivism , Peart has sought to remind listeners of his eclecticism and independence in interviews . He did not try to argue in defence of Rand 's views , saying " For a start , the extent of my influence by the writings of Ayn Rand should not be overstated . I am no one 's disciple . " 
 The 1980 album Permanent Waves saw Peart cease to use fantasy and mythological themes . 1981 's Moving Pictures showed that Peart was still interested in heroic , mythological figures , but now placed firmly in a modern , realistic context . The song " Limelight " from the same album is an autobiographical account of Peart 's reservations regarding his own popularity and the pressures with fame . From Permanent Waves onward , most of Peart 's lyrics began to revolve around social , emotional , and humanitarian issues , usually from an objective standpoint and employing the use of metaphors and symbolic representation . 
 1984 's Grace Under Pressure strings together such despondent topics as the Holocaust ( " Red Sector A " ) and the death of close friends ( " Afterimage " ) . Starting with 1987 's Hold Your Fire and including 1989 's Presto , 1991 's Roll the Bones , and 1993 's Counterparts , Peart would continue to explore diverse lyrical motifs , even addressing the topic of love and relationships ( " Open Secrets " , " Ghost of a Chance " , " Speed of Love " , " Cold Fire " , " Alien Shore " ) a subject which he purposefully avoided in the past , out of fear of using clichés . 2002 's Vapor Trails was heavily devoted to Peart 's personal issues , along with other humanitarian topics such as the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks ( " Peaceable Kingdom " ) . The album Snakes & Arrows dealt primarily and vociferously with Peart 's opinions regarding faith and religion . The lyrics of the album 's song " Faithless " exhibit Peart 's life stance , which has been closely identified with secular humanism . Peart has only explicitly discussed his religious views in his book The Masked Rider : Cycling in West Africa , in which he writes " I 'm a linear thinking agnostic , but not an atheist , folks . " 
 Opinions of Peart 's lyrics have always been divided . While fans have lauded them as thoughtful and intelligent , some critics have called them overwrought and bombastic . In 2007 , he was ranked No. 2 ( after Sting ) on Blender magazine 's list of " worst lyricists in rock " . In contrast , Allmusic has called Peart " one of rock 's most accomplished lyricists . " 
 = = Political views = = 
 For most of his career , Peart had never publicly identified with any political party or organization in Canada or the United States . Even so , his political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources . In October 1993 , shortly before that year 's Canadian federal election , Peart appeared with then @-@ Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic . In that interview , Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism . 
 Peart has often been categorized as an Objectivist and an admirer of Ayn Rand . This is largely based on his work with Rush in the 1970s , particularly the song " Anthem " and the album 2112 ; the latter specifically credited Rand 's work . However , in his 1994 Rush Backstage Club Newsletter , while contending the " individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty , " Peart specifically distanced himself from a strictly Objectivist line . In a June 2012 Rolling Stone interview , when asked if Rand 's words still speak to him , Peart replied , " Oh , no . That was forty years ago . But it was important to me at the time in a transition of finding myself and having faith that what I believed was worthwhile . " Peart has also ascribed to a philosophy that he has called " <unk> , " which means that anything that one tries to attain will be attained if one tries hard enough . 
 Although Peart is sometimes assumed to be a " conservative " or " Republican " rock star , he has criticized the Republican Party by stating that the philosophy of the party is " absolutely opposed " to Christ 's teachings . In 2005 he described himself as a " left @-@ leaning libertarian , " and is often cited as a libertarian celebrity . In July 2011 , Peart reiterated those views , calling himself a " bleeding @-@ heart libertarian " . 
 In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone , Peart stated that in US politics he supports the Democratic Party . 
 = = Books = = 
 Peart is the author of five non @-@ fiction books , the latest released in September 2012 . His growth as an author predates the published work by several years ( not including his work as Rush 's primary lyricist ) , through private letters and short travelogues sent out to a small circle of friends and family . 
 Peart 's first book , titled The Masked Rider : Cycling in West Africa , was written in 1996 about a month @-@ long bicycling tour through Cameroon in November 1988 . The book details Peart 's travels through towns and villages with four fellow riders . The original had a limited print run , but after the critical and commercial success of Peart 's second book , Masked Rider was re @-@ issued and remains in print as of 2006 . 
 After losing his wife and ( at the time ) only daughter , Peart embarked on a lengthy motorcycle road trip spanning North America . His experiences were penned in Ghost Rider : Travels on the Healing Road . Peart and the rest of the band were always able to keep his private life at a distance from his public image in Rush . However , Ghost Rider is a first @-@ person narrative of Peart on the road , on a BMW <unk> motorcycle , in an effort to put his life back together as he embarked on an extensive journey across North America . 
 Years later , after his marriage to Nuttall , Peart took another road trip , this time by car . In his third book , Traveling Music : The Soundtrack of my Life and Times , he reflects on his life , his career , his family and music . As with his previous two books , it is a first person narrative . 
 Thirty years after Peart joined Rush , the band found itself on its 30th anniversary tour . Released in September 2006 , Roadshow : Landscape With Drums , A Concert Tour By Motorcycle details the tour both from behind Neil 's drumkit and on his BMW <unk> and <unk> motorcycles . 
 Peart 's next book , Far and Away : A Prize Every Time , was published by ECW Press in May 2011 . This book , which he worked on for two years , is based around his travelling in North and South America . It tells how he found in a Brazilian town a unique combination of West African and Brazilian music . In 2014 , a follow @-@ up book , Far and Near : On Days like These , was published by ECW . It covers travels in North America and Europe . 
 Peart worked with science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson to develop a novelization of Rush 's 2012 album Clockwork Angels ; the book was published by ECW Press . Snippets of the band 's lyrics can be found throughout the story .

 = The Answer 's at the End = 
 " The Answer 's at the End " is a song by English musician George Harrison , released in 1975 on his final album for Apple Records , Extra Texture ( Read All About It ) . Part of the song lyrics came from a wall inscription at Harrison 's nineteenth @-@ century home , Friar Park , a legacy of the property 's original owner , Sir Frank Crisp . This aphorism , beginning " Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass " , had resonated with Harrison since he bought the property in 1970 , and it was a quote he often used when discussing his difficult relationship with fellow ex @-@ Beatle Paul McCartney . 
 Harrison 's adaptation of the verse for " The Answer 's at the End " coincided with a period of personal upheaval , following the harsh criticism that his 1974 North American tour had received from a number of influential concert reviewers . The song 's plea for tolerance recalls Harrison 's 1970 hit song " Isn 't It a Pity " , and in part of its musical arrangement , " The Answer 's at the End " bears the influence of Nina Simone 's 1972 cover version of that earlier composition . 
 Like much of the Extra Texture album , the song has traditionally enjoyed a mixed reception from music critics and biographers – being labelled " archaic parlour poetry " and a " bleak assessment of the human condition " on one hand , and a " gorgeously melodic song of forgiveness " on the other . The backing musicians on the recording include members of the band Attitudes , among them David Foster and Jim Keltner , who were signed to Harrison 's Dark Horse record label at the time .

 In March 1970 , George Harrison and his first wife , Pattie Boyd , moved into their Victorian Gothic residence at Friar Park in Henley @-@ on @-@ Thames , Oxfordshire . The 120 @-@ room house was built in the 1890s on the site of a thirteenth @-@ century friary by Frank Crisp , a City of London solicitor and microscopist . Harrison was immediately taken with Crisp 's penchant for whimsy , the legacies of which included interior features such as doorknobs and light switches shaped as monks ' faces ( which meant " tweaking " a nose in order to turn each light on ) , and a carving of a monk 's head that showed him smiling on one side and frowning on the other . A keen horticulturalist and an authority on medieval gardening , Crisp established 10 acres of formal gardens , which similarly reflected his eccentric tastes . 
 From midway through the twentieth century until 1969 , ownership of Friar Park resided with the Roman Catholic Church . As a result , paint masked some of Crisp 's inscriptions inside the house , but outside , signs reading " Don 't keep off the grass " , " Herons will be prosecuted " and " Eton boys are a Harrowing sight " remained intact . 
 Harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning , which he described to his Hare Krishna friend Shyamasundar Das as " like songs really , about the devil , about friendship , life " . One example was " Shadows we are and shadows we depart " , written on a stone sundial ; another began : " Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass / You know his faults , now let his foibles pass ... " This four @-@ line verse was written above an entrance @-@ way in a garden wall , and it was an aphorism that Harrison soon took to quoting in interviews . On 28 April 1970 , just over two weeks after the Beatles ' break @-@ up , he used the words during an interview for New York 's <unk> Radio , as Village Voice reporter Howard Smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles . In October 1974 – towards the end of what Harrison termed a " bad domestic year " , following his split with Boyd , and shortly before his troubled North American tour with Ravi Shankar – he used the same quote in an interview with BBC Radio 's Alan Freeman , when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex @-@ Beatles . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Harrison wrote his first Friar Park @-@ inspired composition , " Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp ( Let It Roll ) " , within two months of moving in . As with the " <unk> " that surfaced in the lyrics to his 1974 single " Ding Dong , Ding Dong " , a number of years elapsed before he incorporated the " Scan not a friend " inscription into a song . In 1975 , it provided the central theme to " The Answer 's at the End " , a composition that , theologian Dale Allison has written , " expresses the personal doubts and religious uncertainty George experienced in the mid @-@ 1970s " . This temporary uncertainty contrasted with his previous devotion to a Hinduism @-@ aligned spiritual path , Allison notes . It was also a period marked by Harrison 's excessive use of alcohol and cocaine – a symptom of his despondency following the 1974 North American tour and the generally unfavourable reception afforded his Dark Horse album . 
 The song begins in the key of D , before changing key to F for the choruses . In its musical mood , authors Robert Rodriguez and Elliot Huntley liken the released recording to " Isn 't It a Pity " , issued on Harrison 's 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass , while Simon Leng describes " The Answer 's at the End " as a ballad set to a " mellow , reflective soul mood " , like much of its parent album , Extra Texture ( Read All About It ) . 
 According to the way he renders Crisp 's inscription in his 1980 autobiography , I , Me , Mine , Harrison made a minor alteration to the original text 's third line ( " Life is one long enigma , true , my friend " ) for his opening verse : 
 Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass 
 You know his faults , now let his foibles pass 
 Life is one long enigma , my friend 
 So read on , read on , the answer 's at the end . 
 In another passage from I , Me , Mine , read out by his son Dhani in the 2011 documentary George Harrison : Living in the Material World , Harrison explains that these words helped him reach a better understanding of human relationships and others around him . 
 The theme of tolerance is further reflected in the song 's chorus , where Harrison urges : " Don 't be so hard on the ones that you love / It 's the ones that you love , we think so little of ... " The chorus lyrics echo the message of " Isn 't It a Pity " , in this case , author Ian Inglis writes , providing a " bleak assessment of the human condition " . 
 The second verse begins with an example of what Harrison biographer Alan Clayson views as the " restricted code " found in the lyrics on much of Extra Texture . Harrison sings , " The speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech / But what 's often in your heart is the hardest thing to reach " – the second line of which , Allison writes , " is surely [ Harrison ] talking about his inability to find God , who for him dwells , above all , inside the human being " . Allison suggests that , with the singer describing life as first an " enigma " and then a " mystery " , the previous certainties of his faith have disappeared ; true to the song title , Allison continues , " Only death will reveal ... whether his religious beliefs have been true or false . " 
 As a further reference to the sentiment regarding friendship expressed in " Isn 't It a Pity " , the middle section of " The Answer 's at the End " reflects the influence of Nina Simone 's 1972 cover of that earlier song . According to his recollection in I , Me , Mine , Harrison added this section , or coda , when recording " The Answer 's at the End " . In the lines " And isn 't it a pity how / We hurt the ones we love the most of all ... " , Inglis notes the influence of the 1944 pop standard " You Always Hurt the One You Love " . 
 In the final half @-@ verse , following a brief instrumental passage , Harrison <unk> the second line of Crisp 's text to " You know my faults , now let my foibles pass " . Rodriguez remarks that the subject of reserving judgement would have resonated with Harrison at this time , given the " shellacking " he had recently received in music publications such as Rolling Stone . 
 Among the former Beatle 's biographers , interpretations differ over the message of Extra Texture songs such as " The Answer 's at the End " , with regard to his spirituality . Like Dale Allison , Gary Tillery writes of Extra Texture revealing Harrison 's " inner turmoil at having strayed from his faith " . Leng views this composition as " a deliberate tempering of tone rather than a change in fundamental beliefs " , however , with the song 's choruses " <unk> [ ing ] the search for universal solutions to a simpler , earthbound observation " . Joshua Greene similarly writes that Harrison had " regained strength and relaxed his missionary zeal " during 1975 . Greene references " The Answer 's at the End " while stating that " a modest appeal for tolerance " had now replaced the singer 's earlier " exhortations to chant and warnings about rebirth in the material world " .

 Harrison taped the basic track for " The Answer 's at the End " at A & M Studios in Los Angeles on 22 April 1975 . During the previous month , Harrison attended a press party held by McCartney and the latter 's band Wings , on board the Queen Mary at Long Beach – an event that marked the first social meeting between the two former bandmates since December 1970 . McCartney biographer Howard Sounes views Harrison 's attendance as evidence of a " Beatles rapprochement " , five years after their break @-@ up . 
 Authors Nicholas Schaffner and Rodriguez have commented on the rushed and expedient nature of the sessions for Extra Texture , an album that saw out Harrison 's commitments to EMI @-@ affiliated Apple Records and allowed him to sign with his own , A & M @-@ distributed label , Dark Horse Records . Rather than use his Friar Park studio , Harrison recorded the album at a facility he admitted to finding " technically limiting " , since he was in Los Angeles overseeing projects by his various Dark Horse acts when studio time became available , following the cancellation of sessions for Splinter 's second album . Another of these acts was Attitudes , a band put together by his friend , session drummer Jim Keltner . " The timing was perfect , " Leng writes of Harrison 's approach to making Extra Texture , " as this latest signing to Dark Horse provided a ready @-@ made backup band , close at hand . " 
 Although Attitudes guitarist Danny <unk> did not play on the album , " The Answer 's at the End " was one of two songs that featured all three of the other band members : Keltner , pianist / musical arranger David Foster and bassist / lead singer Paul Stallworth . Another guest musician on the recording was keyboard player Gary Wright , a regular contributor to Harrison 's solo work throughout the 1970s and soon to enjoy a career breakthrough with his Dream Weaver album ( 1975 ) . A & M engineer Norman Kinney , who had carried out the mix down for the Concert for Bangladesh recordings four years before , added the song 's percussion , which the mastering sheet lists as tambourine and shaker . As for all the songs on the album , overdubs on the basic track were carried out between 31 May and 6 June . 
 Huntley describes " The Answer 's at the End " as " the first of the piano songs " on Extra Texture . While piano and other keyboard instrumentation was typically favoured throughout the album , the song also contains multiple guitar parts , in keeping with the sound more traditionally associated with Harrison . Credited to Harrison , these parts comprise 12 @-@ string acoustic guitar , electric guitar arpeggios over the choruses , and a brief solo . During the quieter , " isn 't it a pity how ... " codas , Leng writes , Harrison " semi @-@ scats " the words , " gospel style , over sundown jazz piano " – a vocal affectation that reflected his immersion in the soul genre . Following the first of these codas , the full band returns for the short instrumental break , after which Harrison repeats the choruses , with his singing growing " more impassioned " , Huntley writes . The song ends with what Leng calls a second " smoochy coda " . 
 A string arrangement , arranged and conducted by Foster , was overdubbed on 6 June at A & M. Over the codas , where Huntley notes " the merest veneer of the strings " accompanying Harrison 's vocal , this orchestral part incorporates aspects of the string arrangement on John Lennon 's recent hit song " # 9 Dream " , which in turn had been inspired by John Barham 's score for " Try Some , Buy Some " , co @-@ produced by Harrison and Phil Spector in 1971 .

 " The Answer 's at the End " was released on 22 September 1975 as the second track on Extra Texture ( Read All About It ) . Music critics immediately derided the song for its funereal tempo , which was all the more obvious after the upbeat album opener , " You " . 
 Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone referred to " The Answer 's at the End " as " padded subterfuge " which could " easily " have been cut down to two minutes from its length of 5 : 32 . In the NME , Neil Spencer wrote that , following " You " , " hopes of Hari 's revival are comprehensively dashed by five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes of the inordinately dreary ' The Answer 's At The End ' " . Spencer described it as " one of Hari 's <unk> Homilies full of crusty chunks of potted wisdom " .

 Writing 21 years after its release , Alan Clayson dismissed the track , calling it " archaic parlour poetry " , on an album full of " long , dull melodies " . Simon Leng admires the " warm sonic scenes " of " The Answer 's at the End " and recognises it as an " interesting " composition , one that " ponders the nature of relationships " in a similar way to Bob Dylan 's 1975 album Blood on the Tracks . Leng groups the song with another Extra Texture track , " Grey Cloudy Lies " , however , as " two slabs of introspection " that suffer from being " part calls for tolerance and part expression of downright despair " . " [ T ] he old , bold George is no more , " Leng laments of " The Answer 's at the End " . " The certainties of ' The Lord Loves the One ' seem to have dissipated ... The passionate searcher of ' Hear Me Lord ' sounds defeated , asking for a little ' live and let live ' . " While similarly noting the bleakness of the subject matter , Ian Inglis opines : " The lack of optimism in his words is matched by a largely inconspicuous melody and an inconsistent production in which alternate piano , strings , and guitar interludes fail to provide a coherent musical context . " 
 " The Answer 's at the End " has its admirers , with music journalist Rip Rense citing the song as an example of how " even the rather hasty " Extra Texture offers " some of the most affecting moments in [ Harrison 's ] career " . With reference to the song 's second verse , Rense adds : " and how many songwriters have ever sung a line as wonderful as ' The speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech ? ' " Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise " The Answer 's at the End " as a " highlight " of the album , while Elliot Huntley terms it a " gorgeously melodic song of forgiveness " . Huntley praises the track 's " epic sweep " and writes of the Simone @-@ inspired coda : " This is one of my favourite moments of the entire Harrison back @-@ catalogue , especially when the ensemble returns to see the song through to its conclusion ... " 
 AllMusic 's Richard Ginell describes " The Answer 's at the End " as one of Harrison 's " most beautifully harmonized , majestic , strangely underrated ballads " . Along with the Extra Texture tracks " You " and " This Guitar ( Can 't Keep from Crying ) " , Ginell rates the song " among the best " from Harrison 's solo career . In his book covering the Beatles ' first decade as solo artists , Fab Four FAQ 2 @.@ 0 , Robert Rodriguez includes " The Answer 's at the End " in a chapter that discusses eight overlooked Harrison compositions , and notes the song 's " grace and majesty " , reminiscent of " Isn 't It a Pity " . In December 2001 , Billboard editor @-@ in @-@ chief Timothy White , a longstanding friend of the former Beatle , titled his Harrison obituary " The Answer 's at the End " , a piece that went on to win an ASCAP @-@ Deems Taylor Award for excellence in music journalism . 
 Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years reissue of Extra Texture , for The Second Disc , Joe Marchese highlights " the touching ' The Answer 's at the End ' " among the " top @-@ draw material " found on the album . In his review for Paste magazine , Robert Ham views the song as a " [ moment ] when Harrison 's focus returns " on Extra Texture and one of the album 's ballads that " cut deep " . New Zealand music critic Graham Reid writes that " the melancholy and string @-@ enhanced The Answer 's At the End makes a lovely plea " , and he suggests that had Harrison recorded the track with Phil Spector , it " might not have sounded out of place " on All Things Must Pass .

 = Soft Light ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Soft Light " is the twenty @-@ third episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It originally aired on the Fox network on May 5 , 1995 . It was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by James A. Contner . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology , or overarching fictional history . " Soft Light " received a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 5 and was watched by 8 @.@ 1 million households . The episode generally received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , an ex @-@ student of Scully 's ( Kate Twa ) asks the agents to help her with her first investigation concerning a number of disappearances with very few clues . Mulder ponders the idea of spontaneous human combustion but rethinks it when they find a man , Chester Ray Banton ( Tony Shalhoub ) , who is afraid of his own shadow . Banton is a scientist researching dark matter , and his shadow has somehow developed the ability to disintegrate people who come across it . 
 " Soft Light " was the first The X @-@ Files episode written by Gilligan , who would go on to write several acclaimed episodes such as " Pusher " , " Bad Blood " and " Memento Mori " . " Soft Light " was one of the first episodes written by someone not on the main writing staff for The X @-@ Files . Originally , the script called for Banton 's shadow to be able to move independently , but it was rewritten to save on animation costs . In addition , the character of X ( Steven Williams ) was not in the script initially . His character was added to give Banton a legitimate fear of the government . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At a hotel in Richmond , Virginia , Chester Ray Banton ( Tony Shalhoub ) frantically knocks on the door of a room , seeking a person named Morris . Banton 's shouts attract the attention of Patrick Newirth , a guest in the room across the hall . When Newirth looks through his peephole , Banton 's shadow slips beneath the door . Newirth suddenly evaporates , leaving a strange burn mark on the floor . Banton realizes what has happened and flees the scene . 
 The case of Newirth 's death , the latest in several of its kind , is assigned to local detective Kelly Ryan ( Kate Twa ) . She seeks help from Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , her former instructor at the FBI Academy . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) also takes part in the investigation , believing Newirth died from spontaneous human combustion . While searching the home of an earlier victim , the agents realize that both she and Newirth had recently traveled by train . Meanwhile , Banton sits in a train station , cautiously looking at the floor ; because the room is lit by soft light , his shadow cannot be seen . After he leaves , Banton is confronted by two police officers patrolling the area . Despite Banton 's warnings , the officers step into his shadow and disappear , leaving more burn marks . 
 The following day , while reviewing the station 's surveillance tapes , Mulder sees footage of Banton staring at the floor . After blowing up the frame , Mulder sees the logo for a company called Polarity Magnetics on Banton 's jacket . The agents visit Polarity Magnetics , where they meet scientist Christopher Davey ( Kevin McNulty ) . He identifies Banton , a physicist conducting research into dark matter . Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in his laboratory in which he was locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of subatomic particles . His account is enough for Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion , but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory . 
 The agents find Banton at the train station , but he runs to a poorly lit area . He declares that walking into his shadow will kill the agents , so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights . Banton allows himself to be taken to a mental hospital , where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request . He tells the agents that the accident in his laboratory caused his shadow to behave like a black hole , splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy . Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents , and that the government wants to exploit him . Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning , declaring the case closed , despite Mulder 's objections . Mulder contacts X ( Steven Williams ) , who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton . However , X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power . In the process , the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton 's shadow falls upon them . Banton flees from the hospital . 
 Banton returns to Polarity Magnetics and is confronted by Ryan , whom he reluctantly kills with his shadow when she tries to arrest him . Banton orders Davey to destroy him with the particle accelerator , but Davey reveals that he has been helping the government hunt him down . Davey locks Banton in with the particle accelerator , but is shot by X. Mulder and Scully arrive soon after , seemingly too late to save Banton from being vaporized by the accelerator ; Mulder realizes that X has betrayed him , and tells X to never contact him again . The case is considered closed , but Mulder notes that Davey disappeared after the incidents . The episode ends as X enters a research facility where experiments are being performed on a despairing Banton . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Soft Light " was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by James A. Contner . Gilligan was a fan of The X @-@ Files , and after talking about the show to his agent , who was a relative of series creator Chris Carter , he arranged a meeting between Gilligan and Carter . During it , Gilligan praised the show , and Carter asked if the writer had any ideas for it , to Gilligan 's surprise . His reply was that he had been observing his shadow and thought it would be " creepy " if it began moving independently . Gilligan wrote the episode as a freelancer ; after the episode was finished , Carter asked him to join the staff . 
 Gilligan inserted a reference to the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first season episodes " Squeeze " and " Tooms " in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder . The episode represents one of the first entries in the series to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X @-@ Files . Originally , the script called for Banton 's shadow to be able to move independently ; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect . Gilligan later noted , " they rewrote the episode [ … ] this saved an enormous amount of money in animation costs . " In addition , the character of X was not in the first draft of the script . However , the series staff realized that Banton 's fear of having the government control him should be " more than just paranoia " . Thus , X was written into the story . Writer Frank Spotnitz later noted , " it had been a long time since X had done anything and the character really needed to grow . " 
 The episode guest stars Tony Shalhoub as Dr. Banton . Shalhoub , who had a recurring role on the NBC series Wings , was not familiar with The X @-@ Files when he was offered the part because at the time he did not watch much television . Instead , he was sent the script and enjoyed it — due to the show 's similarities to The Twilight Zone — and agreed to appear in the episode . When Shalhoub informed people that he was going to Vancouver to film an episode of the series , he claimed that " the response was unbelievable " . Shalhoub was impressed with the on @-@ location filming that the series did ; he noted , " Ninety @-@ nine percent of our filming on Wings is done on a soundstage , while most of their material is shot on location in and around Vancouver . It 's an ideal city because it gives producers so many options . " 
 The train station was filmed at both Via Rail 's Pacific Central Station and the Pacific Marine Training Institute in Vancouver . The Pacific Marine Training Institute initially only allowed filming after 5 pm , before the persistence of the location managers led the dean of the station to allow the crew to commence filming at 2 pm . During production , Gilligan financed a trip to the show 's filming locations in Vancouver and followed production with a video camera , a feat then unheard of for a writer on The X @-@ Files .

 " Soft Light " was originally aired in the United States on the Fox Broadcasting Company on May 5 , 1995 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on February 13 , 1996 on BBC One .

 " Soft Light " received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a " B – " and noted that the episode " gains points for the obscure subject matter " but " loses them for the strained conspiratorial element " . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also gave it a " B – " . He praised the cold open for its strangeness and X 's involvement , but thought that the explanation for Banton 's shadow was not satisfactorily fleshed out . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five . The two wrote positively of the episode 's case , calling it one wherein " Mulder and Scully get to investigate properly , coming up with theories that they later build on or retract . " Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the episode 's conclusion , noting that " there 's no better illustration for distrusting the government than the brilliant closing scene " which features Shalhoub " fixed to a chair , bombarded with flashes of light , as one single tear rolls down his terrified face . " Other reviews were decidedly more critical . John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 5 out of 10 and wrote , " Overall , this episode falls short due to a completely ludicrous central concept , only partially countered by an interesting resolution highlighting the more sinister side of Informant X. Much like last season ’ s final few episodes , this season is ending with plenty of hints that Mulder and Scully are pushing the wrong buttons . " 
 = Lavochkin La @-@ 152 = 
 The Lavochkin La @-@ 152 , ( USAF reporting name - Type 4 ) , and its variants , was a jet fighter prototype designed and manufactured by the Lavochkin Design Bureau ( OKB ) shortly after the end of World War II . Derived from the Lavochkin La @-@ 150 , the 152 used several different engines , but the program was canceled as other fighters with more powerful engines and swept wings showed more promise . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 = = = Izdeliye 152 = = = 
 Following the limited success of the 150 , drastic changes were introduced to improve performance and ease of maintenance . The RD @-@ 10 engine , rated at 8 @.@ 8 kN ( 2 @,@ 000 lbf ) of thrust , was moved to the front of the nose and its cowling formed the bottom of the forward fuselage . This position minimized thrust losses due to the length of the intake duct and allowed the engine to be changed much more easily than its predecessor . The cockpit was widened and moved to a position over the mid @-@ set wings , even with the engine 's exhaust nozzle . The pilot 's seat back was armored and he was protected by an armor plate to his front and a bulletproof windscreen . Three fuel tanks were positioned ahead of the cockpit and one behind it with a total capacity of 620 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 370 lb ) of fuel . The removable , mid @-@ mounted wings used several different laminar flow airfoils over their span . Each wing had a single spar , slotted flaps and ailerons . The tricycle undercarriage retracted into the fuselage , which meant that the aircraft had a very narrow ground track . The aircraft was armed with three 23 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 91 in ) Nudelman @-@ Suranov NS @-@ 23 autocannon , two on the starboard side of the aircraft 's nose and the other on the port side . Each gun had 50 rounds of ammunition . 
 The 152 made its first flight on 5 December 1946 and the manufacturer 's trials completed on 23 June 1947 . State acceptance trials commenced on 12 July , but the prototype crashed on the eighth flight when the engine failed on approach . The maximum speed attained by the 152 before its crash was only 840 kilometers per hour ( 520 mph ) . 
 = = = Izdeliye 154 = = = 
 The Lavochkin OKB decided to improve the performance of the 152 in late 1946 by replacing the RD @-@ 10 engine with a more powerful Lyulka TR @-@ 1 turbojet of 12 @.@ 3 kN ( 2 @,@ 800 lbf ) thrust . The design work was completed in September 1947 , and construction began of a prototype shortly afterward , but the engine was not yet ready for testing and the project was canceled . The only other significant difference from the 152 was that each cannon was furnished with 75 rounds of ammunition . 
 = = = Izdeliye 156 = = = 
 Meanwhile , the OKB had been developing two afterburning versions of the RD @-@ 10 to increase the engine 's power . The more successful model was only 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) longer and weighed an additional 31 kilograms ( 68 lb ) more than the original engine . Its power , however , was increased by an additional 3 @.@ 3 kN ( 740 lbf ) , over 30 % more thrust . This engine was designated the izdeliye YuF by the bureau and was fitted into an aircraft 152 prototype in November 1946 , initially designated as the <unk> ( <unk> - Second ) . This was changed to Aircraft 156 the following month . 
 In addition to the more powerful engine , the aircraft now had an ejection seat , additional cockpit armor , and a revised canopy . More importantly , it was fitted with new wings with a greater span and more surface area ; they also had a new airfoil designed to delay Mach tuck . The area of the tailplane and the vertical stabilizer was also increased . Two prototypes were built and the first one was completed in February 1947 and made its first flight on 1 March . The second prototype joined the manufacturer 's trials later that month . One of these aircraft participated in the Tushino flypast on 3 August 1947 , where it was given the USAF reporting name of Type 5 . The additional power increased the aircraft 's top speed by 40 – 70 km / h ( 25 – 43 mph ) over the 152 . The second prototype began state acceptance trials on 9 September and demonstrated a maximum speed of 905 km / h ( 562 mph ) at an altitude of 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 6 @,@ 560 ft ) . It could reach 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 16 @,@ 400 ft ) in four minutes using afterburner . The aircraft was rejected by the Soviet Air Forces when the trials were concluded on 28 January 1948 . The report said that the YuF engine was required more work before it was ready for production , the aircraft had problems with longitudinal stability , excessive stick forces from the ailerons and elevators , and the undercarriage was troublesome . Lavochkin consequently canceled the program .

 An experimental version of Izdeliye 156 was built in 1947 under the name of Izdeliye 174TK ( <unk> <unk> - thin wing ) . It had a very thin , straight wing of 6 % thickness , believed to be the thinnest yet flown in the world , and an imported Rolls @-@ Royce Derwent V engine , rated at 15 @.@ 6 kN ( 3 @,@ 500 lbf ) , mounted in the nose . The three NS @-@ 23 cannon had to be repositioned on the bottom of the nose to accommodate the engine . It was first flown in January 1948 and had a top speed of 970 km / h ( 600 mph ) at sea level . It reached an altitude of 5 @,@ 000 meters in only 2 @.@ 5 minutes , but even these impressive gains over the 156 were inferior to the swept @-@ wing Lavochkin La @-@ 160 that had flown nine months earlier and the program was canceled .

 = Minoru Yasui = 
 Minoru " Min " Yasui ( Japanese : <unk> Yasui Minoru , October 19 , 1916 – November 12 , 1986 ) was a Japanese American lawyer from Oregon . Born in Hood River , Oregon , he earned both an undergraduate degree and his law degree at the University of Oregon . He was one of the few Japanese Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor who fought laws that directly targeted Japanese Americans or Japanese immigrants . His case was the first case to test the constitutionality of the curfews targeted at minority groups . 
 His case would make its way to the United States Supreme Court , where his conviction for breaking curfew was affirmed . After internment during most of World War II , he moved to Denver , Colorado in 1944 . In Denver , Yasui married and became a local leader in civic affairs , including leadership positions in the Japanese American Citizens League . In 1986 , his criminal conviction was overturned by the federal court . 
 In 2015 , Senator Mazie K. Hirono nominated Yasui for the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest civilian award of the United States . On November 16 , 2015 , President Barack Obama announced that Yasui would receive a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom . The Medal was presented to Lori Yasui in a White House ceremony November 24 , 2015 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in Hood River , Oregon , on October 19 , 1916 , Minoru Yasui was the son of Japanese immigrants <unk> and Masuo Yasui . The third son of nine children born to this fruit @-@ farming family , he graduated from the local high school in Hood River in 1933 . At the age of eight he spent a summer in Japan , and later was enrolled in a Japanese language school in Oregon for three years . Yasui went on to college after high school at the University of Oregon in Eugene . At the school Yasui earned a bachelor 's degree from the school in 1937 and a law degree from the University of Oregon Law School in 1939 . He also was a member of the United States Army 's Reserve Officer Training Corps ( ROTC ) program at the university , earning a commission after graduation in 1937 . ROTC was a requirement of all male students during this time period for the first two years of the four @-@ year program . Yasui was commissioned on December 8 , 1937 , as a second lieutenant in the Army 's Infantry Reserve . 
 After law school he passed the bar and began practicing law in Portland , Oregon in 1939 . He found it hard to find work in Portland , but through the connections of his father , he started working for the Japanese government at its consulate in Chicago , Illinois . He was employed as one of several Consular attachés at that office , mainly doing clerical work . Following the attack on Pearl Harbor , which drew the United States into World War II against Japan and Germany , Yasui resigned his position with the consulate on December 8 , 1941 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Yasui returned to Hood River from Chicago after his father , Masuo Yasui , requested that he come home in order to report for military duty . After returning to Hood River , he tried to report for duty with the United States Army at the Vancouver Barracks in neighboring Washington , but was denied from serving on nine occasions . Masuo Yasui was arrested on December 13 , 1941 , by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as an enemy alien , and had his assets frozen . Min Yasui moved to Portland and opened a private law practice in order to help the Japanese Americans put their affairs in order . President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19 , 1942 , that allowed the military to set up exclusion zones , curfews , and ultimately the internment of Japanese Americans during the war . 
 On March 28 , 1942 , Yasui deliberately broke the military implemented curfew in Portland , by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11 : 00 pm in order to test the curfew ’ s constitutionality . He first asked an officer on the street to arrest him but was told to " Run along home , <unk> boy , " and so he walked into the police station . Later , on bail , he learned that a grand jury had indicted him . After the notice was given for the Japanese to evacuate , Yasui notified the authorities that he had no intentions of complying , and went to his family 's home in Hood River . This violated another law restricting travel of Japanese Americans , and authorities arrested him in Hood River .
