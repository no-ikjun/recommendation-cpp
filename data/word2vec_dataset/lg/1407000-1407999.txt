 = La fille aux cheveux de lin = 
 La fille aux cheveux de lin is a musical composition by French composer Claude Debussy . It is the eighth piece in the composer 's first book of Préludes , written between late 1909 and early 1910 . The title is in French and translates roughly to " The Girl with the <unk> Hair " . The piece is 39 measures long and takes approximately two and a half minutes to play . It is in the key of G ♭ major . 
 The piece , named after the eponymous poem by Leconte de Lisle , is known for its musical simplicity , a divergence from Debussy 's style at the time . Completed in January 1910 , it was published three months later and premiered in June of that same year . The prelude is one of the most recorded pieces of Debussy 's , both in its original version and in subsequent various arrangements . 
 = = Background and influence = = 
 The title La fille aux cheveux de lin was inspired by Leconte de Lisle 's poem by the same name , one of his Chansons <unk> ( Scottish songs ) from his 1852 collection Poèmes antiques ( Ancient Poems ) . The image of a girl with flaxen @-@ coloured hair has been utilized in fine art as a symbol of innocence and naivety . Musical writers have suggested that Debussy 's successful portrayal of these emotions was tied in with the musical simplicity of the prelude — specifically , the technical and harmonic elements . His choice of simplicity for this piece was highly unusual , since it deviated from his style at the time and brought back the simple harmonies that he had utilized in his earlier musical compositions , which were more traditional . 
 Debussy had previously utilized the title for a mélodie he wrote from 1882 to 1884 . However , it does not feature any similarities to the 1910 prelude , and merely has a " distant familial relationship " with the prelude at most according to James R. Briscoe in the music journal 19th @-@ Century Music . The song , which is one of his earlier works and remains unpublished , was dedicated to Marie @-@ Blanche <unk> . She had an affair with Debussy at the time , and he dedicated most of the compositions he wrote from 1880 to 1884 to her . 
 = = History = = 
 The prelude was completed on 15 – 16 January 1910 , and was first published in April of that same year , along with the rest of his preludes from Book I. Its first performance was given by Franz <unk> at the Bechstein Hall in London two months later , on 2 June . This was followed by an American premiere at the Stockbridge Casino in Stockbridge , Massachusetts on 26 July 1910 , performed by Walter Morse Rummel . Subsequently , the French premiere took place the following year on 14 January at the Société Nationale de Musique in Paris , with Ricardo Viñes performing the work . 
 A transcription of the prelude for violin and piano was created by Arthur Hartmann — a close friend of Debussy — and released in May 1910 . 
 La fille remains one of the most recorded musical compositions of Debussy 's . Despite its performance on a recurring basis , the prelude remains popular among audiences , partly because of its " memorable tune " which is juxtaposed with a " mellow accompaniment " . It has received acclaim for its expansiveness of emotion , with the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch 's Clarke Bustard describing the piece as " perhaps the most delicately characterful " out of all his twenty @-@ four preludes . 
 = = Musical analysis = = 
 = = = Placement within Preludes , Book I = = = 
 Debussy was known for his meticulousness in the arrangement of his preludes . Pianist and musical writer Paul Roberts asserts that this prelude , along with the two that immediately precede it , forms " the central arch " of Book I 's structure , since the three pieces provide the most " dramatic contrast " out of all the preludes in the first book . The sixth prelude , Des pas sur la neige ( Footprints in the Snow ) , evokes a feeling of sadness and isolation , while Ce qu 'a vu le vent d <unk> ( What the West wind saw ) — the seventh — exudes a violent and tumultuous nature . In stark contrast to these two , La fille brings about a sense of gentle " lyricism " and " warmth " , which is uncharacteristic of Debussy 's music of this kind . By placing these three preludes in this particular order , Debussy ensured that arguably the most technically challenging prelude of the collection ( Vent d <unk> ) was situated in @-@ between the two that are the simplest to play out of the twenty @-@ four . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 The prelude 's central idea takes after its title – a girl with golden hair in a pastoral setting in Scotland . Thus , it is one of many examples of Debussy 's Impressionist music , since it conjures up images of a foreign place . His utilization of pentatonic scales throughout the piece achieves this , and by blending this in with harmonizing diatonic chords and modal cadences , he creates a folk @-@ like tune . This prelude uses more plagal leading tones than any other piece composed by Debussy , and the prelude 's melody alternates between conjunct and disjunct movement throughout . 
 The piece begins with its well @-@ known opening theme consisting of three @-@ note phrases , grouped together as one eighth note and two sixteenth notes . It finishes with chords that form a plagal cadence between bars 2 and 3 , an element that is not featured in his previous preludes . The second part of the melody enters in bars 3 – 4 , evoking a Scottish ballad or resembling a tune in the style of Edvard Grieg . The melody from the opening returns in bar 8 with added harmony in the left hand . At bar 19 , the melody begins its ascent to the climax of the piece , gradually building up through the use of crescendo to propel it to peak at the end of bar 21 . Near the end of bar 22 , the melody decrescendos to the subsequent measure , where the theme of the climax is repeated an octave lower . A pianissimo drone @-@ like part that moves in parallel motion — featuring consecutive fifths in some places — comes in at bars 24 to 27 . In the next measure , the prelude 's coda sees the return of the opening theme one last time — albeit at an octave higher — followed by the droning motif . Finally , the melody ascends in parallel movement and makes use of a final plagal leading cadence to get to the home key chord in root position . This cadence neither " melodically anticipates the arrival pitch " nor does it include the tonic in the left hand . Thus , it has been described as " the ideal harmonization of the plagal leading tone . " The melody ends with two arpeggiated octave chords ( D ♭ in the left hand followed by G ♭ in the right ) , bringing the prelude to a close .

 Jeff " Swampy " Marsh ( born December 9 , 1960 ) is an American animator associated with several animated television series . Marsh was born in Santa Monica , California , where he grew up with a heavily blended family dynamic . Marsh has been and continues to be a driving force behind several animation projects , working for over six seasons on the animated television series The Simpsons . Marsh continued to work on other animated television series , including King of the Hill and Rocko 's Modern Life , before moving to England in 1996 . 
 While in England , Marsh worked on several animated programs , including Postman Pat and Bounty Hamster , and worked for BKN New Media Ltd. to produce several feature films . After six years living in England , Marsh was asked by his longtime partner Dan Povenmire to help produce Phineas and Ferb in 2007 , a concept the two had while working together on Rocko 's Modern Life . Marsh accepted and moved back to the United States ; the series has since garnered Marsh two Emmy Awards nominations for songwriting . According to an original pitch extra of Phineas and Ferb , he prefers having " Swampy " in his name , because it made his name 15 letters long and longer than most other people 's names . As of 2015 , he and Povenmire are currently producing a new series for Disney entitled Milo Murphy 's Law . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Marsh was born on December 9 , 1960 , in Santa Monica , California . Marsh was raised in a large and complicated blended family , which included his stepfather Bill . Growing up , he never felt the dynamic was treated in the media coherently enough to make it seem " normal , " which Marsh felt was unjustified since the majority of his friends were from either divorced or blended familial structures . 
 Marsh spent his summer vacations being active , going outside and digging trenches and tunnels , building tree houses , and constructing forts . He and his family were engrossed in several musical activities , with musical background dating back to Les Brown , Marsh 's grandfather . His household was filled with several different musical instruments and over the years , Marsh learned to play the banjo , trombone , trumpet , and guitar . As Marsh recalls , he would " sing into fake microphones and create full rock bands with [ his ] friends and family . " 
 In both high school and college , Marsh took architectural drawing courses and also took part in a few theater productions , which each helped him understand the view of a set builder .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 As an adult , Marsh became a vice president of sales and marketing for a computer company . One day , he " freaked out " and decided to quit . A friend of his helped him put together a portfolio and go into the animation business . He eventually found himself working on the animated television series The Simpsons as a background layout artist in 1990 . Marsh worked on the series for over six seasons and three episodes he helped produce won Emmy Awards . To help him with his animation efforts on the show , Marsh utilized several books about art , architecture design , and artistic rendering which he kept in his household library . His desk in the series ' office placed him opposite of fellow layout artist Dan Povenmire ; the two bonded over shared tastes in humor and music and quickly formed a friendship . 
 By 1993 , Marsh was working as a writer and director on Nickelodeon 's animated series Rocko 's Modern Life — the channel 's first " in house " cartoon production — for four seasons . He found himself working alongside Povenmire again , this time as a writing partner , a choice Marsh claimed was made by the crew in hopes of making Povenmire 's neatness offset his own sloppy storyboarding . The pair developed a distinctive style , including in their stories characteristic musical numbers and chase scenes . Together they won an Environmental Achievement Award for a 1996 Rocko episode they had written . 
 In 1996 , Povenmire and Marsh conceived the series Phineas and Ferb , based on their similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors . Povenmire went through several unsuccessful pitches to get the series picked up . In 1997 , Marsh was hired as one of the first artists for the Fox Network animated series King of the Hill , serving as both a storyboard artist and designer . 
 = = = Move to England = = = 
 After working on Rocko in 1996 , Marsh moved to London , England , which he considered to be " absolutely fantastic . " Marsh spent six years in the city , working on several animated television productions which included Postman Pat and Bounty Hamster , along with other projects produced by major companies , BBC , ITV and Carlton TV . He also served as a large contributor and producer for several British feature films , working for the company BKN New Media Ltd . 
 Around 2005 , Povenmire contacted Marsh , notifying him that a pitch for Phineas and Ferb had been somewhat successful and The Walt Disney Company had shown interest in producing the series but wanted to see an eleven @-@ minute pilot . Marsh immediately accepted and began packing . He had already booked a vacation to Los Angeles , while Povenmire had plans to travel to France ; while Povenmire set up a <unk> to travel to England , Marsh flew down to Los Angeles for two days where he devised a plot outline for the episode " Rollercoaster . " When Povenmire went to France , he drew the storyboards and plotted out how it would all come together , and then went to England where the pair touched up the dialogue and checked to make sure it came out how they had planned it . 
 = = = Phineas and Ferb = = = 
 Marsh moved back to the United States where Disney accepted the pilot episode and ordered a full 26 episode season . The pair still needed to convince overseas Disney executives to pick up the series , so instead of a conventional script , they recorded the storyboards for " Rollercoaster . " Povenmire then spent time dubbing over it with his voice for each character , along with sound effects and narration . When the recording was sent to the executives , they accepted and the series was officially green lit for the company 's cable network Disney Channel . It officially began broadcast on February 1 , 2008 and the cartoon name was called Phineas and Ferb . 
 Marsh and Povenmire wanted to incorporate into the show the kind of humor they had developed in their work on Rocko 's Modern Life . They included action sequences and , with Disney 's encouragement , featured musical numbers in every episode after " Flop Starz " . Povenmire described the songs as his and Marsh 's " jab at immortality " , but the pair have earned two Emmy nominations for Phineas and Ferb songs to @-@ date . A third Emmy nomination , for the episode " The Monster of Phineas @-@ n @-@ <unk> " ( 2009 ) , pitted the show against SpongeBob SquarePants , although neither nominee received the award due to an unspecific technicality . 
 The distinctive style of Tex Avery influenced the show 's artistic look , which includes geometric shapes in both the characters and the background . The style was determined by Povenmire 's first sketch of title character Phineas Flynn , who he doodled on the butcher paper covering the table during dinner with his family in a restaurant in South Pasadena , California ; he was so taken with the sketch he tore it out , kept it , and used it as the prototype for Phineas and the stylistic blueprint for the whole show . Other than being an executive producer and co @-@ founder , Marsh voices the character of Major Francis Monogram . Marsh based his performance of the character on broadcast journalist and anchorman Walter Cronkite .

 Momčilo Đujić ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> , Serbo @-@ Croatian pronunciation : [ <unk> ͡ <unk> d ͡ <unk> ͡ ɕ ] ; 27 February 1907 – 11 September 1999 ) was a Serbian Orthodox priest and self @-@ appointed Chetnik commander ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : vojvoda , вoјвода ) who led a significant proportion of the Chetniks within the northern Dalmatia region of the Independent State of Croatia during World War II . After the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia in 1934 , he joined the Chetnik Association of Kosta Pećanac . After the invasion of Yugoslavia , he defended local Serbs against the Ustaše regime and collaborated with the Axis powers against the Yugoslav Partisans throughout the remainder of the war as the commander of the Chetnik Dinara Division ( <unk> divizija , <unk> <unk> ) . He survived the war , surrendering to the British and eventually emigrating to the United States , avoiding several denied extradition attempts by the Yugoslav government , who accused him of being responsible for the deaths of 1 @,@ 500 people . Settling in California , Đujić played an important role in Serbian émigré circles and founded the Ravna Gora Movement of Serbian Chetniks alongside other exiled Chetnik fighters . He later retired to San Marcos , where he wrote poems and jokes that were published in both the United States and Serbia . He was instrumental in perpetuating Chetnik ideas in the Yugoslav Wars and controversially appointed Vojislav Šešelj as a Chetnik vojvoda in 1989 . In 1998 , Đujić said that he regretted awarding the title to Šešelj on account of his involvement with Slobodan Milošević . On 21 May 1998 , Biljana Plavšić , President of the Republika Srpska at the time , awarded him the Order of the Star of Karađorđe ( First Class ) . Đujić died at a hospice in San Diego in 1999 , aged 92 . 
 = = Early life , education and priesthood = = 
 Momčilo Đujić was born in the village of Kovačić , near Knin , on 27 February 1907 . He was the oldest of five children born to Rade and Ljubica Đujić ( née Miloš ) . The family was of Bosnian origin . Rade had moved to Kovačić with his disabled veteran father , <unk> , and his brother , Nikola , in the late 1880s and lived off his father 's Austro @-@ Hungarian Army pension for a time . Ljubica hailed from the village of <unk> , southeast of Knin . Shortly after his marriage to Ljubica , Rade established himself as a successful agricultural worker . The couple went on to have three sons and two daughters . 
 Đujić 's mother originally intended to name him Simo , after his uncle . Đujić 's father disliked the name and , having been raised listening to the gusle and reciting Serbian epic poetry , named his son after Momchil , a 14th @-@ century brigand in the service of Serbian Emperor Dušan the Mighty . Đujić finished primary school in 1918 , and graduated as the best student in his class . Between 1920 and 1924 , he attended lower gymnasium in Knin . After a two @-@ year pause , he began attending the higher gymnasium in Šibenik but did not graduate . In 1929 , he began attending the Serbian Orthodox seminary in Sremski Karlovci , graduated in 1931 and was ordained a priest two years later . He was assigned to the Orthodox parish in Strmica , near Kovačić . Shortly after , he married <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> , the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Bosansko Grahovo . The two were married in the Church of St. George in Knin , where Đujić had been baptised as an infant . Businessman Jovo Jelić and Reverend Mirko <unk> acted as witnesses . Đujić 's first child , Siniša , was born in 1934 . In 1935 , the couple received twins ( a son named Radomir and a daughter named <unk> ) . 
 Đujić and his family were relatively wealthy by the standards of Depression @-@ era Yugoslavia . Although a sizeable number of parishioners were not particularly religious and only attended church three or four times per year , Đujić earned a monthly salary of 1 @,@ 000 dinars , and received numerous gifts from locals . He also had a poultry farm , and owned a property which produced about 900 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 000 lb ) of wheat annually . Although most of the inhabitants of Strmica were impoverished , Đujić 's home was always filled with food . Due to his wealth , Đujić became the most influential person in the village . He sought to use his money and influence to help the Serb peasants in the Dalmatian <unk> . In 1934 , he organised the construction of a cultural centre in Strmica , financed and oversaw the irrigation of farmland west of <unk> and approved the reconstruction of a pair of church bells on the Church of St. John the Baptist . The reconstruction of the church bells , which had been destroyed by Austro @-@ Hungarian artillery in 1916 , was done with money donated by the Yugoslav government and greatly improved his reputation among the local population , though Đujić 's critics accused him of misappropriating funds . 
 = = Interwar Chetnik Association = = 
 In October 1934 , a Bulgarian nationalist assassinated Yugoslavia 's King Alexander in Marseille . Đujić 's reputation was such that he was chosen to stand by Alexander 's coffin as the funeral train travelled through Knin . On this occasion , he met future Chetnik commander Draža Mihailović for the first and only time . As the king 's assassination was partially orchestrated by the Ustaše , a Croatian fascist movement , Đujić armed himself and began organising Serb paramilitary groups in and around Knin . " I knew that the country would not survive , " Đujić explained , " because nobody can put Serbs and Croats in the same bag . " In late 1934 , he met with Kosta Pećanac , the head of the interwar Chetnik Association , and formed eleven Chetnik bands in the vicinity of the town . Chetnik insurgency did not have a long tradition in Dalmatia , and only emerged in the 1930s . Đujić subjected local Serbs to constant propaganda , hoping that it would convince them to join the Chetniks . Most ignored his appeals , and continued living peacefully with their Croat neighbours . 
 On 9 January 1935 , Đujić presided over a gathering of twenty newly ordained Chetniks in a village just north of Knin , together with General Ljubo Novaković and one of Pećanac 's commanders . The gathering was held in full view of the villagers , and marked the first time that Đujić publicly donned a Chetnik uniform ( World War I @-@ era Serbian Army battledress and a black <unk> cap — or <unk> — with skull and crossbones insignia ) . On 6 September 1935 , Đujić formed a Chetnik organisation in Vrlika . Several months later , he assembled a band of 70 Chetniks in the villages of Otrić and Velika <unk> . 
 Đujić became known for his fiery speeches , which earned him the nickname " Father Fire " ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Pop <unk> ) . The tone of his speeches changed depending on the course of political developments in Yugoslavia and his ideological convictions ranged from right @-@ wing royalist to left @-@ wing progressive . At certain points , Đujić appeared to embrace the fascism of Dimitrije Ljotić , and at others , he strongly propagated conservative Chetnik ideology . Đujić 's repeated calls for " democracy " and " national rights " prompted the regency of Prince Paul to brand him a " left @-@ wing agitator " . In any case , he received considerable support from the Serbian Orthodox Church in Knin . He also used his position as a priest and respected local leader to influence how the people of Strmica would vote , instructing his parishioners to cast ballots for a candidate of his choosing in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections . 
 In May 1937 , Đujić held a sermon in which he accused the Yugoslav government of being responsible for the poor working conditions of railroad workers in Dalmatia and western Bosnia . In particular , he criticised Niko Novaković @-@ Longo , a minister without portfolio in Milan Stojadinović 's government . In mid @-@ May , Đujić led a massive strike between Bihać and Knin in which more than 10 @,@ 000 disenchanted railroad workers participated . The Una – <unk> railroad was one of eight being built in Yugoslavia by two French civil engineering companies , Société de Construction des Batignolles and Société Edmond Bayer de <unk> . Đujić wished to minimize the influence that the United Workers Syndicate Union of Yugoslavia ( <unk> <unk> <unk> savez Jugoslavije , <unk> ) held over the work force in Dalmatia , and presented himself as a man out to defend the rights of workers throughout the country . The strike began on 15 May , on the Srb – Dugopolje road . After three days , it was broken up by the Yugoslav gendarmerie . Đujić then led the striking workers south to Vrpolje , where he attempted to negotiate a deal with the authorities . After negotiations broke down , Đujić led the workers north to Strmica , via Golubić and Pileći kuk . According to police records , he held a large rally at Pileći kuk and delivered a speech criticising the regency for its " pro @-@ Catholic , anti @-@ Orthodox and anti @-@ worker " policies . An eyewitness reported that Đujić waved " a red [ communist ] flag and greeted followers with a clenched fist , all while being the leader of a Chetnik band . " In Knin , Đujić and the striking workers clashed with police . The police fired a hail of bullets at the protesters , wounding three and killing a young girl that was watching the commotion . Đujić was subsequently arrested and spent ten days in prison for " insulting His Majesty " during the rally at Pileći kuk , which was attended by a crowd of over 800 people . He later received financial compensation from the Yugoslav government for the time he spent in prison . Đujić 's actions greatly enhanced his reputation amongst Dalmatian peasants , who referred to him as a " brave leader of working men " . Local authorities continued to view Đujić with suspicion , describing him as a " priest of left @-@ wing democracy " in internal documents . <unk> rumours circulated that Đujić supported Ljotić 's Yugoslav National Movement ( or Zbor ) , and that he was one of the few people that had voted for Ljotić in the 1938 Yugoslav parliamentary elections . Dalmatian authorities even suspected that Đujić was an " old Italian spy " who received orders from the Italian intelligence headquarters in Zadar , but never uncovered any evidence to substantiate these suspicions . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Following the 1938 Anschluss ( union ) of Germany with Austria , Yugoslavia shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pressure as her neighbours became aligned with the Axis powers . In April 1939 , Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with Italy when that country invaded and occupied neighbouring Albania . At the outbreak of World War II , the Yugoslav government declared its neutrality . Between September and November 1940 , Hungary and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact and Italy invaded Greece . From that time , Yugoslavia was almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites , and her neutral stance toward the war came under tremendous pressure . In late February 1941 , Bulgaria joined the Pact . The next day , German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania , closing the ring around Yugoslavia . With the aim of securing his southern flank for the pending attack on the Soviet Union , Adolf Hitler began placing heavy pressure on the country to join the Axis powers . The Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact after some delay , on 25 March 1941 . Two days later , a group of pro @-@ Western Serb @-@ nationalist air force officers deposed Prince Paul in a bloodless coup d 'état . The conspirators declared 17 @-@ year @-@ old Prince Peter of age and brought to power a government of national unity led by General Dušan Simović . The coup enraged Hitler , who declared : " even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty , she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible . " He then ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia , which commenced on 6 April 1941 . 
 Đujić did not support the coup , and was in Strmica with his family when the Axis invasion began . He realized that Yugoslavia 's collapse was inevitable after seeing a column of demoralised troops from the half @-@ mobilised 12th Infantry Division Jadranska pass his home . Once it became clear that the Royal Yugoslav Army ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije , VKJ ) could not hold the Axis advance , Đujić started blaming Croat fifth column activity for the VKJ 's military defeats . On 10 April 1941 , the Ustaše @-@ led Independent State of Croatia ( Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) was proclaimed in Zagreb and divided into German and Italian zones of occupation . Between April and August , NDH authorities implemented a policy of widespread incarcerations , massacres , forced emigration , and murder of Serbs . 
 = = = Collaboration agreements with the Italians = = = 
 Following the NDH 's establishment , Đujić narrowly escaped capture by Croat nationalists . As early as April , Đujić 's Chetnik 's began killing and mutilating Croats . This was done in retaliation for the wave of Ustaše atrocities that had befallen Serb communities across the NDH around the same time . According to Italian reports , Đujić had around 300 Chetniks under his command that month , centered mainly around Knin . By mid @-@ month , his Chetniks were launching raids against communist @-@ held villages between Bosansko Grahovo and Drvar in conjunction with the Italians , who considered him a filibuster ( <unk> ) . His Chetniks also successfully kept the Ustaše out of Knin and its surroundings , sparing the local Serb population from further massacres . As summer approached , Đujić 's Chetniks captured Drvar from the Ustaše . By early summer , he and Chetnik commander Stevo <unk> contacted the Italians and asked them to put a halt to the Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs , enable the return of Serb refugees , and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb @-@ owned property in the NDH . The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration and seriously weaken any future uprising in the area , which would have further disrupted rail traffic along the Split – Karlovac line . On 13 August , at a meeting in the village of <unk> , Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians . They secretly signed a pact of non @-@ aggression with the Italian military , and in exchange , the Italians acquiesced to Đujić 's 3 @,@ 000 Chetniks operating in and around Knin . On 31 August , at a Drvar assembly , Đujić was given the task of stopping the Italian advance on the town . Immediately afterwards , he made an agreement with the Italians granting them free passage . 
 = = = Establishment of the Dinara Division = = = 
 In early January 1942 , the Dinara Division was formed after Đujić was contacted by supreme Chetnik commander Draža Mihailović via a courier . Chetnik commander Ilija Trifunović @-@ Birčanin played a central role in organizing the units of Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia , Lika , and northern Dalmatia into the Dinara Division and dispatched former Royal Yugoslav Army officers to help . Đujić was designated the commander of the division and its goal was for the " establishment of a Serb national state " in which " an exclusively Orthodox population is to live " . Đujić says the Dinara Division was " under Draža 's command , but we received news and supplies for our struggle from [ Dimitrije ] Ljotić and [ Milan ] Nedić . [ ... ] Nedić 's couriers reached me in Dinara and mine reached him in Belgrade . He sent me military uniforms for the <unk> of the Dinara Chetnik Division ; he sent me ten million dinars to obtain for the fighters whatever was needed and whatever could be obtained . " By mid @-@ April Đujić and his troops began collaborating with the Italians in anti @-@ Partisan raids . He operated in northern Dalmatia under commander Trifunović @-@ Birčanin who acted as liaison officer between the Chetniks and Italians and whose collaboration agreements were condoned by Mihailović . By June 1942 , Đujić and other Chetnik leaders had established co @-@ operation with the Ustaše , although these relationships were " based only on their common fear of the Partisans " and " characterised by distrust and uncertainty " . Đujić actively co @-@ operated with Italian forces , with whom he had concluded a non @-@ aggression pact . In late September 1942 , Đujić 's Chetniks killed up to 200 Croats in the village of Gata near Split , causing outrage by the Italians . 
 On 10 February 1943 , Đujić , Ilija <unk> , Petar Baćović and Radovan Ivanišević , the Chetnik commanders of east Bosnia , Herzegovina , Dalmatia , and Lika , signed a joint proclamation declaring to the " people of Bosnia , Lika , and Dalmatia " that " since we have cleansed Serbia , Montenegro , and Herzegovina , we have come to help to crush the pitiful remnants of the Communist international , criminal band of Josip Broz Tito , Moša Pijade , Levi Vajnert and other paid Jews " . The Partisan rank and file was called upon to " kill the political commissars and join our ranks right away , " like the " hundreds and hundreds who are surrendering every day , conscious that they have been betrayed and swindled by the Communist Jews . " 
 Following the death of Trifunović @-@ Birčanin in February 1943 , Đujić , along with Jevđević , Baćović , and Ivanišević vowed to the Italians to carry on Trifunović @-@ Birčanin 's policies of closely collaborating with them against the Yugoslav Partisans . Đujić 's detachments in Dalmatia and western Bosnia were used by the Italians almost up to the point of their surrender . Following Italian capitulation in September 1943 , the Germans were less supportive of Đujić than the Italians had been , and restricted his activities to guarding railway tracks from Partisan sabotage . On 19 or 20 November 1943 , Mihailović ordered Đujić to collaborate with the Germans , adding that he himself was unable to openly do so " because of public opinion . " 
 = = = Retreat and surrender = = = 
 On 25 November 1944 , the Yugoslav Partisans attacked the town of Knin , which was defended by 14 @,@ 000 German troops , 4 @,@ 500 of Đujić 's Chetniks , and around 1 @,@ 500 Ustaše . On 1 December , Đujić was wounded and sent an emissary to General Gustav Fehn of the German 264th Division in Knin with the following message : 
 The Chetnik Command with all of its armed forces has collaborated sincerely and loyally with the German Army in these area from September last year . Our common interest demanded this . This collaboration has continued to the present day . [ ... ] The Chetnik Command wishes to share the destiny of the German Army in the future , too . [ ... ] The Command requests that [ the village of ] <unk> be the base for supplying our units , until a further common agreement is reached . 
 On 3 December 1944 , Đujić 's force of between 6 @,@ 000 – 7 @,@ 000 withdrew to Bihać with help from the Wehrmacht 373rd Division . The Chetniks received ammunition and food from the Germans and began a joint German @-@ Chetnik offensive against the Partisans . General Fehn organized the transportation of Đujić 's wounded Chetniks through Zagreb to the Third Reich . Đujić requested a written guarantee from Ante Pavelić , leader of the NDH , to afford him and his forces refuge in German @-@ occupied Slovenia . In addition , Dimitrije Ljotić and Milan Nedić petitioned to Nazi party official Hermann Neubacher in Vienna that Đujić 's forces should be allowed passage , as did Slovene collaborationist General Leon Rupnik . On 21 December 1944 , Pavelić ordered the military forces of the NDH to give Đujić and his forces " orderly and unimpeded passage " . However , Đujić went through an alternate route towards the Istrian peninsula , as the routes offered by Pavelić were not secure from Partisan attacks , and killed the Croatian population along the way . When Đujić reached Slovenia , his forces joined Dobroslav Jevđević 's Chetniks , Ljotić 's Volunteers , and Nedić 's Serbian Shock Corps forming a single unit that was under the command of Odilo Globocnik of the Higher SS and Police Leader in the Adriatic Littoral . Together , they tried to contact the western Allies in Italy in an attempt to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti @-@ Communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia . 
 In May 1945 , Đujić surrendered his division to Allied forces and they were then taken to southern Italy , from there to displaced persons camps in Germany and then dispersed . After staying in Paris from 1947 to 1949 , Đujić emigrated to the United States , to where many of his former followers may have followed him . 
 = = Life in exile and failed extradition attempts = = 
 In 1947 , Đujić was tried and sentenced in absentia for war crimes by Yugoslavia . He was declared a war criminal who as commander of the Dinara Division was responsible for organizing and carrying out a series of mass murders , massacres , tortures , rapes , robberies , and imprisonments , and collaborating with the German and Italian occupiers . He was accused of being responsible for the deaths of 1 @,@ 500 people during the war . 
 From 1947 to 1949 Đujić was in France . Following his arrival in the United States , Đujić and his fighters played a role in the foundation of the Ravna Gora Movement of Serbian Chetniks . Later , he enraged some in the Serbian diaspora when he endorsed a Communist @-@ authorized Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church . However , he remained strongly opposed to the Communist regime in Yugoslavia . Đujić retired to San Marcos , where he wrote poems and jokes that were published in both the United States and Serbia . 
 On 28 June 1989 , the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo , Đujić granted the title of vojvoda to Vojislav Šešelj , and ordered him " to expel all Croats , Albanians , and other foreign elements from holy Serbian soil " , stating he would return only when Serbia was cleansed of " the last Jew , Albanian , and Croat " . Šešelj was at the time an anti @-@ Communist dissident and was subsequently described for his activities in the Yugoslav Wars as " a man whose killer commando units operating in Croatia and Bosnia carried on the very worst of the Chetnik tradition . " Later Šešelj became leader of the Serbian Radical Party ( SRS ) , a government coalition partner of Serbian President Slobodan <unk> . In 1998 , Đujić publicly stated that he regretted awarding that title to Šešelj . He was quoted as saying , " I was naïve when I nominated Šešelj [ as ] Vojvoda ; I ask my people to forgive me . The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milošević " and that he is " disappointed in Šešelj for openly collaborating with Milošević 's Socialist Party , with Communists who have only changed their name . [ ... ] Šešelj has sullied the reputation of Chetniks and Serbian nationalism . " According to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) testimony of Croatian Serb leader Milan Babić , Đujić financially supported the Republic of Serbian Krajina in the 1990s . On 21 May 1998 , Biljana Plavšić , President of the Republika Srpska at the time , awarded Đujić the Order of the Star of Karađorđe ( First Class ) . Đujić 's wife <unk> died on 23 August 1995 , aged 84 . 
 On 28 May 1999 , Croatian Justice Minister Zvonimir <unk> attempted to have Đujić extradited based on lengthy evidence drawn from proceedings carried out by the Šibenik @-@ Knin County Court , but to no avail . 
 = = Death = = 
 Đujić died on 11 September 1999 at a hospice in San Diego , California at the age of 92 . He was survived by his three children , two granddaughters , four great @-@ grandchildren , his brother , Boško Đujić , and his sister , <unk> Đuric , all of whom were residents of California . A New York Times obituary following his death , written by journalist David Binder , wrote that Đujić was " a fierce foe of the Nazis , Fascists and Communists , " that participated in " epic World War II battles " and carried out many " acts of wartime bravery . " The article and its author were criticized by the Croatian government which said it was " dissatisfied and disappointed " with what it stated was " false " information included in Đujić 's biography . Editorial writer for the Washington Post , Benjamin <unk> , observed that the obituary only mentioned " in passing " the war crimes and collaboration accusations against Đujić , as well as his influence in the Yugoslav Wars . Historian Marko Attila Hoare stated that Binder 's piece displayed his " admiration of Serb Nazi @-@ collaborator Momčilo Đujić . " 
 A commemoration marking six months since Đujić 's death , organized by the " Vojvoda Momčilo Đujić " Dinara Chetnik Movement , was celebrated at St. Mark 's Church in Belgrade in March 2000 . The Serbian diaspora in the United States set up a monument dedicated to Đujić at the Serbian cemetery in Libertyville , Illinois . The management and players of the football club Red Star Belgrade visited it on 23 May 2010 . 
 = Cotswold Olimpick Games = 
 The Cotswold Olimpick Games is an annual public celebration of games and sports now held on the Friday after Spring Bank Holiday near Chipping Campden , in the Cotswolds of England . The Games probably began in 1622 , and have continued on and off to the present day . They were started by a local lawyer , Robert Dover , with the approval of King James . Dover 's motivation in organising the Games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the realm , but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together ; the Games were attended by all classes of society , including royalty on one occasion . 
 Events included horse @-@ racing , coursing with hounds , running , jumping , dancing , sledgehammer throwing , fighting with swords and cudgels , quarterstaff , and wrestling . Booths and tents were erected in which games such as chess and cards were played for small stakes , and abundant food was supplied for everyone who attended . A temporary wooden structure called Dover Castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre on what is now known as Dover 's Hill , complete with small cannons that were fired to begin the events . 
 The Games took place on the Thursday and Friday of the week of Whitsun , normally between mid @-@ May and mid @-@ June . Many 17th @-@ century Puritans disapproved of such festivities , believing them to be of pagan origin , and they particularly disapproved of any celebration on a Sunday or a church holiday such as Whitsun . By the time of King James 's death in 1625 , many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities ; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 , bringing the Games to an end . 
 Revived after the Restoration of 1660 , the Games gradually degenerated into a drunk and disorderly country festival according to their critics . The Games ended again in 1852 , when the common land on which they had been staged was partitioned between local landowners and farmers and subsequently enclosed . Since 1966 the Games have been held each year on the Friday after Spring Bank Holiday . Events have included the tug of war , gymkhana , shin @-@ kicking , <unk> <unk> , motorcycle scrambling , judo , piano smashing , and morris dancing . The British Olympic Association has recognised the Cotswold Olimpick Games as " the first stirrings of Britain 's Olympic beginnings " . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The first Olimpick Games were probably held in 1622 , organised by lawyer Robert Dover , although different sources give dates from 1601 until 1612 . Little is known about Dover . He was probably born between 1575 and 1582 in Norfolk , one of four children born to John Dover , and may have been admitted to Queens ' College at Cambridge in 1583 , leaving early to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy . Dover was admitted to Gray 's Inn on 27 February 1636 , and was probably called to the bar in 1611 , the same year he likely moved to <unk> , near Chipping Campden , with his wife and children . 
 It is unclear whether Dover began the Games from scratch , or took over from an existing event , perhaps a church ale . The Games had the approval of King James , who in his book of advice to his son , Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) , had written that to promote good feeling among the common people towards their king , " certain days in the year would be appointed , for delighting the people with public spectacles of all honest games , and exercise of arms " . Although there was at that time in England a growing admiration for the ancient Greeks , Dover may have been motivated by military rather than cultural considerations . His biographer , Christopher Whitfield , claimed that Dover combined ancient countryside practices with " classical mythology and Renaissance culture , whilst linking them with the throne and the King 's Protestant Church " . Dover believed that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the kingdom . He may also have believed that the Games would bring rich and poor together , increasing social harmony , an ideal that might explain why the event captured the public imagination . 
 Endymion Porter , a member of the court of King James , had an estate in the village of Aston @-@ sub @-@ Edge , close to Dover 's home . Dover acted as Porter 's legal agent between 1622 and 1640 , and through him James sent some of his own clothes to Dover , " purposely to grace him and consequently the solemnity [ of the Games ] " . James may also have granted Dover a coat of arms , with the motto " Do Ever Good " , as claimed by Dover 's grandson , a claim that was rejected by the heraldic authorities in 1682 . 
 The Annalia <unk> ( Annals of Dover ) , a collection of poems praising Dover and his achievements in promoting and managing the Games , was published in 1636 . The contributors included well @-@ known poets such as Michael Drayton , Ben Jonson , Thomas Randolph , and Thomas Heywood . They saw the Games as revitalising traditional English social life , and they countered opposition from the critics of such events , who complained of " drunken behaviour and sexual licence " , by stressing the " peaceful and well @-@ behaved " nature of the occasion , and even praising the Games as " a gesture of loyalty to the king " . The Games had acquired their title of " <unk> " by the time the Annalia <unk> was published , a name approved of by Dover . It secularised the proceedings , while adding an air a gentrification to the sports by linking them with the Olympics of ancient Greece . Having been brought up in a Catholic family , Dover might well have been keen not to draw attention to religion , particularly if the Games had taken over from an earlier church ale . 
 = = Proceedings = = 
 The Games took place in a natural amphitheatre on what is known today as Dover 's Hill , then called <unk> Plain , above the town of Chipping Campden , in Gloucestershire . They were held on the Thursday and Friday of Whit @-@ Week , or the week of Whitsun , which normally fell between mid @-@ May and mid @-@ June . Dover presided over the Games on horseback , dressed ceremonially in a coat , hat , feather and ruff , donated by King James . Horses and men were decorated with Dover 's favours , yellow ribbons pinned to a hat or worn around the arm , leg , or neck . Tents were erected for the gentry , who came from the surrounding counties of Gloucestershire , Oxfordshire and Worcestershire , and food was supplied in abundance . The poet Nicholas Wallington wrote that : 
 He [ Dover ] spares no cost ; this also doth afford 
 To those that sit at any board . 
 None ever hungry from these Games come home , 
 Or e 'er made <unk> of <unk> , or of room . 
 A temporary wooden building was constructed each year , called Dover Castle , from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions . Competitors were summoned to the hillside by the sound of a hunting horn , to take part in various sports . Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events , which included horse @-@ racing , coursing with hounds , running , jumping , dancing , sledgehammer throwing , fighting with swords and cudgels , quarterstaff , and wrestling . Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports , and perhaps also money for the other events . 
 The contests were refereed by officials called <unk> , from which the phrase " a stickler for the rules " is derived . <unk> were so @-@ named because they carried sticks , with which to safely separate two fighting swordsmen . No scores or times are recorded for any of the events . Portable watches of the time were " rare , costly , and relatively unreliable devices " , but perhaps just as importantly " nobody in Dover 's time was much interested in sports record @-@ keeping or record @-@ breaking " . 
 Visitors from all strata of society attended , from agricultural labourers to the nobility , some of whom travelled up to 60 miles ( 97 km ) to attend the Games . Prince Rupert attended in 1636 . 
 = = = Other diversions = = = 
 A harper dressed as the Greek poet Homer entertained the crowds , enhancing the classical Olympic theme . There was also a maze , known as a Troy Town , constructed from piled up turf with walls about 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) high , through which villagers would dance . Various games were played for small stakes in booths and tents , including chess , Irish – a game similar to backgammon – and card games such as cent , a game like piquet . King James approved of card games " when you have no other thing ado ... and are weary of reading ... and when it is foul and stormy weather " , but he considered chess to be " too obsessive a game " . 
 The Games ended with a grand firework display , centred on the castle . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 In the 17th century many Puritans believed that the slightest action might lead to sin , and even to Hell if it was not repented . They frowned on festivities such as the Games as being of pagan origin , promoting immorality and drunkenness , and disapproved of any celebration on a church holiday such as Whitsun . A Puritan revolt over a 1627 " Bringing in the May " festival at Mount Wollaston in present @-@ day Massachusetts resulted in the expulsion of its organiser from the colony . King James , on the other hand , viewed Puritanism as a challenge to the authority of the monarch . 
 The fine clothes donated by the King , which Dover wore when he presided over the Games , were not just a fashion statement , but also a political one . The feather in Dover 's hat was a " flag of defiance to virtue " in Puritan eyes , and even the starch probably used in the washing of his ruff was evil , according to the Puritan writer Philip <unk> . He described starch as " [ a ] certain kind of liquid matter ... wherein the Devil hath learned them [ non @-@ Puritans ] to wash and die their ruffs " . 
 James was succeeded by King Charles I in 1625 . The new king reluctantly consented to an Act of Parliament " for punishing divers abuses on the Lord 's Day , called Sunday " . The Act restricted the activities that were allowed to take place on a Sunday , and prohibited any meetings of people outside their own parishes on Sunday . Many Puritan landowners went even further , forbidding their workers to attend any church ales , culminating in two Somerset circuit judges ruling in 1632 that " all public ales be henceforth utterly suppressed " . 
 The following year Charles reversed the judges ' ruling of 1632 . He produced a new version of James 's Book of Sports , which he ordered to be read in every church . In it he wrote : 
 We find that under pretence of taking away abuses , there hath been a general forbidding , not only of ordinary meetings , but of the feast of the dedication of the churches , commonly called wakes ... Now our express will and pleasure is that these feasts , with others , shall be observed , and that our Justices of the Peace ... shall look to it , both that all disorders there may be prevented or punished , and that all neighbourhood and freedom , with man @-@ like and lawful exercises be used . 
 The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 brought the Games to an end . 
 = = First revival , 1660 – 1850 = = 
 The Games were revived at some uncertain date after the Restoration of 1660 . Dover had died in 1652 , and bereft of his influence , the Games became " just another drunken country festival " , according to an account written by the poet William Somervile in 1740 . By then the Games , known as Dover 's Meeting , were well established and once again quite popular , and included events such as <unk> fighting . It is unclear whether the contestants fought with metal or wooden swords , but there is no doubt that very real danger was involved . During a fight at the beginning of the 19th century , one of the contestants was so badly injured that he died soon afterwards . The wrestling competitions had become shin @-@ kicking contests , with competitors wearing heavily nailed boots , sometimes with pointed tips . The poet and writer Richard Graves described the Games in his picaresque novel The Spiritual Quixote ( 1773 ) as a " heathenish assembly " . Somervile 's account of the 1740 Games describes a general riot in which " chairs , and forms , and battered bowls are hurled / With fell intent ; like bombs the bottles fly " . Graves dramatised the enthusiasm for the women 's race for a Holland shift displayed on a pole : " six young women began to exhibit themselves before the whole assembly , in a dress hardly <unk> to the rules of decency " . By 1845 the Games were being organised by a local publican , William Drury , who paid £ 5 for the right to do so . He hired out space for stalls and booths , and presumably sold alcohol at the event . The rector of Weston @-@ sub @-@ Edge , the parish in which Dover 's Hill is located , Reverend Geoffrey Drinkwater Bourne , claimed that up to 30 @,@ 000 people were attending the Games by then , and that the hillside was full of drunk and disorderly individuals . Bourne also claimed that : 
 From 1846 onwards , the games , instead of being as they originally were intended to be <unk> conducted , became the <unk> place of all the lowest scum of the population which lived in the districts lying between Birmingham and Oxford . 
 Such accounts may have been exaggerated however , as there are few reports of police being called to the Games , and no court records of prosecutions for drunkenness or fighting . 
 The staging of the Games depended on the existence of a suitably large area of common land , but by the mid @-@ 19th century much of England 's common land was being partitioned up and fenced off . Consent for the enclosure of the parish of Weston @-@ sub @-@ Edge was given in 1850 , signalling the end of the Games in 1852 . The parish 's 969 acres ( 392 ha ) were divided among local farmers and landowners ; Reverend Bourne , who a few years earlier had complained so vociferously about the Games , received 63 acres ( 25 ha ) . 
 = = Shakespearean connection = = 
 Some historians have suggested that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare 's The Merry Wives of Windsor , and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games . But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602 , making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623 , edited by Henry Condell and John <unk> . It is therefore uncertain whether or not it was written by Shakespeare . 
 The first Shakespearean scholars to make a connection between Dover and Shakespeare were Samuel Johnson , George Steevens , Thomas Warton , and Edmond Malone ; historian Jean Wilson has commented that it required " quite imaginative leaps such as a hill referred to by Bolingbroke [ King Henry IV of England ] being the hill on which the games were held " . More recently , the historian and secretary of the Robert Dover 's Games Society , Francis Burns , has suggested that the wrestling scene in As You Like It " reflects the wrestling at the Games " . 
 Although Shakespeare may have been acquainted with Robert Dover , there is no evidence that he ever attended the Games .

 Dover 's Hill was bought by the National Trust in 1928 , and until recently contained a monument to Robert Dover . The Games were revived for the 1951 Festival of Britain , but did not return to being a regular event until the Robert Dover 's Games Society was founded in 1965 . Except when exceptionally bad weather or an outbreak of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease has forced their cancellation the Games have been held each year since 1966 , on the evening of the Friday after Spring Bank Holiday , and attract thousands of visitors . An actor dressed as Dover arrives on horseback to open the games .

After dusk a bonfire is lit , followed by a torchlight procession to the square in Chipping Campden , where the entertainment continues well into the night . 
 The British Olympic Association , in its successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London , recognised Dover 's Games as " the first stirrings of Britain 's Olympic beginnings " . Writing in 1972 , the athletics coach and sports journalist Ron Pickering said : 
 The influence of English rural sports , and the work of William Penny Brookes and Robert Dover , have been significant in the development of the Olympic Games philosophy . Almost half the events in the Modern Games are historically connected to British rural sports . Therefore we have a certain arrogant claim and a responsibility to the development of the Modern Olympic Games . 
 = Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics = 
 Nine cities submitting bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Paralympics were recognised by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . The Committee shortlisted five of them — London , Madrid , Moscow , New York City , and Paris — from which London eventually prevailed ; thus becoming the first city to host the Olympic Games for a third time . The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics was considered one of the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC . Paris was seen by some as the front @-@ runner for much of the campaign , but skillful lobbying by London 's supporters and an inspirational final presentation by Sebastian Coe led to the success of its bid . 
 After a technical evaluation of the nine original bids , the top five were shortlisted on 18 May 2004 , becoming official candidates . The remaining applicant cities — Havana , Istanbul , Leipzig and Rio de Janeiro — were eliminated . Four of the five candidate cities were prominent national capitals , which lent an increased competitive interest to the final bidding phase . Paris and Madrid earned the top scores during the application phase , but in early 2005 , a more thorough evaluation of the candidates put Paris and London in a close race that became tighter as the final vote approached . On 6 July 2005 , in a four @-@ round exhaustive ballot of the IOC ( gathered at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore ) , Moscow , New York City and Madrid were eliminated in the first three rounds . London won the final round by a margin of four votes over Paris and secured the right to host the 2012 Olympics . 
 In the month after the election , members of the Paris 2012 delegation argued that the London delegation had violated IOC rules . The key points in the accusations were London 2012 's abortive athlete incentive initiative and lobbying by then @-@ British Prime Minister Tony Blair . A public statement by IOC President Jacques Rogge dismissed these accusations , stating that the competition had been fair . Another controversy occurred during the bidding process when an undercover investigation by British television series Panorama revealed a corruption scandal associated with IOC member Ivan Slavkov and Olympic agents , who offered to deliver votes from IOC members to any 2012 Olympic bid in return for financial favours . Still recovering from the effects of the Salt Lake City scandal , the IOC reacted swiftly and <unk> toward the rule @-@ breaking individuals . 
 = = Bidding process = = 
 The Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city 's application to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) by its National Olympic Committee ( NOC ) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session . The process is governed by the Olympic Charter , as stated in Chapter 5 , Rule 34 . 
 Since 1999 , the process has consisted of two phases . During the first phase , which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline , the " applicant cities " are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organisation . This information allows the IOC to analyse the cities ' hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans . Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports , the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase . The second phase is the true candidature stage : the accepted applicant cities ( from now on referred to as " candidate cities " ) are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended , more detailed , candidature file . These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission , a group composed of IOC members , representatives of international sport federations , NOCs , athletes , the International Paralympic Committee , and international experts in various fields . The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four @-@ day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities , where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of the themes covered in the candidature file . The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session . 
 The IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics . The election is made by the assembled active IOC members ( excluding honorary and honour members ) , each possessing one vote . Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running . The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an absolute majority of votes ; if this does not happen in the first round , the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins . In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes , a special runoff vote is carried out , with the winner proceeding to the next round . After each round , the eliminated bid is announced . Following the announcement of the host city , the successful bid delegation signs the " Host City Contract " with the IOC , which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC .

 The deadline to submit applications for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was 15 July 2003 . The nine cities that submitted bids before that date also met the 15 January 2004 deadline for submission of the first phase questionnaire . Through analysis of the questionnaires , the IOC gave a weighted @-@ average score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire 's eleven themes : political and social support , general infrastructure , sports venues , Olympic Village , environment , accommodation , transport , security , past experience , finance , and legacy . If a bid 's score was higher than six ( IOC 's predefined benchmark score ) , the city was considered highly capable of hosting the Games ; otherwise , its chances were very slim . On 18 May 2004 , the IOC announced the cities accepted as candidates : 
 Paris — scored 8 @.@ 5 ( bid details ) 
 Madrid — scored 8 @.@ 3 ( bid details ) 
 London — scored 7 @.@ 6 ( bid details ) 
 New York City — scored 7 @.@ 5 ( bid details ) 
 Moscow — scored 6 @.@ 5 ( bid details ) 
 Leipzig — scored 6 @.@ 0 
 Rio de Janeiro — scored 5 @.@ 1 
 Istanbul — scored 4 @.@ 8 
 Havana — scored 3 @.@ 7 
 The five highest @-@ rated applicants progressed to the next phase as official candidate cities . As stipulated , the IOC granted them the right to use the Olympic rings on their candidature emblem , together with a label identifying each as a Candidate City . 
 = = = Evaluation of candidate cities = = = 
 By 15 November 2004 , all candidates had submitted their candidature files to the IOC . After a period of analysis by the IOC , the cities were visited by the IOC Evaluation Commission , consisting of twelve members and chaired by Moroccan IOC member Nawal El Moutawakel . The four @-@ day visits occurred between 3 February and 17 March 2005 : 
 Madrid — 3 – 6 February 
 London — 16 – 19 February 
 New York City — 21 – 24 February 
 Paris — 9 – 12 March 
 Moscow — 14 – 17 March 
 The Parisian bid suffered two setbacks during the inspection : a number of strikes and demonstrations coincided with the visit , and a report was released stating that Guy <unk> , IOC member and one of the key members of Paris 's bid team , faced charges over alleged political party financial corruption . 
 On 6 June 2005 , the IOC released the inspection team 's evaluation reports of the five candidate cities . Although these documents did not contain scores or rankings , the report for Paris was considered the most positive , followed closely by London , which had narrowed most of the gap observed at the time of the first @-@ phase evaluation in 2004 . New York City and Madrid also obtained very positive evaluations , while Moscow was considered the weakest bid . On the same day , New York City 's bid suffered a major setback following the report that the State of New York refused to fund West Side Stadium , a New York 2012 centrepiece . The New York City campaign devised an alternative plan within a week , but such a major change with only one month remaining before the final vote damaged the city 's chances . 
 Throughout the bidding process and leading up to the vote at the 117th IOC Session , Paris was widely seen as the favourite , particularly as its bid was the city 's third in recent history ( previous bids being for 1992 and 2008 ) . London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin , but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of Sebastian Coe as the head of London 2012 , on 19 May 2004 . In late August 2004 , reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris . In the final run @-@ up to the 117th IOC Session , London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest . On 1 July 2005 , IOC president Jacques Rogge , when asked who the winner would be , told the assembled press , " I cannot predict it since I don 't know how the IOC members will vote . But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close . Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes , or maybe less . " 
 = = = Final selection process = = = 
 The opening ceremony of the 117th IOC Session was held at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay in Singapore on 5 July 2005 . Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was the guest of honour and officially opened the session . Song , dance and martial arts exhibitions with the theme " One Voice , One Rhythm , One World " began the ceremony . 
 On 6 July 2005 , the election day , the IOC Session was held at the Raffles City Convention Centre . It began at 1 : 00 UTC with the one @-@ hour final presentations of the candidate cities , followed by a half @-@ hour press briefing , in the following order : Paris , New York City , Moscow , London and Madrid . The bid presentations ended at 9 : 00 UTC and a presentation of the Evaluation Commission 's final report preceded the election . Of the 116 active IOC members , 17 could not vote in the first round , leaving 99 members able to exert their voting rights . 
 The electronic ballot began at 10 : 26 UTC , and the first three rounds eliminated Moscow , New York City and Madrid , respectively . After a city was eliminated , members from that city 's country were allowed to vote in the following rounds . London and Paris made it to the fourth and final round of voting , which concluded at 10 : 45 UTC . An hour later , at 11 : 49 UTC , London was formally announced as the winner by Jacques Rogge . Approximately one billion viewers watched the announcement on live television . 
 After the announcement , the ballot results were published : London gathered more votes in the first , third and final rounds , while Madrid won the second round despite falling short on votes in the third round and being eliminated . The competitiveness of the bids from Paris and London was ultimately demonstrated by a four @-@ vote difference in the final round .

 In December 2003 , the British prime minister Tony Blair spoke about the London bid during a " sports breakfast " he hosted during a summit in Nigeria . Blair mentioned the bid in context of the positive legacy of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester : " It was partly the success of the Commonwealth Games that inspired our bid for the Olympics . " Since the IOC expressly forbids any international promotion of bids before the final candidature phase , it wrote to leading British officials asking for an explanation concerning the alleged violation . The chairmen of the Commonwealth Games Federation and the British Olympic Association , and spokesmen from Downing Street and London 2012 denied any violation of the IOC 's ethical code , insisting that Blair 's comments were taken out of context as there was no intention to promote the bid . Nevertheless , to prevent future ethical clashes , barrister Michael <unk> was appointed the ethics commissioner for the London bid two months later . 
 = = = Ivan Slavkov corruption scandal = = = 
 On 4 August 2004 , BBC 's Panorama broadcast the results of a year @-@ long investigation in which the reporters posed as consultants from a fictitious firm " New London Ventures " , which was supposed to represent businesses interested in bringing the 2012 Olympics to London . The report unveiled how some Olympic agents could guarantee votes from certain IOC members to the London bid , in exchange for favours or money . The undercover team secretly filmed its encounter with one of these agents , Goran Takac , who presented them to Ivan Slavkov , an IOC member and the Bulgarian Olympic Committee 's president . Slavkov stated he was open to negotiation since he had not made up his mind about which 2012 candidate city would get his vote . Takac mentioned that Slavkov 's position on the IOC was an advantage to bypass the rigid rules concerning meetings with other members , and that Slavkov 's services fee was included on the initial figures given to the reporters . 
 In the days leading to the programme 's broadcast , the IOC Ethics Commission launched an enquiry to investigate the accusations made in the documentary . Even though the Panorama reporters clearly stated that the London bid was nowhere associated with the investigation , the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement , hoping to distance themselves from the scandal : " What I have to make clear is that London 2012 knew nothing about this — we have nothing to hide , " said Alan Pascoe , a London 2012 vice chairman , committing to " do everything we can to co @-@ operate [ with the IOC enquiry ] and take this story off the running order " . Sebastian Coe , also a vice chairman at the time , reaffirmed Pascoe 's words and assured " London 2012 has acted properly and ethically throughout the bidding process . " After watching the documentary , IOC members and officials cleared London 2012 of any wrongdoing . 
 Following the broadcast , the IOC provisionally suspended Ivan Slavkov and forbade him from attending the 2004 Summer Olympics . Jacques Rogge claimed he was " an angry man because some people are not playing by the rules , " underlining that " Under my leadership , I can stress there is zero tolerance for unethical behaviour " . An IOC Ethics Commission report released on 25 October 2004 condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC 's investigation : " the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that : ... at no time and in no way did Mr Slavkov object to this discussion of the terms of a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom he and Mr Takac were likely to be able to influence " . Knowing about the accusation , Slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed <unk> , however the Ethics Commission report further stated that " at no point does it emerge from the meeting that Mr Slavkov 's sole intention was to catch in the act these <unk> of IOC members . " It goes on to say that Slavkov received " no mandate to ' find the real roots of corruption ' " and that he was to profit monetarily from Takac 's services . The report concluded : 
 " Mr Slavkov tarnished the honour and reputation of the Olympic Movement and the IOC ... Indeed , an IOC member 's involvement in this ' negotiation ' lent credibility to the hypothesis advanced by the journalists that there were within the IOC members and agents who could corrupt other IOC members . " 
 On 7 July 2005 , during the 117th IOC Session , Ivan Slavkov was expelled from the organisation following an 84 – 12 voting by the IOC members . 
 = = = French recriminations following vote = = = 
 The Paris delegation , led by Bertrand Delanoë , argued that Tony Blair and the London delegation had broken the IOC rules . On 11 July 2005 , Delanoë stated : " They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee . I do not say that they were flirting with the yellow line , I say that they crossed the yellow line " . A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes , which included free flights , food , vouchers for long @-@ distance calling and other financial accommodations . Immediately after announcing the initiative , London withdrew it , most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a " bidding war " . Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal , an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street . It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement : " I made it very clear that , in my opinion , the competition was fair . It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out " . Delanoë 's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders ; Claude <unk> , president of the Union for a Popular Movement ( UMP ) party of the Council of Paris , stated : " One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof " . 
 Even before the election , tensions grew between the French and British delegations , already in Singapore . The Paris bid team considered submitting a complaint against London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the Stade de France was not adequate for athletics , an action that goes against the IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid . The London team promptly denied that the two men were under contract with the bid at that time , and underlined that their opinions did not reflect the views of the London bid . 
 = = = Mistaken voting controversy = = = 
 On 23 December 2005 , Alex <unk> , an Israeli IOC member and a member of the IOC 's London 2012 Co @-@ ordination Commission , suggested that Madrid should have tied for second spot with Paris in the third round of voting , but did not do so because Greek member Lambis Nikolaou pressed the wrong button . He further postulated that if this had happened , Madrid would have beaten Paris in the resulting runoff ballot for second place , and gone on to beat London in the final round . However , Craig <unk> , a British IOC member , dismissed these words , commenting that a claim " that an unnamed member ' might ' have done something which ' might ' have brought about something else which ' might ' have brought about a different result is ' the kind of tittle @-@ tattle that happens after many an IOC vote ' . " 
 By the end of 2005 , Lambis Nikolaou denied <unk> 's claims : " All this speculation surrounding my role in the third round of voting for the 2012 candidates is totally unfounded . I state that I did not vote in the third round as I had announced at the time of the vote . " This statement was confirmed by the IOC voting numbers , which demonstrate that , even if Nikolaou had voted for Madrid , the city would have failed to beat Paris in the third voting round .

 Then @-@ French President Jacques Chirac became the subject of controversy the day before the International Olympic Committee was due to pick a host city . Chirac made comments stating that " the only worse food than British food is Finnish " and " the only thing the British have done for Europe 's agriculture is mad cow disease " . Not only were Chirac 's comments considered unsportsmanlike where the normal etiquette is not to criticize rival cities , there were two IOC members from Finland who would vote in the final ballot . While Paris was widely acknowledged as the front runner , the narrow loss to London led many to believe that Chirac 's comments were at fault . 
 = = Potential applicant cities = = 
 Besides the initial nine applicant cities , other cities also wished to bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics , but the bids were not internally selected by the NOC ( in case of more than one bidding city from the same country ) , were not put forward to the IOC , or were withdrawn before filing the necessary paperwork . 
 The Nigerian capital , Abuja , planned to present a bid to become the first African city to stage the Olympic Games , but ended up not filling its application . In Asia , three cities were interested in holding the Games , but did not officially submit a bid : Hyderabad , New Delhi , and Tel Aviv . In South America , the Brazilian Olympic Committee chose Rio de Janeiro over São Paulo , and if Rio de Janeiro had been selected by the IOC , it would have been the first Olympiad staged in South America ( four years on , Rio de Janeiro did land the 2016 Games ) . In Canada , Toronto initially planned to gain hosting rights for 2012 after losing the 2008 Olympics bidding process , but because Vancouver landed the 2010 Winter Olympics , the Canadian city cancelled these plans . In the United States , the city of New York was picked by the United States Olympic Committee ( USOC ) over San Francisco , although several other cities submitted <unk> to become the American candidate for the 2012 Olympics ; these included Houston , Washington D.C. ( in cooperation with nearby Baltimore ) , Cincinnati , Dallas , Pittsburgh , Los Angeles , Seattle and Tampa ( in cooperation with nearby Orlando ) . Several European cities wanted to follow the likes of London , Madrid , Moscow and Paris , and were thus hopeful to gain their NOC 's support . Germany chose Leipzig over Düsseldorf , Frankfurt , Hamburg , and Stuttgart , while in Spain , Seville lost out to Madrid . Other referenced cities were Budapest , Milan , Rome , Stockholm , Gothenburg , Malmö , Oslo and Copenhagen .

 2012 Host City Election — announcement ( WMV file ) 
 = Causing a Commotion = 
 " Causing a Commotion " is a song by American singer Madonna from the soundtrack album to the 1987 film Who 's That Girl . It was released as the album 's second single on August 25 , 1987 by Sire Records . Its Silver Screen Single Mix later appeared on the 1991 UK compilation EP The Holiday Collection . Written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray , the song was inspired by Madonna 's relationship with then husband Sean Penn , and his abusive and violent nature . Containing a dance @-@ oriented , up @-@ tempo groove , the song begins with the chorus and is accompanied by a four @-@ note descending bassline and staccato chords in the verse . 
 Since its release , the song has received mixed reviews by critics . It became a top @-@ ten hit in the United States , Australia , Canada , Ireland , Italy , New Zealand , Sweden and the United Kingdom , and topped the Billboard U.S. dance chart . Madonna performed the song on the Who 's That Girl World Tour – which was transmitted via satellite to the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards – and the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990 . The performances were included in the home video release of the tours .

 In 1986 , Madonna was shooting for her third motion picture Who 's That Girl , known at the time as Slammer . Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie , she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray , with whom she had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986 . The song was written and produced by Madonna and Bray for the film 's soundtrack . It was inspired by her then husband Sean Penn and their often tumultuous relationship . Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn was on the verge of breaking up , due to Penn 's abusive and violent nature . That translated as the inspiration behind the song . In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10 , 1987 , Madonna spoke about Penn 's impact on her life , 
 " I don 't like violence . I never condone hitting anyone , and I never thought that any violence should have taken place . But on the other hand , I understood Sean 's anger and believe me , I have wanted to hit them [ the paparazzi ] many times . I never would , you know , because I realize that it would just make things worse . " 
 In the United States , " Causing a Commotion " was released in August 1987 . In the United Kingdom , the song was released just before the commencement of Madonna 's 1987 Who 's That Girl World Tour in October . In 1991 , the Silver Screen Single Mix of the song was included on Madonna 's The Holiday Collection EP . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 " Causing a Commotion " was recorded and mixed by Bray along with Shep Pettibone who also did additional production on the track . Junior Vasquez was the mixing engineer along with Steve Peck ; the former also did the audio editing . Background vocals were provided by Donna De Lory and Niki Haris . " Causing a Commotion " has a dancey , up @-@ tempo groove in it . The musical arrangement consists of a number of hooks interpolating with each other . It begins with the chorus , where Madonna sings the line " I 've got the moves baby , You 've got the motion , If we got together we be causing a commotion . " The verses are accompanied by a four @-@ note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords . 
 The lyrics make reference to Madonna 's 1985 single " Into the Groove " and have three parts to the vocal harmony . Andrzej <unk> , one of the editors of the book Exploring Space noted that the proverbial status of the phrase " opposites attract " as a defining key ingredient of cultural concept of " love " and this was evident also in the song with the lyrics : " You met your match when you met me , I know that you 'll disagree its crazy , But opposites attract you 'll see , And I won 't let you get away so easy " .

 The song received generally mixed reviews . Rikky Rooksby , author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , said that the song was " Perfectly acceptable , though not in the same class as ' Who 's That Girl ' . " Christian Wright from Spin called the song celebratory . Camille Paglia , one of the authors of The Madonna Companion : Two Decades of Commentary , said that Madonna 's command of massive , resonant basslines impressed them . " I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing , descending chords of Madonna 's ' Causing a Commotion ' , which opened her dreadful movie Who 's That Girl . If you want to hear the essence of modernity , listen to those chords , infernal , apocalyptic , and grossly sensual . This is the authentic voice of fin de siècle . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that " Causing a Commotion " , along with " Who 's That Girl " were not among Madonna 's best singles .

It remained in the runner @-@ up position for three weeks , before descending from the chart . " Causing a Commotion " reached the top 40 of the Adult Contemporary chart of Billboard and reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Play chart . In Canada , the song debuted at number 90 , on the RPM singles chart on September 19 , 1987 . After six weeks , the song reached a peak of number two on the chart .

 Madonna performed " Causing a Commotion " on the Who 's That Girl World Tour of 1987 and the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990 . In the Who 's That Girl World Tour , " Causing a Commotion " was the sixth song of the setlist . Collaborating with Marlene Stewart on the clothes for the tour , Madonna expanded on the idea of bringing her video characters to life and to display a gangster theme for the song . She wore a golden lamé jacket and performed the song while accompanied by two dancers , each holding a gun . Performances of the song on this tour can be found on the Who 's That Girl : Live in Japan video , filmed in Tokyo , Japan , on June 22 , 1987 , and on the Ciao Italia : Live from Italy video , filmed in Turin , Italy , on September 4 , 1987 . The latter performance was transmitted via satellite on the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards . 
 On the Blond Ambition World Tour , the song was performed as the third song of the set list . The outfit she wore for the performance was described by Carol Clerk , author of Madonnastyle , as the " perfect visual combination of masculine and feminine " . It consisted of a double @-@ breasted suit with a tight jacket , which was cut in slits , allowing her conical bra to point through . She also wore her characteristic monocle chain . Madonna wore heavy makeup with thick , blackened eyebrows and heavy application of dark liner . As she finished the performance of " Open Your Heart " , Madonna opened the jacket and started to simulate sexual intercourse with one of her dancers while playing the dominant role . It was followed by an exhibitionist dance routine with a chair as a prop and Madonna singing the song . The performance ended with Madonna wrestling with her female backup singers . Two different performances were released on video : the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90 , taped in Yokohama , Japan , on April 27 , 1990 , and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live , taped in Nice , France , on August 5 , 1990 .

 = Phillip Wilcher = 
 Phillip Leslie Wilcher ( born 16 March 1958 ) is an Australian pianist and classical music composer and was a founding member of the children 's music group , The Wiggles . When Wilcher published his first work , " Daybreak " , at the age of 14 , he was one of the youngest classical composers in Australia . Early in 1991 Wilcher joined The Wiggles after he met co @-@ founder Anthony Field , who requested Wicher 's assistance in recording the group 's self @-@ titled debut album . Wilcher was a major contributor for the music of the album , but he left the group shortly after its release to focus on his classical music career . 
 Wilcher has published over 100 piano @-@ related works and has performed both solo and with ensembles . Rita Crews for The Studio Quarterly Magazine described his style as " free @-@ flowing , with an underlying romantic character , one in which melodic line and lyricism are all @-@ important elements " . His music has been broadcast by radio stations ABC @-@ FM and 2MBS @-@ FM – the latter has aired two documentaries , Wilcher and the French Connection and Wilcher 's World . 
 = = Family and personal life = = 
 Phillip Leslie Wilcher was born on 16 March 1958 to Naomi Joy Thompson ( 8 April 1929 – 21 June 2005 ) and Leslie James Wilcher ( born 16 January 1923 ) , a World War II veteran . Wilcher grew up in Camperdown . As of 2004 , he resided in Concord and owns no cell phone , watch , computer , or car : " My entire life since I was a boy was writing music and that has overshadowed everything . I would be happy living in an oversized cardboard box with a piano and a blank sheet of manuscript paper " . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Wilcher started piano lessons at the age of eight ; his first teachers were Gladys Woodward and Jean <unk> . His interest in composing music began at an early age , before his teens . At the age of 14 , Wilcher published his first piano composition , " Daybreak " , with the Sydney @-@ based music company , J. Albert & Son , making him the then @-@ youngest published composer in Australia . The track was later recorded by Leslie Ritter and Scott <unk> ( The Fugs ) on their album , Circles in Sand ( 2001 ) , and re @-@ recorded in 2006 by John Martin on his CD , Ancient Rivers . 
 For seven years , after he published " Daybreak " , Wilcher was a student of composer and musicologist , Franz Holford , who was an editor at J. Albert & Son ; he later composed music with Holford for over twenty years . Wilcher 's piano piece , " Autumn Rain " , was published when he was 17 , by J. Albert & Son . He also studied with classical musicians Neta Maughan and Elpis <unk> , and began a thirty @-@ year association with composer Miriam Hyde . In 1976 Wilcher became an assistant editor for J. Albert & Son 's Classical / Educational Division . During the 1980s he worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) . 
 = = = The Wiggles and children 's music career = = = 
 Early in 1991 , while working in the Macquarie University early childhood music program , Wilcher met Anthony Field , former member of the Australian rock group The Cockroaches , who was studying child development . According to Wilcher , Field asked him to join his newly formed children 's music group , The Wiggles , and to help them record their self @-@ titled debut album . 
 Wilcher claims that he " contributed the most musically to the debut album " , composing 75 % of the music . The album included another piece he had composed at 14 , " Summer Dance " , which appeared on the album as " Archie 's Theme " . Wilcher was nicknamed Archie due to his admiration of American pianist Liberace . He performed in two of the group 's videos , " Get Ready to Wiggle " and " Dorothy the Dinosaur " . 
 In 1992 , Wilcher left The Wiggles . Their spokesperson , Dianna O 'Neill , claims that he submitted a letter of resignation because he wanted to continue composing classical music . According to fellow founding member Greg Page , " Archie had considerable input into the arrangement of some songs on that first CD ... he is quite a musical genius ... However ... the musical direction of The Wiggles was changing " . Australian Record Industry Association ( ARIA ) awarded the band members , including Wilcher , with gold and platinum certificates for the album . 
 In 1993 , Wilcher published a lesson plan for early childhood activities , A Musical Offering . By the late 1990s , for reasons not entirely clear , The Wiggles had not only rerecorded their first album , but also renamed it " Wiggle Time " and removed all of his compositions . Wilcher has been called " the fifth Wiggle " in the press for his part in the early history of the group . In 2005 , when The Wiggles had become Australia 's most successful children 's act , he seemed to criticise The Wiggles in the press , but he has since recanted , stating that reporters had misrepresented him and that he chose to remain silent in the aftermath of their articles .

 Phillip Wilcher 's career was described by The Sydney Morning Herald 's Steve Dow as " an eclectic mix of classical and <unk> @-@ <unk> " . He has published over 100 piano @-@ related works . Wilcher has composed music for pianist Aaron McMillan , and for musician and former ABC broadcaster , news reader and journalist , Clive Robertson . He has also set poetry by American librettist Jack Larson to music . In 2007 , he composed " 1791 " , a work honouring Mozart on the anniversary of his death , which was performed by oboist Rachel Tolmie , and the Bourbaki String Ensemble conducted by David Angell . It appeared on a compilation album , Into His Countenance ( 2008 ) , which featured various artists performing Wilcher 's compositions . 
 His works have been included on several other CDs released by Jade Music and <unk> . Pianist <unk> Carrigan has recorded six CDs of his compositions , two for Publications by <unk> . Rita Crews , in a review of Carrigan 's album Shimmer ( 2004 ) for The Studio Quarterly Magazine , described Wilcher 's style as " free @-@ flowing , with an underlying romantic character , one in which melodic line and lyricism are all @-@ important elements " . 2MBS @-@ FM 's Mike Smith found it was of " a more openly romantic nature than in his earlier " work and he was " reminded of Rachmaninov , <unk> and even Brahms " . 
 As well as composing , Wilcher has performed both solo and with ensembles . This has included playing three times for the Liberace Foundation in Las Vegas . His music has been broadcast by radio stations , ABC @-@ FM and 2MBS @-@ FM – the latter has aired two documentaries on his music , Wilcher and the French Connection and Wilcher 's World . He has had an active public speaking career , and is an elected life member of Australasian Performing Right Association ( APRA ) and a board member of the Australian Music Teacher Magazine , for which he has written articles on Chopin , Brahms , Ravel , and music education . 
 In 2014 , Wilcher released Heaven @-@ Haven . The music was performed by The Linden String Quartet . During production of the CD , Wilcher saw press reports about the fatal attack of 18 @-@ year @-@ old Sydney resident Thomas Kelly ; Wilcher was unable to separate the sorrow he felt for Kelly and his family from the sentiment he was trying to convey through his music . He eventually dedicated the project to Kelly and announced that proceeds from the album would benefit the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation .

 = John Sherman Cooper = 
 John Sherman Cooper ( August 23 , 1901 – February 21 , 1991 ) was a politician , jurist , and diplomat from the U.S. state of Kentucky . He served three non @-@ consecutive , partial terms in the United States Senate before being elected to two full terms in 1960 and 1966 . He also served as U.S. Ambassador to India from 1955 to 1956 and U.S. Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 . He was the first Republican to be popularly elected to more than one term as a senator from Kentucky and , in both 1960 and 1966 , he set records for the largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate from either party . 
 Cooper 's first political service was as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1927 to 1929 . In 1930 , he was elected county judge of Pulaski County . After a failed gubernatorial bid in 1939 , he joined the U.S. Army in 1942 . During World War II , he earned the Bronze Star Medal for reorganizing the Bavarian judicial system after the allied victory in Europe . While still in Germany , he was elected circuit judge for Kentucky 's 28th district . He returned home to accept the judgeship , which he held for less than a year before resigning to seek election to A. B. " Happy " Chandler 's vacated seat in the U.S. Senate . He won the seat by 41 @,@ 823 votes , the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time . 
 During his first term in the Senate , Cooper voted with the majority of his party just 51 % of the time . He was defeated in his re @-@ election bid in 1948 , after which he accepted an appointment by President Harry S. Truman as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and served as a special assistant to Secretary of State Dean Acheson during the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) . Cooper was again elected to a partial term in the Senate in 1952 . The popular Cooper appeared likely to be re @-@ elected in 1954 until the Democrats nominated former Vice @-@ President Alben W. Barkley . Cooper lost the general election and was appointed Ambassador to India by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955 . Cooper gained the confidence of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and dramatically improved relations between the U.S. and the recently independent state of India , helping rebuff Soviet hopes of expanding communism in Asia . Barkley died in 1956 , and Eisenhower requested that Cooper seek Barkley 's open seat . Cooper reluctantly acquiesced and was elected to serve the rest of Barkley 's term . 
 In 1960 , Cooper was re @-@ elected , securing his first full , six @-@ year term in the Senate . Newly elected President John F. Kennedy – Cooper 's former Senate colleague – chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact @-@ finding mission to Moscow and New Delhi . Following Kennedy 's assassination in November 1963 , President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination . Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson 's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War , consistently advocating negotiation with the North Vietnamese instead . After Cooper 's re @-@ election in 1966 , he worked with Idaho Democrat Frank Church on a series of amendments designed to de @-@ fund further U.S. military operations in the region . These amendments were hailed as the first serious attempt by Congress to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war . Aging and increasingly deaf , Cooper did not seek re @-@ election in 1972 . His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981 . He died in a Washington , D.C. , retirement home on February 21 , 1991 , and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Sherman Cooper was born August 23 , 1901 , in Somerset , Kentucky . He was the second child and first son of seven children born to John Sherman and Helen Gertrude ( Tartar ) Cooper . The Cooper family had been prominent in the Somerset area since brothers Malachi and Edward Cooper migrated from South Carolina along the Wilderness Trail and through the Cumberland Gap around 1790 , shortly after Daniel Boone . His father 's parents – staunch Baptists – were active in the anti @-@ slavery movement in the nineteenth century , and the elder John Sherman Cooper ( called " Sherman " ) was named after the Apostle John and William Tecumseh Sherman , a hero of the Union in the Civil War . The family was very active in local politics ; six of Cooper 's ancestors , including his father , were elected county judges in Pulaski County , and two had been circuit judges . Sherman Cooper engaged in numerous successful business ventures and was known as the wealthiest man in Somerset . At the time of John Sherman Cooper 's birth , his father was serving as collector of internal revenue in Kentucky 's 8th congressional district , a position to which he had been appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt . 
 During his youth , Cooper worked delivering newspapers , in railroad yards , and in his father 's coal mines in Harlan County . Despite having formerly served as county school superintendent , Cooper 's father had a low opinion of the public schools , and until he was in the fifth grade , Cooper was privately tutored by a neighbor . While his father was away on business in Texas , his mother sent him to sixth grade at the public school , which he attended thereafter . At Somerset High School , he played both basketball and football . After the outbreak of World War I , Cooper joined an informal military training unit at the high school . Two of the school 's instructors organized the boys into two companies , but Cooper , who was given the rank of captain , later recalled that " they taught us how to march and that 's about all . " During his senior year , Cooper served as class president and class poet . In 1918 , he graduated second in his high school class and was chosen to give the commencement speech . 
 After graduation , Cooper matriculated at Centre College in Danville , Kentucky . While at Centre , Cooper was accepted into the Beta Theta Pi fraternity . He also played defensive end on the Praying Colonels ' football team . Cooper was a letterman on the team , playing alongside football notables Bo McMillan , Red Roberts , Matty Bell , and Red Weaver . Another member of the team , John Y. Brown , Sr. , would later become one of Cooper 's political rivals . Coached by Charley Moran , the team was undefeated in four games in the 1918 season , which was shortened by an outbreak of the Spanish flu . 
 Although Centre was known as one of Kentucky 's foremost colleges , Cooper 's father wanted him to broaden his education and , after one year at Centre , Cooper transferred to Yale College in New Haven , Connecticut . At Yale , he was a classmate of his future U.S. Senate colleague , Stuart Symington . Cooper was active in many extracurricular activities at Yale , including the Sophomore German Committee , the Junior Promenade Committee , the Student Council , the Class Day Committee , the Southern Club , the University Club , and Beta Theta Pi . A member of the Undergraduate Athletic Association , he played football and basketball , becoming the first person in Yale history to be named captain of the basketball team in his junior and senior years . In his senior year , he was accepted into the elite Skull and Bones society but regretted not being accepted into Phi Beta Kappa . Upon graduation , he was voted most popular and most likely to succeed in his class . 
 Cooper earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale in 1923 and enrolled at Harvard Law School later that year . During the summer break of 1924 , he returned to Kentucky , where his father , dying of Bright 's disease , told him that he would soon become the head of the family , and that most of the family 's resources had been lost in the economic recession of the early 1920s . Cooper returned to Harvard after his father 's death , but soon discovered that he could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family 's affairs . He was admitted to the bar by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset . Over the next 20 years , he sold his father 's remaining assets , paid off the family debts , and financed a college education for his six siblings . 
 = = Early political career = = 
 After being urged into politics by his uncle , Judge Roscoe Tartar , Cooper ran unopposed for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927 . As a member of the House , he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson 's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health ; the measure failed by a single vote . Cooper supported the governor 's plan to provide free textbooks for the state 's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes , although the latter bill did not pass . 
 In 1929 , Cooper declared his candidacy for county judge of Pulaski County . His opponent , the incumbent , was the president of Somerset Bank and the former law partner of Cooper 's father . Cooper won the election , however , beginning the first of his eight years as county judge . During his service , he was required by law to enforce eviction notices , but often helped those he evicted find other housing or gave them money himself , earning him the nickname " the poor man 's judge " . He reportedly became so depressed by the poverty and suffering of his constituents during the Great Depression that he had a nervous breakdown and took a leave of absence to seek psychiatric treatment . 
 Cooper served on the board of trustees for the University of Kentucky from 1935 to 1946 . In 1939 , he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination . As a result of a mandatory primary election law passed in 1935 , the Republican nominee would not be chosen by a nominating convention , as was typical for the party . Cooper garnered only 36 % of the vote in the primary , losing the nomination to King Swope , a Lexington circuit court judge and former congressman . 
 = = Service in World War II = = 
 Although well above the draft age at 41 years old , Cooper enlisted for service in the United States Army in World War II in 1942 . Immediately offered an officer 's commission , he chose instead to enlist as a private . After basic training , he enrolled in Officer Candidate School at the Fort Custer Training Center in Michigan . He studied military government and graduated second in his class of 111 students . In 1943 , he was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the XV Corps of General George Patton 's Third Army as a courier in the military police . Cooper served in France , Luxembourg , and Germany . After liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp , Patton ordered the entire population of the nearby city of Weimar to go through it and observe the conditions ; Cooper also viewed the camp at that time . 
 Following the cessation of hostilities , Cooper served as a legal advisor for the 300 @,@ 000 displaced persons in his unit 's occupation zone seeking repatriation after being brought to Germany as slaves by the Nazis . Under the terms of the agreement reached at the Yalta Conference , all displaced Russian nationals were to be returned to the Soviet Union , but Soviet negotiators decided that the agreement did not apply to non @-@ Russian spouses and children of the nationals . Cooper brought this to the attention of General Patton , who rescinded the repatriation order in the Third Army 's occupation zone . Cooper received a citation from the Third Army 's military government section for his action . Cooper also oversaw the reorganization of the 239 courts in the German state of Bavaria in an attempt to replace all the Nazi officials , for which he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal . Among the judges installed by Cooper were Wilhelm <unk> , future Minister @-@ President of Bavaria , and Ludwig Erhard , the future Chancellor of Germany . 
 In 1943 or 1944 , while he was still in the Army , Cooper married a nurse named Evelyn Pfaff . Cooper was elected without opposition as circuit judge of Kentucky 's twenty @-@ eighth judicial district in 1945 , despite still being in Germany and not campaigning for the office . He was discharged from the Army with the rank of captain in February 1946 and returned to Kentucky to assume the judgeship . 
 = = First term in the Senate and early diplomatic career = = 
 Cooper 's judicial district included his native Pulaski County , as well as <unk> , Wayne and Clinton counties . During his tenure , blacks were allowed to serve on trial juries in the district for the first time . Of the first 16 opinions he issued during his time on the bench , 15 were upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals , Kentucky 's court of last resort at the time . 
 Cooper resigned his judgeship in November 1946 to seek the U.S. Senate seat vacated when A. B. " Happy " Chandler resigned to accept the position of Commissioner of Baseball . Cooper 's opponent , former Congressman and Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives John Y. Brown , Sr. , was better known and widely believed to be the favorite in the race . However , Brown had alienated Chandler 's supporters in the Democratic Party during a hotly contested senatorial primary between Brown and Chandler in 1942 , and this group worked against his election in 1946 . Further , the Louisville Courier @-@ Journal opposed Brown because of his attacks on former Senator J. C. W. Beckham and Judge Robert Worth Bingham , who were heads of a powerful political machine in Louisville . With these two factors working against Brown , Cooper won the election to fill Chandler 's unexpired term by 41 @,@ 823 votes , the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time . His victory marked only the third time in Kentucky 's history that a Republican had been popularly elected to the Senate . The move to Washington , D.C. proved to be too much for Cooper 's already strained marriage . In 1947 , he filed for divorce , charging abandonment . 
 Cooper described himself as " a truly terrible public speaker " and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor . He was known as an independent Republican during his career in the Senate . In the first roll @-@ call vote of his career , he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster 's special War Investigating Committee . His second vote , directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts , also went against the majority of the Republican caucus , prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him " Are you a Republican or a Democrat ? When are you going to start voting with us ? " Cooper responded , " If you 'll pardon me , I was sent here to represent my constituents , and I intend to vote as I think best . " 
 A few days after being sworn in , Cooper co @-@ sponsored his first piece of legislation , a bill to provide federal aid for education . The bill passed the Senate , but not the House . Cooper was made chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads , and helped draft a bill authorizing $ 900 million in federal funds to states for highway construction . In 1948 , he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity . He insisted on an amendment to the War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets . He also co @-@ sponsored legislation allowing hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally . He opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining for organized labor and on the establishment of closed shops . He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control , but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers . 
 Cooper continued his independence from his party throughout his term , vocally opposing Republican plans to cut taxes despite record national budget deficits and resisting the party 's efforts to reduce funding for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe in the aftermath of the war . He worked with fellow Kentuckian Alben Barkley and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse to undermine Jim Crow laws enacted by the states and remove obstacles to suffrage for minorities . He also co @-@ sponsored a bill to create the Medicare system , although it was defeated at the time . Although he had voted with the Republicans just 51 % of the time during his partial term – the lowest average of any member of the party – Cooper headed the Kentucky delegation to the 1948 Republican National Convention . He supported Arthur Vandenberg for president , but Thomas E. Dewey ultimately received the party 's nomination . Cooper himself was mentioned as a possible candidate for vice @-@ president , but ultimately did not receive the nomination and sought re @-@ election to his Senate seat instead . Also in 1948 , Centre College awarded Cooper an honorary Doctor of Laws degree . 
 Cooper was opposed in his re @-@ election bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman , an ally of Earle C. Clements , who had been elected governor in 1947 . As one of only a few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft – Hartley Act , Chapman had lost the support of organized labor , a key constituency for the Democrats . The Democratic @-@ leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper , but the presence of Kentucky 's favorite son , Alben Barkley , on the ballot as Harry S. Truman 's running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state . Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign , and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket , he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24 @,@ 480 votes . 
 Following his defeat , Cooper resumed the practice of law in the Washington , D.C. firm of Gardner , Morison and Rogers . In 1949 , President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations ( U.N. ) General Assembly . He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951 . Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950 . Political historian Glenn Finch observed that , while Cooper was well @-@ qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO , his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley 's elevation to the vice @-@ presidency . Speculation was raised that Clements , who won Barkley 's old seat in a special election in 1950 , may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments . 
 = = Second term in Senate = = 
 Cooper 's supporters believed he would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s ; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president . Cooper considered running for governor in 1951 , but when Chapman was killed in an automobile accident on March 8 , 1951 , he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood , Governor Lawrence Wetherby 's appointee to fill the vacancy . Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race . Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman . Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier @-@ Journal recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954 . They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate , giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the Korean War . Nevertheless , Cooper defeated Underwood by 29 @,@ 000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman 's term . His victory marked the first time in Kentucky 's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once . 
 Cooper was named to the Senate Committee on Labor , Education and Public Welfare and chaired its education and labor subcommittees . He sponsored a bill authorizing public works projects along the Big Sandy River , including the Tug and <unk> forks . He also supported the reconstruction of the locks and dams along the Ohio River and the construction of locks , dams , and reservoirs in the Green River Valley . He opposed the Dixon @-@ Yates contract , which would have paid a private company to construct a new power station to generate power for the city of Memphis , Tennessee , calling instead for authorization for the Tennessee Valley Authority to issue bonds to finance the construction of new power stations . He supported a comprehensive program benefiting the coal industry and cosponsored a bill to extending public library services to rural areas . 
 Cooper continued to be an independent voice in the Senate . During the Red Scare , he was critical of attempts to permit illegal wiretap evidence in federal courts and attempts to reduce the protections against self @-@ incrimination granted by the Fifth Amendment . Nevertheless , he refused to strip Joseph McCarthy , the leading figure in the Red Scare , of his major Senate committee chairmanships , cautioning that " many of those who bitterly oppose Senator McCarthy call for the same tactics that they charge him with . " He was the only Republican to oppose the Bricker Amendment , which would have limited the president 's treaty @-@ making power . He concluded that the issues addressed by the amendment were not sufficient to warrant a change to the Constitution . He also opposed the Submerged Lands Act and the Mexican Farm Labor bill , both of which were supported by the Eisenhower administration . He denounced Eisenhower 's appointment of Albert M. Cole , an open opponent of public housing , as Federal Housing Administrator and opposed many of the agricultural reforms proposed by Eisenhower 's Agriculture Secretary , Ezra Taft Benson . Again , his independence did little to diminish his stature in the party . In 1954 , he was named to the Senate Republican Policy Committee . 
 Cooper again sought re @-@ election in 1954 . Democrats first considered Governor Wetherby as his opponent , but Wetherby 's candidacy would have drawn a primary challenger from the Happy Chandler faction of the Democratic Party , possibly leading to a party split and Cooper 's re @-@ election . Instead , party leaders convinced former Vice President Barkley , now 77 years old , to run for the seat in order to ensure party unity . There were few policy differences between Barkley and Cooper , who had been deemed the most liberal Republican in the Senate by Americans for Democratic Action . During the campaign , Cooper was featured on the cover of Time on July 5 , 1954 . Cooper appealed to women voters , who were concerned about the First Indochina War and to black voters , for his stands in favor of civil rights . He also claimed that he would be a less partisan senator than Barkley . Barkley 's personal popularity carried him to a 71 @,@ 000 @-@ vote victory , however . Glenn Finch opined that " Barkley was unbeatable in his own state , and it is probable that no other candidate could have defeated Cooper . " 
 = = Ambassador to India = = 
 In 1955 , President Dwight Eisenhower nominated Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal . During his time as a delegate for the United Nations , Cooper had met Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and established a cordial working relationship with the Indian delegation , including Nehru 's sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit . The Indians had been impressed with Cooper and the Indian government had expressed their desire that Cooper serve as their ambassador from the U.S. Cooper initially rejected the offer of the Indian ambassadorship from Secretary of State John Foster Dulles but was convinced to accept it by a personal request from President Eisenhower . The Senate confirmed Cooper 's nomination on February 4 , 1955 . 
 India had only become an independent nation in 1948 , and it was considered a potential bulwark against Communism in Asia . U.S. – India relations were strained , however , because of India 's recognition of Communist China , its opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ( SEATO ) , and its resistance to foreign interference in Indochina . U.S. News and World Report described the ambassadorship as " one of the most difficult and delicate in all the diplomatic world " . 
 Cooper married Lorraine Rowan Shevlin on March 17 , 1955 , in Pasadena , California , just ten days before leaving for India . Twice divorced , Shevlin was the daughter of a wealthy California real estate developer , step @-@ daughter of Vatican official Prince Domenico Orsini , and a well @-@ known socialite . She was fluent in three languages and understood Russian . The two had dated for much of the 1950s , but Cooper was hesitant to marry because he had doubts about moving into Shevlin 's elaborate Georgetown home . ( While in Washington , the unmarried Cooper permanently resided in the Dodge House Hotel . ) The move to India removed this barrier , and Secretary of State Dulles encouraged Cooper to marry her before leaving so that the U.S. embassy in New Delhi might have a proper hostess . On April 4 , 1955 , the couple stopped in England on their way to India to visit with Louis Mountbatten , the last Governor @-@ General of India prior to India 's achieving its independence . Their discussions about the situation of the Indian people were part of the scant preparation Cooper received before arriving there . 
 Cooper began his service as ambassador by developing a close friendship with Prime Minister Nehru . Nehru 's respect and admiration for Cooper soon became widely known . Cooper labored to help officials in Washington , D.C. understand that India 's reluctance to align with either the West or the Communists in China and the Soviet Union was their way of exercising their newly won independence . At the same time , he defended the U.S. military buildup after World War II , its involvement in the Korean War , and its membership in mutual security pacts like NATO and SEATO as self @-@ defense measures , not aggressive actions by the U.S. government , as the Indians widely perceived them . Cooper condemned the Eisenhower administration 's decision to sell weapons to Pakistan , which was resented by the Indians , but also felt that the Indian government took some political positions without regard to their moral implications . By late 1955 , the Chicago Daily News reported that Indo @-@ American relations had " improved to a degree not thought possible six months ago " . 
 In a joint communiqué dated December 2 , 1955 , U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Cunha condemned statements made by Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Soviet Party Chairman Nikita <unk> during an eighteen @-@ day tour of India . Of particular interest was the communiqué 's reference to " Portuguese provinces in the Far East " . This phrase referred to Goa , a Portuguese colony in western India . Although most European nations with holdings near India had granted them to the new independent nation in 1947 , Portugal refused to surrender Goa , and the region had become a source of conflict between the two nations . The joint communiqué seemed to indicate U.S. recognition of Portuguese sovereignty in Goa , which undercut Cooper 's assurances to the Indians of U.S. neutrality in the matter . Cooper himself did not know about the communiqué until he read an account of it in the Indian media and was therefore unprepared to offer an explanation for it when asked by the Indian Foreign Secretary . Cooper 's cable to Washington , D.C. about the matter was reported to have been " bitter " , although the contents of the cable have not been released . 
 The Dulles – <unk> communiqué touched off anti @-@ American demonstrations in many parts of India . On December 6 , Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. neutrality on the Goa issue , but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region . Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest with the United States over the communiqué and to address the Indian Parliament about the matter . In the interim , Cooper secured a meeting with Nehru and forestalled both actions . Cooper became even more upset with Dulles when Dulles authorized withholding $ 10 million of a $ 50 million aid package to India ; Cooper protested the withholding , and Dulles decided to pay the full amount . 
 Throughout the early part of 1956 , Cooper strongly advocated that the U.S. respect Indian <unk> and increase economic aid to the country . In August 1956 , Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale up to that point of surplus agricultural products by the United States to any country . Cooper 's persistence in requesting such aid was critical in getting the package approved , as it was opposed by many administration officials , including Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover , Jr . , Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey , and International Cooperation Administration Director John B. Hollister . 
 = = Later service in the Senate = = 
 Senator Barkley died in office on April 30 , 1956 . Republican leaders encouraged Cooper to return from India and seek the seat , but Cooper was reluctant to give up his ambassadorship . After a personal appeal from President Eisenhower , however , Cooper acquiesced and declared his candidacy in July 1956 . Even after leaving India , he maintained close ties with the country 's leaders and was the official U.S. representative at the funerals of Prime Minister Nehru in 1964 , Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1966 , and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984 . 
 Because Barkley 's death occurred after the filing deadline for the November elections , the Democratic State Central Committee had to choose a nominee for the now @-@ open seat . After unsuccessfully attempting to find a compromise candidate that both the Clements and Chandler factions could support , they chose Lawrence Wetherby , whose term as governor had recently expired . Chandler , now serving his second term as governor , was angered by the choice of Wetherby , and most members of his faction either gave Wetherby lukewarm support or outright supported Cooper instead . This , combined with Cooper 's personal popularity , led to his victory over Wetherby by 65 @,@ 000 votes . 
 Upon his return to the Senate in 1957 , Cooper was assigned to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . In 1959 , he challenged Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen to become the Republican floor leader in the Senate , but lost by four votes . In a 1960 poll of fifty journalists conducted by Newsweek magazine , Cooper was named the ablest Republican member of the Senate . He helped author and co @-@ sponsored the National Defense Education Act . Together with Senator Jennings Randolph , he sponsored the Appalachian Regional Development Act , designed to address the prevalent poverty in Appalachia . He succeeded in gaining more state and local control over the anti @-@ poverty group Volunteers in Service to America . He was a vigorous opponent of measures designed to weaken the Tennessee Valley Authority . 
 In 1960 , Democrats nominated former governor Keen Johnson , then an executive with Reynolds Metals , to oppose Cooper 's re @-@ election bid . Cooper had the support of organized labor and benefitted from a large segment of Kentuckians who voted for Republican Richard M. Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy as a reaction against Kennedy 's Catholicism in the 1960 presidential election . Cooper ultimately defeated Johnson by 199 @,@ 257 votes , a record victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate . 
 Shortly after his election as president in 1960 , Kennedy chose Cooper to conduct a then @-@ secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess the attitudes of the Soviet government for the new administration . Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship . On the mission , Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally . Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets . After meeting with Secretary Khruschev , Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously . Cooper supported Kennedy 's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962 , but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible . 
 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission , which was charged with investigating Kennedy 's assassination in 1963 . As one of three Republicans on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee , he was involved with the investigation of Johnson aide Bobby Baker in 1964 , which he decried as " a whitewash " after the committee blocked further investigation . He proposed the establishment of a Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct in July 1964 and was named to that committee in July 1965 . Also in 1965 , he was chosen advisor to the United States delegation to the Manila Conference that established the Asian Development Bank . 
 An advocate for small businesses and agricultural interests , Cooper opposed an April 1965 bill that expanded the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate cigarette advertising . In March 1966 , he proposed an amendment to a mine safety bill supported by the United Mine Workers of America that would have nullified provisions of the bill if they were not shown to contribute to the safety of small mines , but his amendment was defeated .

 Although Cooper voted in favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , he opposed escalating U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War . As early as April 1964 , Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia . He questioned Southeast Asia 's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale . On March 25 , 1965 , he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations . Later in the day , he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam . 
 In January 1966 , Cooper accompanied Secretary of State Rusk and Ambassador W. Averell Harriman on an official visit to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos as part of a widely publicized " peace drive " . This visit , along with visits to South Vietnam in December 1965 and January 1966 , reinforced Cooper 's opposition to military operations in Southeast Asia . In a meeting with President Johnson on January 26 , 1966 , he again urged the president to forgo his announced intentions to resume bombing missions in North Vietnam and negotiate a settlement instead . Johnson was noncommittal , and that afternoon , Cooper returned to the Senate floor , urgently trying to convince the legislators that negotiation was preferable to escalation , even when it meant negotiating with the Viet Cong fighters in South Vietnam , which he believed was necessary to achieve peace . Cooper advocated a three @-@ to @-@ five @-@ year cease fire , enforced by the United Nations , followed by national elections as prescribed by the 1954 Geneva Convention . Ultimately , Johnson did not heed Cooper 's plea and resumed U.S. bombing missions in North Vietnam . 
 In 1966 , Cooper again won re @-@ election over John Y. Brown , Sr. , by 217 @,@ 000 votes , breaking his own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate , and carrying the vote of 110 of Kentucky 's 120 counties . In the lead @-@ up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary , he endorsed New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller , saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam . Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war , while other Republican candidates tried to remain non @-@ specific about how they would handle it . As Rockefeller 's candidacy faded , Cooper encouraged his colleague , Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton , to seek the presidency , but Morton declined . The nomination – and eventually , the presidency – went to Republican Richard Nixon . 
 As a delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968 , Cooper strongly denounced the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia . He also supported Montana Senator Mike Mansfield 's proposal to bring the matter of the Vietnam War before the United Nations . Returning to the Senate in 1969 , he joined Alaska Senator Ernest Gruening and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the United States Capitol . 
 In the Senate , Cooper helped lead the opposition to the development and deployment of anti @-@ ballistic missiles ( ABMs ) , putting him at odds with many in his party , including President Nixon . Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs , which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race . On August 6 , 1969 , a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50 – 51 ; Vice @-@ President Spiro Agnew cast the tie @-@ breaking vote . After this defeat , Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co @-@ sponsored the Cooper – Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs , but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system . The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget , leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets . Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks . 
 Throughout 1969 and 1970 , Cooper and Senator Frank Church co @-@ sponsored the Cooper – Church Amendments , aimed at curbing further escalation of the Vietnam War . Congressional approval of one of these amendments on December 15 , 1969 , de @-@ funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand . Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well , but Mike Mansfield , who helped Cooper write the amendment , feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk , who was officially neutral in the conflict , might be offended . When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970 , Cambodia 's new leader , Lon Nol , appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule . Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia , despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de @-@ escalation in the region . Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de @-@ fund U.S. operations in Cambodia ; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated , the amendment passed 58 – 37 . The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached , and it did not go into effect . The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as " the first time in our history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war . " The fight over the Cooper – Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper 's health , and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength . In 1971 , Church , Mansfield , and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether , but ultimately , the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned . 
 Seventy @-@ one years of age and becoming increasingly deaf , Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21 , 1972 , that he would not seek re @-@ election to his Senate seat , having served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley . The lame duck Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war , after an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again . Without advance notice , Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27 , 1972 , proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionally end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months . The measure , which had no co @-@ sponsors , stunned Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and provoked heated debate in the Senate . Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces . The revised amendment passed 62 – 33 , whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill . At Nixon 's insistence , the Senate defeated the amended bill 48 – 42 . Disappointed , Cooper nevertheless proclaimed , " I feel purged inside . I 've felt strongly about this for a long time . Now it 's in the hands of the President . He 's the only person who can do anything about ending the war now . "

 After the expiration of his term , Cooper took over the " Dean Acheson chair " at the prestigious Washington law firm of Covington & Burling . In 1972 , he was chosen as the commencement speaker at Centre College , where he had served as a trustee since 1961 . At the ceremony , he became the first recipient of the Isaac Shelby Award , named for two @-@ time Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby , the chair of the college 's first board of trustees . In 1973 , Cooper resisted an attempt to name a federal building in his honor . Upon the completion of the dam that formed Laurel River Lake in 1977 , Congress proposed naming the dam and lake after Cooper , but again , he declined . He was pleased , however , that the Somerset school system chose to name a program to teach and reinforce leadership skills the John Sherman Cooper Leadership Institute . 
 In April 1974 , Nixon announced that he would appoint Cooper to be the US Ambassador to East Germany , but during the final negotiations between the countries for the US to establish an embassy in the country , Nixon resigned . His successor , Gerald Ford , officially appointed Cooper to the ambassadorship , and Cooper took leave from Covington & Burling to accept it . He arrived in East Germany in December 1974 and served as ambassador until October 1976 . After returning to the US , he resumed his work at Covington & Burling . In his last act of public service , he again served as an alternate delegate to the UN General Assembly in 1981 . 
 Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown , Jr . , the son of Cooper 's former opponent in the senatorial elections of 1946 and 1966 , awarded Cooper the Governor 's Distinguished Service Medallion in 1983 . Later that year , Senators Walter Huddleston of Kentucky and Howard Baker of Tennessee introduced a bill to honor Cooper by renaming the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area to the Cooper National Recreation Area ; Kentucky Congressman Hal Rogers sponsored a parallel measure in the House . As a senator , Cooper had been instrumental in securing congressional approval for the creation of Big South Fork . Opponents of the measure in both Kentucky and Tennessee ( the recreation area spans the two states ) cited a variety of reasons to retain the old name , and the proposal was eventually dropped at Cooper 's request . 
 In 1985 , Cooper became the third @-@ ever recipient of the Oxford Cup , an award recognizing outstanding past members of Beta Theta Pi . Also in 1985 , he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Cumberland College ( now the University of the Cumberlands ) in Williamsburg , Kentucky . He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Centre College in 1987 . A non @-@ partisan group co @-@ chaired by former Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Larry Forgy raised $ 60 @,@ 000 to commission two sculptures of Cooper . A life @-@ sized bronze bust of Cooper sculpted by John Tuska was installed at the Kentucky State Capitol in 1987 . The other sculpture , a life @-@ sized bronze statue crafted by Barney Bright , was placed in Fountain Square in Somerset . 
 Cooper retired from the practice of law in 1989 . In June 1990 , Cooper was honored with a gala screening of Gentleman From Kentucky , a Kentucky Educational Television documentary about his life , at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington . On February 21 , 1991 , Cooper died of heart failure in a retirement home in Washington . He had been preceded in death by his second wife , Lorraine , on February 3 , 1985 . On February 26 , 1991 , Kentucky 's two senators , Wendell H. Ford and Mitch McConnell , gave speeches on the Senate floor praising Cooper , and the Senate adjourned in Cooper 's memory . Cooper was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington , Virginia . 
 Because of his extensive support of rural electrification as a senator , the East Kentucky <unk> was renamed the John Sherman Cooper Power Station in his honor . In 1999 , the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader named Cooper one of the most influential Kentuckians of the 20th century . In 2000 , Eastern Kentucky University 's Center for Kentucky History and Politics established the annual John Sherman Cooper Award for Outstanding Public Service in Kentucky . 
 Despite his patrician background , Cooper was known for being " affable , frequently self @-@ deprecating and approachable . " 
 = Anne Hutchinson = 
 Anne Hutchinson , born Anne Marbury ( 1591 – 1643 ) , was a Puritan spiritual adviser , mother of 15 , and an important participant in the Antinomian Controversy that shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638 . Her strong religious convictions were at odds with the established Puritan clergy in the Boston area , and her popularity and charisma helped create a theological schism that threatened to destroy the Puritans ' religious community in New England . She was eventually tried and convicted , then banished from the colony with many of her supporters . 
 Anne was born in Alford , Lincolnshire , England , the daughter of Francis Marbury , an Anglican cleric and school teacher , who gave her a far better education than most other girls received . She lived in London as a young adult , and there married an old friend from home , William Hutchinson . The couple moved back to Alford , where they began following the dynamic preacher John Cotton in the nearby major port of Boston , Lincolnshire . Cotton was compelled to emigrate in 1633 , and the Hutchinsons followed a year later with their 11 children , and soon became well established in the growing settlement of Boston in New England . Anne was a midwife , and very helpful to those needing her assistance , as well as forthcoming with her personal religious understandings . Soon she was hosting women at her house weekly , providing commentary on recent sermons . These meetings became so popular that she began offering meetings for men as well , including the young governor of the colony Henry Vane . 
 As a follower of Cotton , she espoused a " covenant of grace , " while accusing all of the local ministers ( except for Cotton and her husband 's brother @-@ in @-@ law John Wheelwright ) of preaching a " covenant of works . " Many ministers began to complain about the opinions coming from Hutchinson and her allies , and the situation erupted into what is commonly called the Antinomian Controversy , resulting in her 1637 trial , conviction , and banishment from the colony . This was followed by a March 1638 church trial in which she was excommunicated . Hutchinson and many of her supporters established the settlement of Portsmouth with encouragement from Providence founder Roger Williams , in what became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations . After her husband 's death a few years later , threats of Massachusetts taking over Rhode Island compelled Hutchinson to move totally outside the reach of Boston into the lands of the Dutch . Five of her older surviving children remained in New England or in England , while she settled with her younger children near an ancient landmark called Split Rock in what later became The Bronx in New York City . Tensions were high at the time with the native Siwanoy . In August 1643 , Hutchinson , six of her children , and other household members were massacred by <unk> during Kieft 's War . The only survivor was her nine @-@ year @-@ old daughter Susanna , who was taken captive . 
 Hutchinson is a key figure in the development of religious freedom in England 's American colonies and the history of women in ministry . She challenged the authority of the ministers , exposing the subordination of women in the culture of colonial Massachusetts . She is honoured by Massachusetts with a State House monument calling her a " courageous exponent of civil liberty and religious toleration . " She has been called the most famous , or infamous , English woman in colonial American history .

 Anne Hutchinson was born Anne Marbury in Alford , Lincolnshire , England , and baptised there on 20 July 1591 , the daughter of Francis Marbury and Bridget Dryden . Her father was an Anglican cleric in London , with strong Puritan leanings , who felt strongly that clergy should be well educated and clashed with his superiors on this issue . Marbury 's repeated challenges to the Anglican authorities led to his censure and imprisonment several years before Anne was born ; in 1578 he was given a public trial , of which , during a period of house arrest , he made a transcript from memory . He later used this transcript to educate and amuse his children , he being the hero , and the Bishop of London being portrayed as a buffoon . For his conviction of heresy , Marbury spent two years in Marshalsea Prison , on the south side of the River Thames , across from London . In 1580 , at the age of 25 , he was released and was considered sufficiently reformed to preach and teach . He moved to the remote market town of Alford in Lincolnshire , about 140 miles ( 230 km ) north of London . 
 Anne 's father was soon appointed curate ( deputy vicar ) of Saint Wilfrid 's , the local church in Alford , and in 1585 he also became the schoolmaster at the Alford Free Grammar School , one of many such public schools , free to the poor , begun by Queen Elizabeth . About this time Marbury married his first wife , Elizabeth Moore , who bore three children , then died . Within a year of his first wife 's death , Marbury married Bridget Dryden , about ten years younger than he , from a prominent Northampton family . Dryden 's brother , Erasmus , was the grandfather of the famous playwright and Poet Laureate , John Dryden . Anne was the third of 15 children born to this marriage , 12 of whom survived early childhood . The Marburys lived in Alford for the first 15 years of Anne 's life , and with her father 's strong commitment to learning , she received a better education than most contemporary girls , and also became intimately familiar with scripture and Christian tenets . While education at that time was almost exclusively offered to boys and men , one reason that Marbury may have taught his daughters is that six of his first seven children were girls ; another reason may have been that the ruling class in Elizabethan England began realising that girls could be schooled , looking to the example of the queen , who spoke six foreign languages . 
 In 1605 , when Anne was 15 , the family moved from Alford to the heart of London , where her father was given the position of vicar of the Church of Saint Martin 's in the Vintry . Here his expression of puritan views , though somewhat muffled , was tolerated , because of a shortage of pastors . Marbury took on additional work in 1608 , preaching in the parish of Saint Pancras , several miles northwest of the city , travelling there by horseback twice a week . In 1610 he replaced that position with one much closer to home , and became rector of Saint Margaret 's , on New Fish Street , only a short walk from Saint Martin in the Vintry . He was at a high point in his career , but in February 1611 , when Anne was 19 years old , he died suddenly at the age of 55 . 
 = = = Adulthood — following John Cotton = = = 
 The year after her father 's death , Anne Marbury , aged 22 , married William Hutchinson , a familiar acquaintance from Alford who was a fabric merchant then working in London . The couple was married at St Mary Woolnoth Church in London on 9 August 1672 , shortly after which they moved back to their hometown of Alford . 
 Soon they heard about an engaging minister named John Cotton who preached at Saints Botolph 's Church in the large port of Boston , about 21 miles ( 34 km ) from Alford . Cotton was installed as minister at Boston the year that the Hutchinsons were married , after having been a tutor at Emmanuel College in Cambridge . He was only 27 years old , yet he had gained a reputation as one of the leading Puritans in England . Once the Hutchinsons heard Cotton preach , the couple made the trip to Boston as often as possible , enduring the ride by horseback when the weather and circumstances allowed . Cotton 's spiritual message was different from that of his fellow Puritans , as he placed less emphasis on one 's behavior to attain God 's salvation and more emphasis on the moment of religious conversion " in which mortal man was infused with a divine grace . " Anne Hutchinson was greatly attracted to Cotton 's theology of " absolute grace " , which caused her to question the value of " works " and to view the Holy Spirit as " indwelling in the elect saint " . This allowed her to identify as a " mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty " ; such a theology was empowering to women , according to Eve LaPlante , whose status was otherwise determined by their husbands or fathers . 
 Another strong influence on Hutchinson was closer to her home in the nearby town of Bilsby . Her brother @-@ in @-@ law , the young minister John Wheelwright , preached a message like that of Cotton . As reformers , both Cotton and Wheelwright encouraged a sense of religious rebirth among their parishioners , but their weekly sermons did not satisfy the yearnings of some Puritan worshippers . This led to the rise of conventicles , which were gatherings of " those who had found grace " to listen to sermon repetitions , discuss and debate scripture , and pray . These gatherings were particularly important to women because they allowed women to take on roles of religious leadership that were otherwise denied them in a male @-@ dominated church hierarchy , according to some modern scholars . Hutchinson was inspired by Cotton and by other women who ran conventicles , and she began holding meetings in her own home , where she reviewed recent sermons with her listeners , and provided her own explanations of the message . 
 The Puritans wanted to do away with the ceremony of the Church of England and govern their churches based on a consensus of the parishioners . They preferred to eliminate bishops appointed by the monarchs , choose their own church elders ( or governors ) , and provide for a lay leader and two ministers — one a teacher in charge of doctrine , and the other a pastor in charge of people 's souls . By 1633 , Cotton 's inclination toward such Puritan practices had attracted the attention of Archbishop William Laud , who was on a campaign to suppress any preaching and practices that did not conform to the practices of the established Anglican Church . In that year , Cotton was removed from his ministry , and he went into hiding . Threatened with imprisonment , he made a hasty departure for New England aboard the ship Griffin , taking his pregnant wife . She gave birth to their child during the voyage to the colonies , whom they named Seaborn . 
 When Cotton left England , Anne Hutchinson described it as a " great trouble unto her , " and said that she " could not be at rest " until she followed her minister to New England . Hutchinson believed that the Spirit instructed her to follow Cotton to America , " impressed by the evidence of divine providence " . She was well into her 14th pregnancy , however , so she did not travel until after the baby was born . With the intention of soon going to New England , the Hutchinsons allowed their oldest son Edward to sail with Cotton before the remainder of the family made the voyage . In 1634 , 43 @-@ year @-@ old Anne Hutchinson set sail from England with her 48 @-@ year @-@ old husband William and their other ten surviving children , aged about eight months to 19 years . They sailed aboard the Griffin , the same ship that had carried Cotton and their oldest son a year earlier .

 Will Hutchinson was highly successful in his mercantile business and brought a considerable estate with him to New England , arriving in Boston in the late summer of 1634 . The Hutchinson family purchased a half @-@ acre lot on the Shawmut Peninsula , now downtown Boston . Here they had a house built , one of the largest on the peninsula , with a timber frame and at least two stories . ( The house stood until October 1711 , when it was consumed in the great fire of Boston , after which the Old Corner Bookstore was built on the site . ) The Hutchinsons soon were granted Taylor 's Island in the Boston harbour , where they grazed their sheep , and they also acquired 600 acres of land at Mount Wollaston , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Boston in the area that later became Quincy . Once established , William Hutchinson continued to prosper in the cloth trade , and made land purchases and investments . He became a town selectman and deputy to the General Court . Anne Hutchinson likewise fit into her new home with ease , devoting many hours to those who were ill or in need . She became an active midwife , and while tending to women in childbirth , she provided them with spiritual advice . Magistrate John Winthrop noted that " her ordinary <unk> was about the things of the Kingdome of God , " and " her <unk> conversation was in the way of righteousness and <unk> . " 
 = = = Boston Church = = = 
 The Hutchinsons became members of the Boston church , the most important church in the colony . With its location and harbour , Boston was New England 's centre of commerce , and its church was characterised by Winthrop as " the most publick , where Seamen and all Strangers came . " The church membership had grown from 80 to 120 during Cotton 's first four months there . In his journal , Winthrop proclaimed , " more were converted & added to that Churche , than to all the other Churches in the Baye . " Historian Michael Winship noted in 2005 that the church seemed to approach the Puritan ideal of a Christian community . Early Massachusetts historian William Hubbard found the church to be " in so flourishing a condition as were scarce any where else to be paralleled . " Winship considers it an exceptional twist of fate that the colony 's most important church also had the most unconventional minister in John Cotton . The more extreme religious views of Hutchinson and Henry Vane , the colony 's young governor , did not much stand out because of Cotton 's divergence from the theology of his fellow ministers . 
 = = = Home Bible study group = = = 
 Hutchinson 's visits to women in childbirth led to discussions along the lines of the conventicles in England . She soon began hosting weekly meetings at her home for women who wanted to discuss Cotton 's sermons and hear her explanations and elaborations . Her meetings for women became so popular that she had to organise meetings for men , as well , and she was hosting 60 or more people per week . These gatherings brought women , as well as their husbands , " to enquire more seriously after the Lord Jesus Christ . " 
 As the meetings continued , Hutchinson began offering her own religious views , stressing that only " an intuition of the Spirit " would lead to one 's election by God , and not good works . Her theological interpretations began diverging from the more legalistic views found among the colony 's ministers , and the attendance increased at her meetings and soon included Governor Vane . Her ideas that one 's outward behaviour was not necessarily tied to the state of one 's soul became attractive to those who might have been more attached to their professions than to their religious state , such as merchants and craftsmen . The colony 's ministers became more aware of Hutchinson 's meetings , and they contended that such " unauthorised " religious gatherings might confuse the faithful . Hutchinson responded to this with a verse from Titus , saying that " the elder women should instruct the younger . " 
 = = = Antinomian controversy = = = 
 = = = = Tensions build = = = = 
 Hutchinson 's gatherings were seen as unorthodox by some of the colony 's ministers , and differing religious opinions within the colony eventually became public debates . The resulting religious tension erupted into what has traditionally been called the Antinomian Controversy , but has more recently been labelled the Free Grace Controversy . 
 The Reverend Zachariah Symmes had sailed to New England on the same ship as the Hutchinsons . In September 1634 , he told another minister that he doubted Anne Hutchinson 's orthodoxy , based on questions that she asked him following his shipboard sermons . This issue delayed Hutchinson 's membership to the Boston church by a week , until a pastoral examination determined that she was sufficiently orthodox to join the church . 
 In 1635 , a difficult situation occurred when senior pastor John Wilson returned from a lengthy trip to England where he had been settling his affairs . Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time , and she immediately saw a big difference between her own doctrines and his . She found his emphasis on morality and his doctrine of " evidencing justification by sanctification " to be disagreeable . She told her followers that Wilson lacked " the seal of the Spirit . " Wilson 's theological views were in accord with all of the other ministers in the colony except for Cotton , who stressed " the inevitability of God 's will " ( " free grace " ) as opposed to preparation ( works ) . Hutchinson and her allies had become accustomed to Cotton 's doctrines , and they began disrupting Wilson 's sermons , even finding excuses to leave when Wilson got up to preach or pray . 
 Thomas Shepard , the minister of Newtown ( which later became Cambridge ) , began writing letters to Cotton as early as the spring of 1636 . He expressed concern about Cotton 's preaching and about some of the unorthodox opinions found among his Boston parishioners . Shepard went even further when he began criticising the Boston opinions to his Newtown congregation during his sermons . In May 1636 , the Bostonians received a new ally when the Reverend John Wheelwright arrived from England and immediately aligned himself with Cotton , Hutchinson , and other " free grace " advocates . Wheelwright had been a close neighbor of the Hutchinsons in Lincolnshire , and his wife was a sister of Hutchinson 's husband . Another boost for the free grace advocates came during the same month , when the young aristocrat Henry Vane was elected as the governor of the colony . Vane was a strong supporter of Hutchinson , but he also had his own ideas about theology that were considered not only unorthodox , but radical by some . 
 Hutchinson and the other free grace advocates continued to question the orthodox ministers in the colony . Wheelwright began preaching at Mount Wollaston , about ten miles south of the Boston meetinghouse , and his sermons began to answer Shepard 's criticisms with his own criticism of the covenant of works . This mounting " pulpit aggression " continued throughout the summer , along with the lack of respect shown Boston 's Reverend Wilson . Wilson endured these religious differences for several months before deciding that the affronts and errors were serious enough to require a response . He is the one who likely alerted magistrate John Winthrop , one of his parishioners , to take notice . On or shortly after 21 October 1636 , Winthrop gave the first public warning of the problem that consumed him and the leadership of the Massachusetts Bay Colony for much of the next two years . In his journal he wrote , " One Mrs. Hutchinson , a member of the church at Boston , a woman of a ready wit and a bold spirit , brought over with her two dangerous errors : 1 . That the person of the Holy Ghost dwells in a justified person . 2 . That no sanctification can help to evidence to us our justification . " He went on to elaborate these two points , and the Antinomian Controversy began with this journal entry . 
 = = = = Ministerial confrontation = = = = 
 On 25 October 1636 , seven ministers gathered at the home of Cotton to confront the developing discord ; they held a " private conference " which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church . Some agreement was reached , and Cotton " gave satisfaction to them [ the other ministers ] , so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification , and so did Mr. Wheelwright ; so as they all did hold , that sanctification did help to evidence justification . " Another issue was that some of the ministers had heard that Hutchinson had criticised them during her conventicles for preaching a covenant of works and said that they were not able ministers of the New Testament . Hutchinson responded to this only when prompted , and only to one or two ministers at a time . She believed that her response , which was largely coaxed from her , was private and confidential . A year later , her words were used against her in a trial that resulted in her banishment from the colony . 
 By late 1636 , as the controversy deepened , Hutchinson and her supporters were accused of two heresies in the Puritan church : antinomianism and familism . The word " antinomianism " literally means " against or opposed to the law " ; in a theological context , it means " the moral law is not binding upon Christians , who are under the law of grace . " According to this view , if one was under the law of grace , then moral law did not apply , allowing one to engage in immoral acts . <unk> was named for a 16th @-@ century sect called the Family of Love , and it involved one 's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit , coupled with freedom both from sin and from the responsibility for it . Hutchinson and her supporters were sometimes accused of engaging in immoral behaviour or " free love " in order to discredit them , but such acts were antithetical to their doctrine . Hutchinson , Wheelwright , and Vane all took leading roles as antagonists of the orthodox party , but theologically , it was Cotton 's differences of opinion with the colony 's other ministers that was at the centre of the controversy . 
 By winter , the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony 's difficulties . During the appointed fast @-@ day on Thursday , 19 January 1637 , Wheelwright preached at the Boston church in the afternoon . To the Puritan clergy , his sermon was " censurable and incited mischief . " The colony 's ministers were offended by the sermon , but the free grace advocates were encouraged , and they became more vociferous in their opposition to the " legal " ministers . Governor Vane began challenging the doctrines of the colony 's divines , and supporters of Hutchinson refused to serve during the Pequot War of 1637 because Wilson was the chaplain of the expedition . Ministers worried that the bold stand of Hutchinson and her supporters began to threaten the " Puritan 's holy experiment . " Had they succeeded , historian Dunn believes that they would have profoundly changed the thrust of Massachusetts history .

 By March , the political tide began to turn against the free grace advocates . Wheelwright was tried for contempt and sedition that month for his fast @-@ day sermon and was convicted in a close vote , but not yet sentenced . During the election of May 1637 , Henry Vane was replaced as governor by John Winthrop ; in addition , all the other Boston magistrates who supported Hutchinson and Wheelwright were voted out of office . By the summer of 1637 , Vane sailed back to England , never to return . With his departure , the time was ripe for the orthodox party to deal with the remainder of their rivals . 
 The autumn court of 1637 convened on 2 November and sentenced Wheelwright to banishment , ordering him to leave the colony within 14 days . Several of the other supporters of Hutchinson and Wheelwright were tried and given varied sentences . Following these preliminaries , it was Anne Hutchinson 's turn to be tried .

The trial was presided over by Governor John Winthrop , on the charge of " traducing [ slandering ] the ministers " . Other charges against her were laid out by Winthrop , including being one who " troubled the peace of the commonwealth and churches " , promoting and divulging opinions that had caused recent troubles , and continuing to hold meetings at her home despite a recent synod that had condemned them . 
 They found it difficult to charge her because she had never spoken her opinions in public , unlike Wheelwright and the other men who had been tried , nor had she ever signed any statements about them . Winthrop 's first two lines of prosecution were to portray her as a co @-@ conspirator of others who had openly caused trouble in the colony , and then to fault her for holding conventicles . Question by question , Hutchinson effectively stonewalled him in her responses , and Winthrop was unable to find a way to convert her known membership in a seditious faction into a <unk> offence . Deputy governor Thomas Dudley had a substantial background in law , and he stepped in to assist the prosecution . Dudley questioned Hutchinson about her conventicles and her association with the other conspirators . With no answer by Hutchinson , he moved on to the charge of her slandering the ministers . 
 The remainder of the trial was spent on this last charge . The prosecution intended to demonstrate that Hutchinson had made disparaging remarks about the colony 's ministers , and to use the October meeting as their evidence . Six ministers had presented to the court their written versions of the October conference , and Hutchinson agreed with the substance of their statements . Her defence was that she had spoken reluctantly and in private , that she " must either speak false or true in my answers " in the ministerial context of the meeting . In those private meetings , she had cited Proverbs 29 : 25 , " The fear of man <unk> a snare : but <unk> <unk> his trust in the Lord shall be safe . " The court was not interested in her distinction between public and private statements . 
 At the end of the first day of the trial , Winthrop recorded , " Mrs. Hutchinson , the court you see hath labored to bring you to acknowledge the error of your way that so you might be reduced . The time now grows late . We shall therefore give you a little more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning . " The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson , who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates . Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests , " Her success before the court may have astonished her judges , but it was no surprise to her . She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools , largely because of the intimacy she felt with God . " 
 = = = = Civil trial : Day 2 = = = = 
 During the morning of the second day of the trial , it appeared that Hutchinson had been given some legal counsel the previous evening , and she had more to say . She continued to criticise the ministers of violating their mandate of confidentiality . She said that they had deceived the court by not telling about her reluctance to share her thoughts with them . She insisted that the ministers testify under oath , which they were very hesitant to do . Magistrate Simon Bradstreet said that " she would make the ministers sin if they said something mistaken under oath " , but she answered that if they were going to accuse her , " I desire it may be upon oath . " As a matter of due process , the ministers would have to be sworn in , but would agree to do so only if the defence witnesses spoke first . 
 There were three such witnesses , all from the Boston church : deacon John Coggeshall , lay leader Thomas Leverett , and minister John Cotton . The first two witnesses made brief statements that had little effect on the court , but Cotton was grilled extensively . When Cotton testified , he tended to not remember many events of the October meeting , and attempted to soften the meaning of statements that Hutchinson was being accused of . He stressed that the ministers were not as upset about any Hutchinson remarks at the end of the October meeting as they appeared to be later . Dudley reiterated that Hutchinson had told the ministers that they were not able ministers of the New Testament ; Cotton replied that he did not remember her saying that . 
 There was more parrying between Cotton and the court , but the exchanges were not picked up in the transcript of the proceedings . Hutchinson asked the court for leave to " give you the ground of what I know to be true . " She then addressed the court with her own judgment : 
 You have no power over my body , neither can you do me any harm — for I am in the hands of the eternal Jehovah , my Saviour , I am at his appointment , the bounds of my habitation are cast in heaven , no further do I esteem of any mortal man than creatures in his hand , I fear none but the great Jehovah , which hath foretold me of these things , and I do verily believe that he will deliver me out of our hands . Therefore take heed how you proceed against me — for I know that , for this you go about to do to me , God will ruin you and your posterity and this whole state . 
 This was the " dramatic high point of the most analyzed event of the free grace controversy " , wrote historian Michael Winship . Historians have given a variety of reasons for this seemingly impulsive statement , including an " exultant impulse " , " hysteria " , " cracking under the strain of the inquest " , and being " possessed of the Spirit " . Winship , citing the work of historian Mary Beth Norton , suggests that Hutchinson consciously decided to explain why she knew that the divines of the colony were not able ministers of the New Testament . This was " not histrionics , but pedagogy , " according to Winship ; it was Hutchinson 's attempt to teach the Court , and doing so was consistent with her character . 
 = = = = Civil trial : Verdict = = = = 
 Hutchinson simplified the task of her opponents , whose prosecution had been somewhat shaky . Her revelation was considered not only seditious , but also in contempt of court . Cotton was pressed by Dudley on whether or not he supported Hutchinson 's revelation ; he said that he could find theological justification for it . Cotton may have still been angry over the zeal with which some opponents had come after the dissidents within his congregation . Winthrop was not interested in this quibbling , though ; he was using Hutchinson 's bold assertions to lead the court in the direction of rewriting history , according to the historical interpretations of Winship . Many of the Puritans had been convinced that there was a single destructive prophetic figure behind all of the difficulties that the colony had been having , and Hutchinson had just become the culprit . Winthrop addressed the court , " if therefore it be the mind of the court , looking at [ her ] as the principal cause of all our trouble , that they would now consider what is to be done with her . " 
 The Bostonians made a final effort to slow the proceedings . William Coddington rose , asserting , " I do not see any clear witness against her , and you know it is a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too , " ending with , " Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law of the country that she hath broke , and therefore deserve no censure . " The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke . Three of the ministers were sworn in , and each testified against Hutchinson . Winthrop moved to have her banished ; in the ensuing tally , only the Boston deputies voted against conviction . Hutchinson challenged the sentence 's legitimacy , saying , " I desire to know wherefore I am banished . " Winthrop responded , " The court knows wherefore and is satisfied . " 
 Hutchinson was called a heretic and an instrument of the devil , and was condemned to banishment by the Court " as being a woman not fit for our society " . The Puritans sincerely believed that , in banishing Hutchinson , they were protecting God 's eternal truth . Winthrop summed up the case with genuine feeling : 
 Thus it pleased the Lord to <unk> the prayers of his afflicted people ... and by the care and <unk> of the wise and faithfull ministers of the Churches , assisted by the <unk> authority , to discover this Master @-@ piece of the old Serpent .... It is the Lords work , and it is marvellous in our eyes . 
 = = = = Detention = = = = 
 Following her civil trial , Hutchinson was put under house arrest and ordered to be gone by the end of the following March . In the interim , she was not allowed to return home , but was detained at the house of Joseph Weld , brother of the Reverend Thomas Weld , located in Roxbury , about two miles from her home in Boston . The distance was not great , yet Hutchinson was rarely able to see her children because of the weather , which was particularly harsh that winter . Winthrop referred to Hutchinson as " the prisoner " and was determined to keep her isolated so that others would not be inspired by her , according to LaPlante . She was frequently visited by various ministers , whose intent , according to LaPlante , was to reform her thinking but also to collect evidence against her . Thomas Shepard was there to " collect errors " , and concluded that she was a dangerous woman . Shepard and the other ministers who visited her drew up a list of her theological errors and presented them to the Boston church , which decided that she should stand trial for these views . 
 = = = = Church trial = = = = 
 Hutchinson was called to trial on Thursday , 15 March 1638 , weary and in poor health following a four @-@ month detention . The trial took place at her home church in Boston , though many of her supporters were gone . Her husband and other friends had already left the colony to prepare for a new place to live . Her only family members present were her oldest son Edward and his wife , her daughter Faith and son @-@ in @-@ law Thomas Savage , and her sister Katharine with her husband Richard Scott . 
 The ministers intended to protect their orthodox doctrine and to examine Hutchinson 's theological errors . Ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with managing the examination . He called Mrs. Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged . A nine @-@ hour interrogation followed , in which the ministers delved into some weighty points of theology . At the end of the session , only four of the many errors were covered , and Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer . He spoke , " I would speake it to Gods Glory [ that ] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us ... he hath given you a sharp apprehension , a ready utterance and <unk> to <unk> <unk> in the Cause of God . " The ministers overwhelmingly concluded that Hutchinson 's unsound beliefs outweighed all the good which she had done , and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community . Cotton continued , 
 " You cannot <unk> the Argument ... that <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> ; and all promiscuous and <unk> <unk> <unk> of men and <unk> without Distinction or Relation of Mariage , will necessarily follow ... Though I have not herd , <unk> do I thinke you have bine <unk> to your Husband in his Marriage Covenant , yet that will follow upon it . " 
 Here Cotton was making a link between Hutchinson 's theological ideas and the more extreme behaviour credited to the antinomians and <unk> . He concluded , 
 " Therefor , I doe <unk> you , and <unk> charge you in the name of Ch [ rist ] Je [ sus ] , in whose place I stand ... that you would sadly consider the just hand of God <unk> you , the great hurt you have done to the Churches , the great <unk> you have brought to Je [ sus ] Ch [ rist ] , and the <unk> that you have done to many a poore soule . " 
 With this , Hutchinson was instructed to return on the next lecture day , in one week . 
 Cotton had not yet given up on his parishioner . With the permission of the court , Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home , where the recently arrived Reverend John Davenport was also staying . All week the two ministers worked with her and , under their supervision , she had written out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that had formerly brought objection . Hutchinson stood at the next meeting , on Thursday , 22 March , and read her recantation in a subdued voice to the congregation . She admitted to having been wrong about the soul and spirit , wrong about the resurrection of the body , wrong in prophesying the destruction of the colony , wrong in her demeanour toward the ministers , and , most remarkably , agreed that sanctification could be evidence of justification ( a covenant of works ) " as it <unk> from Christ and is witnessed to us by the Spirit " . Had the trial ended there , she would have likely remained in good standing with the Boston church , and had the possibility of returning some day . 
 For some of the ministers , though , it was not sufficient for this proud , strong @-@ minded woman to submit to the humiliation of making a public confession , according to the opinion of Emery Battis . Wilson explored an accusation made by Shepard at the end of the previous meeting , and new words brought on new assaults . The outcome of her trial was uncertain following the first day 's grilling , but her downfall came when she would not acknowledge that she held certain theological errors before her four @-@ month imprisonment . With this , she was accused of lying but , even at this point , Winthrop and a few of the ministers wanted her soul redeemed because of her significant evangelical work before she " set forth her owne <unk> " . To these sentiments , Shepard vehemently argued that Hutchinson was a " Notorious Imposter " in whose heart there was never any grace . He admonished the " <unk> of her lying " during a time of supposed humiliation . 
 Shepard had swayed the proceedings , with Cotton signalling that he had given up on her , and her sentence was presented by Wilson : 
 " <unk> as you , Mrs. Hutchinson , have highly transgressed and offended ... and troubled the Church with your Errors and have <unk> away many a poor soule , and have upheld your Revelations ; and forasmuch as you have made a Lye ... Therefor in the name of our Lord Je [ sus ] Ch [ rist ] ... I doe cast you out and ... deliver you up to <unk> ... and account you from this time forth to be a <unk> and a <unk> ... I command you in the name of Ch [ rist ] Je [ sus ] and of this Church as a Leper to withdraw your selfe out of the Congregation . " 
 Hutchinson was now not only banished from the colony , but excommunicated from the church , and her leading supporters had been given three months to leave the colony , including Coddington and Coggeshall , while others were disenfranchised or dismissed from their churches . The court in November had ordered that 58 citizens of Boston and 17 from adjacent towns be disarmed unless they repudiated the " seditious label " given them , and many of these people followed Hutchinson into exile . 
 = = Rhode Island = = 
 During Hutchinson 's imprisonment , several of her supporters prepared to leave the colony and settle elsewhere . One such group of men , including her husband Will , met on 7 March 1638 at the home of wealthy Boston merchant William Coddington . Ultimately , 23 men signed what is known as the Portsmouth Compact , forming themselves into a " Bodie Politick " and electing Coddington as their governor , but giving him the Biblical title of " judge " . Nineteen of the signers initially planned to move to New Jersey or Long Island , but Roger Williams convinced them to settle in the area of his Providence Plantations settlement . Coddington purchased Aquidneck Island ( later named Rhode Island ) in the Narragansett Bay from the Narragansetts , and the settlement of Pocasset was founded ( soon renamed Portsmouth ) . Anne Hutchinson followed in April , after the conclusion of her church trial . 
 Hutchinson , her children , and others accompanying her travelled for more than six days by foot in the April snow to get from Boston to Roger Williams ' settlement at Providence . They took boats to get to Aquidneck Island , where many men had gone ahead of them to begin constructing houses . In the second week of April , she reunited with her husband , from whom she had been separated for nearly six months . 
 = = = Final pregnancy = = = 
 Hutchinson went into labour in May 1638 , following the stress of her trial , her imprisonment all winter , and the difficult trip to Aquidneck Island . She delivered what her doctor John Clarke described as a handful of transparent grapes . This is known now as a hydatidiform mole , a condition occurring most often in women over 45 , resulting from one or two sperm cells fertilising a blighted egg . Hutchinson had been ill most of the winter , with unusual weakness , throbbing headaches , and bouts of vomiting . Most writers on the subject agree that she had been pregnant during her trial . Historian Emery Battis , citing expert opinion , suggests that she may not have been pregnant at all during that time , but displaying acute symptoms of menopause . The following April after reuniting with her husband , she became pregnant , only to miscarry the hydatidiform mole . A woman could have suffered severe menopausal symptoms who had undergone a continuous cycle of pregnancies , deliveries , and <unk> for 25 years , with the burdens of raising a large family and subjected to the extreme stress of her trials . 
 The Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson 's suffering and also that of Mary Dyer , a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant . The leaders classified the women 's misfortunes as the judgement of God . Winthrop wrote , " She brought forth not one , but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts " , then continued , " see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way , for look — as she had vented misshapen opinions , so she must bring forth deformed monsters . " Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson 's followers who stayed in the Boston area . Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors ; she shouted at them , " the Church at Boston ? I know no such church , neither will I own it . Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston , but no Church of Christ ! " 
 = = = Dissension in government = = = 
 Less than a year after Pocasset was settled , it suffered rifts and civil difficulties . Coddington had openly supported Hutchinson following her trial , but he had become autocratic and began to alienate his fellow settlers . Early in 1639 , Hutchinson became acquainted with Samuel Gorton , who attacked the legitimacy of the magistrates . On 28 April 1639 , Gorton and a dozen other men ejected Coddington from power . Hutchinson may not have supported this rebellion , but her husband was chosen as the new governor . Two days later , over 30 men signed a document forming a new " civil body politic " . Winthrop noted in his journal that at Aquidneck , 
 " the people grew very tumultuous and put out Mr. Coddington and the other three magistrates , and chose Mr. William Hutchinson only , a man of very mild temper and weak parts , and wholly guided by his wife , who had been the beginner of all the former troubles in the country and still continued to breed disturbance . " 
 Coddington and several others left the colony , establishing the settlement of Newport at the south end of the island . The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth . They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state . The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders ; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646 , such as Coggeshall , Nicholas Easton , William Brenton , Jeremy Clarke , and Henry Bull . On 12 March 1640 , the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re @-@ unite peacefully . Coddington became governor of the island , and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants . The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens . 
 During her tenure in Portsmouth , Hutchinson developed a new philosophy concerning religion . She persuaded her husband to resign from his position as a magistrate , as Roger Williams put it , " because of the opinion , which she had newly taken up , of the unlawfulness of magistracy . " 
 Hutchinson 's husband Will died some time after June 1641 at the age of 55 , the same age at which Anne 's father had died . He was buried in Portsmouth . No record of his death exists because there was no established church , which would have been the customary repository for such records . 
 = = New Netherland = = 
 Not long after the settlement of Aquidneck Island , the Massachusetts Bay Colony made some serious threats to take over the island and the entire Narragansett Bay area , causing Hutchinson and other settlers much anxiety . This compelled her to move totally out of the reach of the Bay colony and its sister colonies in Connecticut and New Haven and move into the jurisdiction of the Dutch . Hutchinson went to New Netherland some time after the summer of 1642 with seven of her children , a son @-@ in @-@ law , and several servants — 16 total persons by several accounts . There they settled near an ancient landmark called Split Rock , not far from what became the Hutchinson River in northern Bronx , New York City . Other Rhode Island families were in the area , including the Throckmortons and the <unk> . By one account , Hutchinson bought her land from John Throckmorton ( for whom Throggs Neck is named ) who had earlier been a settler of Providence with Roger Williams , but was now living in New Netherland . 
 The Hutchinsons ' stayed temporarily in an abandoned house while a permanent house was being built with the help of James Sands , who had married Katherine Walker , a granddaughter of William Hutchinson 's brother Edward . Sands later became a settler of Block Island ( later New Shoreham , Rhode Island ) , and the Reverend Samuel Niles , another early settler of Block Island , recorded the following about Sands ' experience in New Netherland : 
 Mrs. Hutchinson ... removed to Rhode Island , but making no long stay there , she went further westward to a place called Eastchester , now in the eastern part of the province of New York , where she prepared to settle herself ; but not to the good liking of the Indians that lived back in the woods , as the sequel proves . In order to pursue her purpose , she agreed with Captain James Sands , then a young man , to build her house , and he took a partner with him in the business ... there came a company of Indians to the frame where he was at work , and made a great shout and sat down . After some time , they gathered up his tools , put his broad axe on his shoulders and his other tools into his hands , and made signs for him to go away . But he seemed to take no notice of them , but continued in his work . 
 Thus the natives gave overt clues that they were displeased with the settlement being formed there . The property had supposedly been secured by an agent of the Dutch West India Company in 1640 , but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk , and the local natives likely had little to do with that transaction , if they even knew of it at all . Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site . 
 The exact location of the Hutchinson house has been a source of great interest for several centuries . LaPlante hints in her biography of Hutchinson that the homestead was near the Indian Trail that went through modern @-@ day Pelham Bay Park , on the east side of the Hutchinson River . Lockwood Barr offers another hypothesis , citing the extensive land title research of Otto <unk> published by the Westchester Historical Society in 1929 . He concluded that the site of the homestead was on the west side of the Hutchinson River in Eastchester . A map in Barr 's book that appeared in the 1929 work shows the property bordering the river in an area that is now called <unk> , between two creeks called Rattlesnake Brook and Black Dog Brook . This area of the Bronx is now highly developed ; Rattlesnake Brook is extant , mostly in underground culverts , but Black Dog Brook is defunct . 
 = = = Massacre = = = 
 The Hutchinsons were unfortunate in the timing of their settlement in this area , and soon became victims of the local unrest . Dutch governor Willem Kieft had aroused the ire of the natives with his inhumanity and treachery , according to the opinion of some modern writers . Mrs. Hutchinson had a favourable relationship with the Narragansett people in Rhode Island , and may have felt a false sense of safety among the Siwanoy of New Netherland . The Hutchinsons had been friendly to them but , following their mistreatment by the Dutch , these natives ravaged the New Netherland colony in a series of incidents known as Kieft 's War . The fate of the Hutchinson family was aptly summarised by LaPlante : 
 The Siwanoy warriors stampeded into the tiny settlement above Pelham Bay , prepared to burn down every house . The Siwanoy chief , Wampage , who had sent a warning , expected to find no settlers present . But at one house the men in animal skins encountered several children , young men and women , and a woman past middle age . One Siwanoy indicated that the Hutchinsons should restrain the family 's dogs . Without apparent fear , one of the family tied up the dogs . As quickly as possible , the Siwanoy seized and scalped Francis Hutchinson , William Collins , several servants , the two Annes ( mother and daughter ) , and the younger children — William , Katherine , Mary , and <unk> . As the story was later recounted in Boston , one of the Hutchinson 's daughters , " seeking to escape , " was caught " as she was getting over a hedge , and they drew her back again by the hair of the head to the stump of a tree , and there cut off her head with a hatchet . 
 The warriors then dragged the bodies into the house , along with the cattle , and set fire to the place , which burned to the ground . During the attack , Hutchinson 's nine year @-@ old daughter Susanna is said to have been out picking blueberries ; she was found , according to legend , hidden in the crevice of Split Rock nearby . She is believed to have had red hair , unusual to the attackers , and perhaps because of this curiosity her life was spared . She was taken captive , was named " Autumn Leaf " by one account , and lived with the Indians for two to six years ( accounts vary ) until ransomed back to her family members , most of whom were living in Boston . 
 The exact date of the Hutchinson massacre is not known . The first definitive record of the occurrence was in John Winthrop 's journal , where it was recorded as the first entry made for the month of September , though not dated . It took days or even weeks for Winthrop to receive the news , so the event almost certainly occurred in August 1643 , and this is the date found in most sources . Some accounts offer an exact date for the massacre , but they provide no source or evidence . 
 The reaction in Massachusetts to Hutchinson 's death was harsh . The Reverend Thomas Weld wrote , " The Lord heard our groans to heaven , and freed us from our great and sore affliction ... I never heard that the Indians in those parts did ever before this commit the like outrage upon any one family or families ; and therefore God 's hand is the more apparently seen herein , to pick out this woeful woman " . Peter Bulkley , the pastor at Concord , wrote , " Let her damned heresies , and the just vengeance of God , by which she perished , terrify all her seduced followers from having any more to do with her leaven . " Winthrop wrote , " Thus it had pleased the Lord to have compassion of his poor churches here , and to discover this great imposter , an instrument of Satan so fitted and trained to his service for interrupting the passage [ of his ] kingdom in this part of the world , and poisoning the churches here " . Further , he wrote , " This American Jezebel kept her strength and reputation , even among the people of God , till the hand of civil justice laid hold on her , and then she began evidently to decline , and the faithful to be freed from her forgeries " . 
 Wampage , the warrior who claimed to have slain Hutchinson , assumed her name after the massacre , calling himself " Anne <unk> , " thus being honoured by using the name of his most famous victim . Eleven years after the event , Wampage confirmed a deed transferring the Hutchinsons ' former property to Thomas Pell , with his name on the document being given as " Ann <unk> alias Wampage . "

 = = = The role of gender = = = 
 Some writers strive to interpret the historical events surrounding Anne Hutchinson 's life from a modern feminist perspective , viewing her as an icon of early " women 's rights " activism . According to some feminist writers , Hutchinson may have been persecuted because , in preaching , she was stepping beyond the gender role then considered appropriate for a woman . Some historians suggest that she fell victim to contemporary mores surrounding the role of women in Puritan society . Hutchinson spoke her mind freely within the context of a male hierarchy unaccustomed to outspoken women . John Winthrop described her as " a woman of ready wit and bold spirit " . The extent to which she was persecuted was perhaps proportional to the threat which the Puritan clergy saw in her , considering that many people were willing to listen to and follow her . The close relationship between church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that a challenge to the ministers was quickly interpreted as challenge to established authority of all kinds . ( However , the Puritans themselves clearly stated that the threat which they perceived was entirely theological , and no direct mention was ever made to indicate that they were threatened by her gender . ) 
 According to Amy Lang , Hutchinson failed to appreciate something which the male members of the court knew : that " the force of the female heretic vastly exceeds her heresy " . It was difficult for the court to pin a crime on her ; her true crime in their eyes was the violation of her role in Puritan society , according to Lang 's interpretation , and was thus condemned for undertaking the roles of teacher , minister , magistrate , and husband . 
 = = = Heretic label = = = 
 To the chagrin of clergy and colony officials , Hutchinson interpreted the doctrine of the Perseverance of the saints according to the Free Grace model , which taught that the saved could sin freely without endangering their salvation , instead of the Lordship salvation model prevalent at that time , which noted that those who were truly saved would demonstrate by seeking to follow the ways of their Saviour . She also claimed that she could identify " the elect " among the colonists . These positions ultimately caused John Cotton , John Winthrop , and other former friends to view her as an antinomian heretic . 
 = = = Church and secular politics = = = 
 In his article on Hutchinson in Forerunner magazine , Jay Rogers articulates the view that Hutchinson 's interpretations were not " antithetical to what the Puritans believed at all . What began as the quibbling over fine points of Christian doctrine ended as a confrontation over the role of authority in the colony . " Hutchinson may have criticised the established religious authorities , as did others , but she did so while cultivating an energetic following . That religious following was large enough to be a significant force in secular politics . Hutchinson may have doomed herself by her strong support of Henry Vane , who was replaced by Winthrop who presided at her civil trial — as much as for the specific content of her religious views . 
 = = = Modern view = = = 
 Hutchinson is famous , not so much for what she did or said during the Antinomian Controversy , but for what John Winthrop made of her in his journal and in his account of the controversy called the Short Story . Hutchinson became the reason for all of the difficulties that the colony had gone through to Winthrop , though inaccurately portrayed and , with her departure , any other lingering issues were swept under the carpet , according to Michael Winship . Winthrop 's account has given Hutchinson near legendary status and , as with all legends , what exactly she stood for has shifted over the centuries . To Winthrop , Hutchinson was a " hell @-@ spawned agent of destructive anarchy " , in the words of Winship . To 19th century America , she was a crusader for religious liberty , as the nation celebrated its new achievement of the separation of church and state . Finally , in the 20th century , she became a feminist leader , credited with terrifying the patriarchs , not because of her religious views , but because she was an assertive , highly visible woman . 
 Historian Michael Winship calls Hutchinson " a prophet , spiritual adviser , mother of fifteen , and important participant in a fierce religious controversy that shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638 " , upheld as a symbol of religious freedom , liberal thinking , and Christian feminism . Anne Hutchinson is a contentious figure , having been lionised , mythologized , and demonised by various writers . In particular , historians and other observers have interpreted and re @-@ interpreted her life within the following frameworks : the status of women , power struggles within the Church , and a similar struggle within the secular political structure . As to her overall historical impact , Winship writes in his 2005 book on Hutchinson and the Free Grace Controversy , " Hutchinson 's well @-@ publicized trials and the attendant accusations against her made her the most famous , or infamous , English woman in colonial American history .

 Another memorial to Hutchinson was erected south of Boston in Quincy , Massachusetts , at the corner of Beale Street and Grandview Avenue . This is near the location where the Hutchinsons owned a 600 @-@ acre farm with a house , and this is where they stayed for several days in early spring 1638 while making the trip from Boston to their new home on Aquidneck Island . 
 = = = Literary works = = = 
 According to Hutchinson biographer Eve LaPlante , some literary critics trace the character of Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne 's The Scarlet Letter to Hutchinson 's persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony . Historian Amy Lang wrote that Hester Prynne was the embodiment of a fictional Anne Hutchinson — a Hutchinson created by the early Puritan chroniclers . Lang notes that Hester was what orthodox Puritans said Hutchinson was , either in reality or at least spiritually . The parallel is that Hutchinson was the heretic who metaphorically seduced the Puritan community , while in Hawthorne 's novel Hester Prynne literally seduced the minister of her community . 
 Anne Hutchinson and her political struggle with Governor Winthrop are depicted in the 1980 play <unk> Creatures by William Gibson . Other notable historical characters who appear in the play are Reverend John Cotton , Governor Harry Vane , and future Quaker martyr Mary Dyer . In January 2014 , Dan Shore 's opera Anne Hutchinson , with libretto by William A. Fregosi and Fritz Bell , was performed twice in Boston , Massachusetts by the Intermezzo Opera Company . In February 2015 , researcher Claire <unk> discovered and positively identified a tribute poem to Anne Hutchinson written in 1770 by Jupiter Hammon , the first published Black American poet .

 In southern New York , her most prominent namesakes are the Hutchinson River , one of the very few rivers named after a woman , and the Hutchinson River Parkway . Elementary schools are named for her , such as in the Westchester County towns of Pelham and Eastchester . 
 In Portsmouth , Rhode Island , Anne Hutchinson and her friend Mary Dyer , the Quaker martyr , have been remembered at Founders Brook Park with the Anne Hutchinson / Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden , a medicinal botanical garden set by a scenic waterfall and historical marker for the early settlement of Portsmouth . The garden was created by artist and herbalist Michael Steven Ford , who is a descendant of both women . The memorial was a grass roots effort by a local Newport organisation , the Anne Hutchinson Memorial Committee headed by Newport artist Valerie <unk> . The organization is called Friends of Anne Hutchinson ; it meets annually at the memorial in Portsmouth on the Sunday nearest to 20 July , the date of Anne 's baptism , to celebrate her life and the local colonial history of the women of Aquidneck Island . 
 Hutchinson is honoured together with Roger Williams with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on 5 February .

 Anne and William Hutchinson had 15 children , all of them born and baptised in Alford except for the last child who was baptised in Boston , Massachusetts . Of the 14 children born in England , 11 lived to sail to New England . 
 The oldest child , Edward , baptised 28 May 1613 , signed the Portsmouth Compact , and settled on Aquidneck Island with his parents , but soon made peace with the Massachusetts authorities , and returned to Boston . He was an officer in the colonial militia , and died from wounds received during King Philip 's War . Susanna , baptised 4 September 1614 , died in Alford during the plague in 1630 , and Richard , baptised 8 December 1615 was admitted to the Boston church in 1634 , but returned to England , after which no further record has been found . Faith , baptised 14 August 1617 , married Thomas Savage , and lived in Boston , dying about 1651 . Bridget , baptised 15 January 1618 / 9 , married John Sanford and lived in Portsmouth , Rhode Island , where her husband was briefly governor of the island , and died by 1698 .

 Ryan James Kesler ( born August 31 , 1984 ) is an American professional ice hockey center and an alternate captain for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League . Selected in the first round , 23rd overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft , Kesler had spent the first ten years of his NHL career with the Canucks . He was traded to Anaheim Ducks on June 27 , 2014 . He is best known for being a two @-@ way forward , winning the Selke Trophy in 2011 after having finished as a finalist the previous two years , as well as for his agitating style of play . 
 Kesler played junior hockey with the U.S. National Team Development Program from which he then accepted a scholarship to play college hockey with the Ohio State Buckeyes of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association ( CCHA ) . In one season with the Buckeyes , he was an honourable mention for the CCHA All @-@ Rookie Team and was named CCHA Rookie of the Week three times and CCHA Rookie of the Month once . In addition to the U.S. National Team Development Program and the Ohio State Buckeyes , Kesler has also suited up for the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) , where he was named to the 2005 AHL All @-@ Star Game . 
 Kesler has represented the United States at five International Ice Hockey Federation @-@ sanctioned events , winning one World U18 Championship gold medal , one World Junior Championships gold medal , and the 2010 Winter Olympics silver medal . He also participated in the 2001 World U @-@ 17 Hockey Challenge where he won a gold medal . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Kesler was born on August 31 , 1984 , in Livonia , Michigan , to Linda and Mike Kesler . He is the youngest of three children , after brother Todd and sister Jenny . His father , Mike , played college hockey at Colorado College and was a supervisor with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association for 37 years . He introduced his children to the ice at a very young age . Ryan recalls skating at around the age of four . Mike also coaches a Junior B hockey team and runs a hockey school in Livonia , which Kesler attended as a child every summer from the age of six to seventeen . In April 2007 , Mike was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer and had seven inches of his small intestine removed in order to be rid of it . 
 Kesler played minor hockey in Detroit for teams such as Compuware , <unk> , and Little Caesars of the Midwest Elite Hockey League ( <unk> ) . Around the age of thirteen , Kesler was cut from every AAA team he tried out for . As a result , he played for his dad 's Livonia Hockey Association bantam team , which he coached . Kesler credits his brother , who is nine years older than him , for getting him into hockey . During his minor career , he established a lasting friendship with Chris Conner , who went on to be drafted by the Dallas Stars . 
 Despite growing up in Michigan , he was a Minnesota North Stars fan . As a young hockey player , Kesler looked up to North Stars center and fellow Livonia native Mike Modano as a role model . He has also listed Joe Sakic of the Quebec Nordiques and Colorado Avalanche as a favorite player during his childhood .

 In June 2000 , Kesler was drafted in the fifth round , 89th overall by the Brampton Battalion in the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) Priority Selection . Despite being drafted by a Canadian OHL team , Kesler chose to play in the U.S. National Team Development Program ( USNTDP ) because of its close proximity to his Livonia home . This allowed Kesler to continue his high school education without leaving Winston Churchill High School . He entered the USNTDP for the 2000 – 01 season . Over his two seasons with the USNTDP , Kesler recorded 99 points in 131 games . 
 = = = Ohio State University = = = 
 After two seasons with the USNTDP , Kesler accepted a scholarship to play college hockey at Ohio State University for the Ohio State Buckeyes of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association ( CCHA ) . He chose Ohio State over the University of Wisconsin – Madison and its Wisconsin Badgers ice hockey program of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association ( WCHA ) because Ohio State was closer to Kesler 's home in Livonia . As a freshman , Kesler scored eleven goals and twenty assists to finish fourth in team scoring behind junior and Hobey Baker Award finalist R. J. <unk> . Over the course of his freshman year , Kesler helped the Buckeyes to a third @-@ place finish in the CCHA 's regular season standings . At the 2003 CCHA Tournament , Kesler scored two goals as the Buckeye 's finished in fourth place , losing to Northern Michigan 4 – 1 in the third place game . Despite this finish , Ohio State secured an at @-@ large bid to the 2003 NCAA Men 's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament , the third appearance at the NCAA Men 's Ice Hockey Championship in Ohio State 's history . At the tournament , Ohio State suffered a 1 – 0 loss to Boston College in the opening round of the East Regional at the Dunkin ' Donuts Center in Providence , Rhode Island , ending both the team 's and Kesler 's season . 
 Kesler 's play as a freshman earned him an honourable mention for the CCHA All @-@ Rookie Team . He was also named CCHA Rookie of the Week three times , CCHA Rookie of the Month once , and was awarded Ohio State 's George Burke Most Valuable Freshman award . Following the season , Kesler entered the 2003 NHL Entry Draft ranked sixteenth overall among North American skaters . On June 21 , 2003 , he was drafted 23rd overall by the Vancouver Canucks . 
 = = = Manitoba Moose = = = 
 Upon being drafted , Kesler considered returning to Ohio State for his sophomore season or joining the Brampton Battalion , who still held his OHL rights . However , less than two months after being drafted , Kesler signed a three @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 475 @-@ million entry level contract with the Canucks , complemented by an $ 850 @,@ 000 signing bonus . After attending Canucks training camp and playing in five preseason games , Kesler was cut by the Canucks and sent to their American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Manitoba Moose . Kesler began his first professional season with the Moose , but was recalled by the Canucks in November and made his NHL debut on November 24 , 2003 in a 2 – 1 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs , recording one shot on goal and 12 : 12 of ice time . He scored his first career NHL goal on November 29 against Calgary Flames goaltender Jamie McLennan in a 4 – 4 tie . For the remainder of the season , Kesler split time between the Canucks and the Moose , finishing his season with five points in 28 Canucks games and eleven points in 33 Moose games . 
 The 2004 – 05 NHL lockout , which cancelled the full 2004 – 05 NHL season , forced Kesler to spend the entire season with the Moose . With Manitoba , Kesler emerged as one of the Canucks ' top prospects . Mid @-@ way through the season , Kesler was named to the PlanetUSA All @-@ Star team for the 2005 AHL All @-@ Star Game where he helped PlanetUSA defeat Team Canada for the first time in five years . Kesler finished third in team scoring with thirty goals and 57 points to be named the Moose 's Most Valuable Player . Kesler added an additional nine points in fourteen playoff games as the Moose advanced to the Western Conference finals before being swept by the Chicago Wolves .

 = = = = 2005 – 08 = = = = 
 When the NHL lockout ended and play resumed for the 2005 – 06 NHL season , Kesler joined the Canucks for his first full season with the team , playing in all 82 games and finishing the season with 23 points . With his entry @-@ level contract expiring in the off @-@ season , Kesler rejected a $ 564 @,@ 000 qualifying offer from the Canucks before becoming a restricted free agent on July 1 , 2006 . Unable to come to terms on a new deal with the Canucks , Kesler signed a one @-@ year , $ 1 @.@ 9 @-@ million offer sheet with the Philadelphia Flyers on September 12 . The offer sheet from Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke was the first in the NHL since the Tampa Bay Lightning extended one to Brett Hauer in July 1999 . The move was highly controversial with many NHL general managers criticizing how Kesler 's inflated salary would affect future free agent signings . The Canucks had one week to either match the offer or receive a second round draft pick from the Flyers in 2007 as compensation . Two days after the signing , the Canucks matched the Flyers ' offer . 
 After playing 48 games in the 2006 – 07 NHL season , Kesler suffered a torn acetabular labrum and missed the remainder of the regular season , finishing the season with sixteen points . Kesler returned to the Canucks lineup for the first game of their quarterfinal playoff series versus the Dallas Stars . While blocking a shot in the fourth overtime of the game , Kesler was re @-@ injured , suffering a displaced index finger . Despite finishing the game , Kesler was forced to undergo surgery to repair the damage and missed the remainder of the playoffs . In the off @-@ season , the Canucks re @-@ signed Kesler to a three @-@ year , $ 5 @.@ 25 @-@ million contract extension on May 24 , 2007 . In comparison to his previous contract , facilitated by the Flyers ' offer sheet , the deal represented a $ 150 @,@ 000 paycut in terms of average annual salary . 
 Early into his fourth season with the Canucks , Kesler was cross @-@ checked in the face by Flyers forward Jesse <unk> . The cross @-@ check was an immediate response to Kesler hitting Flyers defenceman Randy Jones and resulted in Kesler leaving the game with a sore jaw . <unk> was subsequently suspended for 25 games , matching the then largest suspension in NHL history . Later in the season , Kesler was involved in another violent on @-@ ice incident when Anaheim Ducks defenceman Chris Pronger used his skate blade to stomp on Kesler 's calf . Kesler was not injured on the play . Although the NHL originally announced that Pronger would not receive a suspension on the play , he later received an eight @-@ game suspension when new video emerged of the incident . Over the course of the season , Kesler established himself as a solid two @-@ way centre , scoring what was then a career high 21 goals and 37 points and playing a regular shutdown role against opposing teams ' top players and on the penalty kill with linemate Alexandre Burrows . 
 = = = = 2008 – 2014 = = = = 
 With the departures of Markus Näslund , Brendan Morrison , and Trevor Linden following the 2007 – 08 season , the Canucks were left without any captains for the 2008 – 09 NHL season . On September 30 , 2008 , Kesler was announced as a Canucks alternate captain with Willie Mitchell and Mattias Öhlund , while Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo was named captain . While he , at first , continued to play on the third line in a largely defensive role with Burrows , head coach Alain Vigneault eventually split the duo in the midst of a poor January for the team . As a result , Kesler was placed on the second line with free agent acquisitions Pavol Demitra and Mats Sundin . Playing in a more offensive role , he set then @-@ personal bests for the 2008 – 09 season , with 26 goals , 33 assists and 59 points . As a result , he was awarded the Cyclone Taylor Award as team MVP ahead of higher @-@ profile teammates Luongo and the Sedins . Kesler gained additional recognition on a league @-@ wide basis as a Selke Trophy finalist along with Pavel Datsyuk of the Detroit Red Wings and Mike Richards of the Philadelphia Flyers . He finished as second runner @-@ up with one first @-@ place vote . 
 In the midst of another career year , Kesler signed a six @-@ year , $ 30 million contract extension with the Canucks on March 19 , 2010 . The deal was structured to pay Kesler $ 5 million per season and came a month and a half after general manager Mike Gillis announced he had suspended contract negotiations with all the Canucks ' pending free agents until after the 2009 – 10 season . The Canucks were reportedly looking to sign him at $ 4 @.@ 5 million per year , while Kesler was asking for $ 5 @.@ 5 million . Kesler had made remarks the previous season in March 2009 , after Burrows had recently signed a four @-@ year , $ 2 million per season extension , that more players need to sign contracts below market value in order to develop a winning team . His comments later prompted his agent to refute the idea Kesler would not seek full market value in contract negotiations . Kesler was also contacted by NHL Players Association director of affairs Glenn Healy , discouraging him to make similar remarks in the future . 
 Kesler completed the 2009 – 10 campaign with a new personal best in points for the third consecutive season with 75 points ( 25 goals and 50 assists ) . With the Sundin 's retirement and Demitra being held out of the lineup with injuries , he was moved to his natural center position and joined by wingers Mikael Samuelsson and Mason Raymond . His 26 power play points ranked second on the team to Henrik Sedin . Playing on the second power play unit , he earned many of his points controlling the puck along the half @-@ boards . He also averaged a career @-@ high 19 : 37 minutes of ice time per game , which ranked second among team forwards to Henrik Sedin . In the subsequent 2010 playoffs , Kesler notched a goal and nine assists in 12 games . After helping the Canucks eliminate the Los Angeles Kings in the first round , he played with a sore shoulder in the second round , as Vancouver were eliminated by the Blackhawks for the second consecutive year . An MRI did not reveal any serious injury . He admitted following the defeat to not having played his best during the playoffs . 
 Following the campaign , he was a Selke Tropy finalist for the second consecutive season , opposite Pavel Datsyuk and Jordan Staal of the Pittsburgh Penguins . He ranked second in the league to Datsyuk in takeaways with 83 , while blocking 73 shots and recording 95 hits . He lost the award as the first runner @-@ up with 655 voting points , compared to Datsyuk 's 688 . 
 Also in the off @-@ season , Luongo resigned his team captaincy . As Canucks management waited until the beginning of the 2010 – 11 season to announce his replacement , Kesler was seen by media and fans as a strong candidate , alongside Henrik Sedin . Henrik was eventually named captain prior to the season @-@ opener and Kesler retained his alternate captaincy . 
 The 2010 – 11 season marked an expanded focus on Kesler 's offensive role . He began the season playing on the power play with the Sedins , as part of an effort by the Canucks coaching staff to " load up " their first power play unit . Switching from being the primary puck @-@ controller on the second unit , he moved to the front of the net , screening the goalie and tipping pucks in . The off @-@ season acquisition of defensive specialist Manny Malhotra also liberated Kesler from a large portion of his defensive duties , such as playing against opposing team 's top forwards in a shutdown role . Two months into the campaign , Kesler notched his 100th career NHL goal in a 4 – 2 win against the Colorado Avalanche on November 24 , 2010 . He later earned his first NHL career hat @-@ trick , scoring all three of the Canucks ' goals in a 3 – 2 overtime win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on December 15 . Nearly a month later , he recorded a second hat trick against the Edmonton Oilers in a 6 – 1 win . On January 11 , 2011 , Kesler was named to his first NHL All @-@ Star Game ; he was one of three Canucks along with Daniel and Henrik Sedin . Kesler was chosen to be an alternate captain alongside Washington Capitals defenseman Mike Green representing Eric Staal 's team ; he went without a point as Team Staal was defeated by Team Nicklas Lidstrom 11 – 10 . Prior to the Canucks ' final home game of the regular season on April 7 , 2011 , Kesler was presented with the team 's Most Exciting Player Award , as voted by the fans . Playing the Minnesota Wild that night , he went on to record his third hat trick of the season , reaching the 40 @-@ goal plateau , as the Canucks won 5 – 0 . 
 Kesler finished the regular season with a career @-@ high 41 goals ; he added 32 assists for 73 points over 82 games , third among Canucks scorers . His efforts helped the Canucks to the franchise 's first Presidents ' Trophy . After opening the playoffs with a seven @-@ game , first @-@ round victory over the Blackhawks , the Canucks faced the Nashville Predators in the second round . Kesler recorded a point in 11 of the Canucks ' 14 goals in the series , leading them past the Predators in six games . He was one point short of Pavel Bure 's franchise record of most points in a playoff series ( Bure had 12 points in a seven @-@ game series against the Blues in 1995 ) . Playing the San Jose Sharks in the third round , Kesler appeared to injure either his left leg or groin while pursuing opposing defenceman Dan Boyle in the series ' deciding fifth game . After leaving the bench for several shifts , he returned to score the game @-@ tying goal , tipping a Henrik Sedin shot with 13 @.@ 2 seconds remaining in regulation . The Canucks went on to win in double @-@ overtime , advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals . Having suffered a torn labrum on the play , Kesler required cortisone shots to continue playing for the remainder of the playoffs ( his injury was not revealed until the off @-@ season , however ) . Prior to the Finals , he was believed by many in the media to be a leading candidate for the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP . Consequently , Kesler 's performance diminished in the Finals . Playing the Boston Bruins , the Canucks lost the series in seven games . After recording an assist on the game @-@ winning goal in Game 1 , he failed to register a point in the remaining six games , while also recording a -7 rating . With 19 points ( 7 goals and 12 assists ) over 25 games , he ranked third among Canucks scorers ( behind the Sedins ) and tied for sixth among NHL players overall . 
 A week after the Canucks ' Game 7 loss , Kesler was awarded the Selke Trophy after finishing as a runner @-@ up the previous two years . He received 1 @,@ 179 voting points in comparison to runners @-@ up Jonathan Toews ' 476 and Pavel Datsyuk 's 348 . Kesler was also ranked eighth in Hart Memorial Trophy voting as the league 's most valuable player . Later in the off @-@ season , Kesler underwent arthroscopic surgery for the torn labrum in his hip . Unrelated to his labrum tear in 2007 , he had adopted a program to recuperate from the injury naturally until a specialist advised him to have surgery in late @-@ July 2011 . The Canucks announced on August 2 that Kesler had successfully undergone the procedure , while it was also reported he would not be ready to play until mid @-@ October . On schedule , he returned to the lineup on October 18 against the New York Rangers after missing the first five games of the 2011 – 12 season . Appearing in 77 contests , Kesler recorded his lowest scoring total in four years with 22 goals , 27 assists and 49 points . On a team basis , the Canucks remained a successful regular season team , winning their second consecutive Presidents ' Trophy . They failed to defend their Western Conference playoff title , however , losing in the first round to the Los Angeles Kings in five games . Kesler recorded three assists in the series . 
 During the off @-@ season , it was revealed that Kesler had been playing with a shoulder injury since February 2012 . Suffering from a torn labrum , he underwent surgery for the injury in May . Initially expected to have recovered by mid @-@ November , his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late @-@ June . As a result , he made his 2012 – 13 season debut on February 15 , 2013 , in a 4 – 3 loss to the Dallas Stars . Due to the NHL lockout , which cancelled the first four months of the season , Kesler only missed 12 games . Within seven games , however , Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot . He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas , but subsequent X @-@ rays came back negative . After playing through the pain for several games , an additional CT scan revealed the fracture .

 On June 27 , 2014 , Kesler was traded to the Anaheim Ducks along with a third round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Nick Bonino , Luca Sbisa , a first and third round pick in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft . On July 15 , 2015 , Kesler signed a 6 @-@ year contract extension worth $ 41 @.@ 25 million . During October 2015 , Kesler was named an alternate captain of the Ducks .

 Throughout his career , Kesler has represented the United States at various international ice hockey tournaments . He first competed internationally at the 2001 World U @-@ 17 Hockey Challenge in New Glasgow and Truro , Nova Scotia where he helped the American team to a gold medal victory over Team Canada Pacific , finishing the tournament with one goal and five assists in six games . 
 Kesler participated in his first International Ice Hockey Federation @-@ sanctioned event at the 2002 IIHF World U18 Championships in Piešťany and Trnava , Slovakia . He finished the tournament with seven points in eight games , including two goals in a 10 – 3 defeat over Canada in the final round . The Americans won their first U18 title , with Kesler being awarded the Best Player Award for the tournament . Later that year , Kesler was named to the United States national junior team for the 2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Halifax and Sydney , Nova Scotia . He finished the tournament second in team scoring behind Zach Parise with seven points in seven games as the United States lost 3 – 2 to Finland in the bronze medal game . During the tournament , Kesler was twice named the United States ' player of the game — in their quarterfinal game versus the Czech Republic and in the bronze medal game versus Finland . 
 In December 2003 , Kesler was released by the Vancouver Canucks to play in the 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships , Kesler 's second World Junior tournament . Kesler scored two goals as the Americans went a perfect 4 – 0 to win Pool A and advance to the semifinals . There they defeated Finland 2 – 1 , the team that had defeated them in the previous year 's bronze medal game , to advance to the gold medal game versus Canada . In the gold medal game , Kesler scored the game @-@ tying goal 6 : 58 into the third period to even the score at 3 – 3 . After Canadian goaltender Marc @-@ André Fleury cleared the puck off of teammate <unk> Coburn and into his own net , the Americans took the lead 4 – 3 and went on to win their first IIHF World U20 Championship in the tournament 's history . Kesler 's play in the tournament was praised as he often took critical faceoffs and played on the Americans ' most offensive line despite suffering a facial injury early in the tournament . 
 Although having never played for the American national men 's team , Kesler was named to the orientation camp for the American team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin , Italy held from September 5 – 8 , 2005 in Colorado Springs , Colorado at World Arena . Kesler , one of the youngest players at the camp , did not make the final roster for the Games . Rather , Kesler made his national men 's team debut three months after the Olympics at the 2006 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships in Riga , Latvia . Kesler finished the tournament with one point in seven games , assisting on a Yan Stastny goal in the United States ' 3 – 0 victory versus Denmark . He was named the United States ' player of the game in their 6 – 0 quarter @-@ final loss against Sweden . 
 Having developed into a top defensive forward in recent seasons , Kesler was an early candidate to be selected to the American team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , the city in which he plays his NHL hockey . The United States played Canada in the final game of the preliminary round to determine top spot in the pool . With United States up by a goal in the final minute , Kesler dove past opposing forward Corey Perry to score an empty @-@ netter and secure the 5 – 3 win . In a rematch between the two teams in the gold medal game , Kesler scored in the second period on a deflection from Patrick Kane , ultimately losing by a score of 3 – 2 in overtime on Sidney Crosby 's game @-@ winning goal . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Kesler is known as a two @-@ way forward , capable of contributing both offensively and defensively . In his first few years in the NHL , he established his role as a shutdown forward , playing on the penalty kill and against opposing teams ' top players . He also earned a reputation as an agitator , trash @-@ talking and engaging opponents physically in between play . During the 2008 – 09 season , Kesler began adding a more offensive component to his game and was moved up to the Canucks ' second line from third . With an increased points total , he earned league recognition with his first Selke Trophy nomination as the NHL 's best defensive forward . He has since continued to improve his offensive skills while remaining defensively responsible . 
 Among his most prevalent skills are his speed and wrist shot , the latter of which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production . He is also proficient at taking faceoffs . On the penalty kill , he is an efficient shot blocker , using his body to get in the way of pucks . While competing on the powerplay , he often uses his size and strength to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots . 
 Kesler 's success as a player has been attributed to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players . Kesler has recognized , however , that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure . In the 2010 off @-@ season , Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus , maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players . During the subsequent 2010 – 11 campaign , he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career . Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father , wanting to set a mature example for his children when they watch him play .

 = Hurricane Humberto ( 2001 ) = 
 Hurricane Humberto was a moderately powerful hurricane that briefly affected Bermuda in September 2001 . It was the eighth named storm of the season , as well as the fourth hurricane . It formed on September 21 between Puerto Rico and Bermuda , partially related to previous Hurricane Gabrielle . Humberto passed about 140 miles ( 225 km ) west of Bermuda , which spared the island with its strongest winds . After weakening and believed to be on the verge of dissipating , Humberto unexpectedly restrengthened to the southeast of Atlantic Canada . The intensification was short @-@ lived and the storm dissipated on September 27 . There were a series of significant observational flights into the hurricane that produced a wealth of data on the structure of hurricanes . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Humberto originated from a trough that extended southwestward from Hurricane Gabrielle , which had previously moved across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean . The trough interacted with an upper @-@ level low , resulting in an increase of convection , or thunderstorms , in the region . A surface low developed on September 19 , and it gradually organized as it moved westward . After deep convection developed over the center , it is estimated the system reached tropical depression strength ( 39 miles per hour ( 63 km / h ) ) on September 21 , about halfway between Puerto Rico and Bermuda . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) first published an advisory on the storm at 11 AM EDT , identifying it as Tropical Depression Ten . Upon its formation , the depression moved northwestward toward a break in the mid @-@ level ridge . On satellite imagery , the depression looked well @-@ organized , with banding features , outflow , and convection , although Hurricane Hunters had difficulty locating a closed center of circulation . The unfavorable conditions were from the upper @-@ level low to its southwest , which was producing wind shear over the storm ; nevertheless , the NHC anticipated strengthening . 
 On September 22 , the surface circulation rapidly became better organized , and based on confirmation from the Hurricane Hunters , the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Humberto . Throughout its life , the storm was smaller than average , and as it moved around the subtropical ridge , it gradually intensified . Tropical Storm Humberto developed an eye feature on September 23 . Shortly thereafter , the storm reached hurricane status about 175 miles ( 285 km ) west @-@ southwest of Bermuda . After passing about 140 miles ( 225 km ) west of Bermuda , Hurricane Humberto turned more to the northeast , and reached Category 2 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . Subsequently , strong upper @-@ level westerlies began affecting the storm , which caused a marked decrease in intensity ; by September 25 , the winds decreased to 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , or minimal hurricane status . At that time , the NHC expected Humberto to continue weakening due to the shear , as well as steadily decreasing water temperatures . 
 Unexpectedly , the weakening trend stopped , as the steering winds came from the same direction behind the hurricane . It slowed down slightly , and on September 26 the eye of the hurricane became much more distinct . Humberto quickly re @-@ intensified and reached peak winds of 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) , while located about 200 miles ( 320 km ) south @-@ southeast of Sable Island , off the coast of Nova Scotia . Just as quickly it strengthened , the hurricane began weakening again . The eye became distorted as the convection became asymmetrical , due to the cooler waters and stronger westerlies . Initially , the NHC forecast Humberto to become extratropical . On September 27 , it turned more eastward and later to the east @-@ southeast , and Humberto weakening to tropical storm status about 400 miles ( 645 km ) southeast of Newfoundland . The cloud pattern became increasingly elongated and removed from the center , and late on the 27th , the circulation of Humberto degenerated into an open trough in the far northern Atlantic Ocean . The remnants were expected to be absorbed quickly by a larger extratropical storm to its north . 
 There were three major aircraft flights into the hurricane over a three @-@ day period which , according to NASA , " were the most comprehensive measurements of the structure of the hurricane ever recorded . " The flights were designed to obtain data for better hurricane forecasting . 
 = = Impact and naming = = 
 Prior to its passage by Bermuda , the National Hurricane Center advised the residents " should monitor the progress of Humberto until it is safely past . " On September 23 when the hurricane passed the island , the hurricane force winds extended 30 miles ( 50 km ) from the center , while tropical storm force winds only extended 105 miles ( 170 km ) from the center . As a result , Bermuda only experienced peak sustained winds of 27 mph ( 44 km / h ) , with gusts to 43 mph ( 69 km / h ) . During its passage , the island also recorded 1 @.@ 69 inches ( 4 @.@ 3 cm ) of rainfall . 
 Only two ships recorded tropical storm force winds , both of which were away from the center . Some higher surf was recorded along the New Jersey coastline . In September 2001 , two men sought to break the record for sailing the quickest time from New York to Melbourne , Australia ; Humberto disrupted their early path slightly , but they ultimately broke the record by 28 hours . Later in its path , there were several marine warnings issued for offshore Newfoundland , although no severe weather affected coastal Atlantic Canada . Overall , there were no reports of casualties or damage from the hurricane . 
 = Andrew Harclay , 1st Earl of Carlisle = 
 Andrew Harclay , 1st Earl of Carlisle ( ca . 1270 – 3 March 1323 ) , alternatively Andreas de Harcla , was an important English military leader in the borderlands with Scotland during the reign of Edward II . Coming from a knightly family in Westmorland , he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland in 1311 . He distinguished himself in the Scottish Wars , and in 1315 repulsed a siege on Carlisle Castle by Robert the Bruce . Shortly after this , he was taken captive by the Scots , and only released after a substantial ransom had been paid . His greatest achievement came in 1322 , when he defeated the rebellious baron Thomas of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 – 17 March . For this he was created Earl of Carlisle . 
 As one of the main military leaders on the border to Scotland , Harclay became frustrated with Edward II 's inactivity , particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322 , which made it clear that the war could not be won . Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord , and on 3 January 1323 , he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce . The act was without royal sanction , and amounted to treason . The king issued an arrest order for the earl , and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king 's custody . He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March , denied a hearing , and executed the same day . He was hanged , drawn and quartered , and the various parts of his body displayed in different parts of the country . Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial , but the conviction for treason was never annulled . 
 = = Family @-@ background and early career = = 
 The family name of Harclay derives from Hartley in Westmorland . Though relatively little is known about his early years , Andrew Harclay was probably the eldest son of Sir Michael Harclay and Joan , daughter of the Yorkshire landowner William Fitzjohn . His younger brother was the theologian Henry Harclay , a Chancellor of the University of Oxford . Michael Harclay was a retainer of the Clifford family , and served as sheriff of Cumberland from 1285 to 1296 . The first documented appearance of Andrew Harclay was at a Westmorland eyre in 1292 , at which point it must be assumed that he was at least twenty @-@ one years old , and therefore born in the early 1270s . 
 = = Military career = = 
 His military career can be traced back as far as 1304 when he took part in a campaign in the Scottish Wars . In 1309 , he received a royal order to assist Robert de Clifford in the defence of the Marches against Scotland . His standing in local affairs was further advanced in 1311 , when he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland , like his father had been before him . This was followed by his election as Knight of the Shire in 1312 , and in December 1313 , he distinguished himself as the leader of the defence against a Scottish invasion . He received further acclaim in the summer of 1315 , when he successfully defended Carlisle Castle against a siege by Robert the Bruce . For this he was awarded a gift of 1000 marks from the king . 
 Late in 1315 or in 1316 , Harclay was taken captive by the Scots , who demanded 2000 marks in ransom . His meteoric rise over the previous years had made him some enemies in local society , who now took the opportunity to spread slanderous rumours about him at court . The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay 's freedom , but for the next few years he seems to have been out of royal favour . It was not until 1319 that he once more was appointed sheriff , and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles , and Warden of the West Marches . In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament . 
 = = Boroughbridge = = 
 Harclay 's most prominent achievement came with the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322 . The battle was the culmination of an ongoing struggle between King Edward II and his most powerful earl , Thomas of Lancaster . The conflict stemmed from disagreement over the handling of the war with Scotland ; Lancaster , and many others , found the king 's war effort lacking . After failing to incite an insurrection against the king , Lancaster was in March 1322 fleeing northwards from the royal army . Meanwhile , Harclay , as sheriff of Cumberland , was ordered by the king to levy the forces of the northern counties of Cumberland and Westmorland , and move south . His orders were to meet up with the royal army , but while stopping at the town of Ripon in Yorkshire , he received intelligence that Lancaster would arrive at nearby Boroughbridge the next day . Harclay decided to take the initiative , and occupy the bridge that would prevent Lancaster 's passage across the River Ure . 
 Lancaster 's army arrived at Boroughbridge on 16 March . The rebels were greatly outnumbered ; while Harclay commanded around 4000 men , Lancaster only had some 700 knights and men @-@ at @-@ arms , with followers , in his service . In addition to this , the loyalist forces were highly trained and experienced from the Scottish Wars . Harclay used tactics the English had learned from the Scots in these wars . The Lanercost Chronicle describes how Harclay employed the Scottish <unk> – a compact formation of infantrymen with pikes or spears , highly effective against Lancaster 's cavalry @-@ heavy forces . According to The Brut , Lancaster tried to persuade Harclay to join his side , in return for great rewards in land . Harclay had previously been a supporter of Lancaster , possibly also the earl 's retainer ; in 1318 , a general royal pardon for Lancaster and his adherents contained Harclay 's name . On this occasion , however , <unk> decided to remain loyal to the king , and turned down the earl 's offer . 
 The engagement was short and one @-@ sided . Lancaster 's plan was to charge across a ford in the river , while the Earl of Hereford – one of the few magnates who had remained loyal to Lancaster – crossed the bridge . Hereford was killed on the bridge , his companion Roger de Clifford , 2nd Baron de Clifford was badly wounded , and this advance failed . Lancaster , meanwhile , came under such heavy archery fire that he had to call off his attack . Defections during the night , combined with royal reinforcements , forced him to surrender the next day , and on 22 March he was executed . The king was greatly pleased with Harclay 's effort , and rewarded him lavishly . On 25 March , Harclay was created Earl of Carlisle , and given land worth 1000 marks a year . On 15 September , he was also made chief Warden of the Marches . 
 = = Treason = = 
 On 14 October 1322 , the English army was routed by the Scots , under the command of Robert the Bruce , at the Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire . The English commander , John of Brittany , Earl of Richmond , was taken prisoner , while the king himself barely escaped capture . It was the worst defeat the English had suffered in the wars since the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 . Harclay had received a summons to join the royal army , but had not been able to bring his troops south in time to come to the king 's rescue . The event convinced him that the war against Scotland could not be won under the leadership of the present king . Instead he entered into direct negotiations with the Scots , without the king 's sanction . On 3 January 1323 , he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce at Lochmaben . 
 The treaty recognised Scotland as an independent kingdom . It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40 @,@ 000 marks to the English , and that Edward should be allowed to choose a wife from his own family for Robert 's heir . Implied in the text , however , was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward , if necessary , to implement the terms of the treaty . It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions . More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce ; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce 's daughters . It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation , and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a difficult situation . 
 Though historians have generally shown understanding for Harclay 's actions , it is nevertheless common to refer to the event as " Harclay 's treason " . In the words of Maurice Keen : " To make a truce , or to indeed to give safe @-@ conducts or make any agreement with the king 's enemies without proper grant of powers , again constituted lèse majesté and can be found defined as such in other military cases " . Harclay had received such powers in February 1322 , but he was considered to have overstepped his prerogative by the 1323 treaty . It is also possible that Edward held a grudge against Harclay for the latter 's failure to come to the rescue at Byland , and that this was behind the king 's later , severe reaction . There is , however , no evidence that Harclay received the royal letter in time to arrive at the battlefield any earlier than he did . 
 = = Death and aftermath = = 
 When Edward found out about Harclay 's treason , he issued an order for the earl 's arrest . As Harclay attempted to garner support for his cause , the king began to fortify the northern castles . The stalemate lasted until 25 February , when Sir Anthony Lucy arrested the earl at Carlisle Castle . Lucy , who acted with only a small force , was clearly trusted by Harclay , so the arrest must have been conducted as a surprise manoeuvre . The enmity between Lucy and Harclay could stem from a dispute over the honour of <unk> . In 1322 , Harclay had also briefly disseised Lucy of his lands after the 1322 rebellion , even though Lucy had taken no part in that event . 
 On 3 March , Harclay was arraigned before a royal justice in Carlisle , but was denied a proper hearing . He was brought forward apparelled in his robes of estate as a knight and earl . His spurs of knighthood were hewed off , and his sword was broken over his head . He was stripped of his robes , and proclaimed to be no knight , but a knave . He was then convicted as a traitor , and condemned to be hanged , drawn and quartered . He behaved with dignity at his execution , where he maintained that he had acted as he did out of concern for the best interest of the country . After his death , his head was taken to the king at Knaresborough in Yorkshire , before it was hung up on London Bridge . The four parts of his body were dispersed around the country , and displayed in Carlisle , Newcastle , Bristol , and Dover . 
 Harclay 's head was on display in London for five years before it was taken down . His sister petitioned the king to return the various parts of the body for a Christian burial , and in 1328 her request was granted . Further <unk> were not awarded . In the reign of Edward III , Harclay 's nephew Henry petitioned to have the charge of treason annulled , but the petition was ignored . As for the peace treaty , the wisdom of Harclay 's policy was vindicated after his death . Edward II 's inability to win the war against the Scots , combined with his refusal to give up his claim on the Scottish crown , proved untenable in the end . Furthermore , it was Harclay 's military skills and well @-@ organised forces that gave what little protection the northern borders had over the previous years . Less than three months after Harclay 's execution , Edward agreed on a thirteen @-@ year truce with Scotland .

 = Olivier Messiaen = 
 Olivier Messiaen ( French : [ <unk> <unk> ̃ ] ; December 10 , 1908 – April 27 , 1992 ) was a French composer , organist , and ornithologist , one of the major composers of the 20th century . His music is rhythmically complex ; harmonically and melodically it often uses modes of limited transposition , which he abstracted from his early compositions and improvisations . Messiaen also drew on his Roman Catholic faith for his pieces . 
 He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences such as Japanese music , the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi . He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords ( a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation ) ; combinations of these colours , he said , were important in his compositional process . For a short period Messiaen experimented with the <unk> associated with " total serialism " , in which field he is often cited as an innovator . His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan ( tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works ) . 
 Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas , Maurice Emmanuel , Charles @-@ Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré , among others . He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte @-@ Trinité in Paris in 1931 , a post held until his death . He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s . On the fall of France in 1940 , Messiaen was made a prisoner of war , during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps ( " Quartet for the end of time " ) for the four available instruments — piano , violin , cello and clarinet . The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards . He was appointed professor of harmony soon after his release in 1941 , and professor of composition in 1966 at the Paris Conservatoire , positions he held until his retirement in 1978 . His many distinguished pupils included Quincy Jones , Pierre Boulez , Karlheinz Stockhausen and Yvonne Loriod , who became his second wife . 
 He found birdsong fascinating , notating bird songs worldwide and incorporating birdsong transcriptions into his music . His innovative use of colour , his conception of the relationship between time and music , and his use of birdsong are among the features that make Messiaen 's music distinctive . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Youth and studies = = = 
 Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen was born December 10 , 1908 in Avignon , France , into a literary family . He was the elder of two sons of Cécile Sauvage , a poet , and Pierre Messiaen , a teacher of English who translated the plays of William Shakespeare into French . Messiaen 's mother published a sequence of poems , L <unk> en <unk> ( " The Budding Soul " ) , the last chapter of <unk> que la terre <unk> ( " As the Earth Turns " ) , which address her unborn son . Messiaen later said this sequence of poems influenced him deeply and he cited it as prophetic of his future artistic career . 
 At the outbreak of World War I , Pierre Messiaen enlisted and Cécile took their two boys to live with her brother in Grenoble . There Messiaen became fascinated with drama , reciting Shakespeare to his brother with the help of a home @-@ made toy theatre with translucent backdrops made from old cellophane wrappers . At this time he also adopted the Roman Catholic faith . Later , Messiaen felt most at home in the Alps of the Dauphiné , where he had a house built south of Grenoble where he composed most of his music . 
 He took piano lessons having already taught himself to play . His interest included the recent music of French composers Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel , and he asked for opera vocal scores for Christmas presents . Around this time he began to compose . In 1918 his father returned from the war and the family moved to Nantes . He continued music lessons ; one of his teachers , Jehan de <unk> , gave him a score of Debussy 's opera Pelléas et Mélisande , which Messiaen described as " a thunderbolt " and " probably the most decisive influence on me " . The following year Pierre Messiaen gained a teaching post in Paris . Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1919 , aged 11 . 
 At the Conservatoire , Messiaen made excellent academic progress . In 1924 , aged 15 , he was awarded second prize in harmony , having been taught in that subject by professor Jean Gallon . In 1925 he won first prize in piano accompaniment , and in 1926 he gained first prize in fugue . After studying with Maurice Emmanuel , he was awarded second prize for the history of music in 1928 . Emmanuel 's example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes . After showing improvisation skills on the piano Messiaen studied organ with Marcel Dupré . Messiaen gained first prize in organ playing and improvisation in 1929 . After a year studying composition with Charles @-@ Marie Widor , in autumn 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed Paul Dukas . Messiaen 's mother died of tuberculosis shortly before the class began . Despite his grief , he resumed his studies , and in 1930 Messiaen won first prize in composition . 
 While a student he composed his first published works — his eight Préludes for piano ( the earlier Le banquet céleste was published subsequently ) . These exhibit Messiaen 's use of his modes of limited transposition and palindromic rhythms ( Messiaen called these non @-@ retrogradable rhythms ) . His public début came in 1931 with his orchestral suite Les offrandes oubliées . That year he first heard a gamelan group , sparking his interest in the use of tuned percussion . 
 = = = La Trinité , La jeune France , and Messiaen 's war = = = 
 In the autumn of 1927 , Messiaen joined Dupré 's organ course . Dupré later wrote that Messiaen , having never seen an organ console , sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument , and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach 's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard . From 1929 , Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte @-@ Trinité , Paris , for the organist Charles <unk> , who was ill at the time . The post became vacant in 1931 when <unk> died , and Dupré , Charles <unk> and Widor among others supported Messiaen 's candidacy . His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor . The appointment was confirmed in 1931 , and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years . He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s . In 1932 , he composed the Apparition de l 'église <unk> for organ . 
 He married the violinist and composer Claire Delbos also in 1932 . Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play ( Thème et variations for violin and piano in the year they were married ) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness , including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936 , which he orchestrated in 1937 . Mi was Messiaen 's affectionate nickname for his wife . In 1937 their son Pascal was born . The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation and spent the rest of her life in mental institutions . 
 In 1936 , along with André Jolivet , Daniel @-@ <unk> and Yves <unk> , Messiaen formed the group La jeune France ( " Young France " ) . Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected Jean Cocteau 's 1918 Le coq et l <unk> in favour of a " living music , having the impetus of sincerity , generosity and artistic conscientiousness " . Messiaen 's career soon departed from this polemical phase . 
 In response to a commission for a piece to accompany light @-@ and @-@ water shows on the Seine during the Paris Exposition , in 1937 Messiaen demonstrated his interest in using the ondes Martenot , an electronic instrument , by composing Fêtes des belles eaux for an ensemble of six . He included a part for the instrument in several of his subsequent compositions . During this period he composed several multi @-@ movement organ works . He arranged his orchestral suite L <unk> ( " The Ascension " ) for organ , replacing the orchestral version 's third movement with an entirely new movement , Transports de joie d 'une âme devant la <unk> du Christ qui est la <unk> ( " <unk> of a soul before the glory of Christ which is the soul 's own " ) ( listen ) . He also wrote the extensive cycles La Nativité du Seigneur ( " The Nativity of the Lord " ) and Les corps <unk> ( " The glorious bodies " ) . 
 At the outbreak of World War II , Messiaen was drafted into the French army . Due to poor eyesight , he was enlisted as a medical auxiliary rather than an active combatant . He was captured at Verdun and taken to Görlitz in May 1940 , and was imprisoned at Stalag VIII @-@ A. He met a violinist , a cellist and a clarinettist among his fellow prisoners . He wrote a trio for them , which he gradually incorporated into his Quatuor pour la fin du temps ( " Quartet for the End of Time " ) . The Quartet was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards , with the composer playing a poorly maintained upright piano in freezing conditions . Thus the enforced introspection and reflection of camp life bore fruit in one of 20th @-@ century European classical music 's acknowledged masterpieces . The title 's " end of time " alludes to the Apocalypse , and also to the way in which Messiaen , through rhythm and harmony , used time in a manner completely different from his predecessors and contemporaries . 
 = = = Tristan and serialism = = = 
 Shortly after his release from Görlitz in May 1941 , Messiaen was appointed a professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire , where he taught until his retirement in 1978 . He compiled his Technique de mon langage musical ( " Technique of my musical language " ) published in 1944 , in which he quotes many examples from his music , particularly the Quartet . Although only in his mid @-@ thirties , his students described him as an outstanding teacher . Among his early students were the composers Pierre Boulez and Karel Goeyvaerts . Other pupils included Karlheinz Stockhausen in 1952 , Alexander Goehr in 1956 – 57 , Tristan <unk> in 1967 – 72 and George Benjamin during the late 1970s . The Greek composer Iannis Xenakis was referred to him in 1951 ; Messiaen urged Xenakis to take advantage of his background in mathematics and architecture in his music . 
 In 1943 , Messiaen wrote Visions de l 'Amen ( " Visions of the Amen " ) for two pianos for Yvonne Loriod and himself to perform . Shortly thereafter he composed the enormous solo piano cycle Vingt regards sur l 'enfant @-@ Jésus ( " Twenty gazes upon the child Jesus " ) for her . Again for Loriod , he wrote Trois petites liturgies de la <unk> divine ( " Three small liturgies of the Divine Presence " ) for female chorus and orchestra which includes a difficult solo piano part . 
 Two years after Visions de l 'Amen , Messiaen composed the song cycle Harawi , the first of three works inspired by the legend of Tristan and Isolde . The second of these works about human ( as opposed to divine ) love was the result of a commission from Serge Koussevitzky . Messiaen stated that the commission did not specify the length of the work or the size of the orchestra . This was the ten @-@ movement Turangalîla @-@ Symphonie . It is not a conventional symphony , but rather an extended meditation on the joy of human union and love . It does not contain the sexual guilt inherent in Richard Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde because Messiaen believed that sexual love is a divine gift . The third piece inspired by the Tristan myth was Cinq <unk> for twelve unaccompanied singers , described by Messiaen as influenced by the alba of the troubadours . Messiaen visited the United States in 1949 , where his music was conducted by Koussevitsky and Leopold Stokowski . His Turangalîla @-@ Symphonie was first performed in the US in 1949 , conducted by Leonard Bernstein . 
 Messiaen taught an analysis class at the Paris Conservatoire . In 1947 he taught ( and performed with Loriod ) for two weeks in Budapest . In 1949 he taught at Tanglewood . Beginning in summer 1949 he taught in the new music summer school classes at Darmstadt . While he did not employ the twelve @-@ tone technique , after three years teaching analysis of twelve @-@ tone scores , including works by Arnold Schoenberg , he experimented with ways of making scales of other elements ( including duration , articulation and dynamics ) analogous to the chromatic pitch scale . The results of these innovations was the " Mode de valeurs et d 'intensités " for piano ( from the Quatre études de rythme ) which has been misleadingly described as the first work of total serialism . It had a large influence on the earliest European serial composers including Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen . During this period he also experimented with musique concrète , music for recorded sounds . 
 = = = Birdsong and the 1960s = = = 
 When in 1952 Messiaen was asked to provide a test piece for flautists wishing to enter the Paris Conservatoire , he composed the piece Le merle noir for flute and piano . While he had long been fascinated by birdsong , and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works ( for example La Nativité , Quatuor and Vingt regards ) , the flute piece was based entirely on the song of the blackbird . 
 He took this development to a new level with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux — its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura . From this period onwards , Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter ( for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d 'oiseaux completed in 1958 , and La fauvette des jardins of 1971 ) . Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer , and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist . 
 Messiaen 's first wife died in 1959 after a long illness , and in 1961 he married Loriod . He began to travel widely , to attend musical events and to seek out and transcribe the songs of more exotic birds in the wild . Loriod frequently assisted her husband 's detailed studies of birdsong while walking with him , by making tape recordings for later reference . In 1962 he visited Japan , where <unk> music and Noh theatre inspired the orchestral " Japanese sketches " , Sept <unk> , which contain stylised imitations of traditional Japanese instruments . 
 Messiaen 's music was by this time championed by , among others , Pierre Boulez , who programmed first performances at his Domaine musical concerts and the Donaueschingen festival . Works performed included Réveil des oiseaux , Chronochromie ( commissioned for the 1960 festival ) and Couleurs de la cité céleste . The latter piece was the result of a commission for a composition for three trombones and three xylophones ; Messiaen added to this more brass , wind , percussion and piano , and specified a xylophone , xylorimba and marimba rather than three xylophones . Another work of this period , Et <unk> resurrectionem mortuorum , was commissioned as a commemoration of the dead of the two World Wars and was performed first semi @-@ privately in the Sainte @-@ Chapelle , then publicly in Chartres Cathedral with Charles de Gaulle in the audience . 
 His reputation as a composer continued to grow and in 1959 , he was nominated as an Officier of the Légion d 'honneur . In 1966 he was officially appointed professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire , although he had in effect been teaching composition for years . Further honours included election to the Institut de France in 1967 and the Académie des beaux @-@ arts in 1968 , the Erasmus Prize in 1971 , the award of the Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal and the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1975 , the Sonning Award ( Denmark 's highest musical honour ) in 1977 , the Wolf Prize in Arts in 1982 , and the presentation of the Croix de Commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown in 1980 .

 Messiaen 's next work was the large @-@ scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus @-@ Christ . The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100 @-@ voice ten @-@ part choir , seven solo instruments and large orchestra . Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ 's Transfiguration . Shortly after its completion , Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial . He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972 , and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah , where he observed the canyon 's distinctive colours and birdsong . The twelve @-@ movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles ... was the result , first performed in 1974 in New York . 
 In 1971 , he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra . While reluctant to undertake such a major project , he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint @-@ François d 'Assise . The composition was intensive ( he also wrote his own libretto ) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979 ; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983 . Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a " spectacle " rather than an opera . It was first performed in 1983 . Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction ( at times Messiaen himself believed so ) , but he continued to compose . In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces , Livre du Saint Sacrement ; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano , and works for piano with orchestra . 
 In the summer of 1978 , Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire . He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d 'honneur , the Grand @-@ Croix , in 1987 . An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978 , but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen 's 80th included a complete performance in London 's Royal Festival Hall of St. François , which the composer attended , and Erato 's publication of a seventeen @-@ CD collection of Messiaen 's music including a disc of the composer in conversation with Claude Samuel . 
 Although in considerable pain near the end of his life ( requiring repeated surgery on his back ) he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra , Éclairs sur l 'au @-@ delà ... , which was premièred six months after his death . He died in Paris on April 27 , 1992 . 
 On going through his papers , Loriod discovered that , in the last months of his life , he had been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to , namely herself , the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich , the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine <unk> ( hence the title Concert à quatre ) . Four of the five intended movements were substantially complete ; Yvonne Loriod undertook the orchestration of the second half of the first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from George Benjamin . It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994 . 
 = = Music = = 
 Messiaen 's music has been described as outside the western musical tradition , although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it . Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion , development and diatonic harmonic resolution . This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique — for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music . 
 His youthful love for the fairy @-@ tale element in Shakespeare prefigured his later expressions of Catholic liturgy . Messiaen was not interested in depicting aspects of theology such as sin ; rather he concentrated on the theology of joy , divine love and redemption . 
 Messiaen continually evolved new composition techniques , always integrating them into his existing musical style ; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition . For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time . However , very few of these major works lack new technical ideas — simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in Meditations , the invention of a new percussion instrument ( the <unk> ) for Des canyons aux <unk> ... , and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d 'Assise . 
 As well as discovering new techniques , Messiaen found and absorbed exotic music , including Ancient Greek rhythms , Hindu rhythms ( he encountered <unk> 's list of 120 rhythmic units , the <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , Balinese and Javanese Gamelan , birdsong , and Japanese music ( see Example 1 for an instance of his use of ancient Greek and Hindu rhythms ) . 
 While he was instrumental in the academic exploration of his techniques ( he compiled two treatises : the later one in five volumes was substantially complete when he died and was published posthumously ) , and was himself a master of music analysis , he considered the development and study of techniques to be a means to intellectual , aesthetic and emotional ends . Thus Messiaen maintained that a musical composition must be measured against three separate criteria : it must be interesting , beautiful to listen to , and it must touch the listener . 
 Messiaen wrote a large body of music for the piano . Although a considerable pianist himself , he was undoubtedly assisted by Yvonne Loriod 's formidable piano technique and ability to convey complex rhythms and rhythmic combinations ; in his piano writing from Visions de l 'Amen onwards he had her in mind . Messiaen said , " I am able to allow myself the greatest eccentricities because to her anything is possible . " 
 = = = Western artistic influences = = = 
 Developments in modern French music were a major influence on Messiaen , particularly the music of Claude Debussy and his use of the whole @-@ tone scale ( which Messiaen called Mode 1 in his modes of limited transposition ) . Messiaen very rarely used the whole @-@ tone scale in his compositions because , he said , after Debussy and Dukas there was " nothing to add " , but the modes he did use are all similarly symmetrical . 
 Messiaen had a great admiration for the music of Igor Stravinsky , particularly the use of rhythm in earlier works such as The Rite of Spring , and his use of colour . He was further influenced by the orchestral brilliance of Heitor Villa @-@ Lobos , who lived in Paris in the 1920s and gave acclaimed concerts there . Among composers for the keyboard , Messiaen singled out Jean @-@ Philippe Rameau , Domenico Scarlatti , Frédéric Chopin , Debussy and Isaac Albéniz . He loved the music of Modest Mussorgsky and incorporated varied modifications of what he called the " M @-@ shaped " melodic motif from Mussorgsky 's Boris Godunov , although he modified the final interval in this motif from a perfect fourth to a tritone ( Example 3 ) . 
 Messiaen was further influenced by Surrealism , as may be seen from the titles of some of the piano Préludes ( Un <unk> dans le vent ... , " A reflection in the wind " ) and in some of the imagery of his poetry ( he published poems as prefaces to certain works , for example Les offrandes oubliées ) . 
 = = = Colour = = = 
 Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen 's music . He believed that terms such as " tonal " , " modal " and " serial " are misleading analytical conveniences . For him there were no modal , tonal or serial compositions , only music with or without colour . He said that Claudio Monteverdi , Mozart , Chopin , Richard Wagner , Mussorgsky and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music . 
 In some of Messiaen 's scores , he notated the colours in the music ( notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles ... ) — the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience . The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen 's synaesthesia , which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music ( he said that he did not perceive the colours visually ) . In his multi @-@ volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme , de couleur , et d <unk> ( " Treatise of Rhythm , Colour and Birdsong " ) , Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords . His descriptions range from the simple ( " gold and brown " ) to the highly detailed ( " blue @-@ violet rocks , speckled with little grey cubes , cobalt blue , deep Prussian blue , highlighted by a bit of violet @-@ purple , gold , red , ruby , and stars of mauve , black and white . Blue @-@ violet is dominant " ) . 
 When asked what Messiaen 's main influence had been on composers , George Benjamin said , " I think the sheer ... colour has been so influential , ... rather than being a decorative element , [ Messiaen showed that colour ] could be a structural , a fundamental element , ... the fundamental material of the music itself . " 
 = = = Symmetry = = = 
 Many of Messiaen 's composition techniques made use of symmetries of time and pitch . 
 = = = = Time = = = = 
 From his earliest works , Messiaen used non @-@ retrogradable ( palindromic ) rhythms ( Example 2 ) . He sometimes combined rhythms with harmonic sequences in such a way that if the process were allowed to proceed indefinitely the music would eventually run through all the possible permutations and return to its starting point . For Messiaen , this represented the " charm of impossibilities " of these processes . He only ever presented a portion of any such process , as if allowing the informed listener a glimpse of something eternal . In the first movement of Quatuor pour la fin du temps the piano and cello together provide an early example . 
 = = = = Pitch = = = = 
 Messiaen used modes which he called modes of limited transposition . They are distinguished as groups of notes which can only be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times . For example , the whole @-@ tone scale ( Messiaen 's Mode 1 ) only exists in two transpositions : namely C – D – E – F ♯ – G ♯ – A ♯ and D ♭ – E ♭ – F – G – A – B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works . Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions , since for example Messiaen 's Mode 2 ( identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers ) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain . 
 = = = Time and rhythm = = = 
 As well as making use of non @-@ retrogradable rhythm and the Hindu <unk> @-@ <unk> , Messiaen also composed with " additive " rhythms . This involves lengthening individual notes slightly or interpolating a short note into an otherwise regular rhythm ( see Example 3 ) , or shortening or lengthening every note of a rhythm by the same duration ( adding a semiquaver to every note in a rhythm on its repeat , for example ) . This led Messiaen to use rhythmic cells that irregularly alternate between two and three units , a process which also occurs in Stravinsky 's The Rite of Spring , which Messiaen admired . 
 A factor that contributes to Messiaen 's suspension of the conventional perception of time in his music is the extremely slow tempos he often specifies ( the fifth movement <unk> à l <unk> de Jésus of Quatuor is actually given the tempo marking <unk> lent ) . Messiaen also used the concept of " chromatic durations " , for example in his Soixante @-@ quatre <unk> from Livre d <unk> ( listen ) , which is built from , in Messiaen 's words , " 64 chromatic durations from 1 to 64 <unk> [ thirty @-@ second notes ] — invested in groups of 4 , from the ends to the centre , forwards and backwards alternately — treated as a retrograde canon . The whole peopled with birdsong . " 
 = = = Harmony = = = 
 In addition to making harmonic use of the modes of limited transposition , he cited the harmonic series as a physical phenomenon which provides chords with a context which he felt to be missing in purely serial music . An example of Messiaen 's harmonic use of this phenomenon , which he called " resonance " , is the last two bars of his first piano Prélude , La <unk> ( " The dove " ) : the chord is built from harmonics of the fundamental base note E.
