 Paul Whitehouse voiced Thackery <unk> , the March Hare . Burton stated that because Whitehouse is a great comedic actor , a lot of his lines came from improvisation . 
 Timothy Spall voiced Bayard , the Bloodhound . Although Bayard does not appear in the book , a similar character named The Puppy is likely the inspiration for the character . 
 Michael Gough voiced Uilleam , the Dodo . Burton said that Gough was the first person he thought of for the role of the Dodo because he has " a full life quality to his voice " . The character only speaks three lines , that Gough recorded in a day . This would be Gough 's final acting role because he died the following year , aged 94 . Gough had previously portrayed the March Hare in the 1966 TV play of the book . 
 Christopher Lee voiced the Jabberwocky . While it only had two lines , Burton said that he felt Lee to be a good match for the iconic character because he is " an iconic guy " . For the character , Lee had originally tried to make his voice ' burble ' ( as described in the poem " Jabberwocky " ) . However , Tim Burton convinced him to use his actual voice , as he found it more intimidating . 
 Imelda Staunton voiced the Tall Flower Faces . Though there are many flowers that appear around Wonderland , only one of them speaks and one of them is clearly a caricature of Staunton . Staunton only speaks three lines that are heard very briefly at the beginning of the film . 
 Jim Carter voiced the Red Queen 's executioner . The Executioner only speaks one line and appears extremely briefly , though Carter also voiced several other servants to the Red Queen . 
 Frank Welker provided additional voices and vocal effects ; including roars of the Jabberwocky and Bandersnatch , squawks for the Jubjub bird , and Bayard barking . Rickman , Windsor , Fry , Gough , Lee , Staunton and Carter each took only a day to record their dialogue . 
 Burton and Bonham Carter 's children Billy and Nell made cameo appearances as a boy and baby at the dock in the end of the film . 
 = = Production = = 
 Tim Burton signed with Walt Disney Pictures to direct two films in Disney Digital 3D , which included Alice in Wonderland and his remake of Frankenweenie . Burton developed the story because he never felt an emotional tie to the original book . 
 He explained " the goal is to try to make it an engaging movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice . " On prior versions , Burton said " It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another , and I never really felt any real emotional connection . " His goal with the new movie is to give the story " some framework of emotional grounding " and " to try and make Alice feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events . " Burton focused on the poem " Jabberwocky " as part of his structure , and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name " Jabberwock " used in the poem . Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a " re @-@ imagining " . However , the idea of the climax of the story being Alice 's battle with the Queen 's champion , the Jabberwocky , was first added in the video game American McGee 's Alice , and the landscape , tower , weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the movie are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game . 
 This film was originally set to be released in 2009 but was pushed back to March 5 , 2010 . Principal photography was scheduled for May 2008 , but did not begin until September and concluded in three months . Scenes set in the Victorian era were shot at Torpoint and Plymouth from September 1 to October 14 . Two hundred and fifty local extras were chosen in early August . Locations included Antony House in Torpoint , Charlestown , Cornwall and the Barbican , however , no footage from the Barbican was used . Motion capture filming began in early October at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City , California , though the footage was later discarded . Filming also took place at Culver Studios . Burton said that he used a combination of live action and animation , without motion capture . He also noted that this was the first time he had filmed on a green screen . Filming of the green screen portions , comprising 90 % of the film , was completed after only 40 days . Many of the cast and crew felt nauseated as a result of the long hours surrounded by green , and Burton had lavender lenses fitted into his glasses to counteract the effect . Due to the constant need for digital effects to distort the actors ' physical appearances , such as the size of the Red Queen 's head or Alice 's height , visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston cited the film as being exhausting , saying it was " The biggest show I 've ever done , [ and ] the most creatively involved I 've ever been . " 
 Sony Pictures Imageworks designed the visual effects sequences . Burton felt 3D was appropriate to the story 's environment . Burton and Zanuck chose to film with conventional cameras , and convert the footage into 3D during post @-@ production ; Zanuck explained 3D cameras were too expensive and " clumsy " to use , and they felt that there was no difference between converted footage and those shot in the format . James Cameron , who released his 3D film Avatar in December 2009 , criticized the choice , stating , " It doesn 't make any sense to shoot in 2 @-@ D and convert to 3 @-@ D " .

 On February 12 , 2010 , major UK cinema chains , Odeon , Vue and Cineworld , had planned to boycott the film because of a reduction of the interval between cinema and DVD release from the usual 17 weeks to 12 ( possibly to avoid the release of the DVD clashing with the 2010 FIFA World Cup , which was Disney 's pretext for cutting short Alice 's theatrical run but UK exhibitors protested that Alice would be less threatened by the World Cup than other titles ) . A week after the announcement , Cineworld , who has a 24 % share of UK box office , chose to play the film on more than 150 screens . Cineworld 's chief executive Steve Wiener stated , " As leaders in 3D , we did not want the public to miss out on such a visual spectacle . As the success of Avatar has shown , there is currently a huge appetite for the 3D experience " . Shortly after , the Vue cinema chain also reached an agreement with Disney , but Odeon had still chosen to boycott in Britain , Ireland and Italy . On February 25 , 2010 Odeon had reached an agreement and decided to show the film on March 5 , 2010 . The Royal premiere took place at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on February 25 , 2010 for the fundraiser The Prince 's Foundation for Children and The Arts where the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended . It also did not affect their plans to show the film in Spain , Germany , Portugal and Austria . The film was released in the U.S. and UK , in both Disney Digital 3D and IMAX 3D , as well as regular theaters on March 5 , 2010 .

 On July 22 , 2009 , a teaser trailer from the Mad Hatter 's point of view was released on IGN but was shortly taken down because Disney claimed that the trailer was not supposed to be out yet . The teaser was also planned to premiere along with a trailer of Robert Zemeckis ' film adaptation of A Christmas Carol on July 24 , 2009 for G @-@ Force . The following day , the teaser trailer premiered at Comic @-@ Con but the trailer shown was different from the one that leaked . The ComicCon version didn 't have the Mad Hatter 's dialogue . Instead , it featured " Time to Pretend " by MGMT , and the clips shown were in different order than in the leaked version . The leaked version was originally to be shown to one of the three Facebook groups used to promote the film that had the most members . The groups used to promote the film are " The Loyal Subjects of the Red Queen " , " The Loyal Subjects of the White Queen " and " The Disloyal Subjects of the Mad Hatter " . 
 Also at ComicCon , props from the film were displayed in an " Alice in Wonderland " exhibit . Costumes featured in the exhibit included the Red Queen 's dress , chair , wig , spectacles and scepter ; the White Queen 's dress , wig and a small model of her castle ; the Mad Hatter 's suit , hat , wig , chair and table ; Alice 's dress and battle armor ( to slay the Jabberwocky ) .

 Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 52 % of critics have given the film a positive review based on 262 reviews ; the average score is 5 @.@ 7 / 10 . The consensus is : " Tim Burton 's Alice sacrifices the book 's minimal narrative coherence — and much of its heart — but it 's an undeniable visual treat " . Metacritic rated it 53 / 100 based on 38 reviews . 
 Todd McCarthy of Variety praised it for its " moments of delight , humor and <unk> " , but went on to say , " But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along , building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI @-@ heavy movies of the past few years " . Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter said " Burton has delivered a subversively witty , brilliantly cast , whimsically appointed dazzler that also manages to hit all the emotionally satisfying marks " , while as well praising its computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) , saying " Ultimately , it 's the visual landscape that makes Alice 's newest adventure so wondrous , as technology has finally been able to catch up with Burton 's endlessly fertile imagination . " Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said , " But Burton 's Disneyfied 3 @-@ D Alice in Wonderland , written by the girl @-@ power specialist Linda Woolverton , is a strange brew indeed : murky , diffuse , and meandering , set not in a Wonderland that pops with demented life but in a world called Underland that 's like a joyless , bombed @-@ out version of Wonderland . It looks like a CGI head trip gone post apocalyptic . In the film 's rather humdrum 3 @-@ D , the place doesn 't dazzle — it droops . " Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times awarded the film three out of four stars and wrote in his review that , " Alice plays better as an adult hallucination , which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails . " The market research firm CinemaScore found that audiences gave the film an average rating of " A- " . 
 Several reviews criticized the decision to turn Alice into a " colonialist entrepreneur " at the end of the film setting sail for China . Given Britain 's role in the First and Second Opium Wars during the Victorian era and the foreign domination of China through " unequal treaties " , China expert Kevin <unk> writes , " Not only is it troubling imagery , for a female role model in a Disney movie , but it 's also a celebration of the exploitation that China suffered for a century . " 
 Game developer American McGee , best known for creating Alice and Alice : Madness Returns , was asked in a 2011 interview about Tim Burton 's interpretation of the title character since both versions share almost similar dark and twisted tone of Wonderland . McGee praised the film 's visuals and audio but criticized the lack of screen time Alice had compared to the other characters . He felt Alice did not have any purpose in the story and that she was merely used as a " tool . "

 = Soviet cruiser Kalinin = 
 Kalinin ( Russian : <unk> ) was a Project 26bis2 Kirov @-@ class cruiser of the Soviet Navy that was built during World War II . She was built in Siberia from components shipped from European Russia . She saw no action during the war and served into the Cold War . Her post @-@ war career was uneventful until she was disarmed and converted into a floating barracks in 1960 . She was sold for scrap in 1963 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Kalinin was 187 m ( 613 ft 6 in ) long at the waterline , and 191 @.@ 2 m ( 627 ft 4 in ) long overall . She had a beam of 17 @.@ 66 m ( 57 ft 11 in ) and had a draft between 5 @.@ 88 to 6 @.@ 3 m ( 19 ft 3 in to 20 ft 8 in ) . Kalinin displaced 8 @,@ 400 tonnes ( 8 @,@ 267 long tons ) at standard load and 10 @,@ 040 tonnes ( 9 @,@ 881 long tons ) at full load . Her geared steam turbines produced a total of 126 @,@ 900 shaft horsepower ( 94 @,@ 629 kW ) on trials , but she fell somewhat short of her designed speed of 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) , only reaching 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) on trials , because she was over 1 @,@ 200 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 181 long tons ) overweight . The ship normally carried 650 tonnes ( 640 long tons ) of fuel oil , 1 @,@ 660 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 634 long tons ) at full load and 1 @,@ 750 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 722 long tons ) at overload . This gave her an endurance of 5 @,@ 590 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 350 km ; 6 @,@ 430 mi ) at 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) with overload fuel . 
 Kalinin carried nine 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) 57 @-@ caliber B @-@ 1 @-@ P guns in three electrically powered MK @-@ 3 @-@ 180 triple turrets . The turrets were very small ; they were designed to fit into the limited hull space available and were so cramped that their rate of fire was much lower than designed — only two rounds per minute instead of six . The guns were mounted in a single cradle to minimize space and were so close together that their shot dispersion was very high because the muzzle blast from adjacent barrels affected each gun . Unlike her half @-@ sisters built in European Russia , her secondary armament initially consisted of eight single 76 @.@ 2 mm ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) 55 @-@ caliber 34 @-@ K anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns mounted on each side of the rear funnel because the 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) B @-@ 34 guns originally intended to be used had run into production problems . The 34 @-@ K guns were a stop @-@ gap until the Army 85 mm ( 3 @.@ 3 in ) 52 @-@ K anti @-@ aircraft gun could be mated with the mount of the 34 @-@ K and put into production as the 90 @-@ K. They replaced the 34 @-@ K guns in May 1943 . Light AA guns initially consisted of six semi @-@ automatic 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) 21 @-@ K AA guns with 600 rounds per gun , ten fully automatic 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 70 @-@ K AA guns with a thousand rounds per gun , and six DK 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) machine guns with 12 @,@ 500 rounds per gun , but were significantly increased during the war . By 1945 Kalinin had exchanged her 45 mm guns for nine additional 70 @-@ K AA guns . By 1957 her light anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of only nine powered 37 mm V @-@ 11 mounts . 
 Six 533 @-@ millimeter ( 21 in ) 39 @-@ Yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings , one on each side . She received the Lend @-@ Lease ASDIC @-@ 132 sonar system , which the Soviets called Drakon @-@ 132 , as well as the experimental Soviet Mars @-@ 72 system . 
 As built Kalinin lacked any radars , but by 1944 she was equipped with British and American Lend @-@ Lease radars as well as Soviet @-@ designed systems . A British Type 291 and an American SG radar were used for air search .

 Kalinin was one of the Project 26bis2 cruisers , the third pair of the Kirov @-@ class cruisers . She was larger and had a more powerful anti @-@ aircraft armament than her half @-@ sisters . She was assembled at the newly constructed Shipyard 199 , Komsomolsk @-@ on @-@ Amur , from components built at the Shipyard 198 ( Marti South ) in Nikolayev . She was laid down on 12 August 1938 , launched from drydock on 8 May 1942 and was completed on 31 December 1942 after being towed down the Amur River to Vladivostok . Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories . For example , her propellers had to be shipped from Leningrad after it had been surrounded by the Germans and her propeller shafts had to be removed from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad in 1942 before it was destroyed by the Germans . 
 She was commissioned into the Pacific Fleet in 1943 . She was ordered to prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage . They included the installation of special propellers with removable blades and the strengthening of her hull to withstand ice pressure . The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943 , but the alterations remained in place until 1944 . She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945 . 
 Kalinin hosted the State Commissariat for Defence ( Russian : Narodnyy <unk> <unk> — NKO ) during their visit to the Pacific Fleet in October 1954 and demonstrated her main guns while they were aboard . She spent the post @-@ war period on routine training missions until she was placed in reserve on 1 May 1956 . She was reactivated on 1 December 1957 before being disarmed and converted into floating barracks PKZ @-@ 21 on 6 February 1960 . Kalinin was finally sold for scrap on 12 April 1963 . 
 = Battle of Longue @-@ Pointe = 
 The Battle of Longue @-@ Pointe was an attempt by Ethan Allen and a small force of American and Quebec militia to capture Montreal from British forces on September 25 , 1775 , early in the American Revolutionary War . Allen , who had been instructed only to raise militia forces among the local inhabitants , had long had thoughts of taking the lightly defended city . When he reached the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River with about 110 men , he seized the opportunity to try . Major John Brown , who Allen claimed was supposed to provide additional forces , did not appear as they had planned , isolating Allen and his men on the north side of the river . 
 British General Guy Carleton sent a force composed mostly of Quebec militia in response to news of Allen 's crossing of the St. Lawrence . This force cut off Allen 's escape route , and eventually surrounded and captured Allen and a number of his men . Carleton eventually abandoned Montreal , which fell without battle to Continental Army forces on November 13 . Allen was sent first to England and then New York City as a prisoner , and was eventually exchanged in 1778 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 18th century , the city of Montreal occupied only a small portion of the island of Montreal , centered on what is now called Old Montreal . The eastern tip of the island was called Longue @-@ Pointe , and there was at one time a fortification called Fort Longue Pointe on the island , across the river from Longueuil . This area , annexed to Montreal in 1910 , and now the Mercier @-@ Est neighborhood of Mercier @-@ Hochelaga @-@ Maisonneuve , a borough of the city , is near where the action described here took place . 
 With the American Revolutionary War beginning , many thought it would be easy to spread the rebellion to the Province of Quebec , which had only been conquered by the British in 1759 , and whose population was seen as resentful of British rule . The American invasion of Quebec began with the arrival at Île aux Noix of the Continental Army under the command of General Philip Schuyler on September 4 , 1775 . Schuyler , who was ill at the time , eventually turned command of the army over the General Richard Montgomery , who ordered the army to besiege Fort Saint @-@ Jean , which they did on September 18 . At this fort , south of Montreal on the Richelieu River , General Guy Carleton had concentrated the few British regulars at his disposal following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May . 
 = = = American situation = = = 
 Before turning command over to Montgomery , Schuyler drafted a proclamation addressed to the people of Quebec , encouraging them to oppose the British and assist the American cause . On September 8 Ethan Allen and Major John Brown went into the countryside between Saint @-@ Jean and Montreal with a small detachment of Americans to circulate this proclamation , meeting with James Livingston , a Patriot sympathizer at Chambly as well as with the local Caughnawaga Mohawk . Livingston eventually raised about 300 local militia , which he encamped at Pointe @-@ Olivier , below Fort Chambly . Allen and Brown returned to Île aux Noix following this tour . 
 Allen had long harboured the goal of taking Montreal . After he and Benedict Arnold captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775 , he had taken a few hundred men north from Ticonderoga to Saint @-@ Jean with the idea of capturing the fort there by surprise , and then taking Montreal . This effort was frustrated by the timely arrival of British troops at Saint @-@ Jean ; the exploit made Allen a well @-@ known figure in Montreal and the Richelieu valley . 
 = = = Montreal situation = = = 
 Following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775 , General Carleton , with only 800 regular troops available to defend the entire province , had concentrated those troops at Fort Saint @-@ Jean , placing about 500 troops , along with about 250 militia and natives , at the fort . The remaining forces were distributed among the frontier forts along the Great Lakes , with relatively small garrisons at Montreal , Trois @-@ Rivières , and Quebec City . During the summer of 1775 he attempted to raise substantial additional militia forces from the population . These attempts met with limited success , in part because of successful American propaganda and agitation by Patriot sympathizers , especially Thomas Walker , James Price , and James Livingston . By July , Carleton was apparently satisfied with the level of militia support near Montreal , but he did little to stop the activities of the agitators , who also sent reports detailing British military preparations to the Americans . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 When Montgomery finally began the siege of Fort Saint @-@ Jean , he ordered Allen and about 30 Americans to join with Livingston 's Canadians to secure the south bank of the St. Lawrence River against attempts by Carleton in Montreal to relieve the siege . He also ordered a larger force under Brown 's command to secure the area north of the fort , and to cover the road between Saint @-@ Jean and Montreal . 
 Allen traveled along the southeastern banks of the Richelieu River , up to Sorel , where he crossed that river and continued up the southern shore of the St. Lawrence to Longueuil . According to Allen 's account , he met Brown there , and the two of them then hatched a plan to attack Montreal . Brown would cross the river with 200 men at La Prairie , upriver from Montreal , and Allen , with his Americans and 80 Canadians under the command of Loiseau and Duggan , two of Livingston 's captains , would cross the river at Longueuil , below the city , and the two forces would , after a prearranged signal , converge on the city itself . 
 = = Action = = 
 Allen and his men crossed the St. Lawrence on the night of the 24th , landing at Longue @-@ Pointe . The inhabitants he met there were friendly , but he posted guards on the road to Montreal to prevent news of their crossing from reaching the city . However , one man they detained managed to escape to the city and inform Carleton of Allen 's presence on the island . Brown did not cross the river . While no sources indicate why Brown failed to act , historian Justin Smith suggests that Allen in fact acted alone , and only later sought to blame Brown for the endeavour 's failure . This left Allen 's force alone and vulnerable , as it had taken three round trips with the available boats to ferry his men across the river . 
 Realizing he would not be able ferry everyone back across the river before troops arrived from the city , Allen chose a wooded area near the Ruisseau @-@ des @-@ <unk> ( labelled on the map above as Ruisseau de la <unk> Prairie ) , between Longue @-@ Pointe and Montreal , to make a stand . He also sent word to Thomas Walker , a British merchant and known Patriot sympathizer with a house in nearby L 'Assomption , for assistance . Walker was able to muster some men , but Allen was captured before they could lend any assistance . 
 When General Carleton received word that the notorious Ethan Allen was at the gates of the city , he raised the alarm . As the news spread , large numbers of people turned out . Captain John Campbell assembled a force of 34 regulars from the 26th Foot ( the entire garrison in Montreal ) , 120 Canadien and 80 English militia , 20 British Indian agents , and a few Indians , and led them out to face Allen 's force . As Campbell 's force approached , Allen instructed 10 Canadians to cover his left flank , while Duggan and another 50 Canadians were placed on the right flank . Both of these detachments fled instead of holding their positions , leaving Allen with about 50 men . Over the course of the next 90 minutes , fire was exchanged between the forces . Allen 's remaining forces were eventually broken , and , after trying to outrun the enemy , he surrendered . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The abortive attack on Montreal led to the full mobilization of local militia in Montreal , raising nearly 1 @,@ 000 men , but they soon began to drift away . Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint @-@ Jean , and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes . In November , the besieged fort 's commander capitulated , opening the Americans ' way to Montreal . Carleton fled the city , making his way to Quebec City , and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13 . 
 Allen and the other captives were brought to the city . Allen , in his account of the encounter , claims that Colonel Richard Prescott was intent on killing the captured Canadiens , but Allen interceded on their behalf , saying " I am the sole cause of their taking up arms . " Allen was imprisoned in a ship 's hold , and eventually sent to England . He spent about a year , mostly on prison ships , before he was released on parole in British @-@ occupied New York City in November 1776 , as the British authorities feared hanging him would create a martyr . He was eventually exchanged in May 1778 for Archibald Campbell , a British officer , and resumed military and political service for the nascent Republic of Vermont in 1778 . 
 Thomas Walker , the merchant to whom Allen had applied for assistance , was arrested in early October 1775 when twenty regulars and a dozen militia came from Montreal to his house in L 'Assomption . Walker 's house was destroyed , and he was imprisoned with the intent of sending him to England for trial . Walker was eventually freed when the Americans captured Montreal and most of the British fleet trying to escape the city .

 Ethan Allen wrote a memoir recounting his version of the circumstances of his capture , and the time of his imprisonment .

 = Her Story ( video game ) = 
 Her Story is an interactive movie video game written and directed by Sam Barlow . It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows , OS X and iOS . In the game , players search and sort through a database of video clips from fictional police interviews , and use the clips to solve the case of a missing man . The police interviews focus on the man 's wife , Hannah Smith , portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert . 
 The game is Barlow 's first project since his departure from Climax Studios , after which he became independent . He wanted to develop a game that was dependent on the narrative , and avoided working on the game until he was settled on an idea that was possible to execute . Barlow eventually decided to create a police procedural game , and incorporate live action footage . He conducted research for the game by watching existing police interviews . Upon doing so , he discovered recurring themes in the suspects ' answers , and decided to incorporate ambiguity to the investigation in the game . 
 At release , Her Story was acclaimed by many reviewers , with praise particularly directed at the narrative , character performance , and unconventional gameplay mechanics . The game has sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies , and was nominated for multiple year @-@ end accolades , including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Her Story is an interactive movie game , focusing on a series of seven fictional police interviews from 1994 . As the game begins , players are presented with an old desktop , which contains several files and programs . Among the programs are instructional text files , which explain the game 's mechanics . One of the programs automatically open on the desktop is the " <unk> Database " , which allows players to search and sort video clips within the database , of which there are 271 . The video clips are police interviews with a British woman : Hannah Smith . The interviews are unable to be watched in their entirety , forcing players to view short clips . In the interviews , Hannah answers unknown questions to an off @-@ screen detective , prompting players to decipher the context of the answers . Hannah 's answers are transcribed , and players find clips by searching in the database for words from the transcriptions , attempting to solve the case by piecing together information . As players select clips , they can enter user tags , which are then available as searchable terms . One of the files on the desktop is a database checker , which allows players to review the amount of clips that have been viewed ; as a clip is viewed , the red box in the database checker changes to green . The desktop also features the minigame Mirror Game , based on the strategy board game <unk> . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The interview tapes feature a woman who introduces herself as Hannah Smith ( Viva Seifert ) , whose husband , Simon , has gone missing , and is later found murdered . Hannah admits that the two had a difficult relationship , but has an alibi placing her in Glasgow at the time after an argument . As more pieces of the interviews are discovered , it is revealed that " Hannah " is actually two women : Hannah and Eve , identical twins separated at birth by the midwife . The twins were unaware of each other 's existence until years later , at which point they decided to act as a single person , keeping a common diary and a set of rules defining their actions as " Hannah " . 
 Hannah eventually began dating Simon , whom she met at a glazier where they both work . Despite their rules , Hannah sleeps with Simon and becomes pregnant , which upsets Eve , who makes an effort to get pregnant but is unable to do so ; Hannah miscarries in the eighth month . Years later , Simon meets Eve in a bar . The two begin an affair , and Eve becomes pregnant ; by this time , Hannah is infertile . On their birthday , Simon gives a handmade mirror to Hannah , but they have an argument , and Hannah reveals that she has a sister who is pregnant ; Simon realises he is the father . The following day , Eve has an argument and flees to Glasgow . Hannah , wearing Eve 's wig , confronts Simon . Unaware that she is Hannah , Simon gifts her another mirror . Hannah becomes furious , shattering the mirror and accidentally lodging it in Simon 's throat , killing him . When Eve returns , the two agree to hide Simon 's body , and use Eve 's trip to Glasgow as an alibi . At the end of the interview , Eve notes that Hannah is " gone " , and asks to speak to a lawyer . 
 As players uncover enough of the story , a chat window appears asking if they are finished . Once players answer affirmatively , it is revealed that they are Sarah , Eve 's daughter . The chat asks Sarah if she understands her mother 's actions , and asks to meet her outside . 
 = = Development = = 
 Her Story was developed by Sam Barlow , who previously worked on games such as Silent Hill : Origins ( 2007 ) and Silent Hill : Shattered Memories ( 2009 ) at Climax Studios . Barlow had conceived the idea of a police procedural game while working at Climax Studios , but decided to become independent to create the game , in order to develop a game that is " deep on story " . He became frustrated by publishers using kitchen sink realism as the reason behind rejecting game pitches , and found that becoming independent allowed him to create his own game of the sort . He also wished to become independent after playing games like Year Walk ( 2013 ) and 80 Days ( 2014 ) . Barlow avoided development until he had an idea that was possible to execute . " I could probably quite easily have gone and made an exploration horror game ... but I kind of knew that there would be big compromises there because of budget , " he said . Barlow spent his savings to work on the game , allowing him a year of development time . He followed through with the concept of Her Story , as it focused on an " intimate setting , dialogue and character interaction " , which he found was often dismissed in larger titles . Barlow felt particularly inspired to develop Her Story after seeing the continuous support of his 1999 game Aisle . When referring to how Her Story challenges typical game conventions , Barlow compares it to the Dogme 95 filmmaking movement , and Alfred Hitchcock 's 1948 film Rope . 
 Her Story was approved through Steam Greenlight , and was crowdfunded by Indie Fund . It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows , OS X and iOS . Barlow wanted to launch the game on all platforms simultaneously , as he was unsure where the audience would be . " If I 'd just gone for just one I 'd have lost a lot of the potential audience , " he commented . Barlow found that playing Her Story on mobile devices is a " ' sofa ' experience " . He also noted that it felt " natural " for it to be released on mobile devices , as they are regularly used to watch videos and search the internet ; similar tasks are used as gameplay mechanics in Her Story . The iPhone 's smaller pixel size of 640 × 480 as opposed to 800 × 600 led to Barlow 's doubts of a release on the platform , but he was influenced to release it upon receiving positive feedback through testing . As development neared completion , the game underwent testing , which allowed Barlow to " balance some aspects " and " polish items together " . An Android version was released on June 29 , 2016 . Her Story runs on the Unity game engine . 
 = = = Gameplay design = = = 
 Barlow 's immediate idea was to create a game involving police interviews , but he " didn 't know exactly what that meant " . He then conceived the idea to involve real video footage , and the ability to access the footage through a database interface ; he described the interface as being " part Apple II , part Windows 3 @.@ 1 and part Windows 98 " . The interface design was inspired by Barlow 's appreciation of the police procedural genre , commenting that " the conceit of making the computer itself a prop in the game was so neat " . He also compared the searching mechanic to the Google search engine , and wanted to " run with the idea " that players are " essentially Googling " . The game 's concept was inspired by the TV series Homicide : Life on the Street ( 1993 – 1999 ) , which Barlow found depicted police interviews being a " gladiatorial arena for detectives " . Barlow intentionally made the game 's opening screen to be " slightly too long " , to immediately notify players of the slow pacing that would follow . 
 Inspiration to work on Her Story stemmed from Barlow 's disappointment of other detectives games : he felt that L.A. Noire ( 2011 ) never allowed him to feel like " the awesome detective who was having to read things and follow up threads of investigation " , and he called the Ace Attorney series ( 2001 – present ) " rigidity " . When Barlow began development on Her Story , he added more typical game aspects , but the game mechanics became more minimalist as development progressed . The initial plan for the game was for players to work towards a definitive resolution , ultimately solving the crime . However , when Barlow tested the concept on pre @-@ existing interview transcripts of convicted murderer Christopher Porco , he began to discover themes surfacing within the interviews , particularly relating to the concept of money , which was ultimately a large factor in Porco 's trial . He took this concept of recurring themes and threads , and decided to " move beyond the clearly scripted stuff " when developing Her Story . Barlow felt that the story 's appeal was the ambiguity of the investigation , comparing Her Story to the podcast Serial ( 2014 – present ) , which he listened to late in development . He found that the attraction of Serial was the lack of a definitive solution , noting that " people lean towards certain interpretations ... what makes it interesting is the extent to which it lives on in your imagination " . 
 = = = Story and characters = = = 
 Barlow decided to feature live action footage in the game after becoming frustrated with his previous projects , particularly with the technical challenge of translating an actor 's performance into a game engine . Barlow set out to work with an actor on Her Story , having enjoyed the process while working at Climax Studio , albeit with a larger budget . He contacted Viva Seifert , whom he had intermittently worked with on Legacy of Kain : Dead Sun for a year , before its cancellation . He felt that Seifert is " very good at picking up a line and intuitively pulling a lot of the subtext into her performance " , which led him to believe that she was " perfect " for the role in Her Story . When Barlow asked Seifert to audition , he sent her a 300 @-@ page script , which he managed to reduce to 80 pages , by altering font size , as well as some dialogue ; she accepted the role . Seifert began to feel pressure midway through filming , when she realised that " the whole game is <unk> " on her performance . She described the shoot as " intense " and " rather exhausting " , and felt as if she was " subtly being scrutinised " by Barlow , which helped her performance . Barlow also felt that the intensity helped Seifert 's performance , taking cues from director Alfred Hitchcock , who would upset his actors in order to achieve the greatest performance . Seifert felt that there were small nuances in her performance that may have " added some twists and turns " for players that Barlow had not anticipated . The game 's seven police interviews were filmed roughly in chronological order over five days , in a process that Barlow called " natural " . Barlow travelled to Seifert 's home county of Cornwall to film . He felt that finding the locations for the interrogation rooms was the simplest part of production , because " everywhere has crappy looking rooms " , with footage being recorded in a council building in Truro . When filming was complete , Barlow wanted to give the impression that the videos had been recorded in 1994 , but found digital filters were unable to capture this time frame appropriately . Instead , he recorded the footage through two VHS players to create imperfections in the video before digitising the video into the game . 
 Barlow played the part of the detectives during filming , asking scripted questions to Seifert 's character , but is never featured in Her Story . When watching police interviews for research , Barlow found himself empathising with the interviewee , which inspired him to exclude the detective from the game . He stated that the interviews typically feature " double betrayal " , in which the detectives are " pretending to be the best friend " . Barlow felt that removing the detective from the game empowers Seifert 's character , allowing players to empathise . When conducting research for Her Story , Barlow looked at the case regarding the murder of Travis Alexander , which made him consider the manner that female murder suspects are treated in interrogations , stating that they " tend to be fetishised , more readily turned into archetypes " . This was further proved to Barlow when studying the interviews of Casey Anthony and Amanda Knox ; he found that media commentary often ignored the evidence of the investigation , instead focusing on the expressions of the suspects during the interviews . Barlow conducted further research by studying texts about psychology , and the use of language . 
 After conceiving the game 's main mechanics , Barlow began developing the story , conducting research and " letting [ the story ] take on a life of its own " . To develop the story , Barlow placed the script into a spreadsheet , which became so large it often crashed his laptop upon opening it . He mapped out every character involved in the investigation , including their backstories and agendas . He spent about half of development creating detailed documents charting the story 's characters and events . He also determined the dates on which the police interviews would take place , and what the suspect was doing in the interim . Once he had determined the game 's concept more precisely , Barlow ensured the script contained " layers of intrigue " , in order to interest players to finish the game . Barlow often replaced words of the script with synonyms , to ensure that some clips were not associated with irrelevant words . When writing the script , Barlow generally avoided supernatural themes , but realised that it would involve a " slight dreamlike surreal edge " . Working on the script , he often found that he was " very much in the moment , writing from inside the characters ' heads " . He found it difficult to create a new idea for the story , as detective fiction has been explored many times before . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 When searching for music to use in Her Story , Barlow looked for songs that sounded " slightly out @-@ of @-@ time " . He ultimately used eight tracks from musician Chris Zabriskie , and found that his music invoked nostalgia , and had a " modern edge " . He felt that the music " highlights the gap between the ' fake computer world ' " and the game . The " emotional intensity " of the clips also influences the music changes in Her Story . Barlow also intended to feature a song for Seifert to sing in some of the clips that fit within the game . He settled on the murder ballad " The Twa Sisters " , which he felt would trigger the mythical elements of the game . Seifert and Barlow both altered the ballad , to fit the game . Barlow intended for the sound design to be " all about authenticity " . He used an old keyboard to provide sound effects for the computer , using stereo panning for the keys to have the correct 3D position in playback .

 In January 2016 , Barlow confirmed that a sequel was in development , under the working title Her Story 2 .

 Her Story was well received by critics . Review aggregator Metacritic calculated an average score of 91 out of 100 based on 10 reviews for the iOS version , indicating " universal acclaim " , and 86 out of 100 based on 49 reviews for the Windows version , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . Metacritic ranks the game within the top 20 iOS and Windows games released in 2015 , and GameRankings ranks Her Story within its top 100 iOS games of all time . Praise was particularly directed at the game 's narrative , Seifert 's performance , and gameplay mechanics . IGN 's Brian Albert called Her Story " the most unique game I 've played in years " , and Steven Burns of VideoGamer.com named it " one of the year 's best and most interesting games " . Adam Smith of Rock , Paper , Shotgun remarked that it " might be the best FMV game ever made " ; Michael Thomsen of The Washington Post declared it " a beautiful amalgam of the cinema and video game formats " . 
 Critics lauded the game 's narrative . Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer wrote that the " fragmented " delivery of the story " works to its benefit " . She appreciated the subtlety of the narrative , and the ambiguity surrounding the ending . Polygon 's Megan Farokhmanesh noted that Her Story " nails the dark , voyeuristic nature of true crime " . Chris Schilling of The Daily Telegraph was impressed by the coherence of the narrative , " even when presented out of order " . Eurogamer 's Simon Parkin found the effects of the narrative to be similar to well @-@ received HBO thrillers , particularly in terms of audience attention . Stephanie Bendixsen of Good Game was disappointed that large plot points were revealed early in the game , but attributed this to the uniqueness of each players ' experience . 
 Seifert 's performance in the game received high praise from reviewers . GameSpot 's Justin Clark felt that the performance " anchored " the game . Katie Smith of Adventure Gamers wrote that Seifert is convincing in the role , particularly with small details such as body language , but was startled by the lack of emotion . Game Informer 's Wallace echoed similar remarks , noting that Seifert " nailed the role " . Rock , Paper , Shotgun 's Smith wrote that " the whole thing might collapse " without Seifert 's " convincing " performance . IGN 's Albert named the acting " believable " , stating that Seifert 's performance is " appropriately both grounded and absurd " . Joe Donnelly of Digital Spy wrote that Seifert 's performance has the potential to inspire similar games , and Andy Kelly of PC Gamer called the performance " understated , realistic , and complex " . Burns of VideoGamer.com felt generally impressed by Seifert 's performance , but noted some " occasional bad acting " . 
 The unconventional gameplay mechanics also received positive remarks from critics . Destructoid 's Laura Kate Dale felt that the game 's pacing and structure assisted the narrative , and Wallace of Game Informer found that making a connection between key points in the narrative was entertaining . Burns of VideoGamer.com praised the game 's ability to make players realise their own biases , and challenge their " sense of self " . Albert of IGN felt that the searching tool was " gratifying " , and positively contributes to the pacing of the game , while The Washington Post 's Thomsen wrote that the database mechanic created " contemplative gaps between scenes " , allowing for " poignance and power " within the narrative . Bendixsen of Good Game described the desktop as " appropriately retro " , noting that she was " drawn in immediately " .

 = Acrobat ( song ) = 
 " Acrobat " is a song by rock band U2 . It is the eleventh track on their 1991 album Achtung Baby . The critical failure of Rattle and Hum ( 1988 ) led the band to seek a harder sound in their music . The song developed from a riff created by guitarist The Edge , and is played in a 12 ⁄ 8 time signature . Thematically the song contains elements of hypocrisy , alienation , and moral confusion . " Acrobat " has never been performed live , although it was rehearsed prior to the third leg of the Zoo TV Tour .

 Lead singer Bono was influenced by the work of Delmore Schwartz when writing the lyrics of " Acrobat " , to whom the song is dedicated . The title of one of his short stories , In Dreams Begin Responsibilities , is quoted in the final verse . Bono noted the book " was on my mind when I was writing the words ... It 's hard to wrap the book up in a few lines , but Delmore Schwartz is kind of a formalist ... I 'm the opposite . I 'm in the mud as a writer , so I could do with a bit of [ Schwartz ] , and that 's why I enjoy him . " The song was developed from a riff guitarist The Edge developed during a soundcheck in Auckland , New Zealand , on the Lovetown Tour in 1989 . He noted that the beat is unusual for a U2 song , saying it " was the jumping off point , to try and do something with an unusual beat . " 
 Producer Daniel Lanois became disoriented with the direction U2 took " Acrobat " during its recording . Bono noted " Daniel had such a hard time on that ... he was trying to get us to play to our strengths and I didn 't want to . I wanted to play to our weaknesses . I wanted to experiment . " Bono noted that the end product " doesn 't quite get off the ground the way I 'd hoped it would . " An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby . The mix , titled " ' Baby ' Acrobat " , contained lyrics that were later modified to a different perspective ( " You know I 'd hit out if I only knew who to hit " instead of the final " I know you 'd hit out if you only knew who to hit " ) or scrapped entirely ( " If the sky turns to purple and the moon turns to blood / Will you dig me out when I 'm face down in the mud " ) . 
 The song has never been performed live , although it was rehearsed extensively in an acoustic form prior to the third leg of the Zoo TV Tour in 1992 . The end of the song segued into the beginning of " Zoo Station " , leading concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra to speculate that it was being considered to open the set . In 2006 , The Edge said " it never became a live favourite ... I don 't think that is what people come to U2 for . " In 2012 , Willie Williams , U2 's lighting designer and concert director , described the rehearsed version as " extremely dramatic " , saying " in a stadium situation it could be argued that it might have the same dramatic impact as walking out on stage and telling the audience to fuck off .

 " Acrobat " is played in a 12 ⁄ 8 time signature . The Edge noted " it 's a very Irish time signature , it 's used in a lot of traditional Irish music , but in rock and roll you don 't really hear it that much . " 
 U2 's 1987 album The Joshua Tree and the supporting Joshua Tree Tour brought them critical acclaim and commercial success . However , their 1988 album and motion picture Rattle and Hum precipitated a critical backlash . Although the record sold 14 million copies and performed well on music charts , critics were dismissive of it and the film . Hot Press editor Niall Stokes commented " having started out as a band in the slipstream of punk , U2 remembered what they had felt about the supergroups of the late ' 70s . Were they now about to become what they had despised ? " In the time leading up to the start of the Achtung Baby sessions , U2 listened to records which had a " hard @-@ edged industrial kind of sound " , including works by KMFDM and Sonic Youth , as well as artists such as Roy Orbison and Jacques Brel . These influences led the band to seek the creation of songs which were harder musically than their previous work , while remaining personal lyrically . 
 " Acrobat " is one of the most personal songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness , contradictions , and inadequacy . The Edge noted that the song contained " a bit of venom " , likening it to " the bitter , John Lennon tradition of ' Working Class Hero ' , slightly snarling and cynical . " Bono stated " as we moved from the eighties to the nineties , I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it . I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy ... ' Acrobat ' [ goes ] ' Don 't believe what you hear , don 't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy ... ' I can 't remember it , but the point is : you start to see the world in a different way , and you 're part of the problem , not just part of the solution " . In 2006 , he noted it was " a song about being a hypocrite , and I think we all can be and I certainly have been . And you know , you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don 't live them personally " , noting the theme was most evident in the lyric " I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that " . Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge 's guitar playing combined elements of " Where the Streets Have No Name " with " Bullet the Blue Sky " . Speaking of its theme he said " at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time , and what it does to people and to relationships . But beyond that , there is the self @-@ awareness that , itself , comes only with experience ... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy . He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position . " Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the " aggressive and venomous " song reflected Bono 's thoughts during the album sessions , saying " Nearly every lyric brims with rage ... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past . " 
 U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono 's habit of keeping his lyrics " in flux until the last minute " with providing a narrative coherence to the album . Flanagan interpreted Achtung Baby as using the moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love , the sun ; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home . For Flanagan , the final three songs on Achtung Baby — " Ultraviolet ( Light My Way ) " , " Acrobat " , and " Love Is Blindness " — are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other . Hot Press writer Joe Jackson felt that the song was dominated by a theme of moral confusion . Author John Luerssen believed the song was about " the fight to persevere " . He added it " was long on piss and vinegar , as evidenced by its snarling , cynical approach . " 
 Craig Delancey , an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York , cited the conclusion of " Acrobat " as an example of how rock music can be " profoundly successful at evoking the mixture of anger and contempt that can keep you going in the face of seemingly overwhelming opposition . " He noted that " the powerful closing sentiments of Achtung Baby 's ' Acrobat ' can help us feel motivated and empowered in the face of powers that want us to feel powerless . " Timothy Cleveland , the Head of the Philosophy Department at New Mexico State University , wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self . He noted " here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware of the world around them . The ' enemy ' that one can feel is oneself . ' To feel ' in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world ... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance . " 
 Robyn Brothers felt the line " I 'd break bread and wine / If there was a church I could receive in " referenced feelings of spiritual alienation . She compared the song to " Zooropa " , stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation . Writing for Uncut , Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric " What are going to do now it 's all been said ? / No new ideas in the house , and every book has been read " was an examination of the band 's longevity , stating " Bono sounded fragile , wounded , seeming even to ponder the band 's usefulness . " He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex , and compared it to " The Fly " , noting that both songs were " delivered in an amoral voice " and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band . Artist Gavin Friday , a childhood friend of Bono , thought the chorus line " Don 't let the bastards grind you down " was a retaliation to the criticism of the press . Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political , martyr @-@ complex . She noted that it eventually " unfurls as a song about love facing the long run . It comes as a relief to discover , after all this time , that the guys in U2 are as <unk> charged and concerned with love as the rest of us . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Acrobat " received mixed reception from critics . The Kitchener Record felt that the song added to the band 's " tremendous presence " , saying that it showed the band 's commitment to each individual song and that it " indicates a very clear evolution in Bono 's lyricism and the band 's clear artistic focus . " Bono named it one of his favourite U2 songs , a sentiment that The Edge agreed with . Stokes said " For most writers , ' Acrobat ' would have been a slow song ... it was a brave attempt by a rock ' n ' roll band to find a distinctive , hard edge , for what was essentially another love song . " Martin rated the track 4 stars , describing it as " deliciously dark " . Steve Morse of the Boston Globe felt it was one of the album 's " exceptional love songs " . Greg Potter of The Vancouver Sun believed it " sums up Bono 's lyrical direction and mindset better than any song on the album ... alluding to the theory that true contentment must begin from within . " Jon Pareles of the New York Times had a more negative opinion of the song , calling the lyrics " pompous " . Bill Wyman of Entertainment Weekly was similarly dissenting , stating " ' Acrobat ' — formless and overwrought — is just a mess . " 
 The theme of moral confusion cited by Jackson was later used in U2 's song " Zooropa " , from the 1993 album of the same name . The coda in " Zooropa " features the lyric " dream out loud " , which Bono included as a reference to " Acrobat " . The phrase " dream out loud " was first used by Bono during the Lovetown Tour in 1989 , and has appeared several times in U2 's work since then , including the song " Always " — a B @-@ side to the " Beautiful Day " single released in 2000 — and being spoken by Bono in the PopMart : Live from Mexico City concert release . 
 During the fifth episode of the fifteenth series of Top Gear , presenter Jeremy Clarkson used " Acrobat " in his film commemorating the life of the late Formula One champion Ayrton Senna . The piece was set against a montage of Senna duelling with Nigel Mansell , including their close battle in the final laps of the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix . The song was covered by the Dutch band Kane on their 2000 live album With or Without You . A rendition by Glasvegas appears on the 2011 tribute album AHK @-@ toong BAY @-@ bi Covered .

 Glasvegas reworked the song for the 2011 tribute album AHK @-@ toong BAY @-@ bi Covered . " Doing this , I was fantasising I was Bono , shades and all , " remarked singer James Allan . " I was singing the line , ' Don 't let the bastards drag you down , ' feeling determined rather than angry .

 = Watford Gap services = 
 Watford Gap services are motorway services on the M1 motorway in Northamptonshire , England . They opened on 2 November 1959 , the same day as the M1 , making them the oldest motorway services in Britain . The facilities were originally managed by Blue Boar , a local company that had run a nearby petrol station before the M1 opened . Roadchef bought the services from Blue Boar in 1995 . 
 The main building was designed by Harry Weedon , the architect for Odeon Cinemas , while the layout and general buildings were designed by coordinating architect Owen Williams . The main building was not ready on opening , so food was served from temporary sheds . The restaurant opened in September 1960 , but due to the site 's reputation as a truck stop , was redesigned in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service . The services became a meeting place for rock bands in the 1960s , including the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix , as it provided a convenient place to sit down and eat a meal in the early hours of the morning . In the 1970s , the quality of the services declined and the food came in for harsh criticism from journalists and artists , such as Roy Harper . Since purchase in 1995 , Roadchef have refurbished the premises . They have promoted its history , including the association with a north / south divide , and its regular use by 1960s rock musicians . A number of events took place to celebrate the 50th anniversary in November 2009 , including a musical about the services . 
 The services are named after the nearby Watford Gap , a crossing point of the limestone ridge just north of the village of Watford ; the name is unrelated to the town of Watford in Hertfordshire . Watford Gap is considered by some to be on a dividing line that separates the north and the south of England . 
 = = Location = = 
 The services are in Northamptonshire , England close to the village of Watford about 8 miles ( 13 km ) to the south east of Rugby and about 75 miles ( 121 km ) to the north west of London . They are situated between junctions 16 and 17 of the M1 with a single site for each direction on the motorway linked by a footbridge . The name comes from the nearby Watford Gap , the narrowest and lowest point in the limestone ridge that crosses England diagonally from the Cotswolds to Lincoln Edge . In Roman Britain , Iter II , later named Watling Street , crossed the gap ; Thomas Telford considered the route unsuitable for coach traffic due to the presence of quicksand . Today , this is reflected in the modern road network by the A5 suddenly turning left towards <unk> near the services . Similarly , the Grand Union Canal avoided the gap by the Crick Tunnel . Consequently , the Roman Road at Watford Gap was largely untouched by previous engineering works when the M1 was constructed , and the engineers were able to build over it . 
 In popular culture , the Watford Gap is often considered to be a dividing line that separates the north and the south of England . The phrase " north of the Watford gap " may be shortened to " north of Watford " , inviting confusion with the larger town of Watford further south in Hertfordshire . Roadchef have suggested that the services ' name should be included in the Oxford English Dictionary as an expression of the divide between the north and south . 
 = = History = = 
 The services , the first of its kind in the UK , opened at the same time as the new motorway on 2 November 1959 . They evolved from discussions during 1955 and 1956 by the Ministry of Transport over what facilities should be present on new motorways . Civil engineer Owen Williams visited the United States to see what existing rest areas were available , and based his designs on these . Watford Gap was chosen as one of four pilot sites , though by 1958 the Ministry had decided only this and Newport Pagnell services would open with the motorway . 
 The land on which the services were built belonged to the Thorntons of Brock Hall , who had owned the manor since 1625 . The family had previously attempted to block the Grand Union Canal and the main London - Birmingham railway across the gap , without success . Brock Hall was eventually sold in 1969 and converted into flats . 
 The structure was built on the site of derelict farm buildings . There were different designers for different parts of the service area , with Owen Williams as the coordinating architect . An ornate design for a footbridge by Clough Williams @-@ Ellis was rejected in favour of a more functional and conservative modernist design by Owen Williams . When the services opened the new buildings were incomplete so the food was served from temporary sheds . The original plan had been for trucks to use this service station and for cars to use Newport Pagnell . In practice , however , both service areas were unrestricted . The first owners of the services were Blue Boar Limited , a family company that owned a nearby petrol station on the A5 . Although the official name has always been Watford Gap , the services were colloquially called Blue Boar for some time after opening . 
 The original buildings at Watford Gap were designed by Harry W Weedon and Partners , already well known for their work for Odeon Cinemas . The restaurant opened in September 1960 , but the Ministry were unhappy about the services ' reputation as a truck @-@ stop , dating back to Blue Boar 's popularity with HGV drivers . They consequently redesigned the restaurant in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service , which they hoped would " lose at least some of the stigma of having been started in 1959 as primarily a commercial driver 's facility " . Food was criticised for being expensive , though Tam Galbraith disputed this , noting he could buy steak and kidney pie with chips , buttered roll and a cup of tea at Watford Gap for 4s 2d ( £ 3 @.@ 81 today ) . 
 By the 1970s , a combination of the recession , overpriced food , and fear of football hooligans had greatly reduced the services ' popularity . The quality of the food declined substantially and , because of its prominent location , the services became a byword for poor catering . Roy Harper wrote a song criticising the food at the Watford Gap on his 1977 album , <unk> , writing : " Watford Gap , Watford Gap / A plate of grease and a load of crap " . The owners of Watford Gap service station objected to criticism of their food , as did an EMI board member who was also a non @-@ executive director of Blue Boar . Harper defended his decision to write the song , claiming the food was " junk . Absolute junk " . In 1989 , one journalist claimed the services had some of the worst food found on the road network , adding " if I threw the toast out of the window , it would probably still be bouncing up the M1 . " Roadchef purchased the motorway businesses from Blue Boar in 1995 and have since improved facilities . In 2011 and 2012 it was rated as 3 stars by quality assessors at Visit England . 
 Roadchef celebrated the services ' 50th anniversary on 2 November 2009 by selling cups of tea at 1959 prices . A road sign was erected pointing to " The North " and " The South " on the same day . As part of the anniversary celebrations , local film @-@ maker and composer Benjamin Till created a musical about Watford Gap . The show featured stories from 80 people who had worked or been associated with the services , including local residents who remembered the services opening . 
 = = Notable visitors = = 
 Though the Ministry of Transport was adamant that the services should not be destinations in their own right , they did acquire a reputation for being a popular place for motorists to visit . During the 1960s , the services were a regular stopping venue for bands such as Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones . The Beatles stopped at Watford Gap while travelling from Liverpool to gigs in the south in the early stage of their career . Jimi Hendrix heard so much about " Blue Boar " , as the services were then popularly known , that he thought it was a London nightclub . Gerry Marsden , leader of the Pacemakers regularly visited the services when touring , saying it was good for " a quick stop and a quick <unk> . " The Floyd 's Nick Mason recalls Hendrix stopping off at the services at 2am , while The Zombies ' Chris White thought the services were " the feeding trough of the beat boom " . Harper claimed " everybody would meet at Watford Gap because it was the one place after a show where you were guaranteed a bit of a sit @-@ down at 2am " . 
 The services ' association with 1960s musicians is remembered in a set of photographs published in 2008 of the Stones stopping at Watford Gap on the way to ATV Studios , Birmingham in 1963 . In 2009 , Roadchef paid a former employee £ 1 @,@ 000 for autographs he had collected while working there , including those of Paul McCartney , Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Brian Jones , Dusty Springfield and Cliff Richard . In July 2011 , music journalist Peter Paphides presented Late Nights at the Blue Boar , a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the connection between the services and Britain 's 1960s rock bands . 
 = Walter Potter = 
 Walter Potter ( 2 July 1835 – 21 May 1918 ) was an English taxidermist noted for his anthropomorphic dioramas featuring mounted animals mimicking human life , which he displayed at his museum in Bramber , Sussex , England . The exhibition was a well @-@ known and popular example of " Victorian whimsy " for many years , even after Potter 's death ; however enthusiasm for such entertainments waned in the twentieth century , and his collection was finally dispersed in 2003 . 
 = = Early life and popularity = = 
 Potter 's family ran The White Lion pub in Bramber , and as a teenager , his first attempt at taxidermy was to preserve the body of his own pet canary . At the age of 19 , inspired by his sister , Jane , who showed him an illustrated book of nursery rhymes , Potter produced what was to become the centrepiece of his museum , a diorama of " The Death and Burial of Cock Robin " , which included 98 species of British birds . This was so well @-@ received that in 1861 , he opened a separate display in the summer house of the pub . While satisfying the Victorian demand for traditional stuffed animals to earn a living , Potter continued creating his dioramas and expanded into new premises in 1866 , and again in 1880 . As his museum expanded , Potter married a local girl , Ann Stringer <unk> , and they had three children , Walter , Annie and Minnie . 
 Amongst his scenes were " a rats ' den being raided by the local police rats ... [ a ] village school ... featuring 48 little rabbits busy writing on tiny slates , while the Kittens ' Tea Party displayed feline etiquette and a game of croquet . A guinea pigs ' cricket match was in progress , and 20 kittens attended a wedding , wearing little morning suits or brocade dresses , with a feline vicar in white surplice . " Potter 's attention to detail in these scenes has been noted , to the extent that " The kittens even wear frilly knickers under their formal attire ! " Apart from the simulations of human situations , he had also added examples of bizarrely deformed animals such as two @-@ headed lambs and four @-@ legged chickens . Potter 's collection , billed as " Mr Potter 's Museum of Curiosities " was to build into a " world @-@ famous example of Victorian whimsy " , with special coach trips from Brighton being arranged ; and the village and Potter 's museum were so popular that an extension was built to the platform at Bramber railway station . 
 = = Later life , death and decline of the museum = = 
 Potter suffered a stroke in 1914 , from which he never fully recovered , and died at the age of 82 ; he was buried in Bramber churchyard . His museum , which by that time contained about 10 @,@ 000 specimens , was taken over by his daughter and grandson . The Victorian enthusiasm for stuffed animals had waned by the museum 's later days , and it deflected claims of animal cruelty by displaying notices stating that all the animals had died naturally and that " in any case , they were all over 100 years old " . The " Kittens ' Wedding " scene , the last created by Potter in 1890 , was shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2001 as part of " The Victorian Vision " exhibition . 
 = = Sale of the collection = = 
 The museum closed in the 1970s , and , after having been moved to Brighton and then to Arundel , was sold in 1984 to the owners of Jamaica Inn , <unk> , Cornwall , where it attracted more than 30 @,@ 000 visitors each year . The death of their taxidermist and economic considerations sapped the venture of its viability , and , when a buyer to maintain the collection intact did not come forward , it was auctioned by Bonhams in 2003 , realizing over £ 500 @,@ 000 . " The Kittens ' Wedding " was sold for £ 21 @,@ 150 , and " The Death and Burial of Cock Robin " was the highest @-@ selling item of the sale , raising £ 23 @,@ 500 . Present at the auction were Peter Blake , Harry Hill and David Bailey . 
 A bid of £ 1m offered by Damien Hirst for the entire collection had apparently been rejected by the auctioneers , and the owners sued Bonhams , arguing that this offer should have been accepted . Shortly after the auction , Hirst wrote to The Guardian citing some of Potter 's limitations as a taxidermist , saying " You can see he knew very little about anatomy and musculature , because some of the taxidermy is terrible — there 's a kingfisher that looks nothing like a kingfisher " He also showed appreciation for the displays : " My own favourites are these tableaux : there 's a kittens ' wedding party , with all these kittens dressed up in costumes , even wearing jewellery . The kittens don 't look much like kittens , but that 's not the point . There 's a rats ' drinking party , too which puts a different construction on Wind in the Willows . And a group of hamsters playing cricket . " About the auction , Hirst said , " I 've offered £ 1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer 's catalogue – just for them to take it off the market and keep the collection intact – but apparently , the auction has to go ahead . It is a tragedy . " 
 The White Lion pub , home of Potter 's collection , has now been renamed The Castle Hotel .

 = Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn , BWV 23 = 
 Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn ( You true God and Son of David ) , BWV 23 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed it in Köthen between 1717 and 1723 for Quinquagesima Sunday and performed it as an audition piece for the position of Thomaskantor in Leipzig on 7 February 1723 . The Sunday was the last occasion for music at church before the quiet time of Lent . 
 Bach had at least the first three movements ready for the audition in Leipzig and may have added the substantial last movement , derived from the lost Weimarer Passion , rather late . The cantata deals with healing the blind near Jericho . An anonymous author stayed close to the gospel , having the blind man call Jesus in the first movement , and begging Jesus not to pass in the second . In the last movement Bach presents an extended version of " Christe , du Lamm Gottes " , the German Agnus Dei of the Lutheran mass . He scored the cantata for three vocal soloists , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque instrumental ensemble with oboes , strings and continuo . 
 Bach possibly led the audition performance of the work in Leipzig in the Thomaskirche on 7 February 1723 , probably after the sermon . He performed the cantata again for the same occasion on 20 February 1724 , this time reinforcing the voices by a brass choir in the final movement . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach probably composed the cantata in Köthen between 1717 and 1723 for Quinquagesima Sunday , the last Sunday before Lent , also known as Estomihi . He revised it , transposing it from C minor to B minor and possibly adding the last movement , to be a test piece , together with Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe , BWV 22 , for his application for the position of Thomaskantor , director of church music in Leipzig . The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians , " praise of love " ( 1 Corinthians 13 : 1 – 13 ) , and from the Gospel of Luke , healing the blind near Jericho ( Luke 18 : 31 – 43 ) . The authorship of the poetry is unknown . The Sunday was meaningful because it was the last chance to perform cantata music before the quiet time of Lent began . 
 The chorale theme assigned to Christe , du Lamm Gottes , first appeared in print in Johannes Bugenhagen 's Braunschweig church order , published in Wittenberg in 1525 . Luther assigned it then to the Kyrie eleison of his Deutsche Messe . 
 Bach possibly led the audition performance of the work in Leipzig in the Thomaskirche on 7 February 1723 , probably after the sermon . It is unclear whether a " test " performance of the 1723 revised version took place in Köthen before Bach 's audition . Bach performed the cantata again for the same occasion on 20 February 1724 , reinforcing the voices by a brass choir in the final movement . When he performed the cantata again between 1728 and 1731 , he returned to the original Köthen key and performed without brass . 
 = = Structure and scoring = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in four movements : a duet for soprano ( S ) and alto ( A ) , a recitative for tenor ( T ) , a chorus , and a closing chorale . He scored it for the three vocal soloists , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble . The duration is given as 20 minutes . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe for the version performed in 1724 , which is in B minor , uses oboes d 'amore in the first movement and brass playing colla parte with the voices in the last movement , a choir of cornett ( Ct ) and three trombones ( Tb ) ( or <unk> ( Tr ) ) . According to the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr , the audition version of 1723 had no reinforcement by brass , matching the scoring of the other audition piece . The originally composed version , which was not performed until 1728 , was in C minor , had oboes in the opening movement and no brass . The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , played throughout , is not shown . 
 = = Music = = 
 In this cantata , Bach combines elements of ritornello and concerto writing to expand his range of structural experimentation . Although the closing chorale was a later addition , its melody is incorporated earlier in the piece , unifying the form . The theme of the text is optimistic , but the music throughout has a sense of underlying sadness . Craig Smith describes the cantata as " one of the densest and greatest " . The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff notes that the opening duet and also the duet passages on the chorus are in the style of Bach 's secular cantatas written in Köthen . 
 = = = 1 = = = 
 The opening movement , " Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn " ( You true God and Son of David ) , is " a sinewy and somewhat enigmatic quintet " for soprano and alto voices ( assuming the role of the blind man addressing Jesus ) with low active oboes and continuo . The movement is in adapted ternary form with an opening and closing " Italianate " ritornello . The soprano line includes a " drooping " motive , hinting at later harmonic and emotional development . There is a " thorny , even awkward juxtaposition of triple and duple meters " throughout the duet . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The tenor recitative , " Ach ! gehe nicht <unk> " ( Ah ! do not pass by ) , is similar to that for bass in Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe : they are both in major mode and accompanied by chordal strings underlying the vocal line . This movement adds an instrumental rendition of the melody of the closing chorale in oboe and violin . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 The chorus , " Aller Augen <unk> , Herr " ( All eyes wait , Lord ) , is , according to the musicologist Julian Mincham , " dance @-@ like but not toe @-@ tapping , major but not <unk> so , employing the full chorus but restrained throughout " . The form is a free rondo with interspersed extended episodes of tenor and bass duet . The opening includes the <unk> motif . 
 = = = 4 = = = 
 The last movement , " Christe , du Lamm Gottes " ( Christ , Lamb of God ) , is probably older than the first three movements and may have originated in the lost Weimarer Passion from 1717 . The three calls of the Agnus Dei are all set differently , with an independent prelude and interludes by the oboes and strings , between the verses . The first verse is marked " adagio " . Instrumental motifs are derived from the hymn tune , which appears in the soprano and mostly chordal support by the lower voices . In the second verse , marked " andante " , the tune appears in a three @-@ part canon in soprano , oboes and first violin . The third verse returns to B minor . It has the tune in the soprano with polyphony in the lower voices and the instruments . The oboes play a syncopated independent role , while the strings support the voices , and the oboes in the interludes . The complex artful composition is a good preparation for Lent , the time of the Passion . Bach used it again to conclude the second version of his St John Passion in 1725 .

 Concepts similar to those behind the metric system had been discussed in the 16th and 17th centuries . Simon Stevin had published his ideas for a decimal notation and John Wilkins had published a proposal for a decimal system of measurement based on natural units . The first practical realisation of the metric system came in 1799 , during the French Revolution , when the existing system of measure , which had fallen into disrepute , was temporarily replaced by a decimal system based on the kilogram and the metre . The work of reforming the old system of weights and measures had the support of whoever was in power , including Louis XVI . The metric system was to be , in the words of philosopher and mathematician Condorcet , " for all people for all time " . In the era of humanism , the basic units were taken from the natural world : the unit of length , the metre , was based on the dimensions of the Earth , and the unit of mass , the kilogram , was based on the mass of water having a volume of one litre or one thousandth of a cubic metre . Reference copies for both units were manufactured and placed in the custody of the French Academy of Sciences . By 1812 , due to the unpopularity of the new metric system , France had reverted to a measurement system using units similar to those of their old system . 
 In 1837 the metric system was re @-@ adopted by France , and also during the first half of the 19th century was adopted by the scientific community . In the middle of the century , James Clerk Maxwell put forward the concept of a coherent system where a small number of units of measure were defined as base units , and all other units of measure , called derived units , were defined in terms of the base units . Maxwell proposed three base units : length , mass and time . This concept worked well with mechanics , but attempts to describe electromagnetic forces in terms of these units encountered difficulties . By the end of the 19th century , four principal variants of the metric system were in use for the measurement of electromagnetic phenomena : three based on the centimetre @-@ gram @-@ second system of units ( CGS system ) , and one on the metre @-@ kilogram @-@ second system of units ( MKS system ) . This impasse was resolved by Giovanni Giorgi , who in 1901 proved that a coherent system that incorporated electromagnetic units had to have an electromagnetic unit as a fourth base unit . 
 Until 1875 , the French government owned the prototype metre and kilogram , but in that year the Convention of the metre was signed , and control of the standards relating to mass and length passed to a trio of inter @-@ governmental organisations , the senior of which was the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( in French the Conférence générale des poids et mesures or CGPM ) . During the first half of the 20th century , the CGPM cooperated with a number of other organisations , and by 1960 it had responsibility for defining temporal , electrical , thermal , molecular and <unk> measurements , while other international organisations continued their roles in how these units of measurement were used . 
 In 1960 , the CGPM launched the International System of Units ( in French the Système international d 'unités or SI ) which had six " base units " : the metre , kilogram , second , ampere , degree Kelvin ( subsequently renamed the " kelvin " ) and candela ; as well as 22 further units derived from the base units . The mole was added as a seventh base unit in 1971 . During this period , the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of the waves from a particular light source , and the second was defined in terms of the frequency of radiation from another light source . Since the end of the 20th century , an effort has been undertaken to redefine the ampere , kilogram , mole and kelvin in terms of the basic constants of physics .

 The first practical implementation of the metric system was the system implemented by French Revolutionaries towards the end of the 18th century . Its key features were that : 
 It was decimal in nature . 
 It derived its unit sizes from nature . 
 Units that have different dimensions are related to each other in a rational manner . 
 Prefixes are used to denote multiples and sub @-@ multiples of its units . 
 These features had already been explored and expounded by various scholars and academics in the two centuries prior to the French metric system being implemented . 
 Simon Stevin is credited with introducing the decimal system into general use in Europe . Twentieth @-@ century writers such Bigourdan ( France , 1901 ) and McGreevy ( United Kingdom , 1995 ) credit the French cleric Gabriel Mouton ( 1670 ) as the originator of the metric system . In 2007 a proposal for a coherent decimal system of measurement by the English cleric John Wilkins ( 1668 ) received publicity . Since then writers have also focused on Wilkins ' proposals : <unk> ( 2007 ) gave both Wilkins and Mouton equal coverage while Quinn ( 2012 ) makes no mention of Mouton but states that " he [ Wilkins ] proposed essentially what became ... the French decimal metric system " . 
 = = = Work of Simon Stevin = = = 
 During the early medieval era , Roman numerals were used in Europe to represent numbers , but the Arabs represented numbers using the Hindu numeral system , a positional notation that used ten symbols . In about 1202 , Fibonacci published his book Liber Abaci ( Book of Calculation ) which introduced the concept of positional notation into Europe . These symbols evolved into the numerals " 0 " , " 1 " , " 2 " etc . 
 At that time there was dispute regarding the difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers and there was no consistency in the way in which decimal fractions were represented . In 1586 , Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De <unk> ( " the tenth " ) which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal fractions . Stevin felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage , measures , and weights to be merely a question of time . 
 = = = Work of John Wilkins = = = 
 In the mid seventeenth century John Wilkins , the first secretary of England 's Royal Society , was asked by the society to devise a " universal standard of measure " . In 1668 he attempted to codify all knowledge in his 621 @-@ page book An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language . Four pages of Part II in Chapter VII were devoted to physical measurement . Here Wilkins also proposed a decimal system of units of measure based on what he called a " universal measure " that was derived from nature for use between " learned men " of various nations . 
 Wilkins considered the earth 's meridian , atmospheric pressure and , following a suggestion by Christopher Wren and demonstrations by Christiaan Huygens , the pendulum as the source for his universal measure . He discarded atmospheric pressure as a candidate – it was described by Torricelli in 1643 as being susceptible to variation ( the link between atmospheric pressure and weather was not understood at the time ) and he discarded a meridian as being too difficult to measure ; leaving the pendulum as his preferred choice . He proposed that the length of a " seconds pendulum " ( approximately 993 mm ) which he named the " standard " should be the basis of length . He proposed further that the " measure of capacity " ( base unit of volume ) should be defined as a cubic standard and that the " measure of weight " ( base unit of weight [ mass ] ) should be the weight of a cubic standard of rainwater . All multiples and sub @-@ multiples of each of these measures would be related to the base measure in a decimal manner . In short , Wilkins " proposed essentially what became ... the French decimal metric system " . 
 = = = Work of Gabriel Mouton = = = 
 In 1670 , Gabriel Mouton , a French abbot and astronomer , published the book Observationes <unk> solis et <unk> <unk> in which he proposed a decimal system of measurement of length for use by scientists in international communication , to be based on the dimensions of the Earth . The <unk> would be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian and would be divided into 10 centuria , the centuria into 10 <unk> and so on , successive units being the virga , virgula , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> . Mouton used Riccioli 's estimate that one degree of arc was 321 @,@ 185 Bolognese feet , and his own experiments showed that a pendulum of length one virgula would beat <unk> @.@ 2 times in half an hour . Current pendulum theory shows that such a pendulum would have had an equivalent length of 205 @.@ 6 mm – using today 's knowledge of the size of the earth , the virgula would have been approximately 185 @.@ 2 mm . He believed that with this information scientists in a foreign country would be able to construct a copy of the virgula for their own use .

 Communication of metrological information was one of the issues facing mid @-@ seventeenth century savants ; many discussed the possibility of scholarly communication using a so @-@ called " universal measure " that was not tied to a particular national system of measurement . Mouton 's ideas attracted interest at the time ; Picard in his work Mesure de la Terre ( 1671 ) and Huygens in his work Horologium <unk> sive de motu <unk> ( 1673 ) both proposing that a standard unit of length be tied to the beat frequency of a pendulum . 
 The French Academy of Sciences ( Académie Royale des Sciences ) interest in the pendulum experiments were effectively announced by Picard in his work Mesure de la Terre . The length of a " second pendulum " was measured at a number of locations outside France , in 1671 at Uraniborg , an island 26 km north of Copenhagen and in 1672 Jean Richer measured one at Cayenne in French Guiana , 5 ° north of the equator . There was no discernible difference between the Uraniborg pendulum and the Paris one , but there was a 2 @.@ 81 mm difference between the lengths of the Cayenne pendulum and that from Paris . Cooperation with the English Royal Society showed no discernible difference between pendulums measured in London and Paris , but measurements taken at Gorée in Senegal , in West Africa were more in line with those taken at Cayenne . Meanwhile , in England , Locke , in his work An Essay Concerning Human Understanding ( 1689 ) , made references to the " philosopher 's foot " which he defined as being one third of a " second pendulum " at 45 ° latitude . 
 In 1686 Englishman Newton , in his book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica , gave a theoretical explanation for the " bulging equator " which also explained the differences found in the lengths of the " second pendulums " , theories that were confirmed by the Académie 's expedition to Peru in 1735 . 
 = = = 18th @-@ century international cooperation = = = 
 In the late eighteenth century proposals , similar to those of the seventeenth century for a universal measure , were made for a common international system of measure in the spheres of commerce and technology ; when the French Revolutionaries implemented such a system , they drew on many of the seventeenth @-@ century proposals . 
 In the early ninth century , when much of what later became France was part of the Holy Roman Empire , units of measure had been standardised by the Emperor Charlemagne . He had introduced standard units of measure for length and for mass throughout his empire . As the empire disintegrated into separate nations , including France , these standards diverged . It has been estimated that on the eve of the Revolution , a quarter of a million different units of measure were in use in France ; in many cases the quantity associated with each unit of measure differed from town to town , and even from trade to trade . Although certain standards , such as the pied du roi ( the King 's foot ) had a degree of pre @-@ eminence and were used by scientists , many traders chose to use their own measuring devices , giving scope for fraud and hindering commerce and industry . These variations were promoted by local vested interests , but hindered trade and taxation . In contrast , in England the Magna Carta ( 1215 ) had stipulated that " there shall be one unit of measure throughout the realm " . 
 By the mid @-@ eighteenth century , it had become apparent that standardisation of weights and measures between nations who traded and exchanged scientific ideas with each other was necessary . Spain , for example , had aligned her units of measure with the royal units of France , and Peter the Great aligned the Russian units of measure with those of England . In 1783 the British inventor James Watt , who was having difficulties in communicating with German scientists , called for the creation of a global decimal measurement system , proposing a system which , like the seventeenth @-@ century proposal of Wilkins , used the density of water to link length and mass , and in 1788 the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier commissioned a set of nine brass cylinders — a [ French ] pound and decimal subdivisions thereof for his experimental work . 
 In 1789 French finances were in a perilous state , several years of poor harvests had resulted in hunger among the peasants and reforms were thwarted by vested interests . On 5 May 1789 Louis XVI summoned the Estates @-@ General which has been in abeyance since 1614 , triggering a series of events that were to culminate in the French Revolution . On 20 June 1789 the newly formed Assemblée nationale ( National Assembly ) took an oath not to disband until a constitution had been drafted , resulting in the setting up , on 27 June 1789 , of the Assemblée nationale constituante ( Constituent Assembly ) . On the same day , the Académie des sciences ( Academy of Sciences ) set up a committee to investigate the reform of weights and measures which , due to their diverse nature , had become a vehicle for corruption . 
 On 4 August 1789 , three weeks after the storming of the Bastille , the nobility surrendered their privileges , including the right to control local weights and measures . 
 Talleyrand , Assemblée representative of the clergy , revolutionary leader and former Bishop of Autun , at the prompting of the mathematician and secretary of the Académie Condorcet , approached the British and the Americans in early 1790 with proposals of a joint effort to define a common standard of length based on the length of a pendulum . Great Britain , represented by John Riggs Miller and the United States represented by Thomas Jefferson agreed in principle to the proposal , but the choice of latitude for the pendulum proved to be a sticking point : Jefferson opting for 38 ° N , Talleyrand for 45 ° N and Riggs @-@ Miller for London 's latitude . On 8 May 1790 Talleyrand 's proposal in the Assemblée that the new measure be defined at 45 ° N " or whatever latitude might be preferred " won the support of all parties concerned . On 13 July 1790 , Jefferson presented a document Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage , Weights , and Measures of the United States to the U.S. Congress in which , like Wilkins , he advocated a decimal system in which units that used traditional names such as inches , feet , roods were related to each by the powers of ten . Again , like Wilkins , he proposed a system of weights based around the weight of a cubic unit of water , but unlike Wilkins , he proposed a " rod pendulum " rather than a " bob pendulum " . Riggs @-@ Miller promoted Talleyrand 's proposal in the British House of Commons . 
 In response to Talleyrand 's proposal of 1790 , the Assemblée set up a new committee under the auspices of the Académie to investigate weights and measures . The members were five of the most able scientists of the day — Jean @-@ Charles de Borda , Joseph @-@ Louis Lagrange , Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace , Gaspard Monge and Condorcet . The committee , having decided that counting and weights and measures should use the same radix , debated the use of the duodecimal system as an alternative to the decimal system . Eventually the committee decided that the advantages of <unk> by three and four was outweighed by the complications of introducing a duodecimal system and on 27 October 1790 recommended to the Assemblée that currency , weights and measures should all be based on a decimal system . They also argued in favour of the decimalization of time and of angular measures . The committee examined three possible standards for length – the length of pendulum that beat with a frequency of once a second at 45 ° latitude , a quarter of the length of the equator and a quarter of the length of a meridian . The committee also proposed that the standard for weight should be the weight of distilled water held in cube with sides a decimal proportion of the standard for length . The committee 's final report to the Assemblée on 17 March 1791 recommended the meridional definition for the unit of length . Borda , inventor of the repeating circle was appointed chairman . The proposal was accepted by the Assemblée on 30 March 1791 . 
 Jefferson 's report was considered but not adopted by the U.S. Congress , and Riggs @-@ Miller lost his British Parliamentary seat in the election of 1790 . When the French later overthrew their monarchy , Britain withdrew her <unk> and France decided to " go it alone " . 
 = = = Roles of Wilkins and Mouton = = = 
 In the past many writers such as Bigourdan ( France , 1903 ) and McGreevy ( United Kingdom , 1995 ) credited Mouton as the " founding father " of the metric system . In 2007 the late Australian metric campaigner Pat <unk> investigated Wilkins ' proposal for a universal system of measurement in Wilkins ' essay , a work that pre @-@ dated Mouton 's proposal by two years . Wilkins ' proposal , unlike Mouton 's , discussed an integrated measurement system that encompassed length , volume and mass rather than just length . 
 Wilkins ' Essay was widely circulated at the time , but the main interest in the Essay was his proposal for a philosophical language in general rather than just a universal standard for units of measure . Subsequent interest in Wilkins ' Essay was confined mainly to those interested in the field of <unk> rather than metrology : for example , Roget in the introduction of his Thesaurus ( 1852 ) , noted Wilkins ' Essay as being one of the leading seventeenth @-@ century works in <unk> . British commentators of the Essay devoted little space to Wilkins ' proposals of measurement ; Vernon et al . ( 1802 ) made a passing comment on the section on measurements in an eight @-@ page study of the Essay while Wright @-@ Henderson ( 1910 ) , in a four @-@ page study of the Essay , made no comments about measurements at all . 
 Mouton 's proposals were taken seriously by , amongst others , the seventeenth @-@ century scientists Jean Picard and Christiaan Huygens , but a hundred years were to elapse before the French again took interest in the underlying theory of the development of systems of measure . 
 Shortly after the introduction of the metric system by the French , a letter by an anonymous but regular contributor to The Philosophical Magazine ( 1805 ) noted the lack of acknowledgement by the French of Wilkins ' publication . The writer accused the editors of the Encyclopédie of giving unwarranted attention to the work of Mouton and Huygens at the expense of Edward Wright who , in 1599 had proposed using the earth 's meridian as a standard , and of Wilkins who had proposed a measurement system . He took British writers to task for not " defending their countrymen " . He went on to note that there was considerable communication between scientists on either side of the Channel , particularly with Huygens and Leibniz either visiting or being members of both the Royal Society and the Académie Royale des Sciences . 
 = = Implementation in Revolutionary France ( 1792 – 1812 ) = = 
 When the National Assembly accepted the committee 's report on 30 March 1791 , the Académie des sciences was instructed to implement the proposals . The Académie broke the tasks into five operations , allocating each part to a separate working group : 
 Measuring the difference in latitude between Dunkirk and Barcelona and triangulating between them ( Cassini , Méchain , and Legendre ) 
 Measuring the baselines used for the survey ( Monge , <unk> ) 
 Verifying the length of the second pendulum at 45 ° latitude ( de Borda and de Coulomb ) . 
 Verifying the weight in vacuo of a given volume of distilled water ( Antoine Lavoisier and René Just Haüy ) . 
 Publishing conversion tables relating the new units of measure to the existing units of measure ( Tillet ) . 
 On 19 June 1791 - the day before Louis XVI 's flight to Varennes - Cassini , Méchain , Legendre and Borda obtained a royal audience where the king agreed to fund both the measurement of the meridian and repeating the measurements made by Cassini 's father . The king 's authorization arrived on 24 June 1791 . 
 During the political turmoil that followed the king 's flight to Varennes , the reform of weights and measures and in particular the measurement of the meridian continued albeit with interruptions , though the structure of the commission changed with the changing political climate . In May 1792 Cassini , loyal to Louis XVI but not to the Revolution was replaced by Delambre and on 11 July 1792 the Commission formally proposed the names " metre " , " litre " and multipliers " <unk> " , " kilo " etc. to the Assembly . 
 Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793 and on 8 August of that year , on the eve of the Reign of Terror the new de facto government executive , the Committee of Public Safety suppressed all academies and with it the commission , requiring them to justify their existence . Antoine François , comte de Fourcroy , a member of the convention argued that the importance of reforming weights and measures was such that the work of the commission should be allowed to continue . On 11 September 1793 the commission was reconstituted as the commission <unk> . 
 On 7 April 1795 the metric system was formally defined in French law and provisional standards based on Cassini 's survey of 1740 adopted . On 22 October 1795 the work of the commission ( since reconstituted as a three @-@ man <unk> <unk> under Legendre 's directorship ) was taken over by the newly formed National Institute of Arts and Science and under the new government , the Directory , was transferred to the " Office for Weights and Measures " under the Minister of the Interior . 
 On 15 November 1798 Delambre and Méchain returned to Paris with their data , having completed the survey of the Dunkirk @-@ Barcelona meridian . The data was analysed and a prototype metre constructed from platinum with a length of 443 @.@ 296 lignes . At the same time a prototype kilogram was constructed – the mass of a cube of water at 4 ° C , each side of the cube being 0 @.@ 1 metres . The prototype metre was presented to the French legislative assemblies on 22 June 1799 . 
 = = = Decimal time ( 1793 ) = = = 
 The decree of 5 October 1793 introduced the Republican Calendar into France and with it decimalised time . The day was divided into 10 " decimal hours " , the " hour " into 100 " decimal minutes " and the " decimal minute " into 100 " decimal seconds " . The " decimal hour " corresponded to 2 hr 24 min , the " decimal minute " to 1 @.@ 44 min and the " decimal second " to 0 @.@ 864 s . The revolutionary week was 10 days , but there were still twelve months in a year , each month consisting of three " weeks " . Each year had five or six intercalary days to make up the total of 365 or 366 days . 
 The implementation of decimal time proved an immense task and under the article 22 of the law of 18 Germinal , Year III ( 7 April 1795 ) , the use of decimal time was no longer mandatory , though the Republican Calendar was retained . On 1 January 1806 , France reverted to the traditional timekeeping . 
 = = = Angular measure ( c . 1793 ) = = = 
 Although there was no specific decree regarding angular measure which was also decimalised during the 1790s , it is reported to have been used in 1794 , but was not mentioned in the metric system decree of 1795 . In particular , the repeating circle , invented in about 1787 by Borda , himself a strong proponent of decimalization , was adapted to use decimal angles . 
 A grade ( or gon ) was defined as being 1 ⁄ 100 of a quadrant , making 400 grades in a full circle . Fractions of the grade used the standard metric prefixes , thus one centigrade was 1 ⁄ 10000 of a quadrant , making one centigrade of longitude approximately one kilometre . 
 The adoption of the grade by the cartographic community was sufficient to warrant a mention in the <unk> @-@ <unk> Gallica in 1801 and its use continued on military maps through the nineteenth century into the twentieth century . It appears not to have been widely used outside cartography . The centigrade , as an angular measure , was adopted for general use in a number countries , so in 1948 the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) recommended that the degree centigrade , as used for the measurement of temperature , be renamed the degree Celsius . The SI Brochure ( 2006 ) notes that the gon is now a little @-@ used alternative to the degree . 
 = = = Draft metric system ( 1795 ) = = = 
 In France , the metric system of measure was first given a legal basis in 1795 by the French Revolutionary government . Article 5 of the law of 18 Germinal , Year III ( 7 April 1795 ) defined six new decimal units . The units and their preliminary values were : 
 The metre , for length – defined as being one ten millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the Equator through Paris 
 The are ( 100 m2 ) for area [ of land ] 
 The stère ( 1 m3 ) for volume of firewood 
 The litre ( 1 dm3 ) for volumes of liquid 
 The gramme , for mass – defined as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water 
 The franc , for currency 
 Decimal multiples of these units were defined by Greek prefixes : " <unk> " ( 10 @,@ 000 ) , " kilo- " ( 1000 ) , " <unk> " ( 100 ) and " <unk> " ( 10 ) and submultiples were defined by the Latin prefixes " deci- " ( 0 @.@ 1 ) , " centi- " ( 0 @.@ 01 ) and " milli- " ( 0 @.@ 001 ) . Using Cassini 's survey of 1744 , a provisional value of 443 @.@ 44 lignes was assigned to the metre which , in turn , defined the other units of measure . 
 The final value of the metre was defined in 1799 when Delambre and Méchain presented the results of their survey between Dunkirk and Barcelona which fixed the length of the metre at 443 @.@ 296 lignes . The law 19 <unk> An VIII ( 10 December 1799 ) defined the metre in terms of this value and the kilogramme as being <unk> @.@ 15 grains . These definitions enabled reference copies of the kilograms and metres to be constructed and these were used as the standards for the next 90 years . 
 = = = <unk> definition = = = 
 The question of measurement reform in France was placed in the hands of the French Academy of Sciences who appointed a commission chaired by Jean @-@ Charles de Borda . Borda could be said to have been a fanatic for decimalization : he had designed the repeating circle , a surveying instrument which allowed a much @-@ improved precision in the measurement of angles between landmarks , but insisted that it be calibrated in " grades " ( 1 ⁄ 100 of a quarter @-@ circle ) rather than degrees , with 100 minutes to a grade and 100 seconds to a minute . The instrument was manufactured by Étienne Lenoir . For Borda , the seconds pendulum was a poor choice for a standard because the second ( as a unit of time ) was insufficiently decimal : he preferred the new system of 10 hours to the day , 100 minutes to the hour and 100 seconds to the minute . 
 Instead , the commission – whose members included Lagrange , Laplace , Monge and Condorcet – decided that the new measure should be equal to one ten @-@ millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator ( the quadrant of the Earth 's circumference ) , measured along the meridian passing through Paris . Apart from the obvious nationalistic considerations , the Paris meridian was also a sound choice for practical scientific reasons : a portion of the quadrant from Dunkerque to Barcelona ( about 1000 km , or one @-@ tenth of the total ) could be surveyed with <unk> and end @-@ points at sea level , and that portion was roughly in the middle of the quadrant , where the effects of the Earth 's oblateness were expected to be the largest . 
 The task of surveying the meridian arc , which was authorized by Louis XVI and which was estimated to take two years , fell to Pierre Méchain and Jean @-@ Baptiste Delambre . The task eventually took more than six years ( 1792 – 1798 ) with delays caused not only by unforeseen technical difficulties but also by the convulsed period of the aftermath of the Revolution . In the meantime , the commission calculated a provisional value from older surveys of 443 @.@ 44 lignes . 
 The project was split into two parts – the northern section of 742 @.@ 7 km from the Belfry , Dunkirk to Rodez <unk> which was surveyed by Delambre and the southern section of 333 @.@ 0 km from Rodez to the Montjuïc Fortress , Barcelona which was surveyed by Méchain . 
 Delambre used a baseline of about 10 km in length along a straight road , located close to Melun . In an operation taking six weeks , the baseline was accurately measured using four platinum rods , each of length two toise ( about 3 @.@ 9 m ) . Thereafter he used , where possible , the triangulation points used by Cassini in his 1744 survey of France . Méchain 's baseline , of a similar length , and also on a straight section of road was in the Perpignan area . Although Méchain 's sector was half the length of Delambre , it included the Pyrenees and hitherto unsurveyed parts of Spain . After the two surveyors met , each computed the other 's baseline in order to cross @-@ check their results and they then <unk> the kilometre . Their result came out at 0 @.@ 144 lignes shorter than the provisional value , a difference of about 0 @.@ 03 % . 
 = = = Mètre des Archives = = = 
 While Méchain and Delambre were completing their survey , the commission had ordered a series of platinum bars to be made based on the provisional metre . When the final result was known , the bar whose length was closest to the meridianal definition of the metre was selected and placed in the French National Archives on 22 June 1799 ( 4 messidor An VII in the Republican calendar ) as a permanent record of the result : this standard metre bar became known as the mètre des Archives . 
 The metric system , that is the system of units based on the metre , was officially adopted in France on 10 December 1799 ( 19 frimaire An VIII ) and became the sole legal system of weights and measures there from 1801 . 
 It soon became apparent that Méchain and Delambre 's result ( 443 @.@ 296 lignes ) was slightly too short for the meridianal definition of the metre . Arago and <unk> extended the survey to the island of Formentera in the western Mediterranean Sea in 1806 – 1809 , and found that one ten @-@ millionth of the Earth 's quadrant should be 443 @.@ 31 lignes : later work increased the value to 443 @.@ 39 lignes . The modern value , for the <unk> 84 reference spheroid , is 1 @.@ 000 196 57 m or 443 @.@ 383 08 lignes . 
 Nevertheless , the mètre des Archives remained the legal and practical standard for the metre in France , even once it was known that it did not exactly correspond to the meridianal definition . When , in 1867 , it was proposed that a new international standard metre be created , the length was taken to be that of the mètre des Archives " in the state in which it shall be found " . 
 = = = Kilogramme des Archives = = = 
 On 7 April 1795 , the gramme , upon which the kilogram is based , was decreed to be equal to " the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a metre , and at the temperature of the melting ice " . Although this was the definition of the gram , the regulation of trade and commerce required a " practical realisation " : a single @-@ piece , metallic reference standard that was one thousand times more massive that would be known as grave . This mass unit , whose name is derived from the word " gravity " , defined by Lavoisier and René Just Haüy had been in use since 1793 . Notwithstanding that the definition of the base unit of mass was the gramme ( alternatively " gravet " ) , this new , practical realisation would ultimately become the base unit of mass . A provisional kilogram standard was made and work was commissioned to determine the precise mass of a cubic decimetre ( later to be defined as equal to one litre ) of water . 
 Although the decreed definition of the kilogramme specified water at 0 ° C — a highly stable temperature point — the scientists tasked with producing the new practical realisation chose to redefine the standard and perform their measurements at the most stable density point : the temperature at which water reaches maximum density , which was measured at the time as 4 ° C. They concluded that one cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density was equal to 99 @.@ <unk> % of the mass of the provisional kilogram made earlier that year . Four years later in 1799 , an all @-@ platinum standard , the " Kilogramme des Archives " , was fabricated with the objective that it would equal , as close as was scientifically feasible for the day , to the mass of cubic decimetre of water at 4 ° C. The kilogramme was defined to be equal to the mass of the Kilogramme des Archives and this standard stood for the next ninety years . 
 Note that the new metric system did not come into effect in France until after the French Revolution , when the new revolutionary government captured the idea of the metric system . The decision of the Republican government to name this new unit the " kilogramme " had been mainly politically motivated , because the name " grave " was at that time considered politically incorrect as it resembled the aristocratic German title of the Graf , an alternative name for the title of Count that , like other nobility titles , was inconsistent with the new French Republic notion of equality ( <unk> ) . Accordingly , the name of the original , defined unit of mass , " gramme " , which was too small to serve as a practical realisation , was adopted and the new prefix " kilo " was appended to it to form the name " kilogramme " . Consequently , the kilogram is the only SI base unit that has an SI prefix as part of its unit name . 
 = = Adoption of the metric weights and measures = = 
 During the nineteenth century the metric system of weights and measures proved a convenient political compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands , Germany and Italy . In 1814 , Portugal became the first country not part of the French Empire to officially adopt a metric system . Spain found it expedient in 1858 to follow the French example and within a decade Latin America had also adopted the metric system . There was considerable resistance to metrication in the United Kingdom and in the United States , though once the United Kingdom announced its metrication program in 1965 , the Commonwealth followed suit . 
 = = = France = = = 
 The introduction of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district , but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed . Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed , the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved . Paris alone needed 500 @,@ 000 metre sticks , yet one month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure , they only had 25 @,@ 000 in store . This , combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular . 
 Napoleon himself ridiculed the metric system , but as an able administrator , recognised the value of a sound basis for a system of measurement and under the décret <unk> du 12 <unk> 1812 ( imperial decree of 12 February 1812 ) , a new system of measure – the mesures usuelles or " customary measures " was introduced for use in small retail businesses – all government , legal and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education . The names of many units used during the ancien regime were reintroduced , but were redefined in terms of metric units . Thus the toise was defined as being two metres with six pied making up one toise , twelve pouce making up one pied and twelve lignes making up one pouce . Likewise the livre was defined as being 500 g , each livre comprising sixteen once and each once eight gros and the <unk> as 120 centimetres . 
 Louis Philippe I by means of the La loi du 4 <unk> 1837 ( the law of 4 July 1837 ) effectively revoked the use of mesures <unk> by reaffirming the laws of measurement of 1795 and 1799 to be used from 1 May 1840 . However , many units of measure , such as the livre ( for half a kilogram ) , remained in colloquial use for many years .

 In August 1814 , Portugal officially adopted the metric system but with the names of the units substituted by Portuguese traditional ones . In this system the basic units were the <unk> @-@ <unk> ( hand ) 
 = 1 decimetre ( 10 <unk> @-@ <unk> = 
 1 vara ( yard ) 
 = 1 metre ) , the <unk> = 
 1 liter and the libra ( pound ) = 1 kilogram .

 The Netherlands first used the metric system and then , in 1812 , the mesures usuelles when it was part of the First French Empire . Under the Royal decree of 27 March 1817 ( <unk> <unk> van den 27 <unk> 1817 ) , the newly formed Kingdom of the Netherlands abandoned the mesures usuelles in favour of the " Dutch " metric system ( Nederlands <unk> <unk> ) in which metric units were given the names of units of measure that were then in use . Examples include the ons ( ounce ) which was defined as being 100 g . 
 = = = The German Zollverein = = = 
 At the outbreak of the French Revolution , much of modern @-@ day Germany and Austria were part of the Holy Roman Empire which has become a loose federation of kingdoms , principalities , free cities , bishoprics and other fiefdoms , each with its own system of measurement , though in most cases such system were loosely derived from the Carolingian system instituted by Charlemagne a thousand years earlier . 
 During the Napoleonic era , there was a move among some of the German states to reform their systems of measurement using the prototype metre and kilogram as the basis of the new units . Baden , in 1810 , for example , redefined the Ruthe ( rods ) as being 3 @.@ 0 m exactly and defined the subunits of the Ruthe as 1 Ruthe 
 = 10 Fuß ( feet ) = 
 100 Zoll ( inches ) 
 = 1 @,@ 000 <unk> ( lines ) = 
 10 @,@ 000 Punkt ( points ) while the Pfund was defined as being 500 g , divided into 30 Loth , each of 16 @.@ 67 g . Bavaria , in its reform of 1811 , trimmed the Bavarian Pfund from 561 @.@ 288 g to 560 g exactly , consisting of 32 Loth , each of 17 @.@ 5 g while the Prussian Pfund remained at 467 @.@ 711 g . 
 After the Congress of Vienna there was a degree of commercial cooperation between the various German states resulting in the setting of the German Customs Union ( Zollverein ) . There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856 . As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the <unk> ( Customs Pound ) which was defined to be exactly 500 g and which could be split into 30 ' lot ' . This unit was used for inter @-@ state movement of goods , but was not applied in all states for internal use . 
 Although the Zollverein collapsed after the Austro @-@ Prussian War of 1866 , the metric system became the official system of measurement in the newly formed German Empire in 1872 and of Austria in 1875 . The <unk> ceased to be legal in Germany after 1877 . 
 = = = Italy = = = 
 The Cisalpine Republic , a North Italian republic set up by Napoleon in 1797 with its capital at Milan first adopted a modified form of the metric system based in the braccio <unk> ( Cisalpine cubit ) which was defined to be half a metre . In 1802 the Cisalpine Republic was renamed the Italian Republic , with Napoleon as its head of state . The following year the Cisalpine system of measure was replaced by the metric system . 
 In 1806 , the Italian Republic was replaced by the Kingdom of Italy with Napoleon as its emperor . By 1812 , all of Italy from Rome northwards was under the control of Napoleon , either as French Departments or as part of the Kingdom of Italy ensuring the metric system was in use throughout this region . 
 After the Congress of Vienna , the various Italian states reverted to their original system of measurements , but in 1845 the Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia passed legislation to introduce the metric system within five years . By 1860 , most of Italy had been unified under the King of Sardinia Victor Emmanuel II and under Law 132 of 28 July 28 , 1861 the metric system became the official system of measurement throughout the kingdom . Numerous <unk> di <unk> ( Conversion Tables ) were displayed in shops until 31 December 1870 . 
 = = = Spain = = = 
 Until the ascent of the Bourbon monarchy in Spain in 1700 , each of the regions of Spain retained its own system of measurement . The new Bourbon monarchy tried to centralise control and with it the system of measurement . There were debates regarding the desirability of retaining the Castilian units of measure or , in the interests of harmonisation , adopting the French system . Although Spain assisted Méchain in his meridian survey , the Government feared the French revolutionary movement and reinforced the Castilian units of measure to counter such movements . By 1849 however , it proved difficult to maintain the old system and in that year the metric system became the legal system of measure in Spain . 
 = = = United Kingdom and the Commonwealth = = = 
 In 1824 the Weights and Measures Act imposed one standard ' imperial ' system of weights and measures on the British Empire . The effect of this act was to standardise existing British units of measure rather than to align them with the metric system . 
 During the next eighty years a number of Parliamentary select committees recommended the adoption of the metric system each with a greater degree of urgency , but Parliament prevaricated . A Select Committee report of 1862 recommended compulsory metrication , but with an " Intermediate permissive phase " , Parliament responded in 1864 by legalising metric units only for ' contracts and dealings ' . Initially the United Kingdom declined to sign the Treaty of the Metre , but did so in 1883 . Meanwhile , British scientists and technologists were at the forefront of the metrication movement – it was the British Association for the Advancement of Science that promoted the CGS system of units as a coherent system and it was the British firm Johnson Matthey that was accepted by the CGPM in 1889 to cast the international prototype metre and kilogram . 
 In 1895 another Parliamentary select committee recommended the compulsory adoption of the metric system after a two @-@ year permissive period , the 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade , but did not make them mandatory . A bill to make the metric system compulsory in order to enable British industrial base to fight off the challenge of the nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904 , but did not pass in the House of Commons before the next general election was called . Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry , a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118 . 
 In 1965 Britain commenced an official program of metrication that , as of 2012 , had not been completed . The British metrication program signalled the start of metrication programs elsewhere in the Commonwealth , though India had started its program before in 1959 , six years before the United Kingdom . South Africa ( then not a member of the Commonwealth ) set up a Metrication Advisory Board in 1967 , New Zealand set up its Metric Advisory Board in 1969 , Australia passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1970 and Canada appointed a Metrication Commission in 1971 . Metrication in Australia , New Zealand and South Africa was essentially complete within a decade while metrication in India and Canada is not complete . In addition the lakh and crore are still in widespread use in India . Most other Commonwealth countries adopted the metric system during the 1970s . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 The United States government acquired copies of the French metre and kilogram for reference purposes in 1805 and 1820 respectively . In 1866 the United States Congress passed a bill making it lawful to use the metric system in the United States . The bill , which was permissive rather than mandatory in nature , defined the metric system in terms of customary units rather than with reference to the international prototype metre and kilogram . By 1893 , the reference standards for customary units had become unreliable . Moreover , the United States , being a signatory of the Metre Convention was in possession of national prototype metres and kilograms that were calibrated against those in use elsewhere in the world . This led to the Mendenhall Order which redefined the customary units by referring to the national metric prototypes , but used the conversion factors of the 1866 act . In 1896 a bill that would make the metric system mandatory in the United States was presented to Congress . Of the 29 people who gave evidence before the congressional committee who were considering the bill , 23 were in favour of the bill , but six were against . Four of the six dissenters represented manufacturing interests and the other two the United States Revenue service . The grounds cited were the cost and inconvenience of the change @-@ over . The bill was not enacted . Subsequent bills suffered a similar fate . 
 = = Development of a coherent metric system = = 
 From its inception , the metric system was designed in such a manner that the various units of measure were linked to each other . At the start of the nineteenth century , length , mass , time and temperature were the only base unit units that were defined in terms of formal standards . The beginnings of a coherent system were in place with the units of area and volume linked to the unit of length , though at the time science did not understand the concepts of base units and derived units , nor how many physical quantities were inter @-@ related . This concept , which enabled thermal , mechanical , electrical and relativistic systems to be interlinked was first formally proposed in 1861 using length , mass and time as base units . The absence of an electrical base unit resulted in a number of different electrical systems being developed in the latter half of the nineteenth century . The need for such a unit to resolve these problems was identified by Giorgi in 1901 . The SI standard which was published in 1960 defined a single coherent system based on six units . 
 = = = Time , work and energy = = = 
 In 1832 Carl @-@ Friedrich Gauss made the first absolute measurements of the Earth 's magnetic field using a decimal system based on the use of the millimetre , milligram , and second as the base unit of time . In his paper , he also presented his results using the metre and gram instead of the millimetre and milligram , also using the Parisian line and the Berlin pound instead of the millimetre and milligram . 
 In a paper published in 1843 , James Prescott Joule first demonstrated a means of measuring the energy transferred between different systems when work is done thereby relating Nicolas Clément 's calorie , defined in 1824 , to mechanical work . Energy became the unifying concept of nineteenth century science , initially by bringing thermodynamics and mechanics together and later adding electrical technology and relativistic physics leading to Einstein 's equation <formula> . The CGS unit of energy was the " erg " , while the SI unit of energy was named the " joule " in honour of Joule . 
 In 1861 a committee of the British Association for Advancement of Science ( BAAS ) including William Thomson ( later Lord Kelvin ) , James Clerk Maxwell and Joule among its members was tasked with investigating the " Standards of Electrical Resistance " . In their first report ( 1862 ) they laid the ground rules for their work – the metric system was to be used , measures of electrical energy must have the same units as measures of mechanical energy and two sets of electromagnetic units would have to be derived – an electromagnetic system and an electrostatic system . In the second report ( 1863 ) they introduced the concept of a coherent system of units whereby units of length , mass and time were identified as " fundamental units " ( now known as base units ) . All other units of measure could be derived ( hence derived units ) from these base units . The metre , gram and second were chosen as base units . 
 In 1873 , another committee of the BAAS that also counted Maxwell and Thomson among its members and tasked with " the Selection and Nomenclature of Dynamical and Electrical Units " recommended using the CGS system of units . The committee also recommended the names of " dyne " and " erg " for the CGS units of force and energy . The CGS system became the basis for scientific work for the next seventy years . 
 = = = Electrical units = = = 
 In the 1820s Georg Ohm formulated <unk> Law which can be extended to relate power to current , potential difference ( voltage ) and resistance . During the following decades the realisation of a coherent system of units that incorporated the measurement of electromagnetic phenomena and Ohm 's law was beset with problems – at least four different systems of units were devised . In the three CGS systems , the constants <formula> and <formula> and consequently <formula> and <formula> were dimensionless . 
 Electromagnetic system of units ( EMU ) 
 The Electromagnetic system of units ( EMU ) was developed from André @-@ Marie Ampère 's discovery in the 1820s of a relationship between the force between two current @-@ carrying conductors . This relationship is now known as Ampere 's law which can be written 
 <formula> where <formula> ( SI units ) 
 In 1833 Gauss pointed out the possibility of equating this force with its mechanical equivalent . This proposal received further support from Wilhelm Weber in 1851 . The electromagnetic ( or absolute ) system of units was one of the two systems of units identified in the BAAS report of 1862 and defined in the report of 1873 . In this system , current is defined by setting the magnetic force constant <formula> to unity and potential difference is defined in such a way as to ensure the unit of power calculated by the relation <formula> is identical to the unit of power required to move a mass of one gram a distance of one centimetre in one second when opposed by a force of one dyne . The electromagnetic units of measure were known as the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and so on . 
 Electrostatic system of units ( ESU ) 
 The Electrostatic system of units ( ESU ) was based on Coulomb 's discovery in 1783 of the relationship between the force exerted between two charged bodies . This relationship , now known as Coulomb 's law can be written 
 <formula> where <formula> ( SI units ) 
 The electrostatic system was the second of the two systems of units identified in the 1862 BAAS report and defined in the report of 1873 . In this system unit for charge is defined by setting the Coulomb force constant ( <formula> ) to unity and the unit for potential difference were defined to ensure the unit of energy calculated by the relation <formula> is one erg . The electrostatic units of measure are now known as the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and so on . 
 Gaussian system of units 
 The Gaussian system of units was based on Heinrich Hertz realization , made in 1888 while verifying Maxwell 's Equations , that the CGS system of electromagnetic units to were related to the CGS system of electrostatic units by the relationship : 
 <formula> 
 Using this relationship , he proposed merging the EMU and the ESU systems into one system using the EMU units for magnetic quantities ( subsequently named the gauss and maxwell ) and ESU units elsewhere . He named this combined set of units " Gaussian units " . This set of units has been recognised as being particularly useful in theoretical physics . 
 Practical system of units 
 The CGS units of measure used in scientific work were not practical when used in engineering leading to the development of the practical system of electric units . At the time that this system of units was proposed , the dimension of electrical resistance was modelled in the EMU system as the ratio L / T and in the ESU system as its inverse – T / L. 
 The unit of length adopted for the practical system was 107 m ( approximately the length of the Earth 's quadrant ) , the unit of time was the second and the unit of mass an unnamed unit equal to 10 − 11 g and the definitions of electrical units were based on those of the EMU system . The names , but not the values , amp , volt , farad and ohm were carried over from the EMU system . The system was adopted at the First International Electrical Congress ( IEC ) in 1881 . The second IEC congress ( 1889 ) defined the joule and the watt at the practical units of energy and power respectively . The units were formalised as the International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units at the 1893 congress of the IEC in Chicago where the volt , amp and ohm were formally defined . The SI units with these names are very close , but not identical to the " practical units " . 
 = = = A coherent system = = = 
 The electrical units of measure did not easily fit into the coherent system using length , mass and time as its base units as proposed in the 1861 BAAS paper . Using dimensional analysis the dimensions of voltage as defined by the ESU system of units was identical to the dimensions of current as defined by the EMU system of units <formula> while resistance had the same dimensions as velocity in the EMU system of units , but had the dimensions of the inverse of velocity in the ESU system of units . 
 From the mid @-@ 1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside corresponded with each other regarding these anomalous results . This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to the congress of the Associazione <unk> Italiana ( <unk> ) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro @-@ mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature ( ampere , volt or ohm ) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report . This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro @-@ mechanical quantities ε0 and <unk> were also given physical dimensions . His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent , rational system of units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged . 
 The 1893 definitions of the ampere and the ohm by the IEC led to the joule as being defined in accordance with the IEC resolutions being 0 @.@ 02 % larger than the joule as defined in accordance with the artefacts <unk> by the BIPM . In 1908 , the IEC prefixed the units of measure that they had defined with the word " international " , hence the " international ampere " , " international volt " etc . It took more than thirty years before Giorgi 's work was accepted in practice by the IEC . In 1946 the CIPM formally adopted a definition of the ampere based on the original EMU definition and redefined the ohm in terms of other base units . In 1960 , Giorgi 's proposals were adopted as the basis of the Système International d 'Unités ( International System of Units ) , the SI . 
 = = = Naming the units of measure = = = 
 In 1861 , Charles Bright and Latimer Clark proposed the names of ohm , volt , and farad in honour of Georg Ohm , Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday respectively for the practical units based on the centimetre @-@ gramme @-@ second absolute system . This was supported by Thomson ( Lord Kelvin ) These names were later scaled for use in the Practical System . The concept of naming units of measure after noteworthy scientists was subsequently used for other units . 
 = = Convention of the metre = = 
 With increasing international adoption of the metre , the short @-@ comings of the mètre des Archives as a standard became ever more apparent . Countries which adopted the metre as a legal measure purchased standard metre bars that were intended to be equal in length to the mètre des Archives , but there was no systematic way of ensuring that the countries were actually working to the same standard . The meridianal definition , which had been intended to ensure international reproducibility , quickly proved so impractical that it was all but abandoned in favour of the artefact standards , but the mètre des Archives ( and most of its copies ) were " end standards " : such standards ( bars which are exactly one metre in length ) are prone to wear with use , and different standard bars could be expected to wear at different rates . 
 The International Conference on Geodesy in 1867 called for the creation of a new , international prototype metre and to arrange a system where national standards could be compared with it . The international prototype would also be a " line standard " , that is the metre was defined as the distance between two lines marked on the bar , so avoiding the wear problems of end standards . The French government gave practical support to the creation of an International Metre Commission , which met in Paris in 1870 and again in 1872 with the participation of about thirty countries . 
 On 20 May 1875 an international treaty known as the Convention du Mètre ( Metre Convention ) was signed by 17 states . This treaty established the following organisations to conduct international activities relating to a uniform system for measurements : 
 Conférence générale des poids et mesures ( CGPM or General Conference on Weights and Measures ) , an intergovernmental conference of official delegates of member nations and the supreme authority for all actions ; 
 Comité international des poids et mesures ( CIPM or International Committee for Weights and Measures ) , consisting of selected scientists and <unk> , which prepares and executes the decisions of the CGPM and is responsible for the supervision of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures ; 
 Bureau international des poids et mesures ( BIPM or International Bureau of Weights and Measures ) , a permanent laboratory and world centre of scientific metrology , the activities of which include the establishment of the basic standards and scales of the principal physical quantities , maintenance of the international prototype standards and oversight of regular comparisons between the international prototype and the various national standards . 
 The international prototype metre and kilogram were both made from a 90 % platinum , 10 % iridium alloy which is exceptionally hard and which has good electrical and thermal conductivity properties . The prototype had a special X @-@ shaped ( Tresca ) cross section to minimise the effects of torsional strain during length <unk> and the prototype kilograms were cylindrical in shape . The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms . At the first meeting of the CGPM in 1889 bar No. 6 and cylinder No . X were accepted as the international prototypes . The remainder were either kept as BIPM working copies or distributed to member states as national prototypes . 
 = = Twentieth century = = 
 At the beginning of the twentieth century , the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass . Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies . In the scientific world , quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity . By the end of the century , a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Treaty of the Metre , the definition of the second relied on quantum theory , the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity , and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives . 
 = = = Metre = = = 
 The first ( and only ) follow @-@ up comparison of the national standards with the international prototype metre was carried out between 1921 and 1936 , and indicated that the definition of the metre was preserved to within 0 @.@ 2 µm . During this follow @-@ up comparison , the way in which the prototype metre should be measured was more clearly defined — the 1889 definition had defined the metre as being the length of the prototype at the definition of melting ice , but in 1927 the 7th CGPM extended this definition was to specify that the prototype metre shall be " supported on two cylinders of at least one centimetre diameter , symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at a distance of 571 mm from each other " . The choice of 571 mm represents the Airy points of the prototype — the points at which the bending or droop of the bar is minimized . 
 In 1887 Michelson proposed the use of optical interferometers for the measurement of length , work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907 . In 1952 the CIPM proposed the use of wavelength of a specific light source as the standard for defining length and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as the new standard for the metre . By 1975 , when the second had been defined in terms of a physical phenomenon rather than the earth 's rotation and Einstein 's assertion that the speed of light was constant , the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light as the basis for the definition of the metre . This proposal was accepted in 1983 . 
 = = = Kilogram = = = 
 Although the definition of the kilogram remained unchanged throughout the twentieth century , the 3rd CGPM in 1901 clarified that the kilogram was a unit of mass , not of weight . The original batch of 40 prototypes ( adopted in 1889 ) were supplemented from time to time with further prototypes for use by new signatories to the Metre Convention . 
 During the course of the century , the various national prototypes of the kilogram were recalibrated against the International Prototype Kilogram ( IPK ) and therefore against each other . The initial 1889 starting @-@ value offsets of the national prototypes relative to the IPK were <unk> and any subsequent mass changes being relative to the IPK . A technique for steam cleaning the prototypes to remove any contaminants was developed in 1946 as part of the second recalibration . 
 The third periodic recalibration in 1988 @-@ 1989 revealed that the average difference between the IPK and adjusted baseline for the national prototypes was 50 μg – in 1889 the baseline of the national prototypes had been adjusted so that the difference was zero . As the IPK is the definitive kilogram , there is no way of telling whether the IPK had been losing mass or the national prototypes had been gaining mass . 
 = = = Time = = = 
 Until the advent of the atomic clock , the most reliable timekeeper available to mankind was the earth 's rotation . It was natural therefore that the astronomers under the <unk> of the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) took the lead in maintaining the standards relating to time . In 1988 , responsibility for timekeeping passed to the BIPM who took on the role of coordinating a number of atomic clocks scattered around the globe . During the twentieth century it became apparent that the earth 's rotation was slowing down resulting in days becoming 1 @.@ 4 milliseconds longer each century – this was verified by comparing the calculated timings of eclipses of the sun with those observed in antiquity going back to Chinese records of 763 BC . 
 In 1956 the 10th CGPM instructed the CIPM to prepare a definition of the second ; in 1958 the definition was published stating that the second would be calculated by extrapolation using earth 's rotational speed in 1900 . Astronomers from the US Naval Observatory ( USNO ) and the National Physical Laboratory determined a relationship between the frequency of radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom and the estimated rate of rotation of the earth in 1900 . Their value was adopted in 1968 by the 13th CGPM . 
 = = = Electrical units = = = 
 In 1921 the Treaty of the Metre was extended to cover electrical units with the CGPM merging its work with that of the IEC . At the 8th CGPM in 1933 the need to replace the " International " electrical units with " absolute " units was raised . The IEC proposal that Giorgi 's proposal be adopted was accepted , but no decision was made as to which electrical unit should be the fourth base unit . In 1935 Sears proposed that this should be the ampere , but World War II prevented this being formalised until 1946 . The definitions for absolute electrical system based on the ampere was formalized in 1948 . 
 = = = Temperature = = = 
 At the start of the twentieth century , the fundamental macroscopic laws of thermodynamics had been formulated and although techniques existed to measure temperature using empirical techniques , the scientific understanding of the nature of temperature was minimal . Maxwell and Boltzmann had produced theories describing the inter @-@ relational of temperature , pressure and volume of a gas on a microscopic scale but otherwise , in 1900 , there was no understanding of the microscopic or quantum nature of temperature . Within the metric system , temperature was expressed in degrees Centigrade with the definition that ice melted at 0 ° C and at standard atmospheric pressure , water boiled at 100 ° C. A series of lookup tables defined temperature in terms of inter @-@ related empirical measurements made using various devices . 
 When , in 1948 the CGPM was charged with producing a coherent system of units of measure , definitions relating to temperature had to be clarified . At the 9th CGPM , the centigrade temperature scale was renamed the Celsius temperature scale and the scale itself was fixed by defining the triple point of water as 0 @.@ 01 ° C , though the CGPM left the formal definition of absolute zero until the 10th GCPM when the name " Kelvin " was assigned to the absolute temperature scale and triple point of water was defined as being 273 @.@ 16 ° K. In 1967 , at the 13th GCPM the degree Kelvin ( ° K ) was renamed the " kelvin " ( K ) . 
 Over the ensuing years , the BIPM developed and maintained cross @-@ correlations relating various measuring devices such as thermocouples , light spectra and the like to the equivalent temperatures . Increasingly the use of the Boltzmann Relationship was used as the reference point and it appears likely that in 2015 the CGPM will redefine temperature in terms of the Boltzmann constant rather than the triple point of water . 
 = = = Luminosity = = = 
 Prior to 1937 , the International Commission on Illumination ( CIE from its French title , the Commission Internationale de l <unk> ) in conjunction with the CIPM produced a standard for luminous intensity to replace the various national standards . This standard , the candela ( cd ) which was defined as " the brightness of the full radiator at the temperature of solidification of platinum is 60 new candles per square centimetre " . was ratified by the GCPM in 1948 and in 1960 was adopted as an SI base unit . The definition proved difficult to implement so in 1967 , the definition was revised and the reference to the radiation source was replaced by defining the candles in terms of the power of a specified wavelength of visible light . 
 In 2007 the CIPM and the CIE agreed a program of cooperation with the CIPM taking the lead in defining the use of units of measure and the CIE taking the lead in defining the behaviour of the human eye . 
 = = = Mole = = = 
 The mole was originally known as a gram @-@ atom or a gram @-@ molecule – the amount of a substance measured in grams divided by its atomic weight . Originally chemists and physicists had differing views regarding the definition of the atomic weight – both assigned a value of 16 atomic mass units ( amu ) to oxygen , but physicists defined oxygen in terms of the 16O isotope whereas chemists assigned 16 amu to 16O , 17O and 18O isotopes mixed in the proportion that they occur in nature . Finally an agreement between the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics ( IUPAP ) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) brought this duality to an end in 1959 / 60 , both parties agreeing to define the atomic weight of 12C as being exactly 12 amu . This agreement was confirmed by ISO and in 1969 the CIPM recommended its inclusion in SI as a base unit . This was done in 1971 at the 14th CGPM .

In response to formal requests made by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and by the French government to establish a practical system of units of measure , the CGPM requested the CIPM to prepare recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement , suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention . At the same time the CGPM formally adopted a recommendation for the writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers . The recommendation also catalogued the recommended symbols for the most important MKS and CGS units of measure and for the first time the CGPM made recommendations concerning derived units . 
 The CIPM 's draft proposal , which was an extensive revision and simplification of the metric unit definitions , symbols and terminology based on the MKS system of units , was put to the 10th CGPM in 1954 . In accordance with Giorgi 's proposals of 1901 , the CIPM also recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical would be derived . The definitions for the ohm and volt that had previously been in use were discarded and these units became derived units based on the metre , ampere , second and kilogram . After negotiations with the CIS and IUPAP , two further base units , the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base units . The full system and name " Système International d 'Unités " were adopted at the 11th CGPM . 
 During the years that followed the definitions of the base units and particularly the mise en pratique to realise these definitions have been refined . 
 = = = Proposed revision of unit definitions = = = 
 After the metre was redefined in 1960 , the kilogram remained the only SI base defined by a physical example or artefact . Moreover , after the 1996 – 1998 recalibration a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed . 
 At its 23rd meeting ( 2007 ) , the CGPM mandated the CIPM to investigate the use of natural constants as the basis for all units of measure rather than the artefacts that were then in use . At a meeting of the CCU held in Reading , United Kingdom in September 2010 , a resolution and draft changes to the SI brochure that were to be presented to the next meeting of the CIPM in October 2010 were agreed to in principle . The proposals that the CCU put forward were that : 
 in addition to the speed of light , four constants of nature — Planck 's constant , an elementary charge , Boltzmann constant and Avogadro 's number — be defined to have exact values ; 
 the international prototype kilogram be retired ; 
 the current definitions of the kilogram , ampere , kelvin and mole be revised ; 
 the wording of the definitions of all the base units be tightened up . 
 The CIPM meeting of October 2010 found that " the conditions set by the General Conference at its 23rd meeting have not yet been fully met . For this reason the CIPM does not propose a revision of the SI at the present time " ; however the CIPM presented a resolution for consideration at the 24th CGPM ( 17 – 21 October 2011 ) to agree the new definitions in principle , but not to implement them until the details have been finalised . This resolution was accepted by the conference and in addition the CGPM moved the date of the 25th meeting forward from 2015 to 2014 . 
 = Sustainability = 
 In ecology , sustainability is the combination of the words sustain and ability . This concept makes reference to how biological systems remain diverse and productive indefinitely . Long @-@ lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems . In more general terms , sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes . The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development , which includes the four interconnected domains : ecology , economics , politics and culture . Sustainability science is the study of sustainable development and environmental science . 
 Sustainability can also be defined as a socio @-@ ecological process characterized by the pursuit of a common ideal . An ideal is by definition unattainable in a given time / space but endlessly approachable and it is this endless pursuit what builds in sustainability in the process ( ibid ) . Healthy ecosystems and environments are necessary to the survival of humans and other organisms . Ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentally @-@ friendly chemical engineering , environmental resources management and environmental protection . Information is gained from green chemistry , earth science , environmental science and conservation biology . Ecological economics studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems . 
 Moving towards sustainability is also a social challenge that entails international and national law , urban planning and transport , local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism . Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions ( e.g. , ecovillages , eco @-@ municipalities and sustainable cities ) , reappraising economic sectors ( permaculture , green building , sustainable agriculture ) , or work practices ( sustainable architecture ) , using science to develop new technologies ( green technologies , renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power ) , or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner , and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources . 
 Despite the increased popularity of the use of the term " sustainability " , the possibility that human societies will achieve environmental sustainability has been , and continues to be , questioned — in light of environmental degradation , climate change , overconsumption , population growth and societies ' pursuit of indefinite economic growth in a closed system . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name sustainability is derived from the Latin <unk> ( <unk> , to hold ; sub , up ) . Sustain can mean “ maintain " , " support " , or " endure ” . Since the 1980s sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept sustainable development , that of the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations on March 20 , 1987 : “ sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . ”

 = = = Three pillars of sustainability = = = 
 The 2005 World Summit on Social Development identified sustainable development goals , such as economic development , social development and environmental protection . This view has been expressed as an illustration using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually reinforcing . In fact , the three pillars are interdependent , and in the long run none can exist without the others . The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous sustainability standards and certification systems in recent years , in particular in the food industry . Standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include Rainforest Alliance , Fairtrade and <unk> Certified . Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability , or a quadruple bottom line . One such pillar is future generations , which emphasizes the long @-@ term thinking associated with sustainability . 
 Sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment . The question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environment . 
 A study from 2005 pointed out that environmental justice is as important as is sustainable development . Ecological economist Herman Daly asked , " what use is a sawmill without a forest ? " From this perspective , the economy is a subsystem of human society , which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere , and a gain in one sector is a loss from another . This perspective led to the nested circles figure of ' economics ' inside ' society ' inside the ' environment ' . 
 The simple definition that sustainability is something that improves " the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco @-@ systems " , though vague , conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits . But sustainability is also a call to action , a task in progress or “ journey ” and therefore a political process , so some definitions set out common goals and values . The Earth Charter speaks of “ a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature , universal human rights , economic justice , and a culture of peace . ” This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability , which included the importance of the domain of ' politics ' . 
 More than that , sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision @-@ making and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience , economic prosperity , political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future . Specific types of sustainability include , sustainable agriculture , sustainable architecture or ecological economics . Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like " liberty " or " justice " . It has also been described as a " dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development " . 
 = = = Circles of sustainability = = = 
 While the United Nations Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development , including economic development , social development and environmental protection it continued using three domains : economics , environment and social sustainability . More recently , using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade , the Circles of Sustainability approach distinguished four domains of economic , ecological , political and cultural sustainability . This in accord with the United Nations Agenda 21 , which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development . The model is now being used by organizations such as the United Nations Cities <unk> and Metropolis 
 = = = Shaping the future = = = 
 Integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities . A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy . It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable . Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020 , which is also open to participation worldwide . 
 = = Resiliency = = 
 Resiliency in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability . Resilience @-@ thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human @-@ constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to policymakers a definition remains elusive . Resilience @-@ thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the services current and future generations need from them . It is also concerned with commitment from geopolitical policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life ? The resiliency of an ecosystem , and thereby , its sustainability , can be reasonably measured at junctures or events where the combination of naturally occurring regenerative forces ( solar energy , water , soil , atmosphere , vegetation , and biomass ) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances . 
 A practical view of sustainability is closed systems that maintain processes of productivity indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems . In this way , sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced . In nature , the accounting occurs naturally through a process of adaptation as an ecosystem returns to viability from an external disturbance . The adaptation is a multi @-@ stage process that begins with the disturbance event ( earthquake , volcanic eruption , hurricane , tornado , flood , or thunderstorm ) , followed by absorption , utilization , or deflection of the energy or energies that the external forces created . 
 In analysing systems such as urban and national parks , dams , farms and gardens , theme parks , open @-@ pit mines , water catchments , one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long @-@ term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of sustainability traces human @-@ dominated ecological systems from the earliest civilizations to the present time . This history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular society , followed by crises that were either resolved , producing sustainability , or not , leading to decline . 
 In early human history , the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities . Between 8 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago , agrarian communities emerged which depended largely on their environment and the creation of a " structure of permanence . " 
 The Western industrial revolution of the 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels . Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity . Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease . In the mid @-@ 20th century , a gathering environmental movement pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed . In the late 20th century , environmental problems became global in scale . The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non @-@ renewable energy resources . 
 In the 21st century , there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human greenhouse effect , produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels . 
 = = Principles and concepts = = 
 The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields ; in recent years an area that has come to be called sustainability science has emerged . 
 The United Nations Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development , including economic development , social development and environmental protection . The Circles of Sustainability approach distinguishes the four domains of economic , ecological , political and cultural sustainability . This in accord with the United Nations Agenda 21 , which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development . 
 = = = Scale and context = = = 
 Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales ( levels or frames of reference ) of time and space and in many contexts of environmental , social and economic organization . The focus ranges from the total carrying capacity ( sustainability ) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors , ecosystems , countries , municipalities , neighbourhoods , home gardens , individual lives , individual goods and services , occupations , lifestyles , behaviour patterns and so on . In short , it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it . As Daniel Botkin , author and environmentalist , has stated : " We see a landscape that is always in flux , changing over many scales of time and space . " 
 The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability . To shed light on the big picture , explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other , more tangible closed systems . For example , he likens human existence on Earth — isolated as the planet is in space , whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources — to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water . In both cases , he argues , exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival . 
 = = = Consumption = = = 
 A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of biophysical resources , and especially , the Earth 's ecosystems . The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person , which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used , whether or not those resources are renewable , and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved . Careful resource management can be applied at many scales , from economic sectors like agriculture , manufacturing and industry , to work organizations , the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services . 
 One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the I PAT formula . This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components : population numbers , levels of consumption ( which it terms " affluence " , although the usage is different ) , and impact per unit of resource use ( which is termed " technology " , because this impact depends on the technology used ) . The equation is expressed : 
 I 
 = P × A × T 
 Where : I = 
 Environmental impact , P 
 = Population , A = 
 Affluence , T = Technology 
 = = Measurement = = 
 Sustainability measurement is a term that denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability . The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability ( involving the sustainability of environmental , social and economic domains , both individually and in various combinations ) are evolving : they include indicators , benchmarks , audits , sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic , indexes and accounting , as well as assessment , appraisal and other reporting systems . They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales . 
 Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate sustainability reporting , Triple Bottom Line accounting , World Sustainability Society , Circles of Sustainability , and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the Environmental Sustainability Index and Environmental Performance Index . 
 = = = Population = = = 
 According to the 2008 Revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections , the world population is projected to reach 7 billion early in 2012 , up from the current 6 @.@ 9 billion ( May 2009 ) , to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 . Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5 @.@ 6 billion in 2009 to 7 @.@ 9 billion in 2050 . This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15 – 59 ( 1 @.@ 2 billion ) and 60 or over ( 1 @.@ 1 billion ) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease . In contrast , the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1 @.@ 23 billion to 1 @.@ 28 billion , and this would have declined to 1 @.@ 15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries , which is expected to average 2 @.@ 4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050 . Long @-@ term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people , and then a slow decrease to 8 @.@ 4 billion by 2100 . 
 Emerging economies like those of China and India aspire to the living standards of the Western world as does the non @-@ industrialized world in general . It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability . 
 = = = Carrying capacity = = = 
 At the global scale , scientific data now indicates that humans are living beyond the carrying capacity of planet Earth and that this cannot continue indefinitely . This scientific evidence comes from many sources but is presented in detail in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the planetary boundaries framework . An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the 1972 book Limits to Growth , which has prompted follow @-@ up commentary and analysis . A 2012 review in Nature by 22 international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be " approaching a state shift " in its biosphere . 
 The Ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources , and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen . In 2008 it required 2 @.@ 7 global hectares per person , 30 % more than the natural biological capacity of 2 @.@ 1 global hectares ( assuming no provision for other organisms ) . The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways : embedded in the goods and services of world trade ; taken from the past ( e.g. fossil fuels ) ; or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage ( e.g. by over exploiting forests and fisheries ) . 
 The figure ( right ) examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN Human Development Index ( a measure of standard of living ) . The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while , at the same time , maintaining sustainable resource use . The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable . As always , population growth has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use . The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels ; that is , to not exceed " one planet " consumption . Information generated by reports at the national , regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time . 
 Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu @-@ Roegen , a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics , has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is , Earth 's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth 's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use . Leading ecological economist and steady @-@ state theorist Herman Daly , a student of Georgescu @-@ Roegen , has propounded the same argument . 
 = = = Global human impact on biodiversity = = = 
 At a fundamental level energy flow and biogeochemical cycling set an upper limit on the number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem . Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated in a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life , most notably those of water , oxygen , carbon , nitrogen and phosphorus . 
 The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world 's leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth ’ s ecosystems and provides summaries and guidelines for decision @-@ makers . It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world ecosystems , reducing both their resilience and biocapacity . The report refers to natural systems as humanity 's " life @-@ support system " , providing essential " ecosystem services " . The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last 50 years , 15 are in serious decline , and five are in a precarious condition .

 The Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) are the current harmonized set of seventeen future international development targets . 
 The Official Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted on 25 September 2015 has 92 paragraphs , with the main paragraph ( 51 ) outlining the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and its associated 169 targets . This included the following seventeen goals : 
 Poverty – End poverty in all its forms everywhere 
 Food – End hunger , achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture 
 Health – Ensure healthy lives and promote well @-@ being for all at all ages 
 Education – Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all 
 Women – Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls 
 Water – Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 
 Energy – Ensure access to affordable , reliable , sustainable and modern energy for all 
 Economy – Promote sustained , inclusive and sustainable economic growth , full and productive employment and decent work for all 
 Infrastructure – Build resilient infrastructure , promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation 
 Inequality – Reduce inequality within and among countries 
 Habitation – Make cities and human settlements inclusive , safe , resilient and sustainable 
 Consumption – Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns 
 Climate – Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 
 Marine @-@ ecosystems – Conserve and sustainably use the oceans , seas and marine resources for sustainable development 
 Ecosystems – Protect , restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems , sustainably manage forests , combat desertification , and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss 
 Institutions – Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development , provide access to justice for all and build effective , accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels 
 Sustainability – Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development 
 As of August 2015 , there were 169 proposed targets for these goals and 304 proposed indicators to show compliance . 
 The Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) replace the eight Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , which expired at the end of 2015 . The MDGs were established in 2000 following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations . Adopted by the 189 United Nations member states at the time and more than twenty international organizations , these goals were advanced to help achieve the following sustainable development standards by 2015 . 
 To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger 
 To achieve universal primary education 
 To promote gender equality and empower women 
 To reduce child mortality 
 To improve maternal health 
 To combat HIV / AIDS , malaria , and other diseases 
 To ensure environmental sustainability ( one of the targets in this goal focuses on increasing sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation ) 
 To develop a global partnership for development

 = = Environmental dimension = = 
 Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms . There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and the first of these is environmental management . This direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science , environmental science and conservation biology . However , this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human consumption , so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use . 
 Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics . Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability : renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield ( the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration ) ; for non @-@ renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes ; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment . 
 = = = Environmental management = = = 
 At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the oceans , freshwater systems , land and atmosphere , but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden . 
 = = = = Atmosphere = = = = 
 At a March 2009 meeting of the Copenhagen Climate Council , 2 @,@ 500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now " no excuse " for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction " abrupt or irreversible " shifts in climate may occur that " will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with " . Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address human @-@ induced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities ( see Energy below ) . 
 Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the air pollution in cities , the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides , sulfur oxides , volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain , and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer . Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance ( albedo ) of the Earth 's surface . Known as global dimming , the decrease is estimated to have been about 4 % between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed . Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas . It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming . 
 = = = = Freshwater and oceans = = = = 
 Water covers 71 % of the Earth 's surface . Of this , 97 @.@ 5 % is the salty water of the oceans and only 2 @.@ 5 % freshwater , most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet . The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers , lakes , rivers , wetlands , the soil , aquifers and atmosphere . Due to the water cycle , fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation , however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource . Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as , during the 20th century , more than half the world ’ s wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services . Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean , safe water . Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue ( harvestable ) and green ( soil water available for plant use ) water , and this applies at all scales of water management . 
 Ocean circulation patterns have a strong influence on climate and weather and , in turn , the food supply of both humans and other organisms . Scientists have warned of the possibility , under the influence of climate change , of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe . Ten per cent of the world 's population – about 600 million people – live in low @-@ lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise . 
 = = = = Land use = = = = 
 Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development , forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man @-@ made capital . Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation , agriculture , forest , woodland , grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water , carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems . At the local human scale , major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities . 
 Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47 % of the world ’ s forests have been lost to human use . Present @-@ day forests occupy about a quarter of the world ’ s ice @-@ free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics . In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing ( with the exception of Siberia ) , but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern . 
 Food is essential to life . Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth ’ s resources . This begins with the appropriation of about 38 % of the Earth ’ s land surface and about 20 % of its net primary productivity . Added to this are the resource @-@ hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the crop need for irrigation water , synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging , transport ( now a major part of global trade ) and retail . Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture , organic farming and more sustainable business practices . 
 = = = Management of human consumption = = = 
 The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption . This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production , use and disposal more sustainable . Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption , starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns , through to the resource demands of specific goods and services , the impacts of economic sectors , through national economies to the global economy . Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental , social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation . The ideas of embodied resource use ( the total resources needed to produce a product or service ) , resource intensity , and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption . Key resource categories relating to human needs are food , energy , materials and water . 
 In 2010 , the International Resource Panel , hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries . The study found that the most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health , human health and resource depletion . From a production perspective , it found that fossil @-@ fuel combustion processes , agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts . Meanwhile , from a final consumption perspective , it found that household consumption related to mobility , shelter , food and energy @-@ using products cause the majority of life @-@ cycle impacts of consumption . 
 = = = = Energy = = = = 
 The Sun 's energy , stored by plants ( primary producers ) during photosynthesis , passes through the food chain to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes . Since the industrial revolution the concentrated energy of the Sun stored in fossilized plants as fossil fuels has been a major driver of technology which , in turn , has been the source of both economic and political power . In 2007 climate scientists of the IPCC concluded that there was at least a 90 % probability that atmospheric increase in CO2 was human @-@ induced , mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but , to a lesser extent from changes in land use . Stabilizing the world ’ s climate will require high @-@ income countries to reduce their emissions by 60 – 90 % over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO2 levels at 450 – 650 ppm from current levels of about 380 ppm . Above this level , temperatures could rise by more than 2 ° C to produce “ catastrophic ” climate change . Reduction of current CO2 levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to energy @-@ intensive high consumption Western lifestyles . 
 Reducing greenhouse emissions , is being tackled at all scales , ranging from tracking the passage of carbon through the carbon cycle to the commercialization of renewable energy , developing less carbon @-@ hungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead carbon neutral lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all the goods and services they use . Engineering of emerging technologies such as carbon @-@ neutral fuel and energy storage systems such as power to gas , compressed air energy storage , and pumped @-@ storage hydroelectricity are necessary to store power from transient renewable energy sources including emerging renewables such as airborne wind turbines . 
 = = = = Water = = = = 
 Water security and food security are inextricably linked . In the decade 1951 – 60 human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade . This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy – especially the increase in irrigated land , growth in industrial and power sectors , and intensive dam construction on all continents . This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes , affected their water quality and had a significant impact on the global water cycle . Currently towards 35 % of human water use is unsustainable , drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers : this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe , populations increase , aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary . From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled — agricultural use increased by 75 % , industrial use by more than 200 % , and domestic use more than 400 % . In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40 – 50 % of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70 % for agriculture , 22 % for industry , and 8 % for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing . 
 Water efficiency is being improved on a global scale by increased demand management , improved infrastructure , improved water productivity of agriculture , minimising the water intensity ( embodied water ) of goods and services , addressing shortages in the non @-@ industrialized world , concentrating food production in areas of high productivity , and planning for climate change , such as through flexible system design . A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible .

 The American Public Health Association ( APHA ) defines a " sustainable food system " as " one that provides healthy food to meet current food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems that can also provide food for generations to come with minimal negative impact to the environment . A sustainable food system also encourages local production and distribution infrastructures and makes nutritious food available , accessible , and affordable to all . Further , it is humane and just , protecting farmers and other workers , consumers , and communities . " Concerns about the environmental impacts of agribusiness and the stark contrast between the obesity problems of the Western world and the poverty and food insecurity of the developing world have generated a strong movement towards healthy , sustainable eating as a major component of overall ethical consumerism . The environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors , including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food production . The World Health Organization has published a Global Strategy on Diet , Physical Activity and Health report which was endorsed by the May 2004 World Health Assembly . It recommends the Mediterranean diet which is associated with health and longevity and is low in meat , rich in fruits and vegetables , low in added sugar and limited salt , and low in saturated fatty acids ; the traditional source of fat in the Mediterranean is olive oil , rich in monounsaturated fat . The healthy rice @-@ based Japanese diet is also high in carbohydrates and low in fat . Both diets are low in meat and saturated fats and high in legumes and other vegetables ; they are associated with a low incidence of ailments and low environmental impact . 
 At the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and organic farming . At the local level there are various movements working towards local food production , more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including permaculture , urban horticulture , local food , slow food , sustainable gardening , and organic gardening . 
 Sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired . The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods . 
 = = = = Materials , toxic substances , waste = = = = 
 As global population and affluence has increased , so has the use of various materials increased in volume , diversity and distance transported . Included here are raw materials , minerals , synthetic chemicals ( including hazardous substances ) , manufactured products , food , living organisms and waste . By 2050 , humanity could consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals , ores , fossil fuels and biomass per year ( three times its current amount ) unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption . Developed countries ' citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita , ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable . 
 Sustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of dematerialization , converting the linear path of materials ( extraction , use , disposal in landfill ) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible , much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature . This approach is supported by product stewardship and the increasing use of material flow analysis at all levels , especially individual countries and the global economy . The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non @-@ renewables from a life cycle standpoint . 
 Synthetic chemical production has escalated following the stimulus it received during the second World War . Chemical production includes everything from herbicides , pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances . Apart from the build @-@ up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere , chemicals of particular concern include : heavy metals , nuclear waste , chlorofluorocarbons , persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation . Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless there needs to be rigorous testing of new chemicals , in all countries , for adverse environmental and health effects . International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods . The effects of some chemical agents needed long @-@ term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health . The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer . 
 Every economic activity produces material that can be classified as waste . To reduce waste industry , business and government are now mimicking nature by turning the waste produced by industrial metabolism into resource . <unk> is being encouraged through the ideas of industrial ecology , ecodesign and <unk> . In addition to the well @-@ established “ reduce , reuse and recycle , ” shoppers are using their purchasing power for ethical consumerism . 
 The European Union is expected to table by the end of 2015 an ambitious Circular Economy package which is expected to include concrete legislative proposals on waste management , ecodesign and limits on land fills . 
 = = Economic dimension = = 
 On one account , sustainability " concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption , wealth , utility , or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons . " Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity . Sustainability economics represents : " ... a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective . Social , cultural , health @-@ related and monetary / financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis . " However , the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare , resources , or profit margins . At present , the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high @-@ consumption Western lifestyles . The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable . The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact . This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between , on the one hand , economic growth and on the other , environmental damage and resource depletion . 
 A recent UNEP report proposes a green economy defined as one that “ improves human well @-@ being and social equity , while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities ” : it " does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital " . The report makes three key findings : “ that greening not only generates increases in wealth , in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital , but also ( over a period of six years ) produces a higher rate of GDP growth ” ; that there is “ an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons , arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor ” ; " in the transition to a green economy , new jobs are created , which in time exceed the losses in “ brown economy ” jobs . However , there is a period of job losses in transition , which requires investment in re @-@ skilling and re @-@ educating the workforce ” . 
 Several key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform : the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth ; the consequences of nature being treated as an economic externality ; and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior . 
 = = = Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth = = = 
 Historically there has been a close correlation between economic growth and environmental degradation : as communities grow , so the environment declines . This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers , economic growth , and environmental indicators . Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer because it eats away at the Earth 's ecosystem services which are its life @-@ support system . There is concern that , unless resource use is checked , modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through overexploitation of their resource base . While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources , ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale ( rather than continual growth ) , fair distribution and efficient allocation , in that order . The World Business Council for Sustainable Development states that " business cannot succeed in societies that fail " . 
 In economic and environmental fields , the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality . When used in this way , it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure . Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism , the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality . An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled . Exactly how , if , or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate . In 2011 the International Resource Panel , hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals , ores , fossil fuels and biomass per year – three times its current rate of consumption – unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling . The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum ( ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries ) . By comparison , the average person in India today consumes four tons per year . Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity ( the amount of resource ( e.g. water , energy , or materials ) needed for the production , consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service ) whether this be achieved from improved economic management , product design , or new technology . 
 There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation . On the one hand , it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity ( i.e. , energy and materials use per unit GDP ) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five @-@ fold , thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution . On the other hand , an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth , in large part because of the rebound effect ( conservation ) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution . Furthermore , there are inherent thermodynamic ( i.e. , second law of thermodynamics ) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements . For example , there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food , and there are limits to making automobiles , houses , furniture , and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions . Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely , it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution , i.e. , economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run . Consequently , long @-@ term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant , as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community . 
 A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the restore approach . This approach views " restore " as a fourth component to the common reduce , reuse , recycle motto . Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources . These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects , but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects . 
 = = = Nature as an economic externality = = = 
 The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free . In general , as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality , technical innovation and alternative products . However , this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system . As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are <unk> and therefore overused and degraded , a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons . 
 One approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to " internalize " these " externalities " by using market strategies like ecotaxes and incentives , tradeable permits for carbon , and the encouragement of payment for ecosystem services . Community currencies associated with Local Exchange Trading Systems ( LETS ) , a gift economy and Time Banking have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment . Green economics is another market @-@ based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment . The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world 's carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years . 
 = = = Economic opportunity = = = 
 Treating the environment as an externality may generate short @-@ term profit at the expense of sustainability . Sustainable business practices , on the other hand , integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones ( i.e. , the triple bottom line ) . Growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed " uneconomic growth " as it leads to a decline in quality of life . Minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses . For example , industrial waste can be treated as an " economic resource in the wrong place " . The benefits of waste reduction include savings from disposal costs , fewer environmental penalties , and reduced liability insurance . This may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image . Energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing costs . 
 The idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the Society for Organizational Learning , the Sustainable Business Institute , and the World Council for Sustainable Development . The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of green @-@ collar workers . Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability , and led to emergence of the concept of " embedded sustainability " – defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as " incorporation of environmental , health , and social value into the core business with no trade @-@ off in price or quality – in other words , with no social or green premium . " Laszlo and Zhexembayeva 's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation : a ) better risk @-@ management , b ) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use , c ) better product differentiation , d ) new market entrances , e ) enhanced brand and reputation , f ) greater opportunity to influence industry standards , and g ) greater opportunity for radical innovation . 2014 research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services , as well as the company strategy as a whole , when right principles of innovation are applied . 
 = = = <unk> approach = = = 
 One school of thought , often labeled ecosocialism or ecological Marxism , asserts that the capitalist economic system is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability . This theory rests on the premises that : 
 Capitalism ’ s sole economic purpose is “ unlimited capital accumulation ” in the hands of the capitalist class 
 The urge to accumulate ( the profit motive ) drives capitalists to continually reinvest and expand production , creating indefinite and unsustainable economic growth 
 “ Capital tends to degrade the conditions of its own production ” ( the ecosystems and resources on which any economy depends ) 
 Thus , according to this analysis : 
 Giving economic priority to the fulfillment of human needs while staying within ecological limits , as sustainable development demands , is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism 
 A steady @-@ state capitalist economy is impossible ; further , a steady @-@ state capitalist economy is socially undesirable due to the inevitable outcome of massive unemployment and underemployment 
 Capitalism will , unless overcome by revolution , run up against the physical limits of the biosphere and self @-@ destruct 
 By this logic , market @-@ based solutions to ecological crises ( ecological economics , environmental economics , green economy ) are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism ’ s structural failures . “ Low @-@ risk ” technology / science @-@ based solutions such as solar power , sustainable agriculture , and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient . “ High @-@ risk ” technological solutions such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected . Attempts made by businesses to “ <unk> ” their practices are regarded as false advertising , and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology ( such as Walmart ’ s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power ) has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption , viz. further economic growth . Sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable / unsustainable . Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate — and capitalist governments to implement — constraints on maximum profit ( such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures ) renders environmental reforms incapable of facilitating large @-@ scale change : “ History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements . . . at a certain point , at which the system ’ s underlying accumulation drive is affected , its resistance to environmental demands stiffens . ” They also note that , up until the event of total ecological collapse , destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation ; thus , capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters ( i.e. convert to sustainable / ecological production ) . 
 Ecosocialists advocate for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism — an egalitarian economic / political / social structure designed to harmonize human society with non @-@ human ecology and to fulfill human needs — as the only sufficient solution to the present @-@ day ecological crisis , and hence the only path towards sustainability . Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists , environmental activists , and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in Nature : “ What every environmentalist needs to know . . . is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem , and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis , it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom , through social struggle , in order to create a whole new world — in coevolution with the planet . ” 
 = = Social dimension = = 
 Sustainability issues are generally expressed in scientific and environmental terms , as well as in ethical terms of stewardship , but implementing change is a social challenge that entails , among other things , international and national law , urban planning and transport , local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism . " The relationship between human rights and human development , corporate power and environmental justice , global poverty and citizen action , suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice . " 
 = = = Peace , security , social justice = = = 
 Social disruptions like war , crime and corruption divert resources from areas of greatest human need , damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future , and generally threaten human well @-@ being and the environment . Broad @-@ based strategies for more sustainable social systems include : improved education and the political empowerment of women , especially in developing countries ; greater regard for social justice , notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries ; and intergenerational equity . Depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of “ resource wars ” . This aspect of sustainability has been referred to as environmental security and creates a clear need for global environmental agreements to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries , and to protect shared global systems including oceans and the atmosphere . 
 = = = Poverty = = = 
 A major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty . It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation . Such acknowledgment has been made by the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future and the Millennium Development Goals . There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues : according to the Brundtland report , “ poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems . It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality . ” Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs ( such as nutrition and medicine ) and general well @-@ being . As population growth continues to increase , increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials . According to the UN Population Fund , high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated , and the world ’ s poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates . The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment . For example , teaching water treatment to the poor by boiling their water with charcoal , would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy , whereas using PET solar water disinfection would be . Also , sustainable best practices can involve the recycling of materials , such as the use of recycled plastics for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country 's timber base . Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries , such as Bridges to Prosperity 's use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa . 
 = = = Human relationship to nature = = = 
 According to Murray Bookchin , the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in hierarchical societies . Bookchin contends that capitalism and market relationships , if unchecked , have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited . Nature is thus treated as a commodity : “ The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital . ” Social ecology , founded by Bookchin , is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity 's present ecological problems originate in , indeed are mere symptoms of , dysfunctional social arrangements . Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical , biological , economic etc . , studies , Bookchin 's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences . 
 A pure capitalist approach has also been criticized in Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change to mitigation the effects of global warming in this excerpt ... 
 “ the greatest example of market failure we have ever seen . ” 
 Deep ecology is a movement founded by Arne <unk> that establishes principles for the well @-@ being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms . The movement advocates , among other things , a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world . To achieve this , deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic , technological , and ideological structures that will improve the quality of life rather than the standard of living . Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen . The concept of a billion @-@ year <unk> has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species ( for example through artificial photosynthesis ) allowing Rights of Nature .

 One approach to sustainable living , exemplified by small @-@ scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages , seeks to create self @-@ reliant communities based on principles of simple living , which maximize self @-@ sufficiency particularly in food production . These principles , on a broader scale , underpin the concept of a bioregional economy . These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of open source appropriate technology . 
 Other approaches , loosely based around New Urbanism , are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport . Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles , and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures , compared with those living in sprawling suburbs . In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction , that appreciates and develops smart growth , architectural tradition and classical design . This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture , as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl . Both trends started in the 1980s . The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl . 
 Large scale social movements can influence both community choices and the built environment . Eco @-@ municipalities may be one such movement . Eco @-@ municipalities take a systems approach , based on sustainability principles . The eco @-@ municipality movement is participatory , involving community members in a bottom @-@ up approach . In Sweden , more than 70 cities and towns — 25 per cent of all municipalities in the country — have adopted a common set of " Sustainability Principles " and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations . There are now twelve eco @-@ municipalities in the United States and the American Planning Association has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles . 
 There is a wealth of advice available to individuals wishing to reduce their personal and social impact on the environment through small , inexpensive and easily achievable steps . But the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes , at all levels and contexts of society . The United Nations has recognised the central role of education , and have declared a decade of education for sustainable development , 2005 – 2014 , which aims to " challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future " . The Worldwide Fund for Nature proposes a strategy for sustainability that goes beyond education to tackle underlying individualistic and materialistic societal values head @-@ on and strengthen people 's connections with the natural world . 
 = = = Human and labor rights = = = 
 Application of social sustainability requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights , prevention of human trafficking , and other human rights risks . These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities . The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability , and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services . The Equator Principles ( financial industry ) , Fair Wear Foundation ( garments ) , and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives . Resources are also available for verifying the life @-@ cycle of products and the producer or vendor level , such as Green Seal for cleaning products , NSF @-@ 140 for carpet production , and even labeling of Organic food in the United States .

 = Butterfly ( Mariah Carey song ) = 
 " Butterfly " is a song by American singer @-@ songwriter Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album of the same name . It was released as the second single from the album on December 1 , 1997 by Columbia Records . The song was written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff ; both of them producing and arranging the song as well . " Butterfly " is a ballad combining elements of pop and gospel genres . Carey had originally conceived it as a house record with David Morales titled " Fly Away ( Butterfly Reprise ) " . After realizing how personal the lyrics were and how they could be applied to Butterfly , she wrote the album 's title track with Afanasieff . On the song 's lyrics , Carey sings to someone , telling them to spread their wings and release into the world on their own , like a butterfly . 
 The song 's music video depicts Carey in an abandoned house , trapped in a desolate life . As the video progresses , she leaves , apparently for the first time in years , and runs into a nearby meadow . Towards the end , Carey jumps over a barbed fence and goes out into the world on a horse . The song 's lyrics and video were directly connected to Carey 's personal life at the time . " Butterfly " was performed live on the Late Show with David Letterman , Saturday Night Live and various European television programs . The song was also a permanent part of the set @-@ list during her Butterfly World Tour during 1998 . Due to current conflict with Columbia , " Butterfly " was never issued a commercial release , therefore hindering its charting ability . The song performed weakly on the charts , peaking outside the top twenty in most countries , except for New Zealand , where it peaked at number 15 . In the United States , " Butterfly " was not eligible to chart on the Hot 100 due to Billboard rules at the time . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the recording for Butterfly , Carey was in the midst of her separation from then husband , Tommy Mottola . While writing the material for the album , she wrote a house music record titled " Fly Away ( Butterfly Reprise ) " with David Morales . When the song was finished , Carey felt there was something more she could do with the song ; the lyrics were very personal and a perfect fit for a ballad . After contemplating on the matter , Carey re @-@ wrote " Fly Away " in ballad form , and incorporated new lyrics and vocals . 
 " It was ' 97 and I was leaving my marriage [ to Tommy Mottola ] . which encompassed my life . I was writing the song ' Butterfly ' wishing that that 's what he would say to me . There 's a part that goes , ' I have learned that beauty / has to flourish in the light / wild horses run unbridled / or their spirit dies / you have given me the courage / to be all that I can / and I truly feel ... [ sings ] and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you 're ready to land . ' At that point I really believed that I was going to go back to the marriage – I didn 't think I was going to leave forever . But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back . Had it been , ' Go be yourself , you 've been with me since you were a kid , let 's separate for a while , ' I probably would 've . " 
 The song was named " Butterfly " and became Carey 's " favorite and most heartfelt ballad . " Its lyrics were very personal , linking to Carey 's personal life and relationship with Mottola . Carey wrote " Butterfly " for Mottola , hoping he would say its contents to her , and choose to do what was best for her . She described the song as " the best ballad she had ever written " and credited it as the epitome of her magnum opus , which was Butterfly . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Butterfly " is a personal ballad , which blends pop , gospel and R & B genres . It incorporates piano and drum notes , including heavy beats and grooves . As part of " layering the song , " background vocals are featured throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge . It is set in the signature common time , and is written in the key of G ♭ major . It features a basic chord progression of A ♭ -F ♭ -1 . Carey 's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G ♭ 3 to the high note of A6 ; the piano and guitar pieces range from G ♭ 3 to G ♭ 5 as well . The song contains choral lyrics written by Carey , who produced the song 's melody and chorus as well . Aside from assisting with its writing and chord progression , Afanasieff co @-@ arranged and produced the track as well . In his review for the album , David Browne commented on the song 's lyrics and message " The title song , a slice of florid pop gospel , explores the old if @-@ you @-@ love @-@ someone @-@ set @-@ her @-@ free theme ; It isn 't a reach to interpret these songs as describing life with the reportedly controlling Mottola .

 Paul Verna from Billboard gave the song a positive review , writing " the lovely ' Butterfly ' is classic Carey , from its gospel @-@ kissed ballad instrumentation and choir chants to the diva 's soaring , glass @-@ shattering performance . " Verna concluded his review of the song " This should not imply , however , that she is covering crusty old ground . The notable maturity in her lyrics and worldly warmth of her vocal reflect the growth that she has continually strived to attain . " Rick Juzwiak from Slant gave the song a mixed review , but felt it was a pivotal part of Carey 's vocal and musical transition . Juzwiak wrote " The agonizingly slow ' Butterfly , ' with its predictably soaring chorus and if @-@ it @-@ comes @-@ back @-@ it @-@ was @-@ meant @-@ to @-@ be message , would have been ignorable tripe . Here , it 's a show for the peeping . Echoes of her newly failed relationship with Mottola bounce off the gospelly song 's cheap stained glass and then garble so that it sounds like some insane document of Stockholm Syndrome . " He felt however , that the song was an important part of the album , " It isn 't just subject matter that elevates ' Butterfly ' above Carey 's usual melodrama . Carey 's vocal delivery and her willingness to experiment with it helped define the album , so it 's only appropriate that its title track is the first of many to showcase Carey 's much @-@ debated ' whisper voice . ' "

 " Butterfly " was a moderate success on the charts , performing weakly in many music markets . In the United States , Billboard rules at the time did not allow non @-@ commercially released singles to chart on the Hot 100 . Songs were required to have been issued a commercial release in order to chart , therefore not qualifying " Butterfly . " However , due to live promotion and popularity , the song charted on the Hot 100 Airplay , peaking at number sixteen . In Canada , the song entered the RPM Singles Chart at number 57 on the RPM issue dated November 3 , 1997 , and reached its peak of number 22 on December 1 , 1997 . It was present on the chart for a total of 14 weeks . 
 The song 's success in Europe was very limited as well , due to its non @-@ commercial release . In the United Kingdom , the song entered the singles chart at its peak of 22 , the week of December 13 , 1997 . " Butterfly " stayed in the chart for six weeks , falling out of the chart the week of January 17 , 1998 . In France and The Netherlands , the song peaked at number 43 and 52 , respectively . In Australia , " Butterfly " cracked the top @-@ 40 , peaking at number 27 and spending a total of ten weeks on the chart .

 = = Music video = = 
 The single 's music video was co @-@ directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl . It was inspired by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night . The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning ; only his feet are shown . Carey is first seen residing in the old abandoned house , in the middle of a large meadow . She awakes , sad and depressed , with the viewer making notice or her battered and disheveled clothing . As she walks down the stairs , Carey sits on the staircase , lamenting in agony at her loneliness . As the video climaxes , Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer , apparently for the first time in many years , escaping from the misery she once called home . As she reaches the outskirts of the property , Carey mounts a horse , which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence . After leaving , Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video , while waiving her arms in the air . 
 The video drew many comparisons to the rumors of Carey 's deteriorating marriage at the time . Author Chris Nickson felt the video , like the song , served as a metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time . Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling , abusive and would even monitor Carey 's phone calls . For this reason , she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video , with the final moments showing her escape . It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of , and finally breaking free into the outside world . Unlike the video , the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free , because it is the best thing for them ; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness .

 " Confirmed Dead " is the 74th episode of Lost , and was first aired the United States and Canada on February 7 , 2008 . It was the second episode of the fourth season of the serial television drama on ABC and CTV . 
 The episode includes the first appearances of the main characters Miles Straume and Charlotte Lewis and the supporting character Frank Lapidus . Ken Leung played Miles Straume , Rebecca Mader played Charlotte Lewis and Jeff Fahey played Frank Lapidus . The actors were given fake scenes when auditioning to limit the leak of story information or spoilers . Mader and Fahey were different from the writers ' visions of Charlotte and Frank , but the writers changed the characters to suit them . Also , the role of Miles was changed for Leung . The episode was written by co @-@ executive producer Drew Goddard and co @-@ producer Brian K. Vaughan and directed by co @-@ executive producer Stephen Williams . 
 The beginning of the episode is set on December 21 , 2004 , or 91 days after the original characters crash @-@ land on a tropical island from Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 . During the show , flashbacks introduce the island 's latest arrivals – four people from an offshore freighter who landed on the island . The main action is of John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) leading his group to the Barracks . He begins to find out why Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson ) is afraid of the newcomers . " Confirmed Dead " was watched by 17 million Americans and received generally positive critical reception as reviewers praised the introduction of the new characters . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode 's five flashbacks focus on the reactions and activities of the freighter 's crew who made contact with the Oceanic 815 survivors ; Daniel Faraday ( Jeremy Davies ) is shown crying while watching a newscast confirming the deaths of all Oceanic 815 passengers . His caretaker asks why he is crying , and he answers that he does not know . Miles Straume ( Ken Leung ) is a medium hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home . After conversing with the spirit , Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs . Charlotte Lewis ( Rebecca Mader ) is an anthropologist who finds a polar bear skeleton bearing a Dharma Initiative collar buried in the Tunisian desert . Frank Lapidus ( Jeff Fahey ) is an alcoholic who was originally scheduled to pilot flight 815 . He phones the Oceanic hotline while watching the newscast and claims that the footage of the plane wreckage being aired on television is not authentic , while Naomi Dorrit ( Marsha Thomason ) is shown in a posthumous flashback , criticizing her employer Matthew Abaddon ( Lance Reddick ) for his choice in her coworkers . 
 After Daniel parachutes from a failing helicopter onto the island , he uses Naomi 's phone to contact George Minkowski ( Fisher Stevens ) on the ship that he came from . The next morning , on December 22 , 2004 , two of the flight 815 survivors – Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) and Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) – help Daniel find his colleagues , as the rival group led by Locke attempts to do the same . Jack and Kate find Miles , who demands to see Naomi 's body , and ascertains that Locke killed her . Locke 's group finds Charlotte , takes her prisoner , and disposes of her tracking device . Daniel 's third colleague , helicopter pilot Frank , fires a flare into the sky , leading Jack 's group to him . Frank tells Jack 's group that he managed to land the helicopter intact . After finding out that Juliet Burke ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) is one of the Others , Miles demands to know where Ben ( Michael Emerson ) is , as locating him is the freighter crew 's primary objective . In Locke 's group , several people become discontent with Locke 's revelation that he is following the instructions of Walt Lloyd ( Malcolm David Kelley ) , who had left the island a month earlier , and they also question why Ben is being kept alive . Locke holds him at gunpoint , and Ben starts to reveal information about the Kahana crew , specifically Charlotte 's identity and that he has a spy aboard the ship .

 While casting the " freighter folk " – the nickname that Lost 's executive producers / writers / show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use to refer to Daniel , Charlotte , Miles and Frank – fake names , occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned , to limit the leak of spoilers . After seeing Ken Leung guest star on HBO 's The Sopranos in April 2007 , Lindelof and Cuse wrote the role of Miles specifically for him , although it was initially reported that Leung would be playing the part of " brilliant mathematician " " Russell " . The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writer @-@ producers thought that " it would be cool if his name sounded like ' maelstrom ' " . Had he not taken the part , Lindelof and Cuse claim that Miles would have been scrapped and a new and very different character would have been written into the story instead . Leung , who was originally contracted as a recurring guest star , was quoted as saying that " Miles doesn 't know how to be social , which is great , because I don 't know how to be social . " Costume designer Roland Sanchez wanted to base one of the freighter folk 's clothing after that of Keith Richards , specifically a picture in which he wore a sleeveless vest , which he admired . Sanchez believed that Miles fitted the haggard look and bought an Armani Exchange jacket , cut off the sleeves and added a hood , and that this outfit helped Leung to develop Miles . Co @-@ executive producer / writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name " Lapidus " for years , finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus . Unsatisfied , Kitsis developed the character " Frank Lapidus , Helicopter Pilot " . According to the show runners , recurring guest star Jeff Fahey " was the first and only choice for the role " . They also commended his " intense eyes " and stated that " he has exactly the right sensibilities " for the part . Frank was not envisioned with a beard , however , the writer @-@ producers allowed Fahey to keep it for the role . The writer @-@ producers have said that Frank " never takes anything at face value [ and is ] a true conspiracy nut [ who ] has probably seen every episode of The X @-@ Files , [ which will ] pay off for him " . 
 Rebecca Mader 's audition scene was a fake flashback and she was disappointed that it was not used for the show . The character 's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast . Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American ; however , the writers preferred Mader 's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly . Lost 's writer @-@ producers compared Mader to " a young Nicole Kidman " . During the casting process , Charlotte was described as a " successful academic " . It was falsely rumored that Kristen Bell was offered the role of Charlotte ; Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part ; however , no role was offered to her . Despite never having seen Lost , Mader decided that she " was not going to leave [ the auditioning ] room until [ she ] made [ Lindelof and Cuse ] fall in love with [ her ] " . Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of Lost and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role . In the next two to three weeks , Mader – who was then signed on as a recurring guest star – watched the rest of the first three seasons , watching the third season finale a matter of hours before she began shooting her first " Confirmed Dead " scene , in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group . Mader was told little about her character by the writer @-@ producers , except that " she was sort of like a female Indiana Jones type " . Mader has found it challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives . Charlotte 's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis , which is an homage to the author C.S. Lewis , best known for The Chronicles of Narnia and various books about Christianity . Lewis was one of Mader 's favorite authors as a child and found it " wicked " and " cool " for her character to be named after him . Mader also enjoyed that she only requires a small amount of hair and makeup done , saying that " I just wanted to rough it . I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun . " Mader claims that she has " never had so much fun in [ her ] life " as when she is shooting Lost . In the episode , Charlotte 's birthday is said to be July 2 , 1979 . This led to a minor continuity error in the fifth season episode " LaFleur " , when Charlotte is depicted as being a little girl in 1974 . Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for " Confirmed Dead " listed Charlotte 's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is . This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations , the script coordinator , was the one who suggested the change . Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right . 
 Most or all of the episode was shot from September 11 to 23 , 2007 and filming overlapped with the following episode . The Tunisian desert scene was filmed on location in Oahu , Hawaii , like the rest of the episode , at a stone quarry with industrial fans blowing fake sand . A typical Lost episode contains fifty visual effects shots . Among scenes created entirely or partially with effects are the opening scene of " Confirmed Dead " , which shows what appears to be the wreckage of 815 underwater and the scene from Daniel 's perspective as he parachutes from the helicopter to the ground . In Frank 's flashback , he drops a toy plane , which spirals into a small aquarium . This shot was not intended to use effects ; however , " it 's impossible to get a toy plane to spiral the way you want it to " , according to supervisor Mitch Suskin . A tank with still water and rocks on the bottom was filmed and the plane was added in editing . Suskin said that creating effects for " Confirmed Dead " " was slightly too leisurely " because the episode aired over four months after post @-@ production began . 
 In fall 2007 , Lost 's writers presented ABC executives with the story that a salvage vessel called the Christiane I looking for the Black Rock , among other things , in the Sunda Trench would come across what would appear to be the wreckage of 815 . ABC hired the Australian company Hoodlum to design a $ 3 million viral marketing alternate reality game ( ARG ) titled Find 815 . Find 815 ran from December 28 , 2007 to January 31 , 2008 , beginning with a press release issued from ABC Medianet announcing the fictitious return of the fictional Oceanic Airlines ' return to business . The ARG – apparently the largest ever – followed Sam Thomas , an Oceanic technician who had lost his girlfriend in the crash , as he received cryptic e @-@ mails from The Maxwell Group ( a division of Widmore Industries , but nonexistent in Lost ) , joined the crew of the Christiane I and ultimately uncovered 815 . Because Find 815 was produced separately from the show and without the show 's writers , it contradicts events in the TV series . In " Confirmed Dead " , 815 is found by a man not present in the game named Ron ; Thomas is not mentioned . Lindelof and Cuse dismissed the game as not being canon ( not containing genuine information within the fictional universe ) and was largely just a bonus for fans during the between @-@ seasons hiatus .

Among the journalists who gave vague and positive reviews were Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times , Adam Buckman of the New York Post , Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune , Diane Werts of Newsday and Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle . According to Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV , " Confirmed Dead " " was met with almost universal love from the Lost fan base " and according to Jon Lachonis of UGO , the new characters were well received by the fan scene . 
 Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger wrote that " after an underwhelming pre @-@ credits sequence ... this sucker moved , and lots of things happened . We met our four new regulars , squeezed in useful flashbacks about [ them ] and even found out the real reason they 're on the island ... The flipside of all this business is that ' Confirmed Dead ' didn 't have the same emotional resonance as ' [ The ] Beginning of the End ' ... but you clearly can 't have everything in every episode . " Time 's James Poniewozik said that " What amazed [ him ] about this episode was the economy and precision with which it introduced ... the crew of the downed chopper from [ the freighter ] . Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island , and yet by the end of the episode , I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals . " Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that " Confirmed Dead " " was downright alive with fascinating new characters , mind @-@ blowing new possibilities , and exciting new theory fodder " ; however , he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed . They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television , Frank 's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery , Naomi 's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben 's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline . E ! ' s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed " hot damn ! " in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench . She also thought that " Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack 's ' wink thing ' was hilarious " and it was " awesome to see [ the pilot ] again " . Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted " watching Dan 's landing from his point of view . You can feel his panic as he 's free @-@ falling through the air , looks up at his parachute , looks down to see himself about to hit the trees ... it was amazing . " IGN 's Chris Carabott gave " Confirmed Dead " an 8 / 10 , writing that it " isn 't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a ' setup ' episode for these four new characters " and praising the new actors by writing that " Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles ' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday 's awkward mannerisms well . Fahey 's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent . " Erin Martell of AOL 's TV Squad said that " Watching ' Confirmed Dead ' was like watching my dream episode of Lost [ because ] people asked direct questions for once ... [ and ] this episode was all about the <unk> . " A day after the original broadcast , BuddyTV 's Dahl claimed that " [ the audience is ] on an epic journey , one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been " . In contrast , TV Guide 's Michael Ausiello of said that it " was thirty @-@ one flavors of awesome ... [ however ] the negatives outweighed the positives " . He had problems with Claire 's lack of grief for Charlie Pace 's ( Dominic Monaghan ) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk 's main objective . Ben Rawson @-@ Jones of Digital Spy gave " Confirmed Dead " three out of five stars , calling it " so @-@ so " , but commenting that " the new revelations in the episode are fairly startling and provide a momentary distraction from the frustrations .

 = Battle of Block Island = 
 The Battle of Block Island ( April 6 , 1776 ) was a nighttime naval encounter between the Continental Navy , returning from a successful raid on Nassau in The Bahamas on its maiden voyage , and HMS Glasgow , a Royal Navy dispatch boat . Glasgow successfully escaped capture by a fleet of seven ships under the command of Commodore Esek Hopkins , although she sustained significant damage in the encounter . 
 Several of the ship captains of the Continental fleet were criticized for their actions in the engagement , and one was dismissed as a result . Commodore Hopkins was criticized for other actions pertaining to the cruise , including the distribution of seized goods , and was eventually also dismissed from the Navy . 
 = = Background = = 
 HMS Glasgow was a sixth @-@ rate 20 @-@ gun frigate of the Royal Navy . In early April 1776 , under the command of navy captain <unk> Howe , she was carrying dispatches from Newport , Rhode Island to the British fleet off Charleston , South Carolina . ( This fleet had been assembled to launch an assault on Charleston , which ultimately failed in the June Battle of Sullivan 's Island . ) 
 The Second Continental Congress had established the Continental Navy in late 1775 . By February 1776 the first ships of the fleet were ready for their maiden voyage , and Commodore Esek Hopkins led a fleet of eight ships on an expedition to the Bahamas , where the British were known to have military stores . In early March , the fleet ( reduced by one due to tangled riggings en route ) landed marines on the island of New Providence and captured the town of Nassau . After loading the fleet 's ships , enlarged to include two captured prize ships , with military stores , the fleet sailed north on March 17 , with one ship dispatched to Philadelphia , while the rest of the fleet sailed for the Block Island channel . The fleet 's cruise was marked by outbreaks of a variety of diseases , including fevers and smallpox , resulting in significant reductions in crew effectiveness . 
 By April 4 the fleet had reached the waters off Long Island , and captured a prize , HMS Hawk , which was also laden with supplies . The next day brought a second prize , the Bolton . Hoping to catch more easy prizes , Hopkins continued to cruise off Block Island that night , forming the fleet into a scouting formation of two columns . The right , or eastern , column was headed by the USS Cabot , followed by Hopkins ' flagship , the USS Alfred , at 20 guns the largest ship of the fleet , and the left column was headed by the USS Andrew Doria , followed by the USS Columbus . Behind these came the USS Providence , with USS Fly and USS Wasp trailing further behind as escorts for the prizes . The need to provide crews for the prizes further reduced the fighting effectiveness of the fleet 's ships .
