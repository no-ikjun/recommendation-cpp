 Walters assumed command of No. 5 Service Flying Training School in Uranquinty , New South Wales , on 30 June 1943 , but the next month was posted to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea to take over No. 72 Wing following reassignment of its original commander , Group Captain Charles Eaton . Comprising No. 84 Squadron ( flying CAC Boomerang fighters ) , No. 86 Squadron ( Curtiss P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk fighters ) , and No. 12 Squadron ( Vultee A @-@ 31 Vengeance dive bombers ) , No. 72 Wing came under the control of RAAF North @-@ Eastern Area Command , and undertook air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea . Group Captain Bill Hely assumed command of No. 72 Wing in May 1944 , and Walters was appointed Director of Staff Policy and Plans at RAAF Headquarters . He was mentioned in despatches on 28 October 1944 for his " Gallant & distinguished service " in North @-@ Eastern Area , the award being promulgated on 9 March 1945 . 
 In February 1945 , Walters was promoted to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Northern Command , directing its operations in New Guinea , New Britain and Bougainville until the end of the war . Headquartered at Madang in Papua New Guinea , Northern Command had previously been a large mobile formation known as No. 9 ( Operational ) Group but had evolved into a garrison force , its mobile function supplanted by No. 10 ( Operational ) Group ( later First Tactical Air Force ) . Northern Command 's operational formations included No. 71 Wing in northern New Guinea , No. 74 Wing at Port Moresby , and No. 84 Wing on Bougainville . No. 71 Wing , commanded by Group Captain Val Hancock , supported the Australian 6th Division during the Aitape – Wewak Campaign , despite ordnance deficiencies that at one stage led to its squadrons arming their Bristol Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs . No. 84 Wing suffered shortages in pilots and equipment during the Bougainville Campaign , and morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation ; as a result , the wing 's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report , the tone of which earned a rebuke from Walters . In September , Walters represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in Wewak . 
 = = Post @-@ war career = = 
 Walters was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the King 's Birthday Honours on 25 June 1946 , for his " conspicuous service in operations against the Japanese " while leading Northern Command during the war . After completing his term as AOC Northern Command that year , Walters again became Director of Staff Plans and Policy at RAAF Headquarters . He attended the Imperial Defence College , London , in 1947 . Walters was among a small coterie of highly regarded operational commanders , including Air Commodores John McCauley , Fred Scherger and Val Hancock , earmarked by the Australian Air Board for senior leadership roles in the post @-@ war RAAF . In the short term , he remained a temporary air commodore — with the substantive rank of group captain from May 1947 — as the officer corps shrank drastically with demobilisation . He was selected as AOC Southern Area Command , hub of the RAAF 's training organisation , in March 1948 . The following month , he flew to Morotai to preside over a court @-@ martial for an RAAF airman accused of killing an officer of the Dutch merchant marine ; the airman was acquitted . 
 In January 1951 , Walters was appointed AOC RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London . That December , he was part of the Australian contingent at the Commonwealth Air Forces Conference , where an RAAF presence was sought in the Middle East ; this eventually resulted in No. 78 Wing being re @-@ formed and deployed to Malta in July 1952 . Although Walters was keen to use the opportunity to acquire the RAAF 's first North American F @-@ 86 Sabres , political realities led him to negotiate a deal whereby the wing was equipped with leased British de Havilland Vampire <unk> In October 1952 , Walters was promoted to acting air vice marshal and posted to Washington , D.C. , to head up the Australian Joint Services Staff as successor to Air Vice Marshal Scherger . Walters ' rank was made permanent in January 1954 , when he succeeded Air Vice Marshal McCauley to become AOC Home Command . Walters held this post , responsible for directing the RAAF 's combat units , for three years . His tenure witnessed the introduction of the CAC Sabre to operational service with the Air Force , when No. 3 Squadron took delivery of its first machine in March 1956 . 
 Walters was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) in the 1956 New Year Honours . In March 1957 , he was one of three candidates , along with Air Vice Marshals Scherger and Hancock , touted as possible successors to Air Marshal Sir John McCauley as Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) , the RAAF 's senior position . Though Walters was considered to be very able , Scherger had long been regarded as outstanding and was " easily the best material on offer " according to a former CAS , Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman . Scherger gained the appointment , and Walters became Air Member for Personnel ( AMP ) on 21 October . As AMP he occupied a seat on the Air Board , the service 's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the CAS . In this role Walters endorsed the recommendations of a review by the AOC Training Command , Air Vice Marshal Ian McLachlan , that led to a policy of RAAF College cadets undertaking academic degrees , in line with similar institutions in the other armed services ; the college was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy . Walters served as AMP until August 1959 . The following month he was appointed AOC Support Command , a new organisation created by merging the RAAF 's former Training and Maintenance Commands . When Scherger 's term as CAS was due to complete in May 1961 , Walters and Hancock were once more put forward to the Minister for Air as potential replacements . " Walters was again unlucky " , in the words of Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs , Hancock 's " professional ability , operational experience and personal qualities " being deemed more appropriate for the role . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Walters left the RAAF on 16 May 1962 , after completing his posting at Headquarters Support Command . His pending retirement and succession by Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy had been announced the previous November . Walters followed horse racing in private life . Survived by his wife and daughter , he died from <unk> failure in Heidelberg , Melbourne , on 19 October 1968 . He was accorded an Air Force funeral at The Scots Church , Melbourne , and cremated . His pall bearers included two former CASs , Air Marshals Sir Richard Williams and Sir George Jones , along with Air Vice Marshals Henry Wrigley , Joe Hewitt , Colin Hannah , and Douglas Candy . 
 = Typhoon Ma @-@ on ( 2011 ) = 
 Typhoon Ma @-@ on , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was a powerful typhoon that affected southern Japan in July 2011 . It was the sixth named storm and second typhoon of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season . Originating from an area of low pressure near Wake Island on July 9 , the precursor to Ma @-@ on gradually developed as it moved westward . By July 11 , it had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression , although the cyclone 's circulation remained broad . Over the following days , Ma @-@ on gradually intensified and attained typhoon status on July 14 . Favorable environmental conditions allowed for additional strengthening , and the storm ultimately attained peak ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) on July 16 . After turning northward in response to a weakening subtropical ridge , the typhoon underwent a series of eyewall replacement cycles that caused it to weaken . On July 19 , the typhoon struck Shikoku before turning southeastward and moving back over water . Slow weakening continued as Ma @-@ on succumbed to the effects of high wind shear . The system ultimately became extratropical on July 24 , and was last noted by the Japan Meteorological Agency a week later near the Kamchatka Peninsula . 
 Initially , Ma @-@ on posed a slight threat to the Mariana Islands and prompted the issuance of tropical storm warnings . However , the system remained far away from the area and only produced scattered rainfall . In Japan , hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide @-@ prone areas . Torrential rains produced by the storm , estimated at more than 1 @,@ 200 mm ( 48 in ) , led to widespread and damaging floods . Five people perished as a result of Ma @-@ on , and damage reached ¥ 3 @.@ 9 billion ( 2011 JPY , $ 50 million 2011 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of the typhoon were from an area of convection that meandered near Wake Island on July 9 . The disturbance slowly consolidated and developed a low @-@ level circulation . Based on the presence of low wind shear and generally favorable environmental conditions , tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that the system would develop into a tropical cyclone . Early on July 11 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert , and a few hours later the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) reported the formation of a tropical depression about halfway between Wake Island and the Northern Marianas Islands . The JTWC followed suit and initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 08W . 
 The depression tracked westward due to a ridge to its north . Its circulation was initially broad and ill defined , with patches of disorganized convection due to dry air . The depression was able to intensify due to generally favorable conditions , and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ma @-@ on at 0600 UTC on July 12 . Gradually the thunderstorms became concentrated around the center , despite restricted outflow to the north and west . Ma @-@ on intensified at a slower than climatological rate , although an eye feature became evident by early on July 13 . At 0000 UTC that day , the JMA upgraded Ma @-@ on to a severe tropical storm , and 24 hours later the storm intensified into a typhoon to the northeast of the Northern Marianas . By that time , it was also located about 970 km ( 575 mi ) southeast of Iwo Jima . A ragged eye became apparent on satellite imagery , and after developing an anticyclone aloft , its outflow became much better defined . 
 By July 15 , Typhoon Ma @-@ on had a well @-@ defined eye with the strongest convection in its southern periphery . It continued intensifying , and the JTWC estimated 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 220 km / h ( 135 mph ) . Late on July 15 , Ma @-@ on weakened slightly due to stronger wind shear , which caused its eyewall to break apart in the northwest quadrant . It re @-@ intensified the next day after an eyewall replacement cycle commenced . At 0600 UTC on July 16 , the JMA estimated peak 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while the typhoon was located about 1185 km ( 735 mi ) southeast of Okinawa . Around that time , Ma @-@ on began a motion to the northwest due to a weakening of the subtropical ridge , and it briefly entered the area warned by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) ; the agency gave it the local name <unk> . 
 Late on July 17 , Ma @-@ on underwent another eyewall replacement cycle and weakened , despite developing improved outflow and convection in the northern quadrant . The typhoon 's large size prevented re @-@ intensification – gale force winds extended 370 km ( 200 mi ) east of the center . In addition , the intrusion of dry air diminished thunderstorms in the western periphery . By July 18 , Ma @-@ on reached the western extent of the ridge and began a motion to the north toward Japan . The next day , it turned to the northeast as it paralleled the Japan coastline just offshore . At around 1400 UTC on July 19 , Ma @-@ on made landfall on Shikoku as a minimal typhoon . Turning to the east , the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before moving over the southern tip of the Kii Peninsula early on July 20 . After emerging from the country , Ma @-@ on turned to the southeast . Increased wind shear displaced the convection to the east , although slight re @-@ intensification was expected . However , the JTWC downgraded Ma @-@ on to a tropical depression on July 21 after the storm lost much of its convection . The circulation became ill @-@ defined , and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July 22 , noting the system was in the process of dissipation . However , the JMA maintained Ma @-@ on as a severe tropical storm until July 23 , by which time the storm had turned to the northeast . The storm became extratropical on July 24 near the Kuril Islands , lasting another seven days before dissipating east of the Kamchatka Peninsula .

 After Ma @-@ on attained tropical storm status , the Tiyan , Guam National Weather Service office issued a tropical storm watch for Agrihan , Pagan , and Alamagan . It was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning after Ma @-@ on became a typhoon , which was canceled after the storm passed the islands to the north . The typhoon produced high waves in Guam , as well as gusty winds and precipitation in an outer feeder band . 
 High waves in advance of the typhoon capsized a boat in the East China Sea , although the six passengers were rescued . Moisture from the storm extended west to Taiwan , where over 600 mm ( 24 in ) of rainfall was reported . The heavy rainfall caused flooding and mudslides that blocked roadways and forced evacuations . 
 In Japan , the typhoon was forecast to strike areas affected by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster . Officials prepared by installing a cover to prevent rain contamination . Ultimately , there still was rain contamination , and Ma @-@ on 's passage produced 2 @,@ 000 tons of radioactive water . Before the storm struck Japan , officials in <unk> , Miyazaki advised the evacuation of about 900 people in areas prone to mudslides . At least 300 airline flights were canceled due to the storm . The typhoon also caused delays in the nation 's rail system . Nippon Oil stopped shipping oil during the storm . As Ma @-@ on moved across Japan , it produced winds of 108 km / h ( 68 mph ) , along with heavy rainfall of up to 1200 mm ( 48 in ) . Rainfall in a 24 ‑ hour period reached 860 mm ( 38 @.@ 5 in ) in <unk> , Kōchi , which set a 24 ‑ hour rainfall record and exceeded the average July precipitation by 265 @.@ 5 mm ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) . The rains flooded houses and roads in the region . High rains closed several expressways , and in Shizuoka Prefecture , a blocked road stranded 96 mountain climbers . Strong winds left about 11 @,@ 000 people without power on Shikoku Island . The combination of winds and rain damaged the 385 ‑ year ‑ old Nijō Castle in Kyoto . The typhoon injured 60 people , and killed five people . One of the deaths was from a man who drowned while checking on his boat during the storm . Damage was estimated at ¥ 3 @.@ 9 billion ( 2011 JPY , $ 50 million 2011 USD ) . 
 Following Ma @-@ on 's passage , temperatures decreased across Japan , which led to a marked decrease in heat stroke deaths . Throughout the month , heat stroke deaths were 70 % less than in July 2010 . 
 = Cyclone Glenda = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Glenda ( JTWC designation : 20S , also known as simply Cyclone Glenda ) of March 2006 was among the strongest tropical cyclones to threaten Western Australia , though it weakened considerably before landfall and moved ashore in a lightly populated region . It began as a tropical low on 15 March in the Gulf of Carpentaria . The precursor disturbance drifted over Top End and later across the northeastern portion of Western Australia , and after emerging into the Indian Ocean it strengthened into a tropical storm . Aided by favourable environmental conditions , Glenda rapidly intensified to reach Category 5 status on the Australian cyclone scale , and with a peak intensity of 910 mbar it was among the strongest cyclones on record within the Australia region . On 30 March it moved ashore near Onslow as a Category 3 cyclone , and the next day it degenerated into a remnant tropical low over land . 
 The precursor disturbance produced heavy rainfall in the Kimberley region of Western Australia , causing record flooding and some road damage . Minor damage was reported at the final landfall of Glenda . Due to the sparse population and preparations made , the cyclone was not responsible for any deaths or injuries . However , its name was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On 15 March , a tropical disturbance developed in the south @-@ western Gulf of Carpentaria . It moved westward , drifting across Top End , and it exited into the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf on 22 March . The Bureau of Meteorology ( BoM ) office in Darwin , which is the local Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre , began issuing advisories on the system late on 23 March while it was located about 85 km ( 50 mi ) east @-@ south @-@ east of Wyndham , Western Australia . Environmental conditions favored intensification as an anticyclone developed over the storm , which provided good outflow and low vertical wind shear . Initially , the primary inhibiting factor was land interaction . After executing a small loop over water , the disturbance continued westward , crossing over the northern portion of Western Australia before emerging into the Indian Ocean on 26 March . It began tracking west @-@ southwestward just offshore of the Kimberley coastline , and its convection quickly concentrated . At 0000 UTC on 27 March , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified it as Tropical Cyclone 20S . Three hours later , the BoM office in Perth upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Glenda about 260 km ( 160 mi ) north of Derby , Western Australia . 
 Upon reaching open waters , Glenda quickly intensified , and midday on 27 March the BoM upgraded it to tropical cyclone status , or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane . Shortly thereafter , the JTWC followed suit by upgrading it to cyclone status just 12 hours after first warning on the storm . A wind gust of 113 km / h ( 70 mph ) was reported on Adele Island as the cyclone passed nearby . The track turned south westward around a steering ridge over Australia , aided by a mid @-@ latitude trough . By 27 March , Glenda had developed a banding eye , and subsequently began rapid deepening , with warm water temperatures of over 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) and a very favourable upper @-@ level environment . At 1200 UTC on 28 March , the JTWC classified Glenda with peak winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) about 235 km ( 145 mi ) west @-@ north @-@ west of Broome , or about 455 km ( 280 mi ) north @-@ north @-@ east of Port Hedland ; however , in a subsequent analysis , the JTWC lowered their intensity estimate to 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) . At the same time the BoM estimated the cyclone attained peak winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) with gusts to 300 km / h ( 185 mph ) , or a Category 5 on the Australian cyclone scale . Its peak intensity of 910 mbar was tied for the fifth most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin . 
 Initially , Cyclone Glenda was forecast to intensify further . However , a gradual increase in vertical shear caused the eye to become disorganised , with land interaction contributing to further weakening . The BoM maintained Glenda as a Category 5 cyclone until 29 March , and initially it was forecast to turn southward to move ashore near the populated region of Karratha at high tide . It retained its south west track and passed over several weather stations , one of which recorded sustained winds of 176 km / h ( 109 mph ) . Glenda made landfall near the less populated town of Onslow at around 10pm WST ( 1400 UTC ) on 30 March . The cyclone had weakened to a marginal Category 3 at the time of landfall . The JTWC issued its final warning on Glenda shortly after it moved ashore . The cyclone turned south and south @-@ south @-@ eastward and rapidly weakened over land in an area of increasing wind shear , and early on 31 March the BoM downgraded Glenda to a tropical low .

 The precursor system dropped heavy rainfall on 23 March in the eastern Kimberley in the state of Western Australia . The rainfall led to record flooding in the area ; the flooding washed out several roads near Kununurra , including a portion of the Great Northern Highway . Six people were evacuated due to the flooding . 
 Offshore , the threat of Glenda prompted officials to close oil , representing a lack of production of 154 @,@ 000 barrels of oil . Additionally , natural gas fields were closed , and several ports along the coastline were shut down during the passage of the storm . Prior to the storm 's landfall , officials issued a Red Alert for several communities . Storm shelters were opened in Karratha and Onslow , while a few hundred people evacuated along the coastline . 
 Glenda made landfall near Onslow , where sustained winds reached 117 km / h ( 72 mph ) . There , the storm produced a 24 ‑ hour rainfall total of 206 mm ( 8 @.@ 11 in ) , which is the sixth greatest daily precipitation on record in the town . Several other locations reported over 200 mm ( 8 in ) , though overall precipitation was less than a usual landfalling tropical cyclone . The rainfall flooded several roads . The winds downed several trees and power lines , which left about 2 @,@ 000 people in Karratha without electricity ; the power outage was quickly repaired . Several windows at the hospital in Onslow were broken , resulting in some minor water damage . Overall damage was minor , and no deaths or injuries were reported , which was credited to the storm 's weakening and preparations in the landfall area . In all , damages from the storm amounted to A $ 1 @.@ 2 million ( US $ 965 @,@ 000 ) . The disruption to shipping companies resulted in economic losses of A $ 30 million ( US $ 24 @.@ 1 million ) . Oil companies reported a loss of 500 tonnes during the economic quarter due to the cyclone . The Onslow Salt company reported upwards of A $ 20 million ( US $ 16 million ) in lost revenue . 
 Following the storm , residents and companies affected by the storm were allowed to file insurance claims . About A $ 240 @,@ 000 ( US $ 193 @,@ 000 ) was filed in repair claims for council buildings and A $ 69 @,@ 000 ( US $ 55 @,@ 000 ) in airport insurance . About A $ 99 @,@ 000 ( US $ 79 @,@ 000 ) and A $ 300 @,@ 000 ( US $ 241 @,@ 000 ) was provided in financial support for television and broadcasting infrastructure and aerodrome infrastructure respectively . 
 The Bureau of Meteorology retired the name Glenda following its usage . 
 = Édifice Price = 
 The Édifice Price ( English : Price Building ) is an 18 @-@ floor ( originally 16 ) skyscraper in Quebec City , Canada . Built in 1930 @-@ 1931 amid controversy for Price Brothers ltd . , it is the tallest building in the Old Quebec historical district , and one of the oldest skyscrapers in Canada . The building is the property of the Quebec City municipal administration , but is leased to and used by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec . A memorial is attached to the building . In 2001 , it became the location of an official residence for the Premier of Quebec , which occupies two of the upper floors . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1927 , John Herbert and Arthur Clifford Price , having inherited the prosperous Price Brothers Limited after the 1924 death of their father , Sir William Price III , decided to build a new headquarters for the company in Quebec City . They did not find anything to their liking on Saint @-@ Pierre street , at the time Quebec 's main financial district , so decided on Saint @-@ Anne street close to the City Hall . The design for the 16 @-@ floor building was awarded to Ross and Macdonald , a prestigious firm of architects based in Montreal . 
 The city , eager to demonstrate a progressive ethos , gave assent to the project despite heavy criticism that the administration was proving unable to protect Québec 's historic area because the building replaced two historic houses . Sources conflict as to exactly when construction started : one cites June 1929 to May 1930 , while another says the construction permit was delivered in December 1929 and construction began in June 1930 ; a third gives only years : 1928 @-@ 1930 . The building 's cornerstone bears an inscription reading " This stone was laid Oct. XXIX <unk> [ October 29 , 1929 ] " . However , all sources agree that construction was rapid , and the building was finished within a year . It was inaugurated in 1931 . 
 Although completed successfully , the building turned out to be little more than an extravagant nail in Price Brothers ' coffin . The Great Depression pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy , and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune . Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and ' 60s , mostly to the interior of the building . 
 In 1983 , it was acquired by the city of Quebec , which largely used it for its civil engineering division , echoing a similar situation in New York City where the Manhattan Municipal Building is an extension of New York City Hall . Soon afterwards a long term lease placed the Price Building under the management of the Société <unk> Trans @-@ Québec ( <unk> , now <unk> Cambridge ) , the real estate arm of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec ( CDP ) . Further extensive renovation began that lasted until 2005 , and included the addition of two extra floors on the inside , a terrace on the 16th floor and the installation of elevators . 
 In 2001 , the 16th and 17th floor became the Premier of Quebec 's official residence . Between 1997 and 2002 , a high @-@ end psychiatric clinic occupied floor 2 and 3 of the building . The administration has strongly affirmed the timing of this move with the Premier 's installation to be a complete coincidence . On July 12 , 2009 , tightrope walker Ramon <unk> Jr. walked 230 metres ( 755 ft ) from the 13th floor of the building to the Château Frontenac 's 15th floor as part of the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of Quebec City . 
 The construction of the Édifice Price was heavily criticized in the 1920s , both because it showed disrespect for Price Sr. ' s intention of relocating the Price Brothers company 's operations to its original business centre of <unk> ( now <unk> ) , and because the monumental construction was perceived as out of proportion in a mixed commercial and residential area where few buildings exceeded four or five floors . Criticism continued after the construction , and a few years later the city council passed a by @-@ law limiting building heights in the old town to 65 feet ( 19 @.@ 8 m ) — a size only exceeded by one other building at the time : the then seven @-@ floor Hôtel @-@ Dieu de Québec . Nowadays , however , the building is considered an architectural monument in the capital and a defining element of the city 's skyline . 
 When the project for the construction of the Le Phare Québec project for a major skyscraper in the Sainte @-@ Foy area began attracting criticism , parallels with the major controversies that surrounded Édifice Price 's construction were drawn . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Édifice Price , despite the original criticism , is considered to be very well integrated with its surroundings , and well adapted to a lot only 24 metres ( 79 ft ) wide . Of its 18 floors , 15 are used as corporate space , two constitute the Premier 's suite , and on top is a mechanical floor . This leads to conflicting numbers quoted for its floors ( 16 , 17 and 18 have been variously reported ) , compounded by the fact the retrofitted extra floors are not visible from outside the building . Two elevators , one of which is used as a freight elevator , provide access to all floors . 
 Édifice Price was constructed in the art deco style of the time , as was the neighbouring Clarendon Hotel , whose extension was completed a few years earlier . The design uses setbacks to gradually taper floor area down , yielding the typical elongated " wedding cake " shape which contributes in reducing loads and softens the building 's visual impact on the city 's skyline . The upper setbacks were later used to build balconies . Because the building is deeper than it is wide , it appears much bulkier when viewed from the side . This is reminiscent of Finnish art nouveau architect Eliel Saarinen 's work , and is the stylistic opposite of other buildings in the city such as the Château Frontenac , whose cantilever construction widens as it gets taller . Geometric motifs are carved in the Price Building 's stone cladding , especially over the first few levels . The building is topped by a more classical , specifically Châteauesque , steepled copper roof , the final composition showing Beaux @-@ Arts influences . The main exterior decorative themes are pilasters topped with palm motifs , pinnacles and a large vaulted arch with <unk> over the main entrance . 
 At ground level and inside the lobby , bas @-@ reliefs depict the origins of the Price company . During the 1920s John M. Lyle , an influential architect of the Beaux @-@ arts school , was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles , and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building . Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a hallway , and a projection at the end of the building references the bow of a ship . 
 The building 's structural steel frame was also a first for the city . It was covered in grey limestone from Saint @-@ Marc @-@ des @-@ Carrières and Queenston . Due to the rapid construction , Saint @-@ Marc @-@ des @-@ Carrières was unable to supply enough stone to keep up with demand on the building site , resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source . Saint @-@ Marc @-@ des @-@ Carrières limestone is a pearly grey , and becomes a pale beige with age , while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from <unk> fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages . 
 = = Price Memorial = = 
 In 2002 , a memorial was unveiled on Sainte @-@ Anne between the Price Building and its right @-@ hand neighbour ( 67 – 71 Sainte @-@ Anne Street , a set of rowhouses ) . The memorial ( French : Mémorial Price ) is in the form of a sculpture , entitled " L 'Homme @-@ Rivière " ( " The River @-@ man " ) . It was sponsored by the CDP and the Virginia Parker Foundation , and designed by Quebec City artists Lucienne Cornet and Catherine Sylvain . 
 L 'Homme @-@ Rivière is a statue representing a log driver at work . The logs are heavily stylized , reduced to little more than cylinders . The driver and his hook , however , are shown as transforming into a wooden plant . Its location , in a tight space between two tall buildings , gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge . L 'Homme @-@ Rivière is highly dynamic , and has been described as looking as though it is about to spill onto the sidewalk . The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec , thanks notably to Félix @-@ Antoine Savard 's famous novel <unk> , maître <unk> . 
 = = Quebec Premier official residence = = 
 An apartment on the 16th and 17th floors has been the official residence of the premier of Quebec since 2001 . These two floors , the highest habitable ones since the 18th floor is taken up by machinery , had originally been reserved for a CDP executive suite . There had been a previous attempt at offering the premier an official residence . In 1994 , the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce had bought a large residence at 1080 rue des Braves and donated it to then premier Jacques Parizeau . There were issues of security and neighbour relationships , however , and Lucien Bouchard declined to use it . He lived in a small apartment on Parliament Hill for most of his mandate . 
 In May 2001 , Bouchard 's successor Bernard Landry , who had until then lived in a three @-@ room apartment , announced that he would accept the <unk> offer of the Édifice Price apartment , and took up occupancy in November . The choice , although praised for its symbolic location , attracted criticism that the apartment , rather small and poorly lit , could not accommodate a family ( Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time ) . Some also noted that the former Lieutenant @-@ Governor 's residence , located at 1010 Chemin Saint @-@ Louis and sold in 1996 for a fraction of its estimated value , would have made an excellent choice . From 1997 an exclusive psychiatric clinic had occupied the Price Building 's second and third floors . This was moved out in 2002 ; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier 's installation to be a complete coincidence . 
 The 2 @,@ 800 sq ft ( 260 m2 ) apartment cost $ 195 @,@ 000 to build and decorate . It includes a 14 @-@ guest dining room , two bedrooms and all the associated facilities . The Premier also has access to a reception hall on the 14th floor if need be . The apartment is richly appointed with maple hardwood floors , granite and limestone ; its furnishings reproduce traditional Quebec styles , and is decorated with paintings by local artists on loan from the Musée du Québec . 
 In 2006 , renewed criticism regarding current Premier Jean Charest 's limited use of the apartment led to another proposal for a proper official residence . Charest , who heads a family of five and lives in Montreal , saw little reason to move them across the province .

 U.S. Route 40 Alternate ( Alt US 40 ) is the U.S. Highway designation for a former segment of U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 ) through Garrett and Allegany counties in Maryland . The highway begins at US 40 near exit 14 on Interstate 68 ( I @-@ 68 ) and runs 31 @.@ 80 miles ( 51 @.@ 18 km ) eastward to Cumberland , where it ends at exit 44 on I @-@ 68 . Alt US 40 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) . 
 The highway is known as National Pike because it follows the original alignment of the historic National Road . As a result , there are many historic sites along Alt US 40 , including the Casselman Bridge in Grantsville and the last remaining National Road toll gate house in Maryland , located in LaVale . 
 When the National Freeway was built in western Maryland paralleling the old National Road , parts of US 40 were bypassed . The part of the bypassed road between Keyser 's Ridge and Cumberland became Alt US 40 , and other bypassed sections east of Cumberland became Maryland Route 144 ( MD 144 ) and U.S. Route 40 Scenic . Although Alt US 40 has diminished in importance from its original status as the National Road with the construction of I @-@ 68 , it remains an important route for local traffic and serves as the Main Streets of Grantsville and Frostburg . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Alt US 40 runs from Keyser 's Ridge to Cumberland , following part of the route of the National Road through some of Maryland 's most mountainous terrain in Garrett and Allegany counties . The highway is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from the eastern junction with MD 36 in Frostburg to the intersection of Mechanic Street and Henderson Avenue in Cumberland . 
 = = = Garrett County = = = 
 Alt US 40 branches from US 40 near exit 14 on I @-@ 68 at Keysers Ridge . It runs parallel to I @-@ 68 through northern Garrett County as a two @-@ lane road with truck lanes on some uphill sections . The annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) — that is , the number of cars that use the road per day , averaged over the course of one year — is 1 @,@ 831 at the western end of Alt US 40 . For comparison , the parallel section of I @-@ 68 has an AADT of 14 @,@ 271 . Alt US 40 passes through some of the most mountainous terrain in Maryland . The route runs perpendicular to the mountain ridges in Garrett County , and as a result much of the section of the road in Garrett County runs uphill or downhill . The first mountain encountered by the highway east of Keysers Ridge is Negro Mountain . The road passes over the mountain at an elevation of 3 @,@ 075 feet ( 937 m ) , which is the highest point on Alt US 40 , and was also the highest point along the National Road . East of Negro Mountain , the highway enters Grantsville , where traffic increases , with the AADT increasing to 3 @,@ 711 , the highest traffic density on Alt US 40 in Garrett County . In Grantsville , Alt US 40 meets MD 669 , which connects with Pennsylvania Route 669 toward Salisbury , Pennsylvania . A short distance east of this intersection , the highway meets MD 495 , which junctions with I @-@ 68 and continues southward toward Oakland . East of Grantsville , Alt US 40 passes over the Casselman River on a steel bridge built in 1933 . Downstream from this bridge is the Casselman River Bridge State Park , centered on the stone arch bridge which originally carried the National Road over the Casselman River . 
 Continuing eastward from Grantsville , Alt US 40 intersects US 219 a short distance north of exit 22 on I @-@ 68 , where US 219 leaves the freeway . East of this intersection , traffic decreases , with an AADT of 1 @,@ 681 , the lowest traffic density along the entire route . The US 219 intersection is at the top of a hill known as Chestnut Ridge . 
 East of Chestnut Ridge , the highway passes over Meadow Mountain at a height of 2 @,@ 789 feet ( 850 m ) . In eastern Garrett County , traffic on the route gradually increases to an AADT of 2 @,@ 232 . Alt US 40 passes under MD 546 , which runs north from I @-@ 68 , through <unk> , to the Pennsylvania border . Although Alt US 40 does not directly intersect MD 546 , it is connected to MD 546 by way of access road MD <unk> , and also by MD 946 , which intersects Alt US 40 near the top of Little Savage Mountain . Just east , the route crosses the larger Big Savage Mountain at an elevation of 2 @,@ 847 feet ( 868 m ) before entering Allegany County . 
 = = = Allegany County = = = 
 After continuing into Allegany County , Alt US 40 descends Savage Mountain into Frostburg , where it passes through the town as Main Street . Main Street in Frostburg has the highest traffic density on the route , with an AADT of 15 @,@ 022 . For comparison , the parallel section of I @-@ 68 between exits 33 and 34 has an AADT of 20 @,@ 931 . In west Frostburg , the highway intersects MD 36 , which then follows the same road as Alt US 40 for about a mile , separating from Alt US 40 in east Frostburg . In central Frostburg , Main Street intersects MD 936 , an old alignment of MD 36 . Continuing eastward from Frostburg , traffic density decreases , to an AADT of 13 @,@ 585 at the MD 55 intersection , staying between 13 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 for the remainder of the highway . Alt US 40 passes through Eckhart Mines , where it intersects MD 638 , which connects with MD 36 north of Frostburg . In the eastern part of Eckhart Mines , the highway intersects MD 743 , which is an old alignment of US 40 which was bypassed by the roadway which became Alt US 40 . 
 East of Eckhart Mines , Alt US 40 passes through Clarysville , where it intersects MD 55 . It is near Clarysville that the terrain followed by Alt US 40 changes : from Clarysville westward to the summit of Savage Mountain , the road runs uphill , while east of Clarysville , the road follows valleys , first following the valley around Braddock Run to Cumberland , and then following the valley around Wills Creek into Cumberland . Near the MD 55 intersection is a stone arch bridge which was initially built in 1812 and rebuilt in the 1830s , and carried the National Road over Braddock Run , a tributary to Wills Creek . East of Clarysville , the highway passes through a gap carved by Braddock Run between Piney Mountain and Dan 's Mountain . I @-@ 68 , having been built later , is located on the hillside above Alt US 40 , on the Dan 's Mountain side of the gap . Alt US 40 then descends Red Hill into LaVale . At the bottom of Red Hill is the La Vale toll gate house . Built in 1836 , tolls were collected there until the early 1900s , and it is the last original National Road toll gate house standing in Maryland . In LaVale , the route intersects MD 53 , which serves as a truck bypass for US 220 to Cresaptown . Alt US 40 interchanges with westbound I @-@ 68 at exit 39 , but eastbound access is only available via MD 53 and MD 658 , which intersects Alt US 40 east of the exit 39 interchange . The highway expands to a four @-@ lane road near its intersection with MD 53 , then narrows to a two @-@ lane road near its intersection with MD 658 . East of the intersection with MD 658 , Alt US 40 turns northward , passing through LaVale toward the Narrows , bypassing Haystack Mountain to the north , as opposed to I @-@ 68 , which passes directly over Haystack Mountain , paralleling Braddock Road ( MD 49 ) . 
 Northeast of LaVale , Alt US 40 intersects MD 36 at the northern terminus of MD 36 . Alt US 40 then passes through the Narrows , a gap between Haystack Mountain and Wills Mountain carved by Wills Creek , into Cumberland , where it follows Henderson Avenue and Baltimore Avenue to exit 44 on I @-@ 68 , where Alt US 40 ends . The roadway continues eastward as MD 639 . 
 = = History = = 
 The roadway which became Alt US 40 in Garrett and Allegany counties is , with some realignments , the route followed by the National Road through western Maryland . Various historic sites associated with the National Road can be found along Alt US 40 , including a toll @-@ gate house ( La Vale Tollgate House ) and mile @-@ marker in LaVale . The toll @-@ gate house in LaVale is the last remaining toll @-@ gate house on the National Road in Maryland . Several historic bridges from the National Road , since bypassed by newer bridges , are still present along the route of Alt US 40 , including the Casselman Bridge over the Casselman River in Grantsville and a bridge in Clarysville . 
 = = = Braddock Road and the National Road = = = 
 In 1755 , during the French and Indian War , British troops under the command of General Edward Braddock completed the arduous task of building a road westward from Fort Cumberland . They largely followed an Indian trail known as Nemacolin 's Path , expanding it to a 12 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) road using only hand tools . The road construction was part of the Braddock Expedition , which was the British campaign to seize Fort Duquesne from the French and Indian forces . Although the military expedition was a failure , the road continued to be used afterwards . However , with little maintenance being done on the road , it decayed over time until by the early nineteenth century little remained of the road . The route followed by Alt US 40 today is very similar to the route followed by Braddock 's Road , with the exceptions of various realignments that have been done to the road over the years . For example , Braddock 's Road crossed directly over Haystack Mountain west of Cumberland rather than following the Cumberland Narrows as later roads did . 
 The National Road , the first road funded by the U.S. federal government , was authorized by the United States Congress in 1806 , and ran from Cumberland , Maryland , to Vandalia , Illinois . Construction started in 1811 , and by 1837 the road reached Vandalia . Many sites from the National Road remain along Alt US 40 , in particular the LaVale toll gate house , built in 1836 . Following the completion of the National Road in 1837 , the federal government ceded the road to the states to operate as a toll road , and toll gate houses such as the one in LaVale were built along its path in preparation for the transfer . Tolls continued to be collected along the National Road at the LaVale toll house until the late nineteenth century . The LaVale toll house is the first of its kind to be built along the National Road , and it is the last standing toll house along the National Road in Maryland . The LaVale toll house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 . 
 = = = Realignments = = = 
 Multiple realignments of the road that is now Alt US 40 have occurred since it was originally built as the National Road . Most such realignments are minor , such as to bypass an old bridge , but some have significantly affected the path of the road . One such realignment occurred in 1834 , when a new route for the National Road was built through the Cumberland Narrows . The previous route had followed the Braddock Road , a route which is now followed by MD 49 . The route following Braddock Road passed over Haystack Mountain and was much steeper than the newer route through the Narrows . The route through the Narrows allowed the road to bypass this steep mountain ascent . The stone arch bridge built across Will 's Creek for the new alignment remained in service until 1932 , when a new bridge which is the present bridge across Will 's Creek replaced it . The old bridge was torn down during the construction of the Will 's Creek flood control system in the 1950s . 
 Another realignment of Alt US 40 occurred in Eckhart Mines , where in 1969 the road , then designated as US 40 , was realigned to the north , bypassing the section of the highway through Eckhart Mines , which has a lower speed limit and sharp curves . The speed limit on the old alignment is 25 miles per hour ( 40 km / h ) , and the new alignment has a speed limit of 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) along most of the bypass . The new alignment intersects the old alignment , designated as MD 743 , on the east end between MD 638 and MD 55 . The west end of the old alignment meets MD 36 just south of its intersection with Alt US 40 . MD 638 , which prior to the realignment ended at US 40 , was not truncated , and thus ends at MD 743 . 
 = = = Historic bridges = = = 
 There are several historic bridges along the National Road that are still present near the current route of Alt US 40 . Among them are the Casselman River bridge in Grantsville , and the bridge over Braddock Run , a tributary of Wills Creek , in Clarysville . The original National Road bridge over the Casselman River was a stone arch bridge constructed in 1813 . The 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) span was built to be the largest bridge of its type in the United States at the time , and during its construction it was believed that the bridge could not stand on its own . The bridge was constructed in this manner in the hopes that the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal would eventually pass under it , though construction on the canal was stopped at Cumberland in 1850 . When US 40 was first designated in 1925 , it crossed the Casselman River on the original stone bridge . In 1933 , a new steel bridge was constructed to replace the National Road bridge , and it is this bridge that Alt US 40 now follows . The original bridge was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964 , and is now part of the Casselman River Bridge State Park . 
 Another historic bridge stands in Clarysville , near the intersection of Alt US 40 and MD 55 . This bridge , which crosses Braddock Run , was built in 1812 , with later work being done in 1843 . The stone arch bridge , located just south of the current alignment of Alt US 40 , was restored in 1976 . 
 = = = Origins of Alt US 40 = = = 
 Prior to the construction of I @-@ 68 , US 40 followed the route currently designated as U.S. Route 40 Alternate . The first segment of what would become I @-@ 68 was built in Cumberland in the mid @-@ 1960s . The freeway , first designated as US 48 , was extended westward through the 1970s , reaching West Virginia in 1976 . The portions of US 40 that were bypassed between Cumberland and Keysers Ridge became U.S. Route 40 Alternate , which first appeared on MDSHA maps in the early 1980s . At this time , US 40 was realigned to follow the US 48 freeway , sharing the freeway with US 48 . In 1991 the freeway was completed from Hancock to Morgantown , West Virginia . The US 48 designation was retired , and on August 2 , 1991 , the freeway became I @-@ 68 .

 The Generous Mr. Lovewell is the sixth studio album by Christian rock band MercyMe . Released in May 2010 , the album is a concept record revolving around a fictional character , ' Mr. Lovewell ' , and the overall theme of love . Produced by Brown Bannister and Dan Muckala , the album met with positive critical and commercial reception . The album sold over 88 @,@ 000 copies its first week and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and at number one on the Christian Albums chart . 
 Three singles were released in promotion of the album , all of them reaching number one on Billboard 's Christian Songs chart . Lead single " All of Creation " spent ten weeks at the top of the Christian Songs chart , also peaking at No. 14 on the Heatseekers Songs chart and No. 2 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart . " Beautiful " and " Move " also reached number one on the Christian Songs chart , holding the top spot for one and nine weeks , respectively , with " Move " also peaking at No. 20 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart .

 The idea for the character of " Mr. Lovewell " and the album came up while the band was attempting to figure out concepts for the record . According to lead singer Bart Millard " we [ MercyMe ] were trying to come up with the concept for our next record . For some reason , the words ' love well ' got stuck in my head " . Millard elaborated that " we 're very good , as a nation , at loving well when a massive tragedy takes place ... We all of a sudden become very unified , which is a great , great thing . But on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis , we pass up opportunities . We look the other way , or we try to ignore . So the idea of loving well is almost a kind of ' pay it forward ' that revolves around the cross " . With that general idea , MercyMe was going to name the album Love Well . However , the band decided to make a character that personifies the idea of ' loving well ' , and came up with the character of ' Mr. Lovewell ' , partly inspired by The Beatles ' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . Because of the character and the more diverse sound the album was going to have , the band felt the original name didn 't fit and changed the album name to reflect the character of ' Mr. Lovewell ' . Millard has described the character of ' Mr. Lovewell ' as " like Buddy the Elf meets Forrest Gump . He sees the good in everyone and knows his neighbors enough to know their needs . Mr. Lovewell may not be the next Billy Graham , but he ’ s changing the world each day in every little word and deed . ” 
 The concept of ' loving well ' was further developed when the band made a trip to the Dominican Republic and were inspired by the resilient spirits of people living in poverty on the island . When the band started to write the songs for the album , they joined the character of ' Mr. Lovewell ' and the concept of ' loving well ' , creating the overall message of love that is present in the album . Millard stated the band 's dream for the album was " to inspire others to ‘ pay it forward ’ to the cross . It doesn ’ t have to be about major sacrifices . Just let your life become such that people know what you stand for " . 
 The album was recorded mostly by Reid Shippen at Sonic Ranch in El Paso , Texas , with the exceptions of " Won 't You Be My Love " and " All of Creation " , which were recorded by Steve Bishir at Quad Studios .

 MercyMe wanted to get out of their comfort zone with the overall sound of the album , and brought in producer Dan Muckala . Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music , meaning the band didn 't think much about the overall length of the songs . MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration . 
 The songs on the album often vary in genre , with many falling outside of MercyMe 's usual adult contemporary sound . Songs on the album take influences from many genres , including electronic rock on " This Life " and dance music / dance @-@ rock on " Move " . " All of Creation " , " Only You Remain " , and " Won 't You Be My Love " have a more general worship or Adult Contemporary feel , while the title track takes a musical feel similar to that of The Beatles .

 The album 's lyrical content generally revolves around a theme of unconditional love and a concept MercyMe has called ' loving well ' . Other lyrical themes include worship and selflessness . 
 Individual songs vary on the overall theme of love . " Beautiful " was written for the daughters of the band members , expressing the Christian viewpoint that Jesus saw something beautiful , something worth dying for , in everyone . " This So Called Love " expresses the belief that all good deeds done absent of Jesus are in vain .

 Critical reception to The Generous Mr. Lovewell was generally positive . Giving the album four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars , Allmusic reviewer Jared Johnson stated " If you only know MercyMe for their 2001 ubiquitous AC crossover hit " I Can Only Imagine , " you 've missed out on some of the Christian genre 's most accessible and well @-@ known hits – which means you might not fully appreciate the full artistic statement that the band makes on The Generous Mr. Lovewell , a daring reinvention that drove the band far outside its comfort zone and sparked a national social trend in the process , " also noting that " the band 's collaboration with Brown Bannister and Dan Muckala delivers the messages with authenticity and contemporary new sounds that make it perfectly believable to envision a world in which Lovewell 's considerate and genuine actions are manifest in the lives of real everyday people " . Kevin Davis of Christian Music Review , giving the album an A + , opined that the album reminds him " of a classic theme album like Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles or Songs For Jane [ sic ] by Maroon 5 , both in musical diversity and with the challenging lyrics " and " truly establishes MercyMe as the premier artist in all of Christian music " . 
 Kevin McNeese of NewReleaseTuesday gave the album five out of five stars , opining that " [ The Generous Mr. Lovewell ] takes the formula that MercyMe has perfected and drop kicks it out of Mr. Lovewell 's window " . Roger Gelwicks of Jesus Freak Hideout was even less positive , opining that " MercyMe is still on top of their game ... however , The Generous Mr. Lovewell is undeniably a pretty forgettable record , and while there are a few gems to be found , it 's only going to appeal to the already @-@ existent fanbase MercyMe has garnered after all these years " , also stating that " MercyMe still has great things to say and their musical progression has been adequate enough , but it 's hard to see their sixth record as anything extraordinary and more desirable than their previous material . " Billboard reviewer Deborah Evans Price commented that " from the buoyant opener " This Life " to the brief but eloquent closer " This So Called Love , " MercyMe 's sixth studio album , " The Generous Mr. Lovewell , " is a beautifully executed set that celebrates how the power of love can change the world ... Music with a message has never sounded lovelier " . 
 At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards , The Generous Mr. Lovewell was nominated for Top Christian Album and " All of Creation " was nominated for Top Christian Song . At the 42nd GMA Dove Awards , " All of Creation " was nominated for Song of the Year and Pop / Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year .

 = Billy DeBeck = 
 William Morgan DeBeck ( April 15 , 1890 – November 11 , 1942 ) , better known as Billy DeBeck , was an American cartoonist . He is most famous as the creator of the comic strip Barney Google , later retitled Barney Google and Snuffy Smith . The strip was especially popular in the 1920s and 1930s , and featured a number of well @-@ known characters , including the title character , Bunky , Snuffy Smith , and Spark Plug the race horse . Spark Plug was a merchandising phenomenon , and has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s . 
 DeBeck drew with a scratchy line in a " big @-@ foot " style , in which characters had giant feet and bulbous noses . His strips often reflected his love of sports . In 1946 , the National Cartoonists Society inaugurated the Billy DeBeck Memorial Awards ( or the Barney Awards ) , which became the Reuben Award in 1954 . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 William Morgan DeBeck was born on April 15 , 1890 on the South Side of Chicago , where his father , Louis DeBeck , was a newspaperman employed by the Swift Company . The elder DeBeck was French , and the name DeBeck was originally spelled <unk> . His Irish @-@ Welsh mother , Jessie Lee Morgan , had lived on a farm and was a schoolteacher . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 After graduating from Hyde Park High School in 1908 , DeBeck attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts . He sold cartoon drawings during this time to finance himself , at first in 1908 for the Chicago Daily News . His caricatures of models drew the attention of his fellow students , and though he had intended to become a painter in the Flemish tradition , he quit the Academy after two years after he got a cartooning job with the weekly paper Show World in 1910 . His cartoons showed the influence of John T. McCutcheon and Clare Briggs , whom he had admired in his youth ; he also had the skill to draw in the more fastidiously cross @-@ hatched style of a Charles Dana Gibson , copies of whose drawings he sold as originals . 
 DeBeck soon left Show World for better opportunities at Youngstown Telegram in Ohio as a editorial cartoonist , then again at the Pittsburgh Gazette @-@ Time in late August 1912 . He later contributed cartoons to the New York City humor magazines Life and Judge . While living in Pittsburgh , he traveled to New York to show comic strip samples to Arthur Brisbane , an editor working for William Randolph Hearst 's newspaper empire ; Brisbane rejected the work . DeBeck later stated the examples " were terrible " as he " had been doing political cartoons for the Pittsburgh Gazette , and the comics were new " to him . He returned to Youngstown and married Marian Louise Shields there in 1914 . Some time later they divorced , remarried in 1921 , and eventually divorced again . 
 In May 1915 , DeBeck and a partner named Carter launched a newspaper syndicate and correspondence cartooning course ; DeBeck 's advice to his correspondence students was : " First learn how to draw — then go to a good art school and get a firm foundation in the arts " . The school was not a success , and DeBeck returned to Chicago and joined the Chicago Herald in December 1915 . He worked on a strip called Finn an ' Haddie for the Adams Newspaper Service on the side . On December 9 , immediately after starting at the Herald , he began a strip called Married Life that so caught the attention of Hearst ; legend says that , to acquire DeBeck , Hearst bought the Herald and merged it with the Chicago Examiner , as DeBeck had refused to join the Hearst empire after the Examiner raised his monthly salary from $ 35 to $ 200 . DeBeck 's creations were first adapted to film when an animated version of Married Life appeared in a Seattle Sunday Times newsreel in 1917 . DeBeck created a number of other features , especially for the sports section , while his antics made him something of a local celebrity . 
 = = = Barney Google = = = 
 On July 17 , 1919 , a new comic strip by DeBeck in the vein of Married Life on the sports page ; Take Barney Google , For Instance differed in that it was about a henpecked , sports @-@ obsessed husband and his travails defying his wife . Google was interested in non @-@ fictional sports stories , such as the heavyweight championship between Jess Willard and Jack Dempsey . It was not long before DeBeck <unk> the tall , thin Google into the short , squat character he was to be remembered as , and the title too was soon shortened to Barney Google . It was not popular until DeBeck had Google acquire a race horse named Spark Plug ( nicknamed " Sparky " ) in a strip dated July 17 , 1922 . The dilapidated , blanket @-@ covered horse became such a marketing and merchandising phenomenon that the character has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s — toys , balloons , and games were among the popular items adorned with Sparky 's image . When DeBeck introduced the horse , he also introduced a little @-@ used technique into the strip : continuity . Barney Google went from being a gag @-@ a @-@ day strip to one in which both humor and suspense kept readers coming back each day , as Google desperately tried to get his horse to win a race . The sequence in which Spark Plug was introduced into the strip was republished in the October 1922 issue of Comic Monthly — likely the earliest newsstand comics periodical . 
 DeBeck kept readers on the edges of their seats with uncertain suspense : sometimes Spark Plug actually won a race . While DeBeck resisted at first , Hearst demanded a pretty girl be introduced into the strip . DeBeck brought in Sweet Mama , which initially created a stir , and certain papers dropped the strip , but after the phrase swept the nation , the strip 's popularity only increased . Over the years , DeBeck was credited with introducing more neologisms and catchphrases , such as " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , " <unk> " , " balls of fire " and " time 's a @-@ <unk> ' " . In 1923 , Billy Rose penned a Tin Pan Alley pop hit called " Barney Google ( with the Goo @-@ Goo @-@ <unk> Eyes ) " . A series of Barney Google live @-@ action films starring Barney <unk> appeared in 1928 and 1929 . 
 DeBeck had included a topper called Bughouse Fables ( signed " Barney Google ) " with his main strip since 1921 , though he soon handed it off to assistant Paul Fung . On May 16 , 1926 , he replaced Bughouse Fables with Parlor , Bedroom & Sink Starring Bunky , a strip that was popular enough on its own to survive until 1948 . 
 According to later Barney Google and Snuffy Smith <unk> Brian Walker , DeBeck had become " one of the highest @-@ paid cartoonists in America " at this point . In the early 1920s , DeBeck moved to Riverside Drive in New York City , and in 1927 remarried Mary Louise Dunne . The couple spent the next two years in Europe , after which they settled down again in New York . DeBeck 's active lifestyle sometimes caused him to miss deadlines . He enjoyed traveling , deep sea fishing , golf and playing bridge . As a golfer since 1916 , DeBeck spent time on courses with such notables as Harold Lloyd , Walter Huston , Rube Goldberg , Fontaine Fox , Clarence Budington Kelland and bridge authority P. Hal Sims . He was also acquainted with such celebrities as Babe Ruth , Lowell Thomas and Damon Runyon . His best friend was the cartoonist Frank Willard , who also attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts .

 Barney Google 's popularity persisted into the Depression era ; in 1933 , Fortune magazine reported DeBeck 's weekly earnings at $ 1200 . In the spring of 1934 , DeBeck hired 17 @-@ year @-@ old Fred Lasswell as an assistant after seeing his work on a poster . He wanted a letterer for Barney Google , and Lasswell 's lettering impressed him . Lasswell started by doing chores for DeBeck , as well as taking on lettering and other duties on the strip . DeBeck undertook educating Lasswell in cartooning , having him attend schools , copy the works of masters like Gibson and May , and copy line @-@ for @-@ line the artwork from DeBeck 's own comics . Lasswell moved in with the <unk> , and would tag along with them wherever they moved . He would take over his mentor 's strip after his death and continue it into the 21st century . 
 DeBeck gained a growing interest into the culture of Appalachia in the 1930s and amassed a library on the subject that he later donated to Virginia Commonwealth University . Among the books he admired were those featuring Sut <unk> by George Washington Harris ; inside Sut <unk> <unk> ( 1867 ) DeBeck produced his first sketch of Snuffy Smith , a character that grew from talking with and sketching the Appalachian hillbilly locals . Just as the strip 's circulation was starting to flag , DeBeck introduced Snuffy in a storyline in which Barney inherited an estate in the mountains of North Carolina . After dodging the ornery hillbilly 's bullets , the two became fast friends . The strip was eventually renamed Barney Google and Snuffy Smith , and Snuffy would take over from Barney Google as the central character . Lasswell , with his own country roots , provided much of the inspiration for Snuffy and his Appalachian environment . Especially , he provided a source for the locals ' dialect . Hillbilly culture enjoyed much popularity in the 1930s ; Snuffy Smith appeared the same year as Al Capp 's Li 'l Abner . By 1940 , DeBeck 's strip appeared in 210 newspapers with a combined circulation of ten million . 
 The Charles Mintz studios produced four full @-@ color animated Barney Google and Snuffy Smith shorts in 1935 . The series had two more live @-@ action adaptations in 1942 : Bud Duncan starred as Snuffy Smith in Private Snuffy Smith and co @-@ starred with Cliff <unk> as Barney Google in Hillbilly Blitzkrieg .

 DeBeck had a studio apartment on Park Avenue in New York , and homes in Great Neck in New York and St. Petersburg in Florida . In the early 1940s , he developed cancer and found it increasingly difficult to work . Sensing his end was near , he made a special trip to see Marian Shields . His last signed daily strip appeared July 4 , 1942 , and his last Sunday the following August 2 . With Lasswell contributing to the war effort , the strip continued under an assistant , Joe Musial . On November 11 , 1942 , DeBeck died at the age of 52 in New York City , with his wife at his bedside . They had no children . Barney Google appeared in 206 newspapers at the time , and Musial continued the strip until Lasswell took it on full @-@ time in 1945 . Over time , Barney faded from the strip , and the title contracted to Snuffy Smith . 
 In 1943 , Mary DeBeck donated to the Ringling School of Art all of her husband 's art supplies , including drawing tables , reams of drawing paper , hundreds of colored pencils , lamps , drawing boards , inks , drawing pens , artist smocks , etching plates , and an etching press . Mary remarried , and she died February 14 , 1953 , aboard a DC @-@ 6 from National Airlines which plummeted into the Gulf of Mexico during a thunderstorm on a flight from Tampa , Florida to New Orleans . 
 = = Style = = 
 DeBeck 's drawing style falls in the " big @-@ foot " tradition of American comic strips such as The Katzenjammer Kids , <unk> the Horrible , and Robert Crumb . It had a scratchy line and characters with bulbous noses and giant feet . Though he often procrastinated , DeBeck could work quickly and make it just in time for his deadlines . 
 DeBeck put Barney Google through great changes throughout his twenty @-@ three @-@ year run on the strip , changing situations and characters frequently . The storylines reflected the outlook of the 1920s boom years , the Great Depression , and World War II . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 DeBeck 's main strip continued in the hands of Fred Lasswell long after its creator 's death . The number of newspaper that carried it had been flagging in the years leading to DeBeck 's passing , partly because the hillbilly dialect in the dialogue was difficult to read for many . The syndicate informed Lasswell that if many more newspapers dropped the strip , it would be canceled . Lasswell refocused on Snuffy Smith , dropped much of the dialect , and moved away from continuity to a gag @-@ a @-@ day format . The strip 's popularity once again increased , and by 1989 it was running in 900 newspapers in 21 countries . It has continued in different hands since Lasswell 's death in 2001 . 
 <unk> 's hillbilly depictions , though stereotyped and distorted , had a higher degree of accuracy that those of Al Capp or other contemporary cartoonists , and painted hillbillies in a better light . DeBeck included authentic expressions such as " <unk> @-@ blank " ( " exactly " ) and " a lavish of " ( " a lot of " ) , and included explanations of dialect unfamiliar to his readers . Some such as country singer Roy Acuff objected that the strip perpetuated stereotypes of hillbilly culture . 
 DeBeck is credited with introducing or popularizing a number of neologisms and catchphrases via Barney Google , including " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> " , " balls of fire " , " time 's a @-@ <unk> ' " , " touched in the head " , and " bodacious " . 
 Charles M. Schulz , creator of the Peanuts comic strip , was nicknamed " Sparky " after DeBeck 's racehorse character , and DeBeck 's drawing style has been an influence on contemporary cartooning and popular culture , and on such later cartoonists as Robert Crumb and Bobby London . The Barney Google Sunday page for September 18 , 1938 was placed in the time capsule at the 1939 World 's Fair . 
 The National Cartoonists Society 's annual award was originally named the Billy DeBeck Memorial Award . Created by Mary DeBeck Bergman in 1946 , these were known as the Barney Awards . She also made the annual presentation of engraved silver cigarette cases , with DeBeck 's characters etched on the cover , to the winners ( Milton Caniff , Al Capp , Chic Young , Alex Raymond , Roy Crane , Walt Kelly , Hank Ketcham and Mort Walker ) . In 1954 , after her death , the DeBeck Award was renamed the Reuben Award after Rube Goldberg , and all of the earlier winners were re @-@ awarded Reuben statuettes .

 = Reginald Heber = 
 Reginald Heber ( 21 April 1783 – 3 April 1826 ) was an English bishop , traveller , man of letters and hymn @-@ writer who , after working as a country parson for 16 years , served as the Bishop of Calcutta until his sudden death at the age of 42 . 
 The son of a wealthy landowner and cleric , Heber gained an early reputation at Oxford University as a poet . After graduation he expanded his view of the world by undertaking , at the height of the Napoleonic Wars , an extended tour of Scandinavia , Russia and central Europe . He was ordained in 1807 , and took over his father 's old parish of Hodnet in Shropshire . He combined his pastoral duties with other church offices , hymn @-@ writing , and more general literary work which included a critical study of the complete works of the 17th @-@ century cleric Jeremy Taylor . 
 Heber was consecrated Bishop of Calcutta in October 1823 . During his short episcopate he travelled widely in the areas of India within his diocese , and worked hard to improve the spiritual and general living conditions of his flock . A combination of arduous duties , hostile climate and indifferent health brought about his collapse and death while visiting Trichinopoly ( now Tiruchirappalli ) , after less than three years in India . Monuments were erected in his memory in India and in St Paul 's Cathedral , London . A collection of his hymns was published shortly after his death ; one of these , " Holy , Holy , Holy " , is a popular and widely known hymn for Trinity Sunday . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Background and childhood = = = 
 The surname " Heber " is probably derived from " <unk> " , a hill in the Craven district of Yorkshire in north @-@ eastern England , where the Heber family originated . The family held the lordship of the manor of Marton , and was granted a coat of arms during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. In 1752 one of the family , Richard Heber , received the manor and estate of Hodnet Hall in Shropshire as a bequest from a cousin of his wife . The bequest included patronage of the parish of Hodnet . On Richard Heber 's death in 1766 his brother , named Reginald , who had taken Holy Orders and was co @-@ rector of the parish of Malpas in Cheshire , inherited the Shropshire estate . He then became rector of Hodnet , in addition to his share of the Malpas living . This Reginald married twice ; the first union , to Mary Baylie , produced a son , Richard Heber , who became a distinguished book collector and was Member of Parliament for Oxford University . The second marriage , after Mary Baylie 's death , was to Mary <unk> ; it produced two further sons , the elder of whom , born at Malpas on 21 April 1783 , was named Reginald after his father . 
 At the age of eight the younger Reginald began attending the local grammar school at Whitchurch , where he remained for five years . In 1796 he was sent to Bristow 's , a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London . This establishment provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys , preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge universities . At Bristow 's Reginald met John Thornton , who became a lifelong friend . The pair shared a lively interest in church history and beliefs ; a lengthy letter , written by Heber to Thornton , is described by Heber 's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being worthy of a learned theologian . In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College , Oxford ; Thornton 's decision to go to Cambridge was a matter for Heber 's considerable regret . 
 = = = Oxford = = = 
 There were strong family connections with Brasenose ; Heber 's brother Richard was at the time a fellow of the college , and his father was a former fellow . The Master of Brasenose was William Cleaver , a close friend of Reginald senior and a frequent visitor to Hodnet Hall . In his first year at Oxford Heber acquired distinction by winning the University Prize for Latin Verse . He began to develop a local reputation as a Romantic poet , and in 1803 successfully entered his long poem " Palestine " for the Newdigate Prize . He had been helped in this composition by Walter Scott , a family friend , before the future novelist 's years of fame . When Heber declaimed the poem at that year 's Encaenia ceremony at the Sheldonian Theatre , it was given an enthusiastic reception . The poem was later published , and was set to music by the composer William Crotch , who had been professor of music at Oxford since 1797 . Montefiore , writing in 1902 , described the poem as " the most successful and popular piece of religious verse of the first half of the [ 19th ] century " . Heber 's later biographer Derrick Hughes finds its contemporary acclaim puzzling : " It is not a good , not even a mediocre poem ; it is leaden " . 
 In February 1804 Reginald senior died , leaving the living of the parish of St Luke , Hodnet vacant ; this may have prompted Heber 's own decision to seek ordination , though he delayed this for some years . In his degree examinations he acquitted himself honourably rather than brilliantly ; Montefiore quotes a contemporary 's view that Heber 's main contribution to university life was in fields outside formal academic success , particularly as a thinker , a poet and an orator : " Reginald Heber was a star whose lustre was as steady as it was clear " . He took his bachelor 's degree in the summer of 1804 , and was elected to a fellowship of All Souls College , Oxford . He also won the University 's Bachelor 's Prize for an English prose essay . 
 = = = European journey = = = 
 Heber and Thornton had planned to follow their graduation with a Grand Tour of Europe . However , in 1804 the Napoleonic Wars made much of Europe inaccessible , so the pair delayed their departure until the summer of 1805 and organised a route through Sweden , Norway and Finland to Russia , instead of the traditional journey through France and Italy . In July 1805 , they sailed for Gothenburg in Sweden , then travelled northward by stagecoach , via Vänern and Uddevalla , to Kristiania ( Oslo ) in Norway . After a short stay in the city they moved further north , through the wild Dovre Region to Trondheim , where they observed the practice of skiing for the first time ( Heber referred to it as " skating " ) . 
 The two travellers then turned south @-@ east , re @-@ entered Sweden and travelled through Uppsala to Stockholm . Towards the end of September they crossed the Gulf of Bothnia to Åbo ( Turku ) , the site of Europe 's most northerly university , in the part of Finland then under Swedish sovereignty . They proceeded eastwards to the Russian border , and reached St Petersburg at the end of October . They spent two months in the city ; through influential contacts at the British Embassy they visited places generally inaccessible to the public , including Tsar Alexander 's private quarters in the Winter Palace . They experienced Muslim worship at first hand , as the city 's large Muslim population observed Ramadan ; Heber described the crowds gathered for prayer in an improvised mosque as " the most decent and attentive congregation [ he ] had seen since leaving England " . 
 Heber and Thornton had intended to remain in St Petersberg until after the new year and then , if the circumstances of the war permitted , to return home through Germany . Napoleon 's victory at Austerlitz on 2 December 1805 , and the treaties which followed it , led them to alter this plan . They decided to extend their stay in Russia , with a visit to the ancient Muscovy capital , Moscow , before going on to the regions of the south . On 31 December 1805 they left St Petersberg by sledge for the 500 @-@ mile journey to Moscow , where they arrived on 3 January . They found it a hospitable city — in a letter home Heber refers to it as an " overgrown village " — and the pair formed friendships with many of its leading citizens and clergy . They left by stagecoach on 13 March , heading south towards the Crimea and the Black Sea . This journey took them through the Cossack country of the Don River Basin . Heber sent home a vivid account of the night celebrations for Easter at Novo <unk> , the Cossack capital : " The soft plaintive <unk> of the choir , and their sudden change at the moment of daybreak to the full chorus of ' Christ is risen ' were altogether what a poet or a painter would have studied with delight " . 
 In the Crimea , Heber encountered the region 's large Muslim community , and observed eastern manners and practices for the first time . He expressed particular pleasure at being greeted with the oriental salaam . The course of the war in Europe had meanwhile shifted , so that Heber and Thornton were able , on the final stages of their journey , to pass through Poland , Hungary , Austria and Germany to reach the port of Hamburg . On the way they visited Austerlitz , where they heard accounts of the recent battle from the local population . In the course of his enquiries , which included making sketches of the scene , Heber was briefly mistaken for a French spy by local farmers . At Hamburg the two travellers boarded Lord Morpeth 's private yacht and sailed for England , arriving at Great Yarmouth on 14 October 1806 . 
 = = Rector of Hodnet = = 
 = = = Parish priest = = = 
 On his return to England , Heber prepared for Holy Orders at Oxford , where he found time for literary pursuits , was active in university politics and led a busy social life . He was ordained as deacon at the end of February 1807 and received full priest 's orders from the Bishop of Oxford on 24 May 1807 . He was then inducted into the family living , as rector of Hodnet ; he was later to describe his role as " a half @-@ way station between a parson and a squire " . At first he divided his time between his parish and Oxford , where he continued working for his M.A. degree and fulfilled duties at All Souls . He had not at this time determined his own doctrinal position ; writing to Thornton he admitted that he was still searching : " Pray for me , my dear friend , that I may have my eyes open to the truth ... and if it please God that I persevere in his ministry I may undertake the charge with a quiet mind and a good conscience " . A High churchman by upbringing , Heber was a strong opponent of factional rivalry ; he eventually found a place around the midpoint of the Anglican spectrum between the High Church and evangelical wings , with perhaps a slight inclination towards the evangelicals . 
 On 9 April 1809 Heber married Amelia Shipley , the youngest daughter of the Dean of St Asaph . He withdrew from Oxford , having secured his M.A. , and set himself up permanently in the Hodnet rectory ; finding this too small for his wife 's liking he had the house demolished and a larger replacement built . In September 1813 Heber preached a sermon in Shrewsbury to the British and Foreign Bible Society , a missionary organisation of which he had been a member since his undergraduate days . The sermon ended with what Hughes describes as Heber 's first public declaration in support of the work of overseas missions . He refused an appointment as a canon at Durham , preferring to continue his work in Hodnet in which , after 1814 , he was assisted by his younger brother , the Revd Thomas Heber , who served as his curate until his death , at the age of 31 , in 1816 . The employment of a curate enabled Heber to devote more time to his literary pursuits , and to accept an invitation , in 1815 , to deliver the Bampton Lectures at Oxford . He chose as his subject " The Personality and the Office of the Christian Comforter " ; the series was published in 1822 . 
 In 1817 Heber accepted the post of canon at St Asaph , the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties to be carried out without interfering with his parish work . His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th @-@ century cleric Jeremy Taylor ; the works , with Heber 's critique , were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822 . This period of Heber 's life was saddened by the death , on 24 December 1818 , of his infant daughter after a short illness . Two more daughters were born later , in 1821 and 1824 respectively ; both lived to adulthood . In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of Preacher of Lincoln 's Inn , which would require a regular term of residence in London . He saw this both as an extension of his service to the Church and as a means of renewing contact with old friends . 
 = = = Hymn writer = = = 
 At the start of the 19th century the Anglican authorities officially disapproved of the singing of hymns in churches , other than metrical psalms , although there was considerable informal hymn @-@ singing in parishes . Heber , according to the poet John Betjeman , was a professed admirer of the hymns of John Newton and William Cowper , and was one of the first High Church Anglicans to write his own . In all he wrote 57 , mainly between 1811 and 1821 . Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection , in which he proposed to include some by other writers . In October 1820 he sought help from the Bishop of London , William Howley , in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the Archbishop of Canterbury . In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns , although he proposed to withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be gauged . Heber began preparing the publication , but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823 . The collection was eventually published in 1827 , after Heber 's death , as Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year . 
 Betjeman characterised Heber 's style as consciously literary , with careful choices of adjectives and vivid figures of speech : " poetic imagery was as important as didactic truth " . A more recent analysis by J. R. Watson draws attention to Heber 's tendency to deliver what he terms " a rather obvious sermon " , and to his mixing of powerful description with " a rather trite moralism " . A handful of Heber 's hymns have survived into popular use into the 21st century . One whose popularity has waned is the missionary hymn " From Greenland 's Icy Mountains " , written in 1819 as part of a country @-@ wide campaign on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel ( SPG ) . Watson describes this as " a conspicuous example of that fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field " , and while widely sung until the second half of the 20th century , it was for instance omitted from the 1982 revision of the Episcopal Church hymnal . Betjeman felt that in the modern world , the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs , with references to " ... every prospect pleases and only man is vile " , and to " the heathen in his blindness [ bowing ] down to wood and stone " . These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended Gandhi , who drew attention to them in a speech to the YMCA in Calcutta ( Kolkata ) in 1925 : " My own experience in my travels throughout India has been to the contrary ... [ Man ] is not vile . He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are , possibly more so " . Other Heber texts remain popular , and the Dictionary of North American Hymnology noted that most of his hymns remain in use . 
 = = Bishop of Calcutta = = 
 = = = Appointment = = = 
 The see of Calcutta had been established in 1814 . It covered much of the Indian subcontinent and Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) , together with Australia and parts of southern Africa . The first bishop , Thomas Middleton , who had been consecrated in 1814 , died in office in July 1822 . At the time the head of the Indian Board of Control was Charles Watkin Williams @-@ Wynn , an old Oxford friend of Heber 's . In December 1822 Williams @-@ Wynn wrote to Heber , not directly offering his friend the post — the wording appeared to anticipate a refusal — but nevertheless leaving Heber the opportunity to claim the office , should he wish . Heber had a longstanding interest in the work of overseas missions ; he supported not only the SPG but also its more recently formed evangelical sister @-@ body , the Church Missionary Society ( CMS ) , and while still at Oxford had helped to found the British and Foreign Bible Society ( BFBS ) . 
 Heber was attracted to the post , his interest in distant places having been stimulated by his early travels , but his initial response to the implied offer was cautious . He first asked Williams @-@ Wynn whether there was a suitable local man for the appointment and he was told there was not . His next concern was whether his wife and infant daughter should be exposed to the rigours of the Indian climate , and also if his own health was adequate . After consultation with doctors and discussion with his family , Heber wrote to Williams @-@ Wynn on 2 January 1823 , refusing the post . Within days he had written again , regretting the refusal and asking if the post was still available , at which Williams @-@ Wynn quickly obtained the formal approval of King George IV to the appointment . Heber spent the next few months at Hodnet preparing for his departure ; during this period he gave a farewell sermon at Oxford , after which the degree of Doctor of Divinity ( D.D. ) was conferred on him . On 1 June 1823 Heber was formally consecrated as Bishop of Calcutta at Lambeth Palace , by the Archbishop of Canterbury . Two weeks later he departed for India with Amelia and his daughter Emily . 
 = = = In office = = = 
 The new bishop arrived in Calcutta on 10 October 1823 . After his ceremonial installation by the Governor General , Lord Amherst , Heber preached his first sermon as bishop on Sunday 12 October , in St John 's Cathedral Church . He faced many challenges arising from tasks unfinished at the time of his predecessor 's death and from the long hiatus without a bishop . A major area of concern was Bishop 's College , a training school for local clergy founded by Middleton in 1820 , the development of which had stalled due to financial and management problems . Heber reinvigorated the project by extensive fundraising , by persuading the government to increase its grant of land , and by restarting the building programme ; within a few months the college boasted a library and a new chapel . In June 1824 Heber , using a power provided to him by recent Act of Parliament , ordained as deacon the first native Indian to receive Holy Orders . 
 Heber was interested in all aspects of Indian life and quickly made friends , both with the local population and with the representatives of non @-@ Anglican churches . Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy ; one such , Isaac Wilson of the CMS , used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service . Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court . 
 = = = Travels = = = 
 On 15 June 1824 Heber set out on a tour of northern India , accompanied by his personal chaplain , Martin Stowe , and Daniel Corrie , the Archdeacon of Calcutta . Amelia remained in Calcutta ; earlier in the year she had given birth to her third daughter , Harriet . The general plan was to travel by boat to the upper waters of the River Ganges , then overland into the foothills of the Himalayas before turning south and west , crossing Rajputana to reach Bombay . The journey was almost aborted near to its beginning when Stowe fell ill in Dacca and died there ; after some hesitation , Heber decided that the tour should continue . Early in August the party reached Benares ( now Varanasi ) , the largest of the cities in the Ganges plain , where Heber spent several weeks . It was a wholly Indian city without a European population , sacred to Hindus , Sikhs and Buddhists but with a well @-@ established CMS school and a substantial Christian minority . Heber consecrated a new church , and when he conducted a Holy Communion service in both English and Hindustani , a large congregation of Christians and Hindus thronged the church . 
 The party left Benares in mid @-@ September . After reaching Allahabad they continued overland , accompanied by an armed troop of sepoys . On 28 November they reached their farthest northerly point , at Almora in the Kumaon region . Their subsequent path southward took them to Delhi , the ancient Mughal capital , where Heber was presented to the ageing emperor Akbar Shah II in his dilapidated palace ; Heber wrote of the emperor as " the venerable ruin of a mighty stock " . In the final stages of the journey to Bombay , at <unk> , Heber met with Sahajanand Swami , the region 's leading Hindu religious leader . Heber had hopes of converting the Swami to Christianity , but was disappointed in the meeting and finally dismissed the Swami as a worshipper of images . On 19 April Heber arrived in Bombay , to be greeted a week later by Amelia and his daughters , who had arrived by sea from Calcutta . 
 Heber remained in Bombay for four months , and then decided that , instead of sailing directly for Calcutta , he would visit Ceylon on the way . He arrived at Galle on 25 August and spent five weeks touring the main cities before departing for Calcutta where he arrived on 19 October 1825 after an absence of 16 months . 
 = = = Final months = = = 
 Heber wished to pass on to the Governor General , Lord Amherst , much of what he had learned and observed on his long voyage , and on his return to Calcutta busied himself with a series of detailed reports . He also wrote to Williams @-@ Wynn in London , strongly criticising the East India Company 's stewardship of its Indian territories . He was concerned that few Indians were promoted to senior posts , and noted the " bullying , insolent manner " towards Indians that was typically adopted by the British . Many local matters also demanded Heber 's attention : the next phase in the development of Bishop 's College , the preparation of a Hindustani dictionary , and a series of ordinations including that of Abdul Masih , an elderly Lutheran whose reception into Anglican orders had earlier been resisted by Bishop Middleton , on unspecified grounds 
 In spite of the pressures on his time , Heber set out again on 30 January 1826 , this time heading south for Madras ( now Chennai ) , Pondicherry , Tanjore ( Thanjavur ) and ultimately Travancore . One reason for the tour was to examine the issue of caste , which persisted in the church in South India . In Tanjore on Easter Day , 26 March 1826 , Heber preached to more than 1300 , and on the following day conducted a confirmation service for a large Tamil congregation . On 1 April he moved on to Trichinopoly ( Tiruchirappalli ) where , next day , he confirmed 42 people . On 3 April , after attending an early @-@ morning service at which he gave a blessing in the Tamil language , Heber returned to his bungalow for a cold bath . Immediately after plunging into the water he died , possibly from the shock of the cold water in the intense heat . Watson records that a contemporary engraving shows his body " being carried from the bath by his servant and chaplain , the latter immaculately attired in a frock coat and top hat " . His funeral was held the next day at St John 's church , where he had preached his final sermon ; he was buried within the church , on the north side of the altar . 
 = = Memorials and legacy = = 
 Although Heber 's episcopate had been brief he had made a considerable impression , and news of his death brought many tributes from around India . Sir Charles Grey , an old Oxford friend who was serving as Calcutta 's Chief Justice , spoke of Heber 's cheerfulness , his lack of self @-@ importance , his good humour , patience and kindness . Flags were flown at half @-@ mast in Madras and Calcutta , and the Governor @-@ General ordered a salute of 42 guns — one for each completed year of the bishop 's life . In several cities public subscriptions were opened to raise funds for monuments . In St John 's church in Trichinopoly , initially a simple plaque above the grave recorded the date and place of Heber 's death ; this was in due course made much more elaborate . In St George 's church , Madras , a large sculpture by Francis Chantrey was erected , depicting Heber ministering to members of his flock . Reflecting Heber 's interest in the training of local ordinands , further funds were raised to provide Heber scholarships at Bishop 's College ; in Trichinopoly a school founded by the German missionary Christian Friedrich Schwarz became the Heber Memorial School . 
 It took four months for reports of Heber 's death to reach England . At Oxford , representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an appropriate memorial ; this idea was taken over by Williams @-@ Wynn , who wanted a national rather than an Oxford @-@ based monument . From the large sum collected , Chantrey was paid £ 3 @,@ 000 for a huge marble sculpture that was placed in St Paul 's Cathedral , London . More modest memorials were raised in the parish churches at Hodnet and Malpas . 
 Heber was soon commemorated in print ; as well as the publication of his hymns collection in 1827 , the journal that he had kept during his northern India tour of 1824 – 25 was published in 1828 and proved a great commercial success . Less popular was the three @-@ volume biography and letters collection that Amelia published in 1830 . In the ensuing years various collections of Heber 's poetry appeared . Hughes observes that although some of the lighter verses are neat and amusing , the general quality is such that had Heber been only a poet , he would quickly have been forgotten . He achieved a more lasting niche as a hymn @-@ writer ; according to Hughes , among his hymns with enduring appeal are the Epiphany hymn " Brightest and best of the sons of the morning " ; " The Son of God Goes Forth to War " , dedicated to the church 's saints and martyrs , and the Trinity Sunday hymn " Holy , Holy , Holy , Lord God Almighty " . The last one is probably the most widely known of all Trinity hymns and owes a great deal of its popularity to John Bacchus Dykes 's tune " Nicea " : Watson observes that the tune 's " magnificent grandeur carries the long lines effortlessly " . Hughes mentions two more Heber hymns that , he says , deserve to be better known : " God that <unk> earth and heaven " and " By cool Siloam 's shady rill " . 
 Heber 's pioneering commitment to the mission fields was expressed , half a century after his death , by the author Charlotte Mary Yonge : " Heber was one of the first English churchmen who perceived that to enlarge her borders and strengthen her stakes was the bounden duty of the living Church " . He led through example , and through his writings which " did much to spread knowledge of , and therefore interest in , the field of labour in which he died " . The Anglican Church of Canada commemorates Heber on 4 April each year . 
 In July 1830 Amelia Heber married Count Demetrius <unk> , a Greek diplomat who became a British subject and was later knighted by Queen Victoria . Amelia lived until 1870 . Her daughter Emily married Algernon Percy , the son of the Bishop of Carlisle , and the younger daughter Harriet married a son of Heber 's friend John Thornton .

 On August 20 , 2008 , Dunderdale , Premier Williams and a consortium of oil companies led by Chevron Canada signed a deal to develop the Hebron oil field . The Hebron oil field is the second largest oil field off the coast of the province with an estimated 700 million barrels of oil reserves . The province expects to gain at least $ 20 billion in royalties and up to 3 @,@ 500 jobs from the project . Less than a year later , on June 16 , 2009 , the government announced they had negotiated an agreement with oil companies to expand the Hibernia oil field .

The hydro development would see power from the falls transferred from Labrador to the island of Newfoundland via an underwater transmission link through the Strait of Belle Isle . Another underwater transmission link across the Gulf of St. Lawrence would bring power to Nova Scotia . Newfoundland and Labrador will use 40 percent of the hydro power itself and will be able to shut down the oil @-@ burning Holyrood Thermal Generating Station .

Dunderdale is the first female Premier in the province 's history and only the sixth female in Canada to lead a province or territory . On December 6 , 2010 , Dunderdale held a minor cabinet shuffle to replace herself as the Minister of Natural Resources . Innovation , Trade and Rural Development Minister Shawn Skinner took over Dunderdale 's duties as Minister of Natural Resources and he was replaced by Susan Sullivan . 
 = = = Party leadership = = = 
 After being sworn in as premier , Dunderdale announced that she would not be seeking the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party and therefore would only serve in the role of premier until a leadership election was held in the spring of 2011 . However , on December 17 , 2010 , Dunderdale announced that she was reconsidering running for the leadership of the party and that she would make a final decision after Christmas . 
 On December 22 , 2010 , cabinet ministers Jerome Kennedy and Darin King , who were both seen as likely leadership candidates , announced they would not seek the leadership of the party . Both men said they were encouraging Dunderdale to run and that they would endorse her campaign if she entered the race . On December 23 , 2010 , Dunderdale garnered support from two other cabinet ministers when Finance Minister Tom Marshall and Municipal Affairs Minister Kevin O 'Brien opted out of running for the leadership and threw their support behind her entering the race . 
 Dunderdale announced her candidacy for the PC Party leadership on December 30 , 2010 , and was endorsed by her entire caucus . While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she decided to run for the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership . On January 10 , 2011 , an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana , a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan , filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale 's only challenger . The next day however the PC Party 's credentials committee announced that Cabana was ineligible from entering the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated . Cabana appealed the party 's decision but it was announced on January 27 , 2011 , that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by the credentials committee . With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader @-@ designate , she was sworn in as leader at the party 's convention on April 2 , 2011 .

 On September 19 , 2011 , Dunderdale met with Lieutenant Governor John Crosbie and requested a dissolution of the 46th General Assembly with an election to follow on October 11 , 2011 . With an overwhelming lead in public opinion polls , for both Dunderdale and her party , and with roughly $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in the bank , pundits considered the election hers to lose . Dunderdale released her party 's platform in Grand Falls @-@ Windsor on September 22 , 2011 . While Dunderdale stressed the need for fiscal restraint , the platform included $ 135 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in new spending a year . The platform included continuing the freeze on post @-@ secondary tuition and eventually eliminating loans in favour of needs @-@ based grants , phasing out the payroll tax over six years , investing a third of any surplus into unfunded public pension funds , reviewing the province 's income tax rates to ensure they are progressive and competitive , continuing to make payments on the province ’ s direct debt , creating a population growth strategy , moving forward with the Muskrat Falls hydro development , and improving health care wait times . 
 On election night the Progressive Conservatives won 37 of the province 's 48 seats , six fewer seats then the party held before the election . The Liberal Party won six seats , while the NDP were elected in five . With this win Dunderdale became only the third female in Canadian history to lead a party to victory in a general election , after Catherine <unk> in Prince Edward Island and Pat Duncan in the Yukon . 
 On October 28 , 2011 , Dunderdale 's new cabinet was sworn in at Government House . Through the elimination and restructuring of government departments she reduced her cabinet to 16 members , including herself , down from 19 . Dunderdale created the Department of Advanced Education and Skills , which takes on the majority of the responsibilities of the now defunct Department of Human Resources , Labour and Employment . She eliminated the Department of Business and merged it with the Department of Innovation , Trade and Rural Development to create the Department of Innovation , Business and Rural Development . She also restructured the former departments of Labrador and Aboriginal Affairs and Intergovernmental Affairs to create the Department of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs .

 Upon entering the premier 's chair Dunderdale was faced with an ongoing dispute between the province 's doctors and government over contract negotiations . In November , 14 doctors announced their resignations over the government 's latest offer of a 31 percent wage increase that they felt was not enough . At her swearing in as premier Dunderdale stated that earlier that week she had asked Health Minister Jerome Kennedy and Finance Minister Tom Marshall to meet with the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association ( <unk> ) later that day to work out a resolution to the dispute . After the meeting Dunderdale announced she hoped to have a deal signed with the province 's doctors before Christmas . 
 Dunderdale also announced soon after being sworn in that she wanted to end a year @-@ long strike on the Burin Peninsula that involved 15 home care workers . The government had been called on to settle the dispute but had refused to get involved seeing the workers are not direct employees of provincial government . Within 5 days of taking office Dunderdale 's government reached an agreement with the workers which they unanimously accepted ending the 377 @-@ day strike . 
 On December 15 , 2010 , Dunderdale along with Ministers Kennedy and Marshall joined the <unk> president to announce that a tentative agreement between the provincial government and doctors had been reached . The offer included 100 percent Atlantic Canadian parity within the first two years of the agreement , pay equity for salaried specialists , and retention bonuses for fee @-@ for @-@ service rural physicians . As a result of the new deal , the 13 of the 14 doctors who tendered their resignations en masse in November rescinded their resignations . 
 On September 17 , 2013 , the government announced that a four @-@ year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees ( NAPE ) , the province 's largest public sector union . The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations , during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing the government for saying the province 's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay . The tentative deal included a wage freeze during the first two years of the deal , a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four . Full @-@ time employees will also receive a $ 1 @,@ 400 signing bonus , while temporary , seasonal and part @-@ time workers will get a pro @-@ rated bonus . As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees . Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE , the government announced tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees ( <unk> ) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals ( <unk> ) . Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE .

 One of the major focuses of Dunderdale 's premiership has been the development of the first phase of the Lower Churchill Project — Muskrat Falls . Several weeks before becoming premier , Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia , signed a partnership agreement to develop the multibillion @-@ dollar hydro development . During her first official meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 1 , 2011 , Dunderdale asked for his government 's support with a loan guarantee for Muskrat Falls . The loan guarantee would reduce the cost of the project by millions , resulting in lower electricity rates for consumers . Dunderdale 's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21 , 2011 , and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development . During a campaign stop in St. John 's during the 2011 federal election Dunderdale endorsed Harper and his Conservative Party while Harper committed to the loan guarantee . On August 19 , 2011 , Canada 's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver announced a Memorandum of Agreement for the loan guarantee . While Oliver stated the loan guarantee would be in place by the end of November 2011 , it was not until November 30 , 2012 that the loan guarantee was finalized . In a simultaneous news conference held in St. John 's and Halifax on December 17 , 2012 , Dunderdale and Emera Inc. announced they had both officially sanctioned the Muskrat Falls hydro development .

 During her time as Natural Resources Minister Dunderdale promoted the need for a national energy plan , which would include an east @-@ west power grid spanning the country . At the Council of the Federation meeting in July 2012 , Dunderdale was selected as one of three premiers to help draft a national energy strategy on behalf of the Council . At the same meeting she compared a conflict between British Columbia Premier Christy Clark and Alberta Premier Allison Redford , regarding the Northern Gateway pipeline , to the conflicts Newfoundland and Labrador has had dealing with the province of Quebec regarding hydroelectricity . Dunderdale was one of the few premiers to wade into that conflict and stated that " I don 't agree that provinces should be able to use their geographical location to hold off economic development for their sister provinces - that 's not in the best interests of the country " . She went on to say that there would need to be difficult conversations but that they are needed to find resolutions that work for all .

 As part of a reorganization of government departments , the post @-@ secondary education portfolio was removed from the Department of Education and became part of the new Department of Advanced Education and Skills . Along with post @-@ secondary education the new department would be responsible for apprentices , advanced studies and take over much of the responsibilities of the former Department of Human Resources , Labour and Employment . The Department of Education would be responsible for K @-@ 12 education , early childhood learning and the province 's libraries .

 As part of the 2013 budget the Dunderdale government announced that the province 's four English school boards would be consolidated into one , while the one French school board would remain as is . The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004 , from 10 boards to five . Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14 @,@ 000 , or 17 per cent . The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced the appointment of a transition team for the amalgamation on April 24 , 2013 , with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year . The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration , learning resources support and district @-@ based numeracy supports . However , the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers , and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student @-@ teacher ratio in the country .

 Since 2003 , the Progressive Conservative government have froze tuition fees at the province 's public post @-@ secondary institutions , the freeze has led to the province having the lowest tuition fees in the country .

 The 2013 provincial budget included a 10 @-@ year sustainability plan , which announced that in 2014 the government would review both Memorial University and the College of the North Atlantic ( CNA ) . However , the 2013 budget did include a $ 15 million budget cut to CNA and changes to the college 's programming . The budget announced that the Adult Basic Education ( ABE ) program - a high school equivalency program designed for adults who did not complete high school - would be removed from the CNA curriculum and be privatized . The program is already administered through the private sector and through non @-@ profit organizations , with the government stating that only 40 per cent of people enrolled in ABE attended CNA . In a letter to the editor , Advanced Education and Skills Minister Joan Shea wrote " it costs approximately $ 5 @,@ 000 more to provide ABE to a student at College of the North Atlantic than at a private school , and the average cost of ABE per student in this province is about three times the cost in other Atlantic provinces . " College of the North Atlantic President and CEO also announced the elimination of a number of programs at campuses where there was low enrolment . Vaughan later announced the addition of new programs that are considered in demand . 
 = = = Fiscal policy = = = 
 During Danny Williams ' time as premier the province experienced a major economic expansion , mainly as a result of the offshore oil industry . After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits the province started recording large surpluses , starting in 2006 . While billions of dollars were paid down on the province 's debt , government spending increased considerably . In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47 @.@ 4 percent over a five @-@ year period . Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits , and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat . 
 Despite warnings from Noseworthy to control spending , Dunderdale 's first budget saw spending increase by 4 @.@ 9 percent . Spending was focused on infrastructure , health care , social programs , Nalcor Energy as well as other areas . The budget included tax credits for child care , volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel , which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax ( HST ) . The budget raised the threshold on the payroll tax exemption from $ 1 million to $ 1 @.@ 2 million . Despite a $ 598 million surplus for the previous year and a $ 59 surplus forecasted for the coming year , the province 's net debt was expected to increase from $ 8 @.@ 2 billion to $ 8 @.@ 67 billion due to unfunded liabilities . However , on November 16 , 2011 , Dunderdale 's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011 @-@ 2012 , fiscal year was now projected to be $ 755 @.@ 8 million , with the added surplus going towards the debt . In the audited financial statements released in January 2013 , the surplus for the 2011 @-@ 2012 was $ 882 @.@ 8 million , with the overall debt falling to $ 7 @.@ 8 billion . 
 At a luncheon with the St. John 's Board of Trade in February 2012 , Dunderdale delivered a speech which laid out a more fiscally conservative course . She stated that the days of big spending were over and that it was time to rein in public spending . Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget , that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs . She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador 's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average . Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5 , 2011 , speech from the throne . The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review . Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $ 100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts . 
 The 2012 budget was delivered by Finance Minister Marshall on April 24 , 2012 , and was a stark contrast from the austerity budget that Dunderdale and her ministers had been warning of for months . Only 45 temporary positions were cut from the public service and a review of programs found $ 38 @.@ 8 million in savings , much lower than the $ 100 million Dunderdale had previously mentioned . Government spending actually increased in the budget by 1 @.@ 7 per cent , though this was below the rate of inflation . 
 The government estimated that oil would average $ 124 a barrel for the year but as a result of lower oil production , caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs , the province would record a deficit of $ 258 million . Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts , the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses . The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “ core mandate analysis ” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation , and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador ’ s debt level to the all @-@ province average . Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices . On the day of her news conference brent crude , a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland , stood at $ 103 a barrel , which was up from $ 90 the previous month . For every $ 1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $ 20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury , which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars . By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid @-@ year economic update on December 13 , 2012 , it was estimated that the deficit would total $ 726 million for that fiscal year . 
 During this same time , Dunderdale was named the best fiscal performer of Canada 's premiers by the Fraser Institute . The institute measured the performance of all premiers for their time in office , which was the 2011 @-@ 2012 fiscal year for Dunderdale , and looked at their performance on three core components of fiscal policy : government spending , taxes , and debt and deficits . Dunderdale received a score of 71 @.@ 4 out of a possible 100 @.@ 0 , though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to government spending was in part due to the province ’ s significant economic growth and not her ability to restrain growth in spending . 
 On January 16 , 2013 , Dunderdale held a surprise cabinet shuffle that saw Minister Marshall shuffled out of Finance and appointed as Minister of Natural Resources . He was replaced by Jerome Kennedy , who had served as Natural Resources Minister since October 2011 . With contract negotiations underway with public sector unions Minister Kennedy 's appointment was called a warning shot to the union leaders by the opposition . Minister Kennedy is considered a tough negotiator , and was Minister of Finance in 2008 during the last round of contract negotiations . 
 Prior to announcing the 2013 provincial budget Kennedy warned that if <unk> were not brought under control the province could face a $ 1 @.@ 6 billion deficit for the coming fiscal year and that the province 's debt could increase by $ 4 billion in three years . These figures were much lower when the budget was brought down on March 26 , 2013 , but the Dunderdale government was still projecting a deficit of $ 563 @.@ 8 million for the 2013 fiscal year . Roughly 1 @,@ 200 public sector jobs were eliminated , due to spending cuts totalling over $ 300 million .

 During Dunderdale 's tenure as premier the Fisheries portfolio has seen a significant overturn at the ministerial level . In less than three years Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture . Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9 , 2013 . Following his appointment a representative with the Fish , Food and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio for a longer period of time , as he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years . Dunderdale 's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman , who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier . Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election , when Darin King took over the portfolio . Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year . Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery . 
 In February 2011 , Dunderdale 's government rejected a report prepared by an independent committee that called for a massive downsizing of the fishing industry . The report by the Steering Committee for Fishing Industry Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) was released by the province , and called for $ 450 million to be spent to achieve substantial cuts in the industry . At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately , saying the $ 450 million price tag was too expensive . Opposition parties and union leaders were highly critical of the government for dismissing the report , with NDP leader Lorraine Michael calling for Minister Jackman to resign . 
 During the October 2011 , provincial election , Dunderdale said " We 've got too many people chasing too few fish , and these plants are going to collapse and fail because they 're not on sound economic models " . She said there was overcapacity in the fishing industry and that fish processing plants would need to close . Minister Jackman , who represents a district that relies heavily on the fishing industry , continued to face much criticism for his performance in the fisheries portfolio and was re @-@ elected by just 40 votes . The day after winning a majority government , Dunderdale stated in an interview that tough decisions were looming in the industry . She again stated there was overcapacity and structural problems in the fishery and that her government was ready to make the tough decisions that were long overdue . Dunderdale swore in her new cabinet weeks after the election and shuffled Jackman to the Department to Education , Darin King succeeded him as the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture . 
 On February 28 , 2012 , the government announced that they would stop providing funding to the FFAW . In a five @-@ year period the provincial government had provided roughly $ 1 @.@ 3 million in grant money for things like research , seafood marketing and fisheries technology programs . Minister King cited the union 's criticism of the provincial government as the reason for the move , stating ' No matter what we do in this province , the FFAW are more concerned with their own self @-@ interest than they are with the interests of the <unk> 
 = = = = Minimum processing requirements = = = = 
 Fish caught off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador are required to have a minimal level of processing done in provincial fish plants . The objective is to ensure that the province ’ s fishery generates the maximum economic and employment benefits for the <unk> requirements are known as minimum processing requirements , or MPRs . These requirements have been an issue in province over the years for numerous reasons including ; the cost of processing , labour availability and because some markets are interested in less processed fish . The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture can grant a company exemptions from minimum processing requirements . 
 In November 2011 , provincial government @-@ appointed auditors backed up claims by Ocean Choice International ( OCI ) that they were losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant . On December 2 , 2011 , the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province . The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company 's plant in Fortune . Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it . Negotiations on a deal would become tense , with the minister criticizing the company for using ' pressure tactics ' to try to get a deal . OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King 's comments . In February 2012 , the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company , saying that it was not in the best interest of the province . In mid October 2012 , workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing , in return for 110 full @-@ time jobs at their plant . The FFAW , which represented the workers , opposed the move to ship out the raw product . Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19 , 2012 , and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture . In a news conference held on December 21 , 2012 , Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing , along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota . In return a total of 236 year @-@ round jobs , between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea , for at least five years . 
 = = = = = CETA = = = = = 
 Minimum processing requirements also became an issue in the Canada @-@ European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement ( CETA ) . Dunderdale announced in a speech to the St. John 's Board of Trade in May 2013 , that the loan guarantee for the Muskrat Falls project nearly fell apart because of MPRs . She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh hour of the loan guarantee negotiations to help secure the trade deal . Dunderdale said that while she was willing to look at minimum processing requirements , she was not willing to tie it to the loan guarantee . 
 On October 18 , 2013 , Charlene Johnson , the minister responsible for trade , along with Fisheries minister Keith Hutchings announced that the government supported the agreement in principle for CETA , that had been announced early that day . The ministers said the trade agreement would a game changer for the fishing industry . The agreement would eliminate MPRs for the European Union three years after the ratification of the deal , which is expected to occur in 2015 . In return for eliminating minimum processing requirement , high tariffs and import restrictions on almost all fish would be eliminated on the first day that CETA comes into effect . Currently only 13 @.@ 1 per cent of seafood is duty @-@ free . But by 2022 , all seafood would be 100 per cent duty @-@ free . Following the conclusion of the CETA negotiations Dunderdale said that other provinces and the federal government had been pressuring her to accept a deal that would eliminate minimum processing requirements on fish right away , in exchange for concessions on tariffs later . Dunderdale said they refused that deal and were eventually able to negotiate the current arrangement . Her government also felt that eliminating MPRs was a safe trade away because they did not feel European countries could compete with Newfoundland and Labrador fish plants , due to higher operating costs in those countries . 
 On October 29 , 2013 , Dunderdale held a major news conference regarding the fishery at The Rooms in St. John 's . Along with cabinet ministers and industry officials , Dunderdale announced that the federal and provincial governments would be investing $ 400 million , over three years , into the fishery . The federal government portion of the money totalled $ 280 million while the provincial portion was $ 120 million . The money is compensation for the province eliminating minimum processing requirements for the European Union . Although the premier said that her government plans to work with industry officials on how the money would be spent , she said it would be invested into such things as research and development , new marketing initiatives and infrastructure .

 = = = = Bill 29 = = = = 
 In June 2012 , Dunderdale 's government brought forth controversial legislation , known as Bill 29 , that reformed the province 's Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act . The amendments to the act expanded the government 's ability to deny access to information by keeping ministerial briefings secret , ignoring requests for information that cabinet ministers deem to be " frivolous , " and barring the auditor general from a wider array of records . Deadlines to respond to requests were pushed back , and fees were increased from $ 15 to $ 25 . The opposition leaders immediately condemned the bill and said they would team up to filibuster the bill . An expert on international access @-@ to @-@ information laws , Toby Mendel , called key changes to the act “ breathtaking , ” and said the province will rank lower than some third world countries with the new legislation . As well 75 people also assembled outside the Confederation Building to protest the bill . However , Newfoundland and Labrador 's information commissioner , Ed Ring , said bill 29 was not a bad thing and that it would not stop the Access to the Information and Protection of Privacy Act from doing its job . Bill 29 led to a four @-@ day filibuster in the House of Assembly , which eventually ended when the government invoked closure to the debate . NDP leader Lorraine Michael 's accusation that the government was being racist , when referring to Mendel 's criticism of the bill , was cited by the government as reasons to end debate . 
 On September 13 , 2012 , long time Tory MHA and former cabinet minister Tom Osborne announced he was leaving the PC Party to sit as an independent . He cited Dunderdale 's leadership as the reason for his defection and said that the turning point for him was the debate over Bill 29 . Osborne said that while he voted in favour of the new legislation he did not support it . On October 19 , 2012 , Dunderdale shuffled her cabinet and Justice Minister Felix Collins , who was responsible for Bill 29 , was shuffled out of the Justice portfolio and became Minister of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs . Though the portfolio change was considered to be a demotion Dunderdale stated that Collins ' handling of Bill 29 was not connected to his move . At the time of the cabinet shuffle Dunderdale also created the Office of Public Engagement , which will bring together different departments to aid in communications efforts . The new office will also be responsible for access to information . 
 = = = = Office of Public Engagement = = = = 
 The Office of Public Engagement was established on October 19 , 2012 , and includes the Rural Secretariat , the Voluntary and Non @-@ Profit Secretariat , the Youth Engagement office , the Strategic Partnership Initiative , and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Office . Innovation , Business and Rural Development Minister Keith Hutchings was appointed as the minister responsible for the office , while Steve Kent was appointed parliamentary secretary for the office . Several days after his appointment Hutchings announced that the government was looking at putting restaurant inspection reports online for the public viewing . The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) had spent $ 457 obtaining inspection reports earlier the year , which had been criticized by former Service NL Minister Paul Davis during the debate on Bill 29 . On November 22 , 2012 , Hutchings and Service NL Minister Nick McGrath announced that the public could now go on the government 's website and see recent health and sanitation inspection reports for restaurants . While both opposition parties agreed with the government 's decision to make the reports available online , Liberal MHA Andrew Parsons said that “ I have no doubt that this is a response to the Bill 29 criticism " . 
 A CBC investigation , intended to test access to information following Bill 29 , discovered that some departments and agencies were refusing to release previously available details about how much public employees take home above their base salaries . When the media was briefed on Bill 29 the @-@ then Deputy Minister of Justice , Donald Burrage , said that the provisions of the act which enabled the public to see bonuses offered to public service employees had not been changed . Minister Hutchings confirmed that only the base salary , or a salary range , plus a range of possible bonuses , are now available . However , he said that this was not a change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary .

 On February 7 , 2011 , the premier ’ s office announced that due to several incidents since Dunderdale became premier in December that police bodyguards were protecting her . After her office contacted the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary ( RNC ) to report the incidents the RNC felt it was necessary to take precaution and assign security to the premier . Dunderdale spoke on the issue the following day , she said that due to privacy reasons she was partially reluctant to take on a bodyguard but respects the RNC ’ s decision . Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security . 
 = = = Public opinion = = = 
 During her premiership support for Dunderdale , her government and the PC Party saw a steady decline . A Corporate Research Associates ( CRA ) poll released days after Dunderdale became premier , and conducted before she took office , showed that 90 per cent of the population were satisfied with the PC government . 75 per cent would vote for the Progressive Conservative Party in an election and 76 percent chose Williams as the best leader to be premier . A CRA poll conducted throughout February 2011 , showed that support for Dunderdale , her government and the PC Party remained high . Satisfaction with government was at 82 per cent , while 73 per cent of respondents said they would vote for the PC Party in an election . 64 per cent of respondents stated Dunderdale was the best choice for premier , compared to 18 per cent for Liberal leader Yvonne Jones and 5 per cent for Lorraine Michael . An Angus Reid Public Opinion ( Angus Reid ) poll conducted around the same time listed Dunderdale as the second most popular premier in Canada with a 55 percent approval rating . 10 percent of respondents disapproved of her performance while 35 percent were not sure if they approved or disapproved of her performance . 
 By the time the provincial election was called in September 2011 , support for Dunderdale , her government and the Progressive Conservatives had fallen in public opinion polls . However , her party entered the campaign with support levels in the high fifties and Dunderdale remained the top choice for premier . On October 11 , 2011 , Dunderdale led her party to victory winning 56 per cent of the popular vote , which was consistent with polling throughout the campaign . After an initial bounce in the polls following the election , support for Dunderdale would decline right up until her resignation as premier in 2014 . Throughout 2012 , Dunderdale saw her personal numbers take a big hit , while PC Party support and government satisfaction would also decline . In November 2012 , 36 per cent of respondents to a CRA poll thought Dunderdale was the best choice for premier , down from 59 per cent a year earlier . Although the Progressive Conservatives still remained in first place their support had fallen 14 points over the year to 46 per cent . While government satisfaction had fallen it remained high , with 58 percent of respondents either being completely or mostly satisfied . An Angus Reid poll released in December 2012 , also showed declining support for Dunderdale over the year . Just 37 per cent of those polled approved of the job Dunderdale was doing as premier , while 55 per cent disapproved . 
 In March 2013 , a CRA poll showed that the Progressive Conservatives had fallen below the NDP , with 39 per cent indicating they supported the New Democrats and 38 per cent supporting the PC Party . The Liberal Party were third with 22 per cent support . Michael also surpassed Dunderdale when asked who would make the best premier , Michael was at 33 per cent and Dunderdale was at 32 per cent . This was also the first poll to show that more people were dissatisfied with government 's performance then satisfied . An Angus Reid poll released on April 8 , 2013 , rating the performance of provincial premiers , showed that Dunderdale was the most unpopular premier in the country . Her approval rating was tied with British Columbia 's Christy Clark at 25 per cent , while 73 per cent of respondents said they disapproved of Dunderdale 's performance as premier . 
 A CRA poll conducted throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale , her government , and the PC Party . Only 21 per cent of those surveyed felt Dunderdale was the best choice for premier , behind both Michael and Ball . Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent , compared to 33 per cent who indicated they were dissatisfied a year earlier . Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent . This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first , at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively . The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote , a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011 . Towards the end of 2013 , satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase , though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May . According to a November CRA poll , satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent , while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent . A quarter of decided voters thought <unk> was the best choice for premier , this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball . Due to a large drop in NDP support , down to 19 percent , the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that they would vote for the party in an election . The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters saying they would vote for the party in an election .

 On January 22 , 2014 , and initially reported by media outlets the day before , Dunderdale announced that she would be resigning as Premier on January 24 , 2014 . In her speech Dunderdale stated " Just as you know when it 's time to step up , you also know when it is time to step back , and that time for me is now . " The announcement followed the defection of PC MHA Paul Lane to the Liberal Party , and months of poor performance in opinion polls . Dunderdale 's Finance Minister Tom Marshall was sworn in as premier and became the interim party leader on January 24 . Marshall will hold the post until the PC Party selects a permanent leader . On February 28 , 2014 , Dunderdale sent out a news releasing announcing she was resigning as the MHA for Virginia Water by the end of the day , ending a ten and a half year career in provincial politics .

 = Greenlandic language = 
 Greenlandic is an Eskimo – Aleut language spoken by about 57 @,@ 000 Greenlandic Inuit in Greenland . It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada such as Inuktitut . The main variety , Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic , has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009 ; this is a move by the <unk> ( government of Greenland ) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language , Danish . The second variety is Tunumiit oraasiat or East Greenlandic . The Thule Inuit of Greenland , Inuktun or Polar Eskimo , is a recent arrival and a dialect of Inuktitut . 
 Greenlandic is a polysynthetic language that allows the creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes . Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative , meaning that it treats ( i.e. case @-@ marks ) the argument ( " subject " ) of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb , but distinctly from the agent ( " subject " ) of a transitive verb . 
 Nouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession . Verbs are inflected for one of the eight moods and for the number and person of its subject and object . Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology . Basic word order in transitive clauses is subject – object – verb . Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods . A so @-@ called fourth @-@ person category enables switch @-@ reference between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects . Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of grammatical tense , as temporal relations are normally expressed through context , through the use of temporal particles such as " yesterday " or " now " or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with aspectual meanings with the semantic aktionsart of different verbs . However , some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily . Another question is whether the language has noun incorporation , or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature . 
 When adopting new concepts or technologies , Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots , but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English . The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s . The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851 , but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes . An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy , which is now among the highest in the world . 
 = = History = = 
 The Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the Thule people in the 1200s . It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier Saqqaq and Dorset cultures in Greenland . 
 The first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s , and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s , and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland , the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began . The missionary Paul Egede wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750 , and the first grammar in 1760 . 
 From the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979 , Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language . In the 1950s , Denmark 's linguistic policies were directed at replacing Greenlandic with Danish . Of primary significance was that post @-@ primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish . 
 From 1851 to 1973 , Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt . In 1973 , a new orthography was introduced , intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard , which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt 's time . The reform was effective and in the years following it , Greenlandic literacy received a boost . 
 Another development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of " <unk> " of Greenlandic society which began with the <unk> agreement of 1979 . This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education . The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish @-@ speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic . Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media : the Greenlandic National Radio , Kalaallit <unk> <unk> , which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic . The newspaper <unk> , has been published since 1958 , and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper <unk> / <unk> , which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house . 
 Before June 2009 , Greenlandic shared its status as the official language in Greenland with Danish . Since then , Greenlandic has become the sole official language . This has made Greenlandic a unique example of an indigenous language of the Americas that is recognized by law as the only official language of a semi @-@ independent country . Nevertheless , it is still considered to be in a " vulnerable " state by the UNESCO Red Book of Language <unk> . The country has a 100 % literacy rate . As the Western Greenlandic standard has become dominant , a UNESCO report has labelled the other dialects as endangered , and measures are now being considered to protect the Eastern Greenlandic dialect . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Kalaallisut and the other Greenlandic dialects belong to the Eskimo – Aleut family and are closely related to the Inuit languages of Canada and Alaska . Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different <unk> languages , among them the three main dialects of Greenlandic . 
 The most prominent Greenlandic dialect is West Greenlandic ( Kalaallisut ) , which is the official language of Greenland . The name Kalaallisut is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic . The northern dialect , Inuktun ( <unk> ) , spoken in the vicinity of the city of Qaanaaq ( Thule ) , is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut . The eastern dialect ( Tunumiit oraasiat ) , spoken in the vicinity of <unk> Island and Ittoqqortoormiit , is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects , having assimilated consonant clusters and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic . Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects . One that is spoken around Upernavik has certain similarities to East Greenlandic , possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland . A second dialect is spoken in the region of Uummannaq and the Disko Bay . The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in Sisimiut in the north , around Nuuk and as far south as Maniitsoq . Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around <unk> and Qaqortoq in the south . Table 1 shows the differences in the pronunciation of the word for " humans " in the three main dialects . It can be seen that Inuktun is the most conservative , maintaining the " gh " which has been elided in Kalaallisut , and <unk> is the most innovative , having further simplified the structure by <unk> the / n / . 
 Michael Fortescue , a specialist in Eskimo – Aleut as well as in <unk> @-@ Kamchatkan , argues for a link between Uralic , <unk> , <unk> @-@ Kamchatkan , and the Eskimo – Aleut languages in Language Relations Across Bering Strait ( 1998 ) . He calls this proposed grouping the <unk> @-@ Siberian languages . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 Letters between slashes / / indicate phonemic transcription , letters in square brackets [ ] indicate phonetic transcription and letters in triangular brackets 〈 〉 indicate standard Greenlandic orthography . 
 = = = Vowels = = = 
 The Greenlandic three vowel system , composed of / i / , / u / , and / a / , is typical for an Eskimo – Aleut language . Double vowels are analyzed as two <unk> , so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel ; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography . The only diphthong in the language is / ai / , which occurs only at the ends of words . Before a uvular consonant ( [ q ] or [ ʁ ] ) , / i / is realized allophonically as [ e ] , [ ɛ ] or [ ɐ ] , and / u / is realized allophonically as [ o ] or [ ɔ ] , and the two vowels are written e , o respectively ( as in Quechua and Aymara ) . / a / becomes retracted to [ ɑ ] in the same environment . / i / is rounded to [ y ] before labial consonants . / u / is fronted to [ <unk> ] between two coronal consonants . 
 The allophonic lowering of / i / and / u / before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing / i / and / u / as 〈 e 〉 and 〈 o 〉 respectively before <unk> 〈 q 〉 and 〈 r 〉 . For example : 
 / ui / " husband " pronounced [ ui ] . 
 / <unk> / " she has a husband " pronounced [ <unk> ] and written 〈 <unk> 〉 . 
 / illu / " house " pronounced [ <unk> ] . 
 / <unk> / " he has a house " pronounced [ <unk> ] and written 〈 <unk> 〉 . 
 = = = Consonants = = = 
 Greenlandic has consonants at five points of articulation : labial , alveolar , palatal , velar and uvular . It does not have phonemic voicing contrast , but rather distinguishes stops from fricatives . It distinguishes stops , fricatives , and nasals at the labial , alveolar , velar , and uvular points of articulation . The earlier palatal sibilant [ ʃ ] has merged with [ s ] in all but a few dialects . The labiodental fricative [ f ] is only contrastive in loanwords . The alveolar stop [ t ] is pronounced as an affricate [ t ͡ s ] before the high front vowel / i / . Often Danish loanwords are written with Danish letters for voiced stops 〈 b d g 〉 , for example 〈 <unk> 〉 " beer " and 〈 <unk> 〉 " God " , but in Greenlandic these stops are pronounced exactly as / p t k / , i.e. [ <unk> ] and [ <unk> ] . 
 = = = Phonological constraints = = = 
 The Kalaallisut syllable is simple , allowing syllables of ( C ) ( V ) V ( C ) , where C is a consonant and V is a vowel and VV is a double vowel or word @-@ final / ai / . Native words may only begin with a vowel or / p , t , k , q , s , m , n / ; they may end only in / p , t , k , q / or rarely / n / . Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into <unk> . All non @-@ nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless . 
 = = = Prosody = = = 
 Greenlandic prosody does not include stress as an autonomous category ; instead , prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters . Intonation is influenced by syllable weight : heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress . Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters . The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters . The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light . In words with many heavy syllables , syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster . 
 Geminate consonants are pronounced long , almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant . 
 Intonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable , falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable . <unk> intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Greenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations . 
 Greenlandic phonology allows clusters , but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is / r / . The first consonant in a cluster is always assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant . Geminate / tt / is pronounced [ ts ] and written 〈 ts 〉 . Geminate / ll / is pronounced [ <unk> ] . Geminate / <unk> / is pronounced [ <unk> ] . Geminate / <unk> / is pronounced [ <unk> ] . Geminate / <unk> / is pronounced [ <unk> ] and written 〈 ff 〉 . / v / is also pronounced and written [ f ] after / r / . 
 These assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words , <unk> ( " house " ) , is illu in Greenlandic , where the / <unk> / consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a voiceless alveolar lateral affricate . And the word Inuktitut itself , when translated into Kalaallisut , becomes <unk> . The Old Greenlandic diphthong / au / has assimilated to / aa / . 
 The consonant / v / has disappeared when between / u / and / i / or / a / . This means that affixes beginning with <unk> or <unk> have forms without [ v ] when suffixed to stems ending in / u / . 
 The vowel / i / of modern Greenlandic is the result of an historic merger of the Proto @-@ Eskimo – Aleut vowels * i and * ɪ . The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede . In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned <unk> in certain environments . The vowel that was originally * ɪ has the variant [ a ] when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes . 
 The degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo , Inuktun , which still allows some <unk> consonant clusters , from West and East Greenlandic . East Greenlandic has shifted some geminate consonants , e.g. [ <unk> ] to [ <unk> ] . In Tunumiit oraasiat , for example , the name of a particular town is Ittoqqortoormiit , which would appear as <unk> in Kalaallisut . 
 = = Grammar = = 
 The morphology of Greenlandic is highly synthetic and exclusively suffixing , with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix . It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem . In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word , but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent , and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5 . The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones . 
 There are few compound words , but lots of derivations . The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking : both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns , while dependent noun phrases inflect for case . The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative . 
 The language distinguishes four persons ( 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive ( see <unk> and switch @-@ reference ) , two numbers ( singular and plural ; no dual as in Inuktitut ) , eight moods ( indicative , participial , imperative / optative , interrogative , past subjunctive , future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive ) and eight cases ( absolutive , ergative , equative , instrumental , locative , allative , ablative and <unk> ) . Verbs carry a <unk> inflection for subject and object . Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor , as well as for case . 
 In this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen . 
 = = = Syntax = = = 
 Greenlandic distinguishes three open word classes : nouns , verbs and particles . Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood . Nouns inflect for possession and for case . Particles do not inflect . 
 The verb is the only word required to build a sentence . Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object , the verb is in fact a clause itself . Therefore , clauses where all participants are expressed as free @-@ standing noun phrases are rather rare . The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments : 
 Intransitive clause with no subject noun phrase : 
 Sini @-@ <unk> " ( S ) he sleeps " 
 sleep @-@ 3p / IND 
 Intransitive clause with subject noun phrase : 
 <unk> <unk> " the man sleeps " 
 <unk> sleep @-@ 3p / IND 
 Transitive clause with no overt arguments : 
 Asa @-@ vaa " ( S ) he loves him / her / it " 
 love @-@ 3p / 3p 
 Transitive clause with agent noun phrase : 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ vaa " the man loves him / her / it " 
 man @-@ ERG love @-@ 3p / 3p 
 Transitive clause with patient noun phrase : 
 <unk> <unk> @-@ vaa " ( S ) he loves the woman " 
 <unk> love @-@ 3p / 3p 
 = = = = <unk> alignment = = = = 
 The Greenlandic language uses case to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence . Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases . 
 Greenlandic is an ergative language . This means that , instead of treating the grammatical relations as in most European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative , the grammatical roles are defined differently . In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors . <unk> case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs . Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete , converting the language into a nominative – accusative language . 
 Intransitive : 
 Anda sini @-@ <unk> " Anda sleeps " 
 <unk> sleep @-@ 3p / IND 
 Transitive with agent and object : 
 Anda @-@ p <unk> taku @-@ aa " Anda sees a bear " 
 <unk> bear @-@ ABS see @-@ 3p / 3p 
 = = = = Word order = = = = 
 In transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases , basic , pragmatically neutral word order is <unk> / <unk> , where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases . This order is fairly free , though . Topical noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last . This is usually the verb , but it can also be a focal subject or object as well . In spoken language also " afterthought " material or clarifications may follow the verb , usually in a lowered pitch . 
 On the other hand , the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the <unk> . 
 In copula clauses the order is usually Subject @-@ <unk> @-@ Complement . 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> " Anda bought the sweater " 
 Anda sweater bought 
 A O V 
 An attribute appears after its head noun . 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " Anda bought the blue sweater " 
 Anda sweater blue bought 
 A O X V 
 An attribute of an incorporated noun appears after the verb : 
 Anda <unk> <unk> " Anda is a skilled carpenter " 
 Anda <unk> skilled

 = = = = Coordination and Subordination = = = = 
 <unk> coordination and subordination is done by combining predicates in the <unk> moods ( indicative , interrogative , imperative , optative ) with predicates in the subordinate moods ( conditional , causative , contemporative and participial ) . The contemporative has both <unk> and <unk> functions depending on context . The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free , and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns . 
 = = = = <unk> and switch @-@ reference = = = = 
 The Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as <unk> or switch @-@ reference . There is a special so @-@ called fourth person used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is <unk> with the third person subject of the matrix clause . Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person : 
 illu @-@ a taku @-@ aa " he saw his ( the other man 's ) house " 
 house @-@ <unk> see @-@ 3p / 3p 
 illu @-@ ni taku @-@ aa " he saw his own house "

 = = = = <unk> construction = = = = 
 There is no category of definiteness in Greenlandic , so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means . According to some authors , morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called antipassive or intransitive object conveys such meaning , along with strategies of noun incorporation of non @-@ topical noun phrases . This view , however , is controversial . 
 Active : 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> " Peter saw the whale "

 = = = Verbs = = = 
 The morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex . The two main processes are inflection and derivation . <unk> morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood , person , and voice ( tense / aspect is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut ) . <unk> morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by adverbs in English . <unk> suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds . Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as <unk> rather than suffixes , particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar . Such semantically " heavy " suffixes may express concepts such as " to have " , " to be " , " to say " , or " to think " . The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes / <unk> + inflectional suffixes . Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes .

 Greenlandic verbs inflect for agreement with agent and patient , for mood and for voice . There are eight moods , of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses . The four independent moods are : indicative , interrogative , imperative , optative . The four dependent moods are causative , conditional , contemporative , and participial . Verbal roots can take transitive , intransitive or negative inflections , so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms . The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme , requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms . As some moods do not have forms for all persons ( imperative only has 2nd person , optative only 1st and 3rd person , participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person ) , the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318 . 
 = = = = = Indicative and interrogative moods = = = = = 
 The indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses . The interrogative mood is used for posing questions . Questions with the question particle <unk> " maybe " cannot use the interrogative mood . 
 <unk> @-@ vit ? " Are you sick ? " ( interrogative mood ) 
 <unk> @-@ YOU / <unk> 
 <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ nga . " No , I am not sick " ( indicative mood ) 
 no , <unk> @-@ NEG @-@ I / IND 
 Table 5 shows the intransitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb <unk> " to eat " in the indicative and interrogative moods ( question marks mark interrogative intonation — questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most Indo @-@ European languages in which questions are marked by rising intonation ) . The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection , but here only the intransitive inflection is given . Interestingly , consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation ( with strengthening to pp in the 3rd person plural and weakening to v elsewhere ) . 
 Table 6 shows the transitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb <unk> " to love " ( an asterisk means that this form does not occur as such but would have to use a different reflexive inflection ) . 
 = = = = = Imperative and <unk> moods = = = = = 
 The imperative mood is used to issue orders . It is always combined with the second person . The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person . There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions . Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms . There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms : a standard one , and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children .

 = = = = = Conditional mood = = = = = 
 The conditional mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning " if " or " when " . 
 <unk> @-@ pat Eva ani @-@ ssaa @-@ q " If the sun shines , Eva will go out " 
 Sunshine @-@ <unk> Eva go.out @-@ expect / 3p 
 = = = = = <unk> mood = = = = = 
 The causative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning " because " or " since " or " when " ; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of " that " . The causative is also used in main clauses to imply some underlying cause . 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ poq " He went to bed because he was tired " 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> / 3p <unk> @-@ 3p 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ ama " I 've eaten blubber ( that 's why I 'm not hungry ) "

 go.out @-@ <unk> / YOU remember @-@ fut @-@ IMP fox @-@ are @-@ <unk> 
 = = = = = <unk> mood = = = = = 
 The contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity . It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical . If they differ , the participial mood or causative mood are used . The contemporative can also be used to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking . 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ punga " Being tired , I went home " 
 <unk> @-@ CONT / I <unk> @-@ I

 Eva say @-@ 3p boot @-@ PL pay @-@ CONT / 3p 
 = = = = = <unk> mood = = = = = 
 The participial mood is used to construct a subordinate clause describing its subject in the state of carrying out an activity . It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects . It is often used in <unk> phrases such as relative clauses . 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> taku @-@ ara " I saw her read / I saw that she read " 
 read @-@ PART / 3p see @-@ I / 3p 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> tiki @-@ ssa @-@ <unk> " I hope he is coming / I hope he 'll come " 
 hope @-@ I come @-@ expect @-@ PART / 3p 
 = = = = Derivation = = = = 
 Verbal derivation is extremely productive , and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes . Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix , resulting in very long words . Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs . 
 <unk> " be tired of " 
 taku @-@ <unk> @-@ para " I am tired of seeing it / him / her " 
 see @-@ <unk> @-@ I / 3p 
 <unk> " begin to / be about to " 
 neri @-@ ler @-@ <unk> " We are about to eat " 
 eat @-@ begin @-@ WE 
 <unk> " be proficient at " 
 <unk> @-@ su @-@ <unk> @-@ poq " She is good at singing "

 <unk> " plans to / wants to "

 arrive @-@ <unk> @-@ 3p 
 = = = = Time reference and aspect = = = = 
 Greenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between , for example , recent and distant past , but the use of these is not obligatory , and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic 's extensive derivational system than as a system of tense markers . Rather than by morphological marking , fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials : 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ poq " He died long ago " 
 die @-@ <unk> @-@ 3p / IND 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ punga " I ate recently " 
 eat @-@ recently @-@ I / IND 
 <unk> Piitaq <unk> @-@ poq " Yesterday Peter was running . " 
 yesterday Peter @-@ ABS run @-@ 3p / IND 
 All other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials , the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal aktionsart . 
 Piitaq <unk> @-@ poq " Peter runs " 
 Peter @-@ ABS run @-@ 3p / IND 
 Piitaq ani @-@ voq " Peter was gone out " 
 Peter @-@ ABS go.out @-@ 3p / IND 
 But if a sentence containing an <unk> verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative , it would be interpreted as past . 
 Greenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart , e.g. sar expressing " habituality " and <unk> expressing " stop to " . Next to these , there are at least two major perfect markers : sima and <unk> sima can occur in several positions with obviously different function <unk> position indicates evidential meaning , but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present . 
 tiki ( t ) <unk> @-@ sima @-@ voq " Apparently , she had arrived " 
 arrive @-@ <unk> @-@ SIMA @-@ 3p / INT 
 With <unk> verbs , there is a regular contrast between <unk> evidentiality marked by sima and witnessed evidentiality marked by nikuu . Due to its evidential meaning , the combination of first person and sima sometimes is marked . 
 <unk> @-@ sima @-@ voq " He cried ( his eyes are swollen ) " 
 cry @-@ SIMA @-@ 3p / IND 
 <unk> @-@ nikuu @-@ voq " He cried ( I was there ) " 
 cry @-@ <unk> @-@ 3p / IND 
 In the written language and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers , sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past . That is , they might arguably mark time reference , but not yet systematically . 
 Just as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense , the language also does not have a future tense . Rather , it employs three different strategies to express future meaning : 
 suffixes denoting cognitive states that show an attitude about prospective actions . 
 e.g. <unk> @-@ ara <unk> manna Dudley <unk> @-@ tor @-@ si @-@ <unk> @-@ ssa @-@ <unk> " I expect to get some fun out of Dudley this summer . " 
 expect @-@ I / 3p / IND summer this Dudley <unk> @-@ cn @-@ <unk> @-@ expect @-@ <unk> / 3p 
 <unk> suffixes creating <unk> actions which can then be understood as already having begun by virtue of the indicative mood . 
 e.g. <unk> @-@ ler @-@ para " I 've started to bring him . " 
 bring @-@ begin @-@ I / 3p / IND 
 moods that mark the speech act as a request or wish . 
 e.g. <unk> @-@ t <unk> @-@ niar @-@ <unk> " Let us feed the dogs , ok ? " dog @-@ PL feed @-@ please @-@ we / them / IMP 
 While the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial , some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non @-@ future . Especially , the suffix <unk> and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers . However , at least for literary Greenlandic , these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described . 
 = = = = Noun incorporation = = = = 
 There is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation . This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning . On the other hand , Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots . The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs . Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation . Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses . This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation . They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb , subject and object . Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized . Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs . This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element . The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots . 
 <unk> " dog " + <unk> " have " ( + <unk> " 3p " ) 
 <unk> @-@ qar @-@ poq " She has a dog " 
 illu " house " + - ' <unk> " make " 
 illu @-@ <unk> @-@ poq " She builds a house " 
 <unk> " coffee " + <unk> " drink / eat " 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ poq " She drinks coffee " 
 puisi " seal " + <unk> " hunt " 
 puisi @-@ <unk> @-@ poq " She hunts seal " 
 <unk> " letter " + <unk> " receive " 
 <unk> @-@ si @-@ voq " She has received a letter " 
 <unk> " mother " + -a- " to be " 
 <unk> @-@ a @-@ voq " She is a mother " 
 = = = Nouns = = = 
 Nouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor . Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used : absolutive , ergative ( relative ) , instrumental , allative , locative , ablative , prosecutive ( also called <unk> or <unk> ) , and equative . Case and number are marked by a single suffix . Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes , e.g. <unk> " to read " + <unk> " place " becomes <unk> " school " and <unk> + <unk> " something good " becomes <unk> " good school " . 
 The fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns , parallel to the same distinction in the verbs . 
 = = = = Pronouns = = = = 
 There are personal pronouns for first- , second- , and third @-@ person singular and plural . These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects , but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments . 
 Personal pronouns are , however , necessary in the oblique case : 
 <unk> @-@ nut <unk> @-@ qu @-@ aa 
 thou <unk> eat tell @-@ to 3s @-@ 3s @-@ <unk> . 
 <unk> told you to eat <unk> 
 = = = = Case = = = = 
 The two grammatical core cases <unk> and <unk> are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases . The oblique case expresses information related to movement and manner . 
 <unk> @-@ t neri @-@ voq " The man eats " 
 man @-@ ABS eat @-@ 3p 
 <unk> @-@ tip puisi neri @-@ vaa " The man eats the seal " 
 man @-@ ERG seal @-@ ABS eat @-@ 3p / 3p 
 The instrumental case is versatile . It is used for the instrument with which an action is carried out , for oblique objects of intransitive verbs ( also called antipassive verbs ) and for secondary objects of transitive verbs . 
 nano @-@ q <unk> @-@ mi @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ vaa " He stabbed the bear with his knife " 
 polar bear @-@ ABS knife @-@ <unk> @-@ INSTR stab @-@ 3p / 3p 
 <unk> tor @-@ tar @-@ poq " She usually drinks coffee " 
 coffee @-@ INSTR drink @-@ usually @-@ 3p 
 Piitaq <unk> @-@ mik <unk> @-@ vara " I gave Peter a knife " 
 Peter @-@ ABS knife @-@ INSTR give @-@ I / 3p 
 It is also used to express the meaning of " give me " and for forming adverbs from nouns : 
 <unk> @-@ mik ! " ( give me ) water " 
 water @-@ INSTR 
 <unk> @-@ mik <unk> @-@ poq " He slept late " 
 late @-@ INSTR sleep @-@ 3p 
 The allative case describes movement towards something . 
 illu @-@ mut " towards the house " 
 It is also used with numerals and the question word <unk> to express the time of the clock , and in the meaning " amount per unit " : 
 <unk> @-@ nut ? – <unk> @-@ nut . " When ? " – " At three o 'clock " 
 when @-@ ALL three @-@ ALL 
 <unk> @-@ mut <unk> krone @-@ qar @-@ poq " It costs 20 crowns per kilo " 
 kilo @-@ ALL twenty crown @-@ have @-@ 3p 
 The locative case describes spatial location : 
 illu @-@ mi " in the house " 
 The ablative case describes movement away from something or the source of something : 
 <unk> @-@ mit <unk> @-@ voq " He got a letter from Rasmus " 
 Rasmus @-@ ABL <unk> @-@ 3p 
 <unk> @-@ mit <unk> " ( antler ) horn from a rein @-@ deer " 
 <unk> @-@ ABL horn 
 The prosecutive case describes movement through something as well as the medium of writing or a location on the body . It is also used to describe a group of people such as a family as belonging to the modified noun . 
 <unk> @-@ kkut iser @-@ poq " He entered through the door " 
 door @-@ PROS enter @-@ 3p 
 su @-@ kkut <unk> @-@ <unk> ? " Where ( on the body ) did he hit you ? " 
 where @-@ PROS hit @-@ 3p / YOU 
 <unk> @-@ kkut " the priest and his family " 
 priest @-@ PROS 
 The equative case describes similarity of manner or quality . It is also used for deriving language names from nouns denoting nationalities , i.e. " like a person of x nationality [ speaks ] " . 
 <unk> <unk> @-@ sar @-@ poq " he works as a doctor " 
 doctor @-@ <unk> work @-@ <unk> @-@ 3p 
 <unk> @-@ tut " Danish language ( like a Dane ) " 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> 
 = = = = Possession = = = = 
 In Greenlandic possession is marked on the noun which agrees with the person and number of its possessor . The possessor is in the ergative case . There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases . Table 4 gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of illu " house " . Below are given examples of the use of the possessive inflection , the use of the ergative case for possessors and the use of fourth person possessors . 
 Anda @-@ p illu @-@ a " Anda 's house " 
 Anda @-@ ERG house @-@ 3p / POSS 
 Anda @-@ p illu @-@ ni taku @-@ aa " Anda sees his own house " 
 Anda @-@ ERG house @-@ 4p / POSS see @-@ 3p / 3p 
 Anda @-@ p illu @-@ a taku @-@ aa " Anda sees his ( the other man 's ) house " 
 Anda @-@ ERG house @-@ 3p / POSS see @-@ 3p / 3p 
 = = Vocabulary = = 
 Greenlandic vocabulary is mostly inherited from Proto @-@ Eskimo – Aleut , but it has also taken a large number of loans from other languages , especially from Danish . Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system , for example the Greenlandic word <unk> " priest " is a loan from the Danish " <unk> " . But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots , many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed , e.g. <unk> " computer " which literally means " artificial brain " . This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families . For example the root for " tongue " <unk> is used to derive the following words : 
 <unk> ' <unk> 
 <unk> ' <unk> 
 <unk> ' <unk> 
 <unk> ' <unk> 
 <unk> ' <unk> 
 <unk> ' <unk> 
 <unk> ' harangues <unk> 
 <unk> ' <unk> 
 <unk> ' speaks badly about <unk> 
 Lexical differences between dialects are often considerable . This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person . Since people were often named after everyday objects , many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules , causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further . 
 = = Orthography = = 
 Greenlandic is written with the Latin script . The alphabet : 
 A E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V 
 To spell loanwords from other languages , especially from Danish and English , the additional letters B , C , D , X , Y , Z , W , Æ , Ø and Å are used . Greenlandic uses the symbols " ... " and » ... « as quotation marks . 
 From 1851 and until 1973 Greenlandic was written in the alphabet invented by Samuel Kleinschmidt . This alphabet employed the special character <unk> ( <unk> / <unk> ) which was replaced by q in the 1973 reform . In the Kleinschmidt alphabet , long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels ( in the case of consonant gemination , the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant ) . For example , the name Kalaallit <unk> was spelled <unk> <unk> . This scheme uses a <unk> accent ( <unk> ) to indicate a long vowel ( e.g. , <unk> / <unk> / <unk> , modern : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , an acute accent ( ´ ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant : ( i.e. , á , í , ú modern : a ( kk ) , i ( kk ) , u ( kk ) ) ] and , finally , a <unk> ( <unk> ) or a grave accent ( ` ) , depending on the author , indicates vowel length and gemination of the following consonant ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , modern : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) . The letters ê and ô , used only before r and q , are now written er / eq and or / <unk> in Greenlandic . The spelling system of <unk> , spoken in <unk> in northeastern Labrador , is derived from the old Greenlandic system . 
 Technically , the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology : the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts , despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts . The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system : Here , there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation , and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts . The differences are due to phonological changes . It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new ( cf. the online converter ) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis .

 = Battersea Power Station = 
 Battersea Power Station is a decommissioned coal @-@ fired power station located on the south bank of the River Thames , in Nine Elms , Battersea , an inner @-@ city district of South West London . It comprises two individual power stations , built in two stages in the form of a single building . Battersea A Power Station was built in the 1930s , with Battersea B Power Station to the east in the 1950s . The two stations were built to a nearly identical design , providing the long @-@ recognized four @-@ chimney layout . The station ceased generating electricity in 1983 , but over the past 50 years it has become one of the best known landmarks in London and is Grade II * listed . The station 's celebrity owes much to numerous popular culture references , which include the cover art of Pink Floyd 's 1977 album Animals and its appearance in the 1965 Beatles ' film , Help ! . 
 The station is one of the largest brick buildings in the world and is notable for its original , lavish Art Deco interior fittings and decor . The building has remained largely unused since its closure and the condition of the structure has been described as " very bad " by English Heritage , which included it in its Heritage at Risk Register . The site was also listed on the 2004 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund . 
 Since the station 's closure numerous redevelopment plans were drawn up from successive site owners . In 2004 , when a redevelopment project by Parkview International stalled , the site was sold to the administrators of Irish company Real Estate Opportunities ( REO ) , who bought it for £ 400 million in November 2006 with plans to refurbish the station for public use and build 3 @,@ 400 homes across the site . This plan fell through due to REO 's debt being called in by its creditors , the state @-@ owned banks in the UK and Ireland , and the site was subsequently placed on sale in December 2011 to the open property market through commercial estate agent Knight Frank . It has received interest from a variety of overseas consortia , most seeking to demolish or partly @-@ demolish the structure . The combination of an existing debt burden of some £ 750 million , the need to make a £ 200 million contribution to a proposed extension to the London Underground , requirements to fund conservation of the derelict power station shell and the presence of a waste transfer station and cement plant on the river frontage made a commercial development of the site a significant challenge . 
 On 7 June 2012 , Knight Frank announced that administrators Ernst & Young had entered into an exclusivity agreement with Malaysia ’ s SP Setia and Sime Darby and were working towards a timely exchange and completion of the site and associated land . Completion of the £ 400 million sale took place in September 2012 , and the redevelopment intends to implement the Rafael <unk> design which had gained planning consent from Wandsworth Council in 2011 . In January 2013 the first residential apartments went on sale . Construction on Phase 1 was due to commence in 2013 , with completion due in 2016 / 17 . 
 = = History = = 
 Until the late 1930s electricity was supplied by municipal undertakings . These were small power companies that built power stations dedicated to a single industry or group of factories , and sold any excess electricity to the public . These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency . In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership . Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company . They planned to heed parliament 's recommendations and build a small number of very large stations . 
 The London Power Company 's first of these super power stations was planned for the Battersea area , on the south bank of the River Thames in London . The proposal was made in 1927 , for a station built in two stages and capable of generating 400 megawatts ( MW ) of electricity when complete . The site chosen was a 15 @-@ acre ( 61 @,@ 000 m2 ) plot of land which had been the site of the reservoirs for the former Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company . The site was chosen for its proximity to the River Thames for cooling water and coal delivery , and because it was in the heart of London , the station 's immediate supply area . 
 The proposal sparked protests from those who felt that the building would be too large and would be an eyesore , as well as worries about the pollution damaging local buildings , parks and even paintings in the nearby Tate Gallery . The company addressed the former concern by hiring Sir Giles Gilbert Scott to design the building 's exterior . He was a noted architect and industrial designer , famous for his design of the red telephone box , and of Liverpool Anglican Cathedral . He would go on to design another London power station , Bankside , which now houses Tate Modern art gallery . The pollution issue was resolved by granting permission for the station on the condition that its emissions were to be treated , to ensure they were " clean and smokeless " . 
 Construction of the first phase , the A Station , began in March 1929 . The main building work was carried out by John Mowlem & Co , and the structural steelwork erection carried out by Sir William Arrol & Co . Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks . Most of the electrical equipment , including the steam turbine turbo generators , was produced by Metropolitan @-@ Vickers in Trafford Park , Manchester . The building of the steel frame began in October 1930 . Once completed , the construction of the brick cladding began , in March 1931 . Until the construction of the B Station , the eastern wall of the boiler house was clad in corrugated metal sheeting as a temporary enclosure . The A Station first generated electricity in 1933 , but was not completed until 1935 . The total cost of its construction was £ 2 @,@ 141 @,@ 550 . Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933 , there were six fatal and 121 non @-@ fatal accidents on the site . 
 After the end of the Second World War , construction began on the second phase , the B Station . The station came into operation gradually between 1953 and 1955 . It was nearly identical to the A Station from the outside and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it , which gave the power station its now familiar four @-@ chimney layout . The construction of the B Station brought the site 's generating capacity up to 509 megawatts ( MW ) , making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time , providing a fifth of London 's electricity needs ( with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations ) . It was also the most thermally efficient power station in the world when it opened . 
 The A Station had been operated by the London Power Company , but by the time the B Station was completed , the UK 's electric supply industry had been nationalised , and ownership of the two stations had passed into the hands of the British Electricity Authority in 1948 . In 1955 , this became the Central Electricity Authority , which in turn became the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1957 . 
 On 20 April 1964 , the power station was the site of a fire that caused power failures throughout London , including at the BBC Television Centre , which was due to launch BBC Two that night . The launch was delayed until the following day at 11 am . 
 = = Design and specification = = 
 Both of the stations were designed by a team of architects and engineers . The team was headed by Dr. Leonard Pearce , the chief engineer of the London Power Company , but a number of other notable engineers were also involved , including Henry Newmarch Allott , and T. P. O 'Sullivan who was later responsible for the Assembly Hall at Filton . J. Theo Halliday was employed as architect , with Halliday & Agate Co. employed as a sub @-@ consultant . Halliday was responsible for the supervision and execution of the appearance of the exterior and interior of the building . Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott was involved in the project much later on , consulted to appease public reaction , and referred to in the press as " architect of the exterior " . The station was designed in the brick @-@ cathedral style of power station design , which was popular at the time . Battersea is one of a very small number of examples of this style of power station design still in existence in the UK , others being Uskmouth and Bankside . The station 's design proved popular straightaway , and was described as a " temple of power " , which ranked equal with St Paul 's Cathedral as a London landmark . In a 1939 survey by The Architectural Review a panel of celebrities ranked it as their second favourite modern building . 
 The A Station 's control room was given many Art Deco fittings by architect Halliday . Italian marble was used in the turbine hall , and polished parquet floors and wrought @-@ iron staircases were used throughout . Owing to a lack of available money following the Second World War , the interior of the B Station was not given the same treatment , and instead the fittings were made from stainless steel . 
 Each of the two connected stations consists of a long boiler house with a chimney at each end and an adjacent turbine hall . This makes a single main building which is of steel frame construction with brick cladding , similar to the skyscrapers built in the United States around the same time . The station is the largest brick structure in Europe . The building 's gross dimensions measure 160 metres ( 520 ft ) by 170 metres ( 560 ft ) , with the roof of the boiler house standing at over 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . Each of the four chimneys is made from concrete and stands 103 metres ( 338 ft ) tall with a base diameter of 28 ft tapering to 22 ft at the top . The station also had jetty facilities for unloading coal , a coal sorting and storage area , control rooms and an administration block . 
 The A Station generated electricity using three turbo alternators ; two 69 megawatt ( MW ) Metropolitan @-@ Vickers British Thomson @-@ Houston sets , and one 105 MW Metropolitan @-@ Vickers set , totalling 243 MW . At the time of its commissioning , the 105 MW generating set was the largest in Europe . The B Station also had three turbo alternators , all made by Metropolitan @-@ Vickers . This consisted of two units which used 16 MW high pressure units exhausting to a 78 MW and associated with a 6 MW house alternator , giving these units a total rating of 100 MW . The third unit consisted of a 66 MW machine associated with a 6 MW house alternator , giving the unit a rating of 72 MW . Combined , these gave the B station a generating capacity of 260 MW , making the site 's generating capacity 503 MW . All of the station 's boilers were made by Babcock & Wilcox , fuelled by pulverised coal from pulverisers also built by Babcock & Wilcox . There were nine boilers in the A station and six in the B station . The B station 's boilers were the largest ever built in the UK at that time . The B station also had the highest thermal efficiency of any power station in the country for the first twelve years of its operation .

 = = = Coal transportation = = = 
 The station had an annual coal consumption of over 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 tonnes . The majority of this coal was delivered to the station from coal ports in South Wales and North East England by coastal collier ships . The ships were " flat @-@ irons " with a low @-@ profile superstructure , fold @-@ down funnel and masts to fit under bridges over the Thames above the Pool of London . The LPC and its nationalised successors owned and operated several of its own " flat @-@ irons " for this service . 
 The jetty facilities used two cranes to offload coal , with the capacity of unloading two ships at one time , at a rate of 480 tonnes an hour . Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site . Coal was usually delivered to the jetty , rather than by rail . A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station 's boiler rooms . The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers . The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75 @,@ 000 tonnes of coal . This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system , for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms . 
 = = = Water system = = = 
 Water is essential to a thermal power station , as it is used to condense steam from the steam turbines before it is returned to the boiler . Water cycled through Battersea Power Station 's systems was taken from the River Thames , upon whose banks it had been built . The station would extract an average of 1 @.@ 5 gigalitres ( 340 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ) of water from the river each day . Once the water had been through the station 's systems , the water was cooled and discharged back into the river . 
 After the end of World War II , the London Power Company took the opportunity to use the waste heat to supply the Pimlico District Heating Undertaking , which started operating in 1950 .

 The reduction of sulphur emissions had been an important factor since the station was in the design stages , as it was one of the main worries of those who protested the construction of the station . The London Power Company began developing an experimental technique for washing the flue gases in 1925 . It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in the flue ducts . The gases were subject to continuous washing , and with the presence of the catalyst iron oxide , sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid . Battersea Power Station was one of the first commercial applications of this technique in the world . This method of washing was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s , when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful to the river than the gases would be to the atmosphere .

 = = = Closure = = = 
 The fact that the station 's output continued to fall , coupled with increased operating costs , such as flue gas cleaning , led to Battersea 's demise . On 17 March 1975 , the A Station was closed after being in operation for 40 years . By this time the A Station was co @-@ firing oil and its generating capacity had declined to 228 MW . 
 Three years after the closure of the A Station , rumours began to circulate that the B Station would soon follow . A campaign was then launched to try to save the building as part of the national heritage . As a result , the station was declared a heritage site in 1980 , when the Secretary of State for the Environment , Michael Heseltine , awarded the building Grade II listed status . ( This was upgraded to Grade II * listed in 2007 . ) On 31 October 1983 production of electricity at Station B also ended , after nearly 30 years of operation . By then the B Station 's generating capacity had fallen to 146 MW . The closure of the two stations was put down largely to the generating equipment becoming outdated , and the preferred choice of fuel for electricity generation shifting from coal toward oil , gas and nuclear power . Since the station ceased generating electricity , there have been numerous proposals and attempts to redevelop the site . 
 = = = Theme park proposal = = = 
 Following the station 's closure , the Central Electricity Generating Board had planned to demolish the station and sell the land for housing , but because of the building 's then Grade II listed status , they had to pay the high cost of preserving the building . In 1983 they held a competition for ideas on the redevelopment of the site . It was won by a consortium including Alton Towers Ltd , which proposed an indoor theme park , based around Britain 's industrial history . At an estimated cost of £ 35 million , the scheme was risky and would require over 2 million visitors a year to make any profit . The scheme received planning approval in May 1986 and the site was purchased by John Broome for £ 1 @.@ 5 million in 1987 . Work on converting the site began the same year . 
 The project was halted in March 1989 , for lack of funding , after costs had quickly escalated that January , from £ 35 million to £ 230 million . By this point huge sections of the building 's roof had been removed , so that machinery could be taken out . Without a roof , the building 's steel framework has been left exposed and its foundations have been prone to flooding . 
 In March 1990 , the proposal was changed to a mixture of offices , shops and a hotel . This proposal was granted planning permission in August 1990 , despite opposition from 14 independent organisations , including English Heritage . Despite permission being granted , no further work took place on the site between 1990 and 1993 . 
 = = = Parkview proposal = = = 
 In 1993 , the site and its outstanding debt of £ 70 million were bought from the Bank of America by Hong Kong @-@ based development company , Parkview International , for £ 10 million . Following resolution of creditors ' claims , it acquired the freehold title in May 1996 . In November 1996 plans for the redevelopment of the site were submitted and outline consent was received in May 1997 . Detailed consent for much of the site was granted in August 2000 , and the rest in May 2001 . The company received full possession of the site in 2003 . Having purchased the site , Parkview started work on a £ 1 @.@ 1 billion project to restore the building and to redevelop the site into a retail , housing and leisure complex . 
 Parkview 's project plan , called simply " The Power Station " , was masterminded by architect Nicholas Grimshaw . The scheme proposed a shopping mall , with 40 to 50 restaurants , cafés and bars , 180 shops , as well as nightclubs , comedy venues and a cinema . Cosmopolitan shops would have been sited in the A Station 's turbine hall , and label name shops in the B Station 's turbine hall . The boiler house would have been glazed over and used as a public space for installations and exhibitions . A riverside walkway would also be created , running continuously along the riverside from Vauxhall to Battersea Park . 
 Parkview claimed that 3 @,@ 000 jobs would be created during the construction of the project , and 9 @,@ 000 would be employed once completed , with an emphasis on local recruitment . The Battersea Power Station Community Group campaigned against the Parkview plan and argued for an alternative community @-@ based scheme to be drawn up . The group described the plans as " a deeply unattractive project that has no affordable housing anywhere on the 38 @-@ acre ( 150 @,@ 000 m2 ) site , no decent jobs for local people and no credible public transport strategy " . They also criticised how appropriate the project was in its location , and proposal of other large buildings on the site . Keith Garner of the group said " I feel that there ’ s a real problem of appropriateness . They need a completely different kind of scheme , not this airport @-@ lounge treatment . What you see now is a majestic building looming up from the river . If you surround it with buildings 15 storeys high , you don ’ t have a landmark any more . " 
 In 2005 Parkview , English Heritage and the London Borough of Wandsworth claimed that the reinforcement inside the chimneys was corroded and irreparable . Wandsworth Council granted permission for them to be demolished and rebuilt . However , the Twentieth Century Society , the World Monuments Fund and the Battersea Power Station Company Ltd commissioned an alternative engineers ' report that claimed that the existing chimneys could be repaired . In response , Parkview claimed to have given a legally binding undertaking to the council to provide certainty that the chimneys will be replaced " like for like " , in accordance with the requirements of English Heritage and the planning authorities . 
 = = = REO proposal = = = 
 On 30 November 2006 , it was announced that Real Estate Opportunities , led by Irish businessmen Richard Barrett and Johnny Ronan of Treasury Holdings , had purchased Battersea Power Station and the surrounding land for € 532 million ( £ 400 million ) . REO subsequently announced that the previous plan by Parkview had been dropped and that it had appointed the practice of the Uruguayan @-@ born architect Rafael Viñoly , of New York as the new master planner for the site . The engineers Roger Preston & Partners and Buro Happold were retained on the design team . REO announced its £ 4 billion plan in 2008 , later revised . Jersey law firms , Ogier , Carey Olsen and <unk> <unk> helped REO to raise funds for the new Battersea Power Station redevelopment . On 30 November 2011 , it was officially announced that the REO scheme had collapsed with the debt called in by its lenders and creditors , putting the site in administration . 
 London Underground extension 
 A proposed part of the regeneration is an extension of the London Underground to serve the area . Although the site is close to Battersea Park and Queenstown Road stations , it appears to be considered that trains from these stations to Victoria and Waterloo respectively are already heavily loaded . The proposed 2 @-@ mile tunnelled extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea . The proposed extension would cost at least £ 500 million in 2008 terms before inflation and optimism bias ( extra contingency amounts ) and would be part funded by REO and , possibly , other significant land owners in the Nine Elms area . The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £ 200 million to the Underground extension , which adds another financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site . 
 Biomass power station 
 They include reusing part of the station building as a power station , fuelled by biomass and waste . The station 's existing chimneys would be utilised for venting steam . The former turbine halls would be converted to shopping spaces , and the roofless boiler house used as a park . An energy museum would also be housed inside the former station building . The restoration of the power station building would cost £ 150 million . 
 Eco @-@ dome 
 A plastic built " eco @-@ dome " was to be built to the east of the power station . This building was originally planned to have a large 300 metres ( 980 ft ) chimney , but this has now been abandoned in favour of a series of smaller towers . The eco @-@ dome would house offices , and aim to reduce energy consumption in the buildings by 67 % compared to conventional office buildings , by using the towers to draw cool air through the building . 3 @,@ 200 new homes would also be built on the site to house 7 @,@ 000 people . 
 Consultation process 
 In June 2008 a consultation process was launched , which revealed that 66 % of the general public were in favour of the plans . At an event at the station on 23 March 2009 , it was announced that REO were to submit the planning application for their proposal to Wandsworth Council . These plans have now been shelved due to the latest financial crisis to hit the site . 
 Planning consent 
 The Council gave planning consent on 11 November 2010 . REO hoped for construction to begin in 2011 , but this has now been delayed to 2012 . The station structure itself is expected to be repaired and secure by 2016 , with completion of the whole project by 2020 . Plans now include the construction of 3 @,@ 400 apartments and 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 330 @,@ 000 m2 ) of office space . Approximately 28 @,@ 000 inhabitants and 25 @,@ 000 workers are expected to occupy the space once complete . 
 Lenders allow more time 
 Reuters reported on 1 September 2011 that lenders would allow more time for a new equity partner to be found : 
 " Lenders to the owner of Battersea Power Station in London waived a debt maturity deadline yesterday while talks with potential new equity partners for its redevelopment continued , a source close to the process told Reuters . AIM @-@ listed Real Estate Opportunities is seeking a partner for the 5 @.@ 5 billion pound ( $ 9 billion ) development , and its senior lenders Lloyds and Ireland 's National Asset Management Agency have already extended a deadline once relating to the 400 million pounds REO paid for the site in 2006 . ' The banks have nothing to gain by calling the debt in . Talks with new equity partners continue , and an announcement may come in the next few weeks , ' the source said " . 
 However , in November 2011 , Lloyds and NAMA called in the debt and the REO scheme collapsed into administration . A new buyer is now being sought for the site .

 Following the failure of the REO bid to develop the site , in February 2012 , Battersea Power Station was put up for sale on the open market for the first time in its history . The sale was conducted by commercial estate agent Knight Frank on behalf of the site 's creditors . In May 2012 , several bids were received for the landmark site , which was put on the market after Nama and Lloyds Banking Group called in loans held by Treasury Holdings ' Real Estate Opportunities ( REO ) . Bids were received from Chelsea F.C. with other interested parties including a Malaysian interest , SP Setia , London & Regional , a company owned by the London @-@ based Livingstone brothers and housebuilder Berkeley . If sold , the new owner would have to pay £ 500 million for the power station , including £ 325 million to cover the debts held by Nama and Lloyds , and a £ 100 million contribution to the Northern line extension . If the sale is unsuccessful , the agent would have a duty to maintain and preserve the site in line with its listed status . 
 On 7 June 2012 , Knight Frank announced that administrators Ernst & Young had entered into an exclusive agreement with Malaysian developers SP Setia and Sime Darby , who were given 28 days to conduct due diligence and agree the final terms of the deal . Completion of the sale to the Malaysian consortium took place in September 2012 . The redevelopment of the site will use the existing <unk> master plan which intends to position the Power Station as the central focus of the regenerated 40 @-@ acre site , housing a blend of shops , cafes , restaurants , art and leisure facilities , office space and residential accommodation . The plan includes the restoration of the historic Power Station itself , the creation of a new riverside park to the north of the Power Station and the creation of a new High Street which is designed to link the future entrance to Battersea Power Station tube station with the Power Station . The redevelopment is hoped to bring about the extension of the existing riverside walk and facilitate access directly from the Power Station to Battersea Park and Chelsea Bridge . 
 Restoration of the Grade II * listed Power Station is an early priority in the development . Work commenced in 2013 and plans include the restoration of the art deco structure internally and externally , reconstruction of the chimneys , and refurbishment of the historic cranes and jetty as a new river taxi stop . The plan includes over 800 homes of varying sizes , and sales of residential apartments in Phase 1 of the redevelopment began in January 2013 with around 75 per cent of townhouses and apartments being sold within four days . Construction work on Phase 1 , called Circus West , is being undertaken by Carillion and commenced in 2013 alongside work on the Power Station . The full redevelopment consists of seven main phases , some of which are planned to run concurrently . Phase 1 is due to complete in 2016 / 17 with the Northern line extension and requisite new Battersea Power Station terminal anticipated to complete in 2020 . 
 In October 2013 , Frank Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design " Phase 3 " of the scheme , which will provide " the gateway to the entire development and the new Northern line extension " . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 Battersea Power Station has become an iconic structure , being featured in or used as a shooting location for many films , television programmes , music videos and video games . One of the station 's earliest appearances on film was in Alfred Hitchcock 's 1936 film Sabotage , which shows the station before the construction of the B station . The interior of the A station 's control room was used for the " Find The Fish " segment of Monty Python 's 1983 film The Meaning of Life . 
 It also appears during the first daylight attack on London sequence in the 1969 movie , Battle of Britain , in the movie as in real life used as a navigational landmark by the attacking Luftwaffe bombers . More recently in October 2007 , the power station was used as a filming location for the Batman movie , The Dark Knight . The station 's stripped , empty interior was used as a setting for a burnt out warehouse . A closeup of the station can be seen as stand @-@ in for the exterior of a London railway station in the Michael Radford 's 1984 film Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four . The station appears repurposed as the Ministry of Arts in the film Children of Men , in which a floating pig appears , an homage done for the amusement of its proprietor . 
 The station has appeared numerous times in the long @-@ running British science fiction series Doctor Who . It appeared briefly in the episode The Dalek Invasion of Earth in 1964 , which saw the station in the 22nd century with two chimneys demolished , and a nearby nuclear reactor dome . It appeared again in the 2006 Doctor Who episodes " Rise of the Cybermen " and " The Age of Steel " as the base to which Londoners are drawn to be converted into Cybermen . 
 The Battersea Power Station Community Group think one of the main reasons for the power station 's worldwide recognition is that it appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd 's 1977 album Animals , on which it was photographed with the group 's inflatable pink pig floating above it . The photographs were taken in early December 1976 and the inflatable pig was made by the German company Ballon Fabrik and Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw . The inflatable pig was tethered to one of the power station 's southern chimneys , but broke loose from its moorings and , to the astonishment of pilots in approaching planes , drifted into the flight path of Heathrow Airport . Police helicopters tracked its course , until it landed in Kent . Video footage of the photoshoot was used in the promotional video for the song " Pigs on the Wing " . The album was officially launched at an event at the power station . 
 In recent years , the power station has been used for various sporting , cultural and political events . Since 22 August 2009 , the station has been used as a venue on the Red Bull X @-@ Fighters season . On 13 April 2010 the station was used as the venue for the launch of the Conservative Party 's 2010 general election manifesto . Between 6 and 7 May 2010 , the station site was used by Sky News in their coverage of the election . 
 = Constitution of Virginia = 
 The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia is the document that defines and limits the powers of the state government and the basic rights of the citizens of the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia . Like all other state constitutions , it is supreme over Virginia 's laws and acts of government , though it may be superseded by the United States Constitution and U.S. federal law as per the Supremacy Clause . 
 The original Virginia Constitution of 1776 was enacted in conjunction with the Declaration of Independence by the first thirteen states of the United States of America . Virginia was an early state to adopt its own Constitution on June 29 , 1776 , and the document was widely influential both in the United States and abroad . In addition to frequent amendments , there have been six major subsequent revisions of the constitution ( by Conventions for the constitutions of 1830 , 1851 , 1864 , 1870 , 1902 , and by commission for 1971 amendments ) . These new constitutions have been part of , and in reaction to , periods of major regional or social upheaval in Virginia . For instance , the 1902 constitution included provisions to <unk> African Americans , who in 1900 made up nearly 36 % of the state 's population . They did not regain suffrage until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid @-@ 1960s . 
 = = Historic constitutions = = 
 = = = 1776 = = = 
 The preparation of the first Virginia Constitution began in early 1776 , in the midst of the early events of the American Revolution . Among those who drafted the 1776 Constitution were George Mason and James Madison . Thomas Jefferson was Virginia 's representative to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia at the time , and his drafts of the Virginia constitution arrived too late to be incorporated into the final document . James Madison 's work on the Virginia Constitution helped him develop the ideas and skills that he would later use as one of the main architects of the United States Constitution . 
 The 1776 Constitution declared the dissolution of the rule of Great Britain over Virginia and accused England 's King George III of establishing a " detestable and insupportable tyranny " . It also established separation of governmental powers , with the creation of the bicameral Virginia General Assembly as the legislative body of the state and the Governor of Virginia as the " chief magistrate " or executive . The accompanying Virginia Declaration of Rights , written primarily by Mason , focuses on guarantees of basic human rights and freedoms and the fundamental purpose of government . It , in turn , served as a model for a number of other historic documents , including the United States Bill of Rights . 
 Critically , the 1776 Constitution limited the right to vote primarily to property owners and men of wealth . This effectively concentrated power in the hands of the landowners and aristocracy of Southeastern Virginia . Dissatisfaction with this power structure would come to dominate Virginia 's constitutional debate for almost a century . 
 = = = 1830 = = = 
 By the 1820s , Virginia was one of only two states that limited voting to landowners . In addition , because representation was by county rather than population , the residents of increasingly populous Western Virginia ( the area that would become West Virginia in 1863 ) had grown discontented at their limited representation in the legislature . Pressure increased until a constitutional convention was convened in 1829 – 1830 . This convention became largely a contest between eastern Virginia planters of the slaveholding elite and the less affluent yeomen farmers of Western Virginia . Issues of representation and suffrage dominated the debate . Delegates to the convention included such prominent Virginians as James Madison , James Monroe , John Tyler , and John Marshall . 
 The convention ultimately compromised by loosening suffrage requirements . It also reduced the number of delegates and senators to the Virginia General Assembly . The resulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority , though most of the voters in the western part of the state ended up voting against it . Thus , the underlying intrastate tensions remained , and would have to be addressed later . 
 = = = 1851 = = = 
 As of the 1840 census , the majority of the white residents of the state lived in western Virginia , but they were underrepresented in the legislature because of the continued property requirement for voting ; not all held sufficient property to vote . This compounded their dissatisfaction with the apportionment scheme adopted in 1830 , which was based on counties rather than population , thus giving disproportionate power to the fewer , but propertied whites who lived in the eastern part of the state and kept a grip on the legislature . As the state legislature also elected the governor and lieutenant governor , and the United States senators , Western Virginians felt they had little influence on state leadership . Their attempts to win electoral reform in the Virginia legislature were defeated each time . Some began to openly discuss the abolition of slavery or secession from the state . Ultimately , the eastern planters could not continue to ignore their discontent , and a new constitutional convention was called to resolve the continuing tensions . 
 The most significant change adopted in the 1851 Constitution was elimination of the property requirement for voting , resulting in extension of the suffrage to all white males of voting age . The 1851 Constitution established popular election for the governor , the newly created office of lieutenant governor , and all Virginia judges , rather than the election of the top two state officers by the legislature , or political appointment for judges . Because of these changes , the 1851 Virginia Constitution became known as the " Reform Constitution " . 
 = = = 1864 = = = 
 When in 1861 , the Virginia legislature voted for secession in the events leading up to the American Civil War , all of the western and several of the northern counties dissented They set up a separate government with Francis H. Pierpont as governor . During the Civil War , this separate or " restored " government approved the creation of West Virginia as a separate state ( which was admitted to the Union in 1863 ) and in 1864 it approved a new Constitution . The constitution was the product of a divided state and government ; it was the first since the original 1776 Constitution to be adopted by the legislature without a popular vote . 
 The 1864 Constitution abolished slavery in Virginia , disfranchised men who had served in the Confederate government , recognized the creation of the State of West Virginia , and adjusted the number and terms of office of the members of the Virginia Assembly . 
 The foreword to the current Virginia Constitution does not include the 1864 Constitution in its list of previous constitutions . It notes that the 1864 Constitution was drafted under wartime conditions and was of uncertain legal status . 
 = = = 1870 = = = 
 After the end of the Civil War , Virginia came briefly under military rule during Reconstruction , with the district commanded by John M. Schofield . Pursuant to federal Reconstruction legislation , Schofield called for a new constitutional convention to meet in Richmond from December 1867 to April 1868 . In protest of freedmen 's suffrage , many of Virginia 's conservative whites refused to participate in voting for delegates . As a result , Republicans led by Judge John Curtiss Underwood dominated the convention . Opponents called the result the " Underwood Constitution " or the " Negro Constitution " , as it gave freedmen suffrage . 
 Significant provisions included expanding the suffrage to all male citizens over the age of 21 , which included freedmen ; establishing a state public school system for the first time , with mandatory funding and attendance ; and providing for judges to be elected by the General Assembly rather than by popular vote . Controversy over clauses that continued the temporary disfranchisement of former Confederate government members delayed the adoption of the Constitution . An eventual compromise provided for separate voting on the disfranchisement clauses and the rest of the Constitution ; the former failed to win approval . The remainder of the Underwood Constitution was ratified by a popular vote of 210 @,@ 585 to 9 @,@ 136 , and went into effect in 1870 . 
 = = = 1902 = = = 
 In the late nineteenth century , white Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South . They passed Jim Crow laws establishing racial segregation in public facilities and restricting the lives of blacks . Beginning with Mississippi in 1890 , legislatures began to ratify new constitutions , amendments or electoral laws that disfranchised African @-@ American voters , devising means such as poll taxes , literacy tests and residential requirements that passed Supreme Court review but worked against poor blacks and many poor whites . By the turn of the 20th century , six Southern states had essentially eliminated the black vote , and pressure mounted among whites in Virginia to do the same , ostensibly as a way to stop electoral fraud and corruption . The 1901 constitutional convention met in this climate . Members were focused on restricting black voting rights without violating the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or <unk> poor whites . Led by the future Senator Carter Glass , the convention created requirements that all prospective voters had to pay poll taxes or pass a literacy test administered by white registrars . An exemption was granted , in a kind of grandfather clause , for military veterans and sons of veterans , who were virtually all white . The changes effectively disfranchised black voters , though many illiterate whites were also unable to meet the new requirements . In 1900 blacks made up nearly 36 % of the population . In succeeding elections , the Virginia electorate was reduced by nearly half as a result of the changes . Voter turnout would not return to 1904 levels until 1952 within a statewide population almost twice the size . The small electorate was key to maintaining the dominant Democratic Organization in power for sixty years . 
 Other significant provisions of the 1902 Constitution imposed racial segregation in public schools ( which already existed on a de facto basis ) and abolished the county court system . The Constitution provided for the creation of the State Corporation Commission to regulate the growing power of the railroads . Because of concern over African @-@ American opposition , the convention did not honor its pledge to have the proposed constitution put to popular vote . Like the 1864 Constitution by the Loyalist government during the Civil War , the legislature adopted the 1902 Constitution without ratification by the electorate . It was in effect far longer than any previous Virginia constitution . 
 = = Current constitution ( 1971 ) = = 
 As a result of the Civil Rights Movement challenging the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights , a series of US Supreme Court cases , beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 , the 24th Amendment , and federal legislation : the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation . Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965 , there was impetus for governmental change . Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state @-@ issued bonds and borrowing , and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution . In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission , chaired by former Governor <unk> Harrison , to revise the constitution . 
 The Commission on Constitutional Revision presented its report and recommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969 , and continued to work with them to draft a final consensus version . The proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia ( who by then included African @-@ American men and women , following passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid @-@ 1960s ) and took effect on July 1 , 1971 .

Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights , including the right to due process , the prohibition against double jeopardy , and the right to bear arms . Like the Federal Constitution , the Virginia Bill of Rights , in § 17 , states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people . 
 In 1997 , a Victims ' Rights Amendment was added to the Virginia Bill of Rights as § 8 @-@ A. In <unk> v. Commonwealth , the only case so far to interpret this amendment , the Virginia Supreme Court used the Victims ’ s Rights Amendment to support its ruling that an alleged rape victim could not be compelled to submit to a psychiatric evaluation . 
 On November 7 , 2006 , Virginia voters ratified an amendment , previously approved by the General Assembly , prohibiting same @-@ sex marriage , to be added to the Bill of Rights . This amendment also prohibits the recognition of any " union , partnership , or other legal status " between unmarried people that intends to approximate marriage or which confers the " rights , benefits , obligations , qualities , or effects of marriage . " The Virginia Attorney General issued an opinion stating that the amendment does not change the legal status of documents such as contracts , wills , or Advanced Medical Directives between unmarried people . The amendment was declared to be in violation the United States Constitution by a U.S. District Court Judge on February 13 , 2014 . ( In 2015 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the failure to provide for same @-@ sex marriage by any U.S. state had the effect of violating the rights of homosexuals to equal protection of law required under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution . )
