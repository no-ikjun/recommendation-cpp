 After World War II , the 1950 Census showed growth in Teaneck ( 33 @.@ 6 % ) pacing Bergen County overall ( 31 @.@ 6 % ) . Starting in 1960 , a substantial decline in the rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached the limits of developable land , and the township neared its peak population . Population growth in the 1970 Census was small , but positive , with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42 @,@ 355 . Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 ( − 7 @.@ 9 % ) and 1990 ( − 3 @.@ 0 % ) data . The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck 's population to 39 @,@ 260 , though growth ( 3 @.@ 8 % ) was smaller than in Bergen County overall ( 7 @.@ 1 % ) . 
 With almost no land left to develop for housing , Teaneck 's population is likely to remain stable for the foreseeable future . A reluctance to permit high @-@ rise development as a means to increase population density also places a limit on growth . Changes in family size and the possibility of zoning changes to allow denser construction are some of the few influences that may affect population over time .

 Super Mario RPG ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Sūpā Mario Āru Pī Jī ) , subtitled Legend of the Seven Stars in its North American release , is a role @-@ playing game developed by Square ( now Square Enix ) and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . It was originally released on March 9 , 1996 , in Japan and on May 13 , 1996 , in North America . Nintendo ported the game , with minor differences , to the Wii 's Virtual Console service in 2008 and to the Wii U 's Virtual Console service by late June 2016 to regions around the world . It is the first role @-@ playing video game in the Mario series . The game contains fundamental gameplay similarities and inspirations to other Square role @-@ playing video games , such as the Final Fantasy series , with a story and action @-@ based gameplay derived from the Super Mario Bros. series . 
 The story focuses on Mario and his party as they seek to eliminate the game 's main antagonist , Smithy . Smithy has stolen the seven star pieces of Star Road where all the world 's inhabitants ' wishes become Wish Stars , and Mario must return the pieces so these wishes may again be granted . The game features five permanent playable characters . Super Mario RPG was directed by Yoshihiko Maekawa and Chihiro Fujioka and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto . Yoko Shimomura composed the game 's score , which was released on a soundtrack album in Japan shortly after the game 's debut . 
 Square did much of the development of Super Mario RPG under direct guidance from producer Shigeru Miyamoto . The game was well @-@ received upon release , praised particularly for its 3D @-@ rendered graphics and humor . The game spawned the Mario RPG series , and two successive RPG @-@ themed spiritual sequels followed : the Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi series , both of which use certain conventions established in the original .

 Super Mario RPG contains token similarities to other Square @-@ developed video games , such as the Final Fantasy series , along with a story and gameplay based on the Super Mario Bros. series of platform games . Like most traditional JRPGs , there are two main sections to the game : adventuring and turn @-@ based battle sequences . Much of Super Mario RPG 's gameplay is outside monster battles and plays like an isometric 3D platformer , in which traditional Mario elements such as punching floating question blocks from below are prominent . There are no random encounters and as such enemies are visible in the field ; a battle ensues only if Mario comes in contact with one . This allows the player to evade unnecessary battles . 
 The player controls only Mario at the journey 's beginning . Ultimately , the player will gain a party of five characters , though only three members can be used during a battle at any given time . Mario is always in the player 's party , but the other two characters can be selected before battles . Each of the five characters has a unique set of attacks and techniques . For example , Princess Toadstool 's abilities are primarily healing techniques , whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage . The combat is based on a traditional turn based battle system with the addition of action commands that amplify a move 's effects . The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack , special move , defense , or item usage . This is one of the more innovative features of gameplay , becoming a mainstay of later Mario RPGs .

 The game world is set in a geographically diverse land , which includes mountains and bodies of water . Each region has distinct characteristics held by its inhabitants ; Mushroom Kingdom is inhabited by Toads , <unk> is inhabited by moles , Monstro Town is populated by reformed monsters , Yo <unk> Isle is where Yoshi and his eponymous species reside , and Nimbus Land is an area inhabited by cloud people . Bowser 's Castle is another prominent location in the game , as it holds the portal to the main antagonist 's home world . 
 As in most Mario series games , the main protagonist is Mario , whose initial goal is to rescue Princess Peach ( Toadstool ) from Bowser . However , the story takes on an unusual and very important twist . Soon after the start of his journey , the Smithy Gang invades the world . While attempting to stop the group , Mario is joined by Mallow , a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole ; Geno , a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road ; Bowser , whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang ; and Princess Toadstool , who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived . The Smithy Gang is led by Smithy , a robotic blacksmith from an alternate dimension with aspirations of world domination . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The game begins when Mario enters Bowser 's Castle to rescue Princess Toadstool . During the battle , a giant sword falls from the sky , breaks through the Star Road ( a pathway that helps grant people 's wishes ) , and crashes into Bowser ’ s castle , sending Mario , Princess Toadstool , and Bowser flying in different directions , as well as scattering seven star fragments . Mario makes his way to the Mushroom Kingdom , where the mushroom chancellor insists that Mario recover the Princess and discover the purpose of the giant sword , but once he returns to Bowser 's castle , the giant sword ( who reveals that it can talk ) destroys the bridge , preventing him from entering . Upon returning , Mario encounters Mallow , a " tadpole " who has lost a frog coin to Croco , a local thief . Mario agrees to help him , but when they return to the castle , he finds that the kingdom is overrun by creatures from the Smithy Gang led by an evil robotic blacksmith king named Smithy . He and Mallow enter the castle and are met by the first boss in the game , a giant knife and spring @-@ like creature named Mack . When Mack is defeated , they find a mysterious Star Piece , which Mario takes . 
 Mallow accompanies Mario as they travel through the Kero Sewers and after they defeat a monster named <unk> , they reach Tadpole Pond where they meet Mallow 's grandfather , who reveals that Mallow isn 't really a tadpole and claims that his real parents are waiting for him to return home . The duo travel to Rose Town where they meet a star spirit who has taken control of a doll named Geno . After battling the bow @-@ like creature , Bowyer , who is immobilizing residents of Rose Town with his arrows , they retrieve another Star Piece and Geno joins Mario and tells him that the Star Piece is a part of the shattered Star Road , where he resides . Geno has been tasked with repairing Star Road and defeating Smithy , so that the world 's wishes may again be heard , and he must find the seven pieces held by members of the Smithy gang . The three retrieve the third Star Piece from Punchinello , and continue to Booster Tower where they encounter Bowser , who is trying to reassemble his forces . Though former enemies , they join forces to fight a common enemy as Bowser wishes to reclaim his castle . The new team intercepts the princess , just before she is forcibly married to the eccentric amusement @-@ venue owner , Booster , but it turns out that the wedding wasn 't real and that Booster only wanted the wedding cake . After her rescue , the princess initially returns to Mushroom Kingdom but later joins the party as its final member . After recovering six of the Star Pieces , Mario 's group learns that the final piece is held by Smithy in Bowser 's castle . Upon battling their way through the assembled enemies and returning to the giant sword , they discover that it is actually a gateway to Smithy 's factory and they fight it to gain access to the factory , where Smithy mass @-@ produces his army . In the end , Smithy is defeated , the giant sword disappears , and the collected Star Pieces are used to repair the Star Road .

 Yoshio Hongo of Nintendo explained the game 's origins : " Square 's RPGs sold well in Japan but not overseas . There have been calls from all ages , and from young girls , for another character to which they could become attached . Mario was the best , but had not been in an RPG . Nintendo 's director , Mr. Miyamoto also wanted to do an RPG using Mario . There happened to be a chance for both companies to talk , which went well . " 
 The game was officially unveiled by both Mario creator and producer Shigeru Miyamoto and co @-@ director Chihiro Fujioka at the 1995 V @-@ Jump Festival event in Japan . Miyamoto led teams at Nintendo and Square , who spent over a year developing the graphics . The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the Super Mario Bros. series . Square reported that the game was about 70 % complete in October 1995 . The developers created the interior elements such as columns , stairways , and exterior elements with advanced computer modeling techniques . Special lighting effects were used to create shadows and reflections that were meant to improve the 3D elements . With guidance from Miyamoto , Square developed the game , combining role @-@ playing aspects of previous Square games like Final Fantasy VI with the platforming elements of Nintendo 's games . Square 's Final Fantasy series was the model for the battle sequences , while the tradition of Super Mario Bros. games demanded a lot of action . Mario 's ability to jog in eight directions and jump up or down in three – quarter perspective gave him a ( comparatively ) large range of motion . At 70 % completion , the mix of adventure and action game play elements placed it in a category closer to The Legend of Zelda : A Link to the Past . 
 When Nintendo of America received a 60 % complete version in November , the staff were surprised at the inclusion of an RPG battle system . The battle screens , using pre @-@ rendered sprites as in the rest of the game , included attack animations of equipped weapons . In December , further development and improvements to the gameplay delayed the translation of the game . For example , the Chancellor , who was named the Mushroom <unk> in Japan , was called the " Minister " in North America . Plans continued through February for the North American version , changing the release date forecast from winter to spring . 
 Super Mario RPG : Legend of the Seven Stars is one of only seven SNES games released outside Japan to use the Nintendo SA @-@ 1 chip . Compared with standard SNES games , the additional microprocessor allows higher clock speeds ; faster access to the random @-@ access memory ( RAM ) ; greater memory mapping capabilities , data storage , and compression ; new direct memory access ( DMA ) modes , such as bitmap to bit plane transfer ; and built @-@ in CIC lockout for piracy protection and regional marketing control . When asked about the possibility of a European release , Nintendo representatives said there were no plans for one , and remarked that preparing an RPG for release in Europe is far more difficult than other regions due to the need to optimize the game for PAL TV systems and translate it into multiple languages .

 Yoko Shimomura , best known for her previous work in Street Fighter II , composed the game 's music . As part of the score , she incorporated arrangements of music by Koji Kondo from Super Mario Bros. and three tracks by Nobuo Uematsu from Final Fantasy IV . Shimomura regards the Super Mario RPG soundtrack as one of the turning points in her career as a composer . The music from the game was released as a soundtrack album , titled Super Mario RPG Original Sound Version ( <unk> オリジナル ・ サウンド ・ <unk> , Sūpā Mario Āru Pī Jī Orijinaru <unk> <unk> ) .

 Though various aspects of Super Mario RPG have received mixed reviews , the game garnered praise for the quality of the graphics and for the humor in particular . Nintendo Power 's review commented that the " excellent " 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs . In March 1997 , Nintendo Power nominated the game for several awards , including " Best Graphics " , in a player 's choice contest , though Super Mario 64 won " Best Graphics " . Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the graphics , stating that they are " the best seen on the Super NES " . 1UP.com stated that the graphic element is " strong enough to resemble a Mario title but still retains the role @-@ playing theme at the same time " , and Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the graphics are " typical of Nintendo , using clean and colorful graphics along with nice animation " . RPGamer editor Derek Cavin called the backgrounds " beautiful " and stated that they " perfectly bring the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas into 3D " . Skyler Miller from Allgame stated that the graphics are " absolutely outstanding , with colorful , 3D rendered visuals that once seemed impossible on the Super NES . This is definitely the high watermark for 3D graphics on any 16 @-@ bit system " . The editor also called the music " quite extraordinary " and that the songs " match the mood of the surrounding environment " . In the Virtual Console re @-@ release , IGN 's Lucas Thomas 's review of Super Mario RPG stated that the game 's experience " completes itself with a compelling story , a humorous attitude and a variety of interspersed mini @-@ games that break up the adventuring action " . The publication also stated that the soundtrack is " spectacular and a joy to listen to " and the graphics " took full advantage of the system 's 16 @-@ bit technology and looks great " . 
 Despite the praise , Cavin noted that most of the battle system mechanics " aren 't very original " and also noting the " lack of a unified storyline " which is " far from great " . Miller commented that after engaging in many battles , " the battle music becomes monotonous " and that after the game is beaten , " There aren 't any surprises to be discovered the second time around " . While 1UP.com stated that " The characters seem too childish for older gamers " .

 Super Mario RPG does not have a direct sequel . Nintendo originally announced a game entitled Super Mario RPG 2 , but was changed to " Paper Mario " before release . Considered to be its thematic and spiritual sequels , two successive RPG @-@ themed Mario series , Paper Mario as well as Mario & Luigi , followed conventions established in the original . This includes the use of Flower Points as a shared party resource instead of each character having their own pool of Magic Points , timed action commands during battles , and , in the original Paper Mario , the collection of the seven stars .

 = 1929 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1929 Atlantic hurricane season was among the least active hurricane seasons in the Atlantic on record – featuring only five tropical cyclones . Of these five tropical systems , three of them intensified into a hurricane , with one strengthening further into a major hurricane ( Category 3 or higher on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ) . The first tropical cyclone of the season developed in the Gulf of Mexico on June 27 . Becoming a hurricane on June 28 , the storm struck Texas , bringing strong winds to a large area . Three fatalities were reported , while damage was conservatively estimated at $ 675 @,@ 000 ( 1929 USD ) . 
 The second storm , nicknamed the Bahamas hurricane , developed north of the Lesser Antilles . It was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season , peaking as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) . The storm moved through the Bahamas at this intensity and later struck Florida while slightly weaker . Overall , this hurricane resulted in 59 deaths and at least $ 2 @.@ 36 million in damage . The next three tropical cyclones did not impact land , with the last transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 22 . Until HURDAT reanalysis in 2010 , the final two systems were considered the same tropical cyclone . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 48 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength .

 After barometric pressures in the western Gulf of Mexico had been low for several days , the steamship Chester O. Swain encountered a disturbance of " probably moderate intensity " offshore Texas on June 28 . A tropical storm developed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on the previous day . The storm was abnormally small , having a diameter of only about 20 mi ( 32 km ) . It moderately intensified and by early on June 28 , the storm became a hurricane . While offshore Texas , the hurricane peaked with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . Shortly after making landfall near Matagorda Bay , a minimum barometric pressure of 982 mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) was reported . The storm then accelerated westward across the Southwestern United States and weakened to a tropical storm early on June 29 . However , it was still of " considerable intensity " while passing near El Paso about 24 hours later . Thus , the system was thought to have remained a tropical storm until early on June 30 . Several hours later , the storm dissipated over Arizona . 
 The storm brought hurricane @-@ force winds to portions of Texas , including as far inland as Yorktown in DeWitt County . Additionally , a 60 to 80 mi ( 95 to 130 km ) path observed gale force winds as far from the coast as Bexar , Kendall , Kerr , and Medina counties . Wind impacts were significant , with a " conservative " estimate of $ 310 @,@ 000 in damage inflicted on crops , while buildings , windmills , power , telephone , and telegraph lines suffered about $ 365 @,@ 000 in damage . There were three deaths in Wharton County , as well as several injuries . Outside of the area of wind damage , rainfall was considered " highly beneficial " to crops and range .

 The second storm of the season originated from a tropical wave that developed in the vicinity of Cape Verde on September 11 . The wave became a tropical depression at 00 : 00 UTC on September 19 , while located about 300 mi ( 480 km ) north @-@ northeast of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands . The depression drifted just north of due west while strengthening slowly , becoming a tropical storm early on September 22 . Later that day , the storm curved northwestward . Around midday on September 23 , it intensified into a hurricane . While turning southwestward on the following day , the hurricane began to undergo rapid deepening . Late on September 25 , the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) , an estimate based on pressure @-@ wind relationship , with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) . 
 While crossing through the Bahamas , the storm struck Eleuthera and Andros , on September 25 and September 26 , respectively . Late on September 27 , the system weakened to a Category 3 hurricane and re @-@ curved northwestward . At 13 : 00 UTC the next day , the hurricane made landfall near Tavernier , Florida . The storm then entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued weakening , falling to Category 2 intensity late on September 28 . While approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States , the hurricane weakened to a Category 1 hurricane . Early on October 1 , it made landfall near Panama City Beach , Florida . A few hours later , the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and then became extratropical over southwestern Georgia shortly thereafter . The remnants continued northeastward up the East Coast of the United States , until entering Canada and dissipating over Quebec early on October 5 . 
 In the Bahamas , the hurricane brought strong winds and large waves to the archipelago . At Nassau , a weather station observed a wind gust of 164 mph ( 264 km / h ) . Within the city alone , 456 houses were destroyed , while an additional 640 houses suffered damage . On Abaco Islands , 19 homes were demolished . The hurricane damaged or destroyed 63 homes and buildings on Andros . Telegraph service was disrupted . There were 48 deaths in the Bahamas . Throughout the Bahamas and the Florida Keys , numerous boats and vessels were ruined or damaged . At the latter , strong winds were observed , with a gust up to 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) in Key Largo . However , damage there was limited to swamped fishing boats and temporary loss of electricity and communications . Farther north , heavy rains flooded low @-@ lying areas of Miami . A devastating tornado in Fort Lauderdale damaged a four story hotel , a railway office building , and several cottages . In the Florida Panhandle , storm surge destroyed several wharves and damaged most of the oyster and fishing warehouses and canning plants . Overall , there was approximately $ 2 @.@ 36 million in damage and three deaths in Florida ; eight others drowned offshore .

 Historical weather maps indicate that a low pressure area was embedded within a west to east oriented stationary front over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean on September 24 . The low quickly detached from the stationary front and acquired a closed circulation while tracking across sea surface temperatures of 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) . Early on September 25 , a tropical depression formed just west of Bermuda and strengthened into a tropical storm later that day . Around 02 : 00 UTC on September 26 , a ship observed a barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 002 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) – the lowest while the storm was tropical . Four hours later , sustained winds peaked at 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) .

 = Wellingborough = 
 Wellingborough is a market town and borough in Northamptonshire , England , situated 11 miles ( 18 km ) from the county town of Northampton . The town is situated on the north side of the River Nene , most of the older town is sited on the flanks of the hills above the river 's current flood plain . Due to frequent flooding by the River Nene , the town was mostly built above the current level of the flood plain . Originally named " <unk> " , the settlement was established in the Saxon period and is mentioned in the Domesday Book under the name of " <unk> " . The town was granted a royal market charter in 1201 , by King John of England . 
 As of 2011 the census states the borough has a population of 75 @,@ 400 , which the town itself accounts for 49 @,@ 087 . The town of Wellingborough is governed by The Borough Council of Wellingborough , with their office located in the town centre . The town is twinned with Niort in France , and with <unk> in Germany . 
 The town is predicted to grow by around 30 percent under the Milton Keynes South Midlands ( <unk> ) study , as the British government has identified Wellingborough as one of several towns in Northamptonshire where growth will be directed over the next 30 years . The study allocates 12 @,@ 800 additional homes mainly to the east of the town . The town has also a growing commuter population as it is located on the Midland Main Line railway , operated by East Midlands Trains , which has InterCity trains to London St Pancras International station taking under an hour , giving an interchange with Eurostar services . 
 = = History = = 
 The town was established in the Anglo @-@ Saxon period and was called ' <unk> ' . It is surrounded by five wells : Red Well , Hemming Well , <unk> 's Well , Lady 's Well and Whyte Well , which appear on its coat of arms . 
 The medieval town of Wellingborough housed a modest monastic grange – now the Jacobean Croyland ' Abbey ' – which was an offshoot of the larger monastery of Croyland Abbey , near Peterborough , some 30 miles ( 48 km ) down @-@ river . This part of the town is now known as ' Croyland ' . 
 All Hallows Church is the oldest existing building in Wellingborough and dates from c . 1160 . The manor of Wellingborough belonged to Crowland Abbey Lincolnshire , from Saxon times and the monks probably built the original church . The earliest part of the building is the Norman doorway opening in from the later south porch . The church was enlarged with the addition of more side chapels and by the end of the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan . The west tower , crowned with a graceful broach spire rising to 160 feet ( 49 m ) , was completed about 1270 , after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later . The church was restored in 1861 by Edmund Francis Law . The 20th @-@ century Church of St Mary was built by Ninian Comper . 
 Wellingborough was given a Market Charter dated 3 April 1201 when King John granted it to the " Abbot of Croyland and the monks serving God there " continuing , " they shall have a market at <unk> ( Wellingborough ) for one day each week that is Wednesday " . 
 In the Elizabethan era the Lord of the Manor , Sir Christopher Hatton was a sponsor of Sir Francis Drake 's expeditions ; Drake renamed one of his ships the Golden Hind after the heraldic symbol of the Hatton family . A hotel in a Grade II listed building built in the 17th century , was known variously as the Hind Hotel and later as the Golden Hind Hotel . 
 During the Civil War the largest substantial conflict in the area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645 , although a minor skirmish in the town resulted in the killing of a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer . Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest , Thomas Jones , and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads . However , after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers . Little is known about this period . 
 Wellingborough was bombed once during World War II . The bomb fell where the town centre McDonald 's restaurant used to be located . The town was also used for evacuated children from London . 
 Originally the town had two railway stations : the first called Wellingborough London Road , opened in 1845 and closed in 1966 , linked Peterborough with Northampton . The second station , Wellingborough Midland Road , is still in operation with trains to London and the East Midlands . Since then the ' Midland Road ' was dropped from the station name . The Midland Road station opened in 1857 with trains serving Kettering and a little later Corby , was linked in 1867 to London St Pancras . In 1898 in the Wellingborough rail accident six or seven people died and around 65 were injured . In the 1880s two businessmen held a public meeting to build three tram lines in Wellingborough , the group merged with a similar company in Newport Pagnell who started to lay tram tracks , but within two years the plans were abandoned due to lack of funds .

 = = Geography = =

 The town is sited on the hills adjoining the flood plain of the River Nene . In the predominantly agrarian medieval period , this combination of access to fertile , if flood @-@ prone , valley bottom soils and drier ( but heavier and more clay @-@ rich ) hillside / hilltop soils seems to have been good for a mixed agricultural base . The clay @-@ rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with boulder clay or glacial till during the recent glaciations . On the valley sides and valley floor however , these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period , and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down , which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century . 
 = = = Iron ore = = = 
 The most economically important aspect of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation . This is a marine sand of Jurassic age ( <unk> stage ) , deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and <unk> . Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt % iron . To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time , but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer steel making process and the " basic slag " smelting chemistry , which combine to make high quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores . The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run @-@ up to World War II , being the best developed bulk iron producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials . However , because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east @-@ south @-@ east , they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county .

 Wellingborough 's population expanded rapidly from 26 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 in the 1960s and 1970s as agreements were signed between the Urban District Council and London County Council and the Greater London Council for the town to re @-@ house over @-@ spill population from London . Following the post World War II arrival of immigrants from the Commonwealth group of nations into Britain , a sizeable Black Caribbean and Indian / Pakistani community grew up in this small market town , and now represents 7 % of the population in the Borough and to 11 % within the town . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Wellingborough has approximately 2 @,@ 500 registered businesses within its boundaries . Much of the town centre was redeveloped during the 1970s , when it grew rapidly from London overspill . The Borough Council has adopted a ' Town Centre Action Plan ' . The former traditional economic structure based on footwear and engineering is gradually diversifying with wholesale , logistics , and service sectors providing new opportunities for employment . 
 As a market town , Wellingborough has major high street chains mainly located in the town centre . The only shopping centre , <unk> , previously known as the Arndale Centre , was built in the 1970s . Since 2009 the Borough Council has been looking at rebuilding the centre and major stores want bigger floor @-@ spaces . The Britannica Fund , which owns <unk> shopping centre is currently in administration , and decision on the future of the centre is expected in early 2013 . Supplementing the town centre shops are several out @-@ of @-@ town retail parks and supermarkets including a Sainsbury 's , four Tesco stores , an Aldi store and a Morrisons store in the town centre . The town has a market three times a week and a weekly privately organised market . 
 Other businesses operating within the town include motorsport , high performance engineering , distribution , engineering , environmental technology and renewable energy , digital and creative media , financial and business services , and global brands , once such brand being Cummins UK at Park Farm , and major park home manufacturer <unk> Homes Ltd at Finedon Road Industrial Estate .

 Future developments 
 As part of its Milton Keynes South Midlands ( <unk> ) study , the government has identified Wellingborough as one of several towns in Northamptonshire into which growth will be directed over the next thirty years . It allocates 12 @,@ 800 additional homes to Wellingborough , and will also create additional facilities , further improve the town centre , improve infrastructure and increase employment opportunities . A jobs growth target of 12 @,@ 400 jobs has been set to accompany the large scale housing growth . A plan for 3 @,@ 000 homes north of the town has been accepted by the British Government after an appeal by Bee Bee Developments . The plan was first refused by Wellingborough Borough Council . 
 As a result , plans have been made for a major urban extension in the town , mainly to the east of the railway station . When finished , the town would be around 30 % larger and 3 @,@ 200 new homes would be built on ' Stanton Cross ' site , with new schools , bus stops , community centres , shops , a doctor 's surgery and new open spaces . The railway station would be developed into an ' interchange ' with local buses and trains . The upgrade would provide a new platform , footbridge and new station buildings . Outside the station a new road bridge from Midland Road over the railway line is also planned with a new footbridge to reach the new development . Other plans to include the development of the High Street , Shelley Road and the north of the town areas are also being considered .

Within the genus Persoonia , it is a member of the Lanceolata group of 58 closely related species . P. levis interbreeds with several other species where they grow together . 
 Found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone @-@ based nutrient @-@ deficient soils , P. levis is adapted to a fire @-@ prone environment ; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires , and can live for over 60 years . Regeneration also takes place after fire by a ground @-@ stored seed bank . The longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons is a pollinator of the flowers , and the fruit are consumed by vertebrates such as kangaroos , possums and currawongs . Despite its horticultural appeal , P. levis is rare in cultivation as it is very hard to propagate , either by seed or cuttings .

The large green leaves measure 6 to 14 cm ( 2 @.@ 2 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) in length , and 1 @.@ 3 to 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 2 in ) in width , and are oblong or sickle @-@ shaped ( falcate ) . The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P. lanceolata . The bright green foliage , particularly of new growth , stands out against the more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems , which are reddish in colour . The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn ( December to April ) , and peak over December to February . They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets . Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth , consisting of tepals fused for most of their length , within which are both male and female parts . The central style is surrounded by the anther , which splits into four segments ; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above . They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma , which is located at the tip of the style . The smooth fleshy fruit , known as a drupe , is green and more or less round , measuring 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) by 0 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) in diameter . It contains two seeds , and has a spike at the end . The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe , and the seeds and skin are inedible . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 Persoonia levis was described and given the name Linkia levis by Antonio José Cavanilles in 1798 . His description was based on plant material collected by Luis Née in the vicinity of Port Jackson ( Sydney ) in April 1793 during the <unk> Expedition . The species was placed in the genus Persoonia by Karel Domin in 1921 . The genus names Linkia and Persoonia had been coined in 1798 , but the latter was officially conserved . The species name is the Latin adjective levis , meaning " smooth " , and refers to the hairless foliage . Christiaan Hendrik Persoon coined the name Persoonia salicina for it in his 1805 work Synopsis Plantarum , and queried whether Cavanilles ' Linkia levis was in fact P. lanceolata . Robert Brown used Persoon 's name in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen , and echoed Persoon 's thoughts on Cavanilles ' original name and specimen . In the 1995 Flora of Australia revision of the genus , Peter John Weston reviewed the mounted material of Linkia levis , and found that Cavanilles had mounted material from both P. levis and P. lanceolata . He set one specimen of the three , which was clearly P. levis , as the lectotype , which aligned the material with the description . Common names include broad @-@ leaved geebung , willow geebung and smooth geebung . The term geebung is derived from the Dharug language word geebung . 
 Like most other members of the genus , Persoonia levis has seven chromosomes that are large compared to those of other Proteaceae . In 1870 , George Bentham published the first infrageneric arrangement of Persoonia in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis . He divided the genus into three sections , placing P. levis ( which he called P. salicina ) in P. sect . Amblyanthera . The 1995 Flora of Australia revision of the genus saw it classified in the Lanceolata group , a group of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage . These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur , and hybrids with P. <unk> , P. lanceolata , P. linearis , P. mollis subsp. <unk> , P. myrtilloides subsp. myrtilloides ( in the Upper Blue Mountains , these plants resemble P. lanceolata ) , P. oxycoccoides , and P. <unk> have been recorded . Robert Brown initially described the hybrid with P. linearis as a species " Persoonia lucida " , which is now known as Persoonia × lucida , and has been recorded from the southeast forests of the New South Wales south coast . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Persoonia levis is found from the Macleay River catchment on the New South Wales mid north coast to the Cann River in far eastern Victoria . It is found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone @-@ based nutrient @-@ deficient soils , from sea level to an altitude of 1000 m ( 3500 ft ) . There it grows in sunny or lightly shaded areas in open woodland , associated with such trees as Eucalyptus piperita , E. sieberi , E. sclerophylla , E. radiata , E. smithii , Angophora costata and Corymbia gummifera , and shrubs such as Conospermum longifolium , Grevillea buxifolia , G. phylicoides , Hakea <unk> , <unk> montanum and Telopea speciosissima , as well as Persoonia hirsuta and P. mollis . Coastal forms are smaller with broader leaves than inland forms . The annual rainfall of the area it occurs in the Sydney Basin is 900 – 1 @,@ 400 mm ( 35 – 55 in ) . It is considered adequately protected in the Sydney region , and is found in Georges River , <unk> , Wollemi , <unk> , Brisbane Water , <unk> , Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase , <unk> , Lane Cove , Sydney Harbour , Botany Bay and <unk> National Parks . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Persoonia levis is one of several species of Persoonia that regenerate by resprouting from the trunk after bushfire , an adaptation to the fire @-@ prone habitat in which it grows . Its thick papery bark shields the underlying epicormic buds from the flames . Plants also regenerate by seedlings that arise from a seedbank in the soil after fire , although they may take up to 12 months to germinate . One study of sclerophyll forest unburnt for thirty years showed P. levis had declined over time . P. levis plants can live for over 60 years , and their leaves have a lifespan of up to 6 years . 
 Vesicles indicating a mycorrhizal association have been found on the roots of Persoonia levis , the Proteaceae not previously noted for forming mycorrhizal associations . Infection by the fungal species <unk> persooniae results in leaf spot disease . P. levis is the food plant of the larvae of the weevil species <unk> <unk> . 
 Colletid bees of the genus Leioproctus subgenus Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia . Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers do not appear to be effective pollinators . Particular species recorded on P. levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons . Weighing 1700 mg ( 0 @.@ 60 oz ) , the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates , such as kangaroos and possums , as well as currawongs and other large birds . The flowers of P. levis are self @-@ incompatible — that is , they are unable to fertilise themselves and require outcrossing to another plant . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Persoonia levis is rarely seen in cultivation , mainly because of difficulties in propagation ; seed germination is unpredictable , and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike . Nevertheless , its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features . Well @-@ drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation . Once established , it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily , albeit slowly , in suitable conditions . Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795 . 
 = Forth Road Bridge = 
 The Forth Road Bridge is a suspension bridge in east central Scotland . The bridge , opened in 1964 , spans the Firth of Forth , connecting Edinburgh , at Queensferry , to Fife , at North Queensferry . It replaced a centuries @-@ old ferry service to carry vehicular traffic , cyclists , and pedestrians across the Forth ; rail crossings are made by the adjacent and historic Forth Bridge . 
 Issues regarding the continued tolling of the bridge , and those over its deteriorating condition and proposals to have it replaced or supplemented by an additional crossing , caused it to become something of a political football for the Scottish Parliament , which voted to scrap tolls on the bridge from 11 February 2008 . 
 On 4 December 2015 , the bridge was closed to all vehicular traffic , pedestrians and cyclists due to structural issues . The bridge reopened to all traffic except heavy goods vehicles ( HGVs ) on 23 December 2015 , and it was reopened to HGVs on 20 February 2016 . 
 = = History = = 
 The first crossing at what is now the site of the bridge was established in the 11th century by Margaret , queen consort of King Malcolm III , who founded a ferry service to transport religious pilgrims from Edinburgh to Dunfermline Abbey and St Andrews . Its creation gave rise to the port towns of Queensferry and North Queensferry , which remain to this day ; and the service remained in uninterrupted use as a passenger ferry for over eight hundred years . As early as the 1740s there were proposals for a road crossing at the site , although their viability was only considered following the construction of the Forth Bridge in 1890 . 
 The importance of the crossing to vehicular traffic was underpinned when the Great Britain road numbering scheme was drawn up in the 1920s . The planners wished the arterial A9 road to be routed across the Forth here , although the unwillingness to have a ferry crossing as part of this route led to the A90 number being assigned instead . 
 There was a period of renewed lobbying for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s , at which time the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry . Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s , providing and operating on behalf of the London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge . Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s , by which time the ferries were making 40 @,@ 000 crossings annually , carrying 1 @.@ 5 million passengers and 800 @,@ 000 vehicles . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 With the then newest and nearest bridge spanning the Forth ( the Kincardine Bridge , built in 1936 ) still around 15 miles ( 24 km ) upstream , the upsurge in demand for a road crossing between Edinburgh and Fife prompted the UK Government to establish the Forth Road Bridge Joint Board ( <unk> ) by Act of Parliament in 1947 to oversee the implementation of a new bridge to replace the ferry service . In 1955 the authorities on either side investigated and drew up an alternative scheme for a tunnel beneath the estuary . This was known as the Maunsell Scheme , and was projected to run somewhat closer to the rail bridge than the present road bridge . The scheme was abandoned as being too ambitious and reverted to a bridge concept . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The final construction plan was accepted in February 1958 and work began in September of that year . Mott , Hay and Anderson and Freeman Fox and Partners carried out the design work and a joint venture of Sir William Arrol & Co . , Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company and Dorman Long constructed the bridge at a cost of £ 11 @.@ 5 million , while the total cost of the project including road connections and realignments was £ 19 @.@ 5 million . 
 It was the longest steel suspension bridge in Europe . 210 @,@ 000 tons of concrete were involved in its construction , with nine miles of grade @-@ separated dual @-@ carriageway approach roads . Reed and <unk> ( known for Reema construction of houses ) of Salisbury , Wiltshire , built the approach viaducts . 
 There were twenty four individual bridges built for the approach roads . The 4 @.@ 5 @-@ mile southern approach road of the A90 began at Cramond Bridge , over the River Almond on the western outskirts of Edinburgh , near Craigiehall . There were two @-@ level interchanges built at <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) and the <unk> junction ( <unk> and <unk> ) . At Dalmeny there was a bridge over the railway . The southern approach roads were built by A.M. Carmichael Ltd . The 4 @-@ mile northern approach road had three two @-@ level junctions at Ferry Toll ( for the <unk> ) , Admiralty ( for Rosyth Dockyard via the <unk> , and Inverkeithing via the A921 ) and at <unk> / Masterton ( for what would be the fledgling M90 southern terminus ) . The Masterton junction was an octopus junction , a variation of a clover @-@ leaf junction , having six bridges and a 600 ft viaduct . There were fifteen bridges built for this approach road . The northern approach road terminated as the <unk> ( M ) at a roundabout with the <unk> south of Dunfermline , next to Rosyth railway station . The northern approach roads were built by <unk> Ltd of Glasgow , later bought by Alfred McAlpine . 
 Seven lives were lost during construction before the bridge was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh on 4 September 1964 . The ferry service was discontinued as of that date . 
 = = = Operation = = = 
 The bridge 's management was delegated to the <unk> , and remained so until 2002 when its operation was transferred to a new body with a wider remit , the Forth Estuary Transport Authority . 
 On 1 December 2010 the bridge was closed for the first time due to heavy snow . After several accidents meant snowploughs were unable to clear the carriageways , the bridge was closed in both directions at 6 @.@ 40 a.m. and remained closed for several hours . As part of celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge 's operation , artist Kate Downie was commissioned to create a print of the bridge and hold an exhibition of works portraying it . 
 On 1 June 2015 Amey took over the maintenance and operating of the bridge on behalf of Transport Scotland from the Forth Estuary Transport Authority and are now called the Forth Bridges Unit . 
 = = Statistics = = 
 The bridge 's central main span is 1 @,@ 006 metres ( 3 @,@ 301 ft ) long , its two side spans are each 408 metres ( 1 @,@ 339 ft ) long , and the approach viaducts are 252 metres ( 827 ft ) on the north side and 438 metres ( 1 @,@ 437 ft ) on the south side . At a total length of 2 @,@ 512 metres ( 8 @,@ 241 ft ) , it was the longest suspension bridge span outside the United States and the fourth @-@ longest span in the world at the time of its construction . The bridge comprises 39 @,@ 000 tonnes of steel and 115 @,@ 000 cubic metres of concrete . The towers reach 156 metres ( 512 ft ) above mean water level . Its width comprises a dual carriageway road with two lanes in each direction bounded by cycle / footpaths on each side . The main strung cables are 590 millimetres ( 23 in ) in diameter , comprising 11 @,@ 618 high tensile wires , each five millimetres in diameter , and each cable carries 13 @,@ 800 tonnes of the bridge 's load . 
 The bridge forms a crucial part of the corridor between south @-@ east and north @-@ east Scotland , linking Edinburgh to Perth , Dundee and Aberdeen by the A90 road and its sister M90 motorway , which begins 1 @.@ 67 miles ( 2 @.@ 69 km ) north of the bridge 's northern terminus . The bridge carried around 2 @.@ 5 million vehicles in its first year but the annual figure has risen steadily over time to around 21 @.@ 4 million vehicles in 2008 . The bridge carried its 250 millionth vehicle in 2002 . 
 It was awarded Historic Scotland 's Category A listed structure status in 2001 . 
 = = Structural issues = = 
 There has been concern at FETA over the structural wear of the bridge . The planned theoretical capacity for the bridge ( 30 @,@ 000 vehicles per day in each direction ) is routinely exceeded as traffic levels have outstripped predictions . The Scottish Government stated in 2006 that 60 @,@ 000 vehicles travel on more than half the days in a year . This raised concerns about the lifespan of the bridge , originally planned at 120 years . 
 2003 saw an inspection programme launched ( at a cost of £ 1 @.@ 2 million ) to assess the condition of the main suspension cables after corrosion was discovered in a number of older bridges in the United States of a similar design and size . The study , which was completed in 2005 , found that the main cables had suffered an 8 – 10 % loss of strength . Future projections highlighted the likelihood of an accelerating loss of strength , with traffic restrictions to limit loading required in 2014 in the worst @-@ case scenario , followed by full closure by 2020 . 
 Further monitoring and remedial work is now under way . An acoustic monitoring system , commissioned in August 2006 , uses listening devices to monitor any further strands snapping and pinpoint their location within the main cables . 
 Given the significance of the findings of the first internal inspection , in November 2005 the Scottish Executive appointed Flint & Neill Partnership to audit the results . Flint & Neill appointed New York – based Ammann & Whitney to act as sub @-@ consultants providing specialist advice using experience gained from inspections and assessments carried out in America . In January 2006 , an audit report to the Scottish Executive concluded that FETA 's consultant had performed the initial internal inspection and cable strength calculation in accordance with accepted practice . The audit report suggested that traffic restrictions could be required as early as 2013 . 
 Several options are being implemented to increase the bridge 's lifespan . These include an extensive dehumidification programme to slow the rate of corrosion in the main cables by installing a system that will keep the air in the voids between the strands that make up the main cables at a humidity level of below 40 % . Engineering consultants Faber Maunsell began work on the project in 2006 . The works are planned to take two and a half years at a cost of £ 7 @.@ 8 million . As part of the works , some of the corroded cable strands are to be spliced . 
 The southbound carriageway of the bridge was closed on 1 December 2015 due to the discovery of steelwork defects during routine inspections . Subsequently a 7 @.@ 5 tonne weight limit was put in place ( public service buses were not included ) . On 4 December , the bridge was fully closed because of structural faults and was initially not expected to reopen until the new year following further inspections and repair work . Following the closure , Transport Scotland began work to lay on extra trains and buses and consider whether to reintroduce a ferry service to mitigate the impact on travellers . The closure resulted in tailbacks approaching the Kincardine Bridge , the alternative route across the Forth from Fife to Edinburgh . On 22 December it was announced that the Road Bridge would reopen the following day for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles ( HGVs ) , with an expectation that the bridge will reopen to HGVs around mid @-@ February . 
 On 4 February , It was announced the date had been pushed back to March for full restrictions to be taken off , due to further problems with the truss end link pins in the southern towers , which require preventative works to be carried out . Trials began to allow 600 HGVs to cross northbound between 23 : 00 and 04 : 00 each night , subject to weather conditions . The HGVs are controlled by traffic signals and released onto the bridge at a rate of one every 30 seconds . 
 = = = 2016 public inquiry = = = 
 On 20 January Scottish Parliament began its inquiry led by the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee ( ICI ) , to determine the circumstances that led to the discovery of a cracked truss in the bridge 's undercarriage . Evidence was heard from ; Forth Estuary Transport Authority ( Feta ) , Transport minister Derek Mackay , engineers and officials from Amey along with a number of other experts and key personnel . 
 On the first day , Richard Hornby , of engineering consulting firm Arup , stated , since 2001 , the truss end in question had been inspected 23 times and there was no fault found . It was revealed a pin had seized up , which was cause of the truss end to crack , and was only the quality of the steel which had stopped its cracking appearing earlier . Hornby also made clear even if the seized pin had been picked up earlier it was " virtually impossible " to lubricate the bearing . 
 Several witnesses defended a decision by previous operator Forth Estuary Transport Authority ( Feta ) not to proceed with a £ 15 million truss end link replacement project in 2010 . This claim was disputed by Barry Colford , former chief engineer and bridgemaster at the Forth Estuary Transport Authority . Lesley Hinds , Feta ’ s former convener , pointed out that the bridge budget had been cut by 58 % in 2011 , while senior staff at Feta had “ deep concerns ” about the transfer of bridge management to a private company . 
 = = Tolling issues = = 
 On 11 February 2008 tolls were abolished on the bridge . 
 Initially , it was suggested that tolling would cease once the original cost of construction plus the accrued interest was repaid – this was done in 1993 and it was planned that tolls would not be levied after May 1995 . However , the legislation enabling the levying of tolls was instead renewed by Parliament ( originally that of the UK but now the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament ) on three separate occasions in 1998 , 2003 and 2006 . 
 Originally , a toll was paid for each direction of travel with sets of toll booths on both carriageways . In 1997 , a decision was made to double the northbound toll ( then <unk> , to 80p ) and remove the southbound toll . The belief was that almost all traffic makes a return journey across the bridge , and that the removal of the southbound toll would result in a reduction of congestion for southbound traffic without reducing overall toll revenues . 
 The Forth Estuary Transport Authority ( FETA ) justified the continued use of tolls by suggesting they were necessary to fund maintenance and improvement works . These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers in the event of collision in the Firth . The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns ( the original tower structure was hollow ) and had hydraulic rams jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork . Also , the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a single detected failure . A new paint system required development for the bridge ( the original was phased out due to environmental concerns ) . 
 = = = Variable tolling proposals = = = 
 In late 2005 , FETA 's committee approved a proposal for a complete revamp of the system of toll levies . The minimum toll would be set to the existing £ 1 figure , but would increase dependent on the time of day , rising to a maximum of £ 4 for evening rush hour travel . All tolls would be halved for cars with more than one occupant , as an incentive to drivers to share cars and make fewer journeys . According to FETA 's chairman Lawrence Marshall , the system would provide the most efficiency , claiming that 80 % of peak @-@ time journeys are made by single @-@ occupant vehicles . The proposal , passed with the chairman 's casting vote after the committee was deadlocked , was referred to the Scottish Executive in December 2005 , and implementation planned for October 2007 subject to approval by transport minister Tavish Scott . Environmental groups welcomed the proposal , although local politicians condemned it as simply a means of raising capital . At the same time , a counter @-@ argument was tabled by Fife councillors proposing the complete removal of tolls . 
 The Scottish Parliament debated the proposals in January 2006 , and the affair became a major political issue after Westminster @-@ based MPs Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling ( Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Scotland respectively ) were seen to describe the variable tolling plan as " dead in the water " . Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell insisted his Labour Party colleagues were misquoted and himself refused to rule out the plan , receiving considerable condemnation from the opposition Scottish National Party . 
 The political situation was particularly important given that by late January 2006 , campaigning was under way for the Dunfermline and West Fife by @-@ election , 2006 scheduled to take place for the Westminster constituency in which the north end of the bridge is situated . The by @-@ election , scheduled for 9 February , was contested by - in addition to the major political parties in Scotland - an Abolish Forth Bridge Tolls Party . It was won by Liberal Democrat candidate Willie Rennie , overturning a large Labour majority on a 16 % swing . 
 In the aftermath of the by @-@ election defeat , media speculation suggested the Executive had turned against the proposals , and Tavish Scott eventually confirmed their rejection and the retention of the existing toll structure on 1 March 2006 . FETA condemned the decision , while local opposition MSPs charged the minister that his tolling review short @-@ changed <unk> as tolls were axed on the Erskine Bridge leaving tolls on only the Forth and Tay Road Bridge . 
 = = = Abolition = = = 
 Following the formation of an SNP minority government after the Scottish parliamentary election of May 2007 , a new debate on the abolition of tolls was opened by Transport Minister Stewart Stevenson on 31 May 2007 , where it was agreed by a large majority . Toll levies at that point totalled £ 16 million annually . 
 The Abolition of Bridge Tolls ( Scotland ) Bill , required to revoke legislation mandating toll collection on the bridge , was introduced to the Scottish Parliament on 3 September 2007 , passed on 20 December 2007 , and received royal assent on 24 January 2008 . The tolls were removed on 11 February 2008 at 00 : 01 GMT . This immediately followed a major upgrade and reconfiguration of the tolls on the northbound carriageway ( the toll on the southbound carriageway had been removed some years before , simplifying the arrangement as most journeys were , and remain , two @-@ way ) . 
 = = Additional crossing at Queensferry = = 
 The strategic transport importance of the road bridge and the threat of closure by 2020 if major structural work were not undertaken led to fears of serious economic consequences , especially as work on any new crossing could take a decade . 
 Increasing traffic levels across the Firth of Forth had also led to the construction of the Clackmannanshire Bridge adjacent to the existing Kincardine Bridge . This bridge opened in November 2008 . 
 Proposals for a second road crossing at Queensferry had been made in the 1990s , but were subsequently shelved , despite preliminary work on route selection . Following the discovery of potentially serious structural issues with the Forth Road Bridge in 2005 the proposals were revisited and plans advanced . The decision to proceed with a replacement bridge was taken at the end of 2007 , and it was announced the following year that the existing bridge would be retained , as a public transport link . The Forth Crossing Act received Royal Assent in January 2011 , and construction began in September 2011 . The Queensferry Crossing is being constructed as a cable @-@ stayed bridge , with an overall length of 1 @.@ 7 miles ( 2 @.@ 7 km ) . Around 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) of new connecting roads are being built , including new and upgraded junctions at <unk> in Fife , South Queensferry , and Junction 1a on the M9 . The new bridge will continue the M90 motorway , ( extending its southern terminus ) from Admiralty to the M9 junction 1a ( re @-@ numbering the M9 spur ) . 
 = Telenor Arena = 
 Telenor Arena , sometimes referred to as Fornebu Arena , is a multi @-@ purpose indoor arena located at Fornebu in Bærum , outside Oslo , Norway . It serves as a venue for a variety of events , including concerts , exhibitions , action shows , family shows , TV and sport . It has a capacity for 15 @,@ 000 spectators for sports and 23 @,@ 000 for concerts , including 40 luxury boxes and club seating for 1 @,@ 200 . The venue has a fixed roof and an asphalt floor . The venue was opened ahead of the 2009 Norwegian football season as a replacement for Nadderud Stadion . It cost 585 million Norwegian kroner ( NOK ) to build , of which NOK 300 million was for the sports venue . 
 During the 2000s , Nadderud was below standards for play in the top national league . Fornebu was at the time undergoing an urban redevelopment ; after several years of negotiations and public grants , Stabæk secured a lot in 2004 . Construction started in 2007 . In 2010 , a disagreement arose between the club and venue @-@ owner Kjell Chr . Ulrichsen , with the latter demanding that the team leave the venue to allow for more event revenue . Telenor Arena has hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 , as well as concerts by artists and bands of international fame , such as Adele , Muse , Foo Fighters , Roger Waters ( the Wall tour ) , Rihanna , Lady Gaga , Beyoncé , Jay @-@ Z , Kanye West , Metallica , AC / DC , Black Sabbath , The Rolling Stones . Telenor holds the naming rights .

 Stabæk traditionally has played their home games at Nadderud Stadion , a municipal multi @-@ purpose stadium at <unk> . Following the club 's rapid ascent from lower divisions to the top league during the first half of the 1990s , Nadderud became in need of upgrades , resulting in a new main grandstand opening in 1996 . The stadium remained severely lacking adequate facilities for professional football , and fell short of increasing requirements from the Football Association of Norway ( NFF ) . 
 Originally , a redevelopment of Nadderud was proposed , but in 1999 Stabæk players launched the idea of building a new stadium at Fornebu , which became subject to an urban redevelopment project after the 1998 closing of Oslo Airport , Fornebu . The initial proposal was named Blue Dream Arena , would have seating for 25 @,@ 000 spectators , blue artificial turf and a retractable roof . Other proposed amenities were movable seating which would also allow the stadium to both host athletics and be configured as an intimate football stadium . The idea called for Bruce Springsteen to hold a concert before the first match , which would be played against Barcelona . Several of the initial concepts of the stadium were never materialized . International rules disallowed blue artificial turf ; instead , the flooring in the boxes were made in a blue , artificial turf @-@ inspired material . Also the idea of having a retractable roof was discarded , both because of technical difficulties and cost issues . 
 In May 2001 , Oslo City Council voted to sell their properties at Fornebu to Fornebu Boligspar ( FB ) , which again had agreements to sell a lot for the stadium to Stabæk . In November 2002 , Borgarting Court of Appeal concluded that <unk> had the right to continue leasing a hangar — located at the planned location of the venue — until 2014 . In June 2003 , Stabæk was in financial difficulties , and investor Kjell Chr . Ulrichsen bought shares for NOK 10 million to avoid bankruptcy ; these shares had the option to be converted to shares in the arena company . 
 Fornebu Boligspar later determined that it was more profitable to build apartments at the arena site . Negotiations started between the club , the property company and Mayor Odd Reinsfelt . In November 2003 , it was announced that a compromise was reached whereby Fornebu Boligspar would give the lot free to Stabæk , in exchange for a lot nearby . Two weeks later the compromise was rejected by FB . A new compromise was announced on 29 June 2004 , whereby FB would give 50 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) and a lot free to Stabæk in exchange for the commercial properties which would be part of the stadium . However , the following day the parties announced that they were not able to agree on the risk , as Stabæk demanded that FB take the full risk in the project . 
 Instead , Stabæk started negotiating with IT Fornebu to take over a lot they owned . They needed a 300 hectares ( 740 acres ) lot which would have a market value of between NOK 60 and 80 million , and Reinsfelt stated that the municipality was willing to help by " maneuver in gray areas within the margins " . The club was further pressured by NFF , who were going to limit the exceptions allowed for Nadderud and other stadiums not meeting their criteria . On 29 October , FB and Stabæk signed an agreement whereby Stabæk received a free lot and NOK 50 million , in exchange for FB taking over the commercial properties . The condition was that the municipality allowed a more dense use of the rest of FB 's area . This would require a re @-@ regulation of the area , and Reinsfelt estimated that it would not be possible for construction to start until 2006 . In November , UEFA changed the rules for artificial turf to state that it had to be green . Until Stabæk 's proposal was made , UEFA had not though that anyone would build a pitch with a non @-@ green turf , and representatives stated that it was because of Stabæk the rule change was made . The plans were nearly terminated in October 2006 , after discussion about the planned Fornebu Line — a people mover which would connect Fornebu to Lysaker — stopped the regulation plan . However , in November the final permissions were granted by Bærum Municipality . On 22 December , Stabæk announced that the financing was secured . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Architects were <unk> and the main contractor was NCC Construction . While domed stadiums have been common in North America , no such stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe . Construction started by demolishing a hangar , which was completed in February 2007 . However , because of the building boom , concrete elements needed for construction to start meant that the rest of the construction was delayed . The cornerstone was laid on 5 September . 
 In June 2008 , Stabæk announced they had signed an eleven @-@ year sponsorship agreement with the telecommunications company Telenor , where the latter would pay up to NOK 115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena , in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes . In March 2009 , the retailing property was sold from Scandinavian Property Development to <unk> Eiendom . The plans called for twenty to twenty @-@ five football games , four to eight concerts , three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year . Because of larger seating capacity , an all @-@ seating arrangement , higher attendance and VIP facilities , Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud . The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays , with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds . The bus stops closest to the venue are closed , and a large number of police officers have to direct the traffic . These are costs which have to be carried by the arena company , and contrasts to matches at the nearly twice as large Ullevaal , where no such measures are necessary .

 In October 2009 , ten individuals bought the operation company of the club and signed a 40 @-@ year lease for the use of the arena for Stabæk 's home matches , as well as the right to use the facility for certain other activities . This contract has a revenue of NOK 9 million per year . In 2009 , Stabæk Holding had a deficit of NOK 66 @.@ 1 million , while Stabæk Fotball lost NOK 23 @.@ 6 million . To keep the operating company running , Ulrichsen increased the company 's share capital by NOK 73 million from late 2009 through late 2010 . 
 On 4 November 2010 , Stabæk Holding stated that they were near a bankruptcy , and that they intended to throw out Stabæk as a tenant , remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events . Chair <unk> <unk> in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable . The football schedule was not made until early in the year , while in the event business , bookings were common one to two years in advance . It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events , as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet @-@ to @-@ be scheduled matches . The holding company stated that they might have to file for bankruptcy . Stabæk Fotball stated that they had a 40 @-@ year contract to use the venue . 
 Stabæk 's director of sports , Inge André Olsen , stated that returning to Nadderud was not an option , as it had too little capacity and insufficient facilities . Should Nadderud be used , it would have to be rebuilt , with new grandstands under roofs , VIP seating , a new parking house and new change room , which would cost NOK 100 million . Because of building permits , construction would take two to three years . Nadderud is also not approved to host games in the Premier League , so Stabæk would have to either play their games at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo or Marienlyst Stadion in Drammen . Telenor stated that if Stabæk moved , they would have to re @-@ negotiate the naming rights agreement for the arena , as the value of the contract was largely based on the naming exposure of Stabæk playing in the Premier League . The company also stated that they had difficulty understanding the argumentation from the holding company , as there was no football being played October and March , but that the venue , which has the largest capacity for indoor concerts in the Oslo area , failed to attract large artists , such as Rihanna , during the winter months . 
 On 4 December , Stabæk Fotball stated that they were willing to move their training , Norwegian Football Cup and UEFA matches to either Nadderud or Ullevaal , as a compromise to free up more available time in the arena . This was rejected by NFF , who stated that the licensing rules required that a club 's main arena be available for all league , cup and UEFA matches , and that a general exemption would not be given for the cup . In mid @-@ December , Stabæk Fotball started the process of a judicial registration of the right to lease the venue , which was permitted according to the contract . This would grant Stabæk Fotball the right to continue to lease the venue even if the holding company went bankrupt . A preliminary injunction for this was granted by Asker and Bærum District Court . 
 In a 16 December statement , three Stabæk Fotball officials said that they suspected that <unk> 's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center , and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK 200 million plus grants worth NOK 50 million . The book value of the venue was NOK 303 million at the end of 2010 , although a statement from the district court stated that the value of the venue was significantly lower than that . The bank <unk> NOR held at the time a mortgage with security in the property worth NOK 260 million , while Ulrichsen through his investment company held a mortgage worth NOK 60 @.@ 1 million . 
 On 7 January 2011 , the parts announced that they had reached a compromise . Stabæk would remain at Telenor Arena for at least the 2011 season . In addition , the club held an option to take over the responsibility for events at the venue . Stabæk Fotball had until 30 June to accept the option , which would allow the club to remain at the venue on a permanent basis . This would require them to invest NOK 20 million in an event administration , which would increase event revenue , but at the same time move the risk from Stabæk Holding to Stabæk Fotball . If the club declined the option , they would not be allowed to play at the venue from the 2012 season . On 30 June , Stabæk announced that they would not fulfill the option to continue renting the stadium . The necessary NOK 35 million would entail a risk the club was not willing to take . The club stated that they hoped they could remain at the stadium by establishing a foundation which could purchase the venue form Ulrichsen . If this does not work out , the club will have to relocate from the 2012 season . The club is then considering relocating back to Nadderud , to Ullevaal or to Marienlyst . The club estimates that any relocation would result in the club losing half their revenue . Stabæk played its last match at Fornebu Arena on 20 November 2011 , losing 1 – 2 against Haugesund . Subsequently the pitch was removed , and Stabæk returned to Nadderud from the 2012 season . 
 The Norwegian Handball Federation announced in May 2013 that the arena would be used for a four @-@ nation men 's handball tournament , Bring Cup , in November . The federation stated that they would use the tournament to evaluate if the venue was suitable as a new national arena for handball . The venue received mixed reviews . The tournament saw low attendance and Danish commentator Bent <unk> criticized the arena for being too large . The federation was happy with the arena , and stated that were planning on using it for finals in their bid for future World and European Handball Championships . Telenor Arena is part of the Oslo bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics , in which it has been proposed used for short track speed skating and figure skating .

 Ruter bus 31 is a high @-@ frequency service which runs from the city center of Oslo via Lysaker Station to Fornebu . During regular schedule it stops just outside the stadium ; however , on matchdays it stops further away because of traffic .

There are 1 @,@ 500 parking spaces immediately near the venue , although additional parking is available at IT Fornebu and at Lysaker , which are a seven- and fifteen @-@ minute walk away , respectively . The Fornebu Line is under planning , and would be built either as a light rail or a rapid transit , which would allow rail transport from the city center of Oslo and Lysaker to the stadium .

 = Cheek to Cheek ( album ) = 
 Cheek to Cheek is a collaborative album by American singers Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga . It was released on September 19 , 2014 , by Interscope Records and Columbia Records . In 2011 , Bennett and Gaga first met at the Robin Hood Foundation gala in New York City . After these two later recorded a rendition of " The Lady Is a Tramp " , they began discussing plans for working on a jazz project . Cheek to Cheek consists of jazz standards by popular jazz composers such as George Gershwin , Cole Porter , Jerome Kern , and Irving Berlin . The album was inspired by Bennett and Gaga 's desire to introduce the songs to a younger generation , since they believed that these tracks had universal appeal . 
 In January 2013 , it was announced by both artists and started recording , after Gaga recovered from her hip surgery . The album was recorded in New York City , where Bennett and Gaga were accompanied by a live band and jazz musicians associated with both artists . Gaga deviated from her previous contemporary pop albums , while wanting instead to create a jazz record . The release date of the album was delayed multiple times , and the final date was announced by Bennett and Gaga on The Today Show . The full @-@ length track listing and the cover artwork was released thereafter ; including the track lists for many alternate editions . The artists promoted Cheek to Cheek through multiple performances in and around New York , a " behind the scenes " program detailing the recording of the album on Home Shopping Network ( HSN ) , and a televised concert , titled Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga : Cheek to Cheek Live ! , which aired on PBS in October 2014 . The album was preceded by the release of two singles : " Anything Goes " and " I Can 't Give You Anything but Love " . They both reached number one on Billboard 's Jazz Digital Songs Chart . 
 Cheek to Cheek received generally positive reviews upon release , with critics praising Gaga 's vocals . At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards , the album won a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album . Cheek to Cheek debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 , with 131 @,@ 000 copies sold in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan , and has since sold 717 @,@ 000 copies in the US .

 In 2011 , Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga first met , after she had performed a rendition of Nat King Cole 's " Orange Colored Sky " , at the Robin Hood Foundation gala in New York City . Bennett then asked Gaga to sing a duet with him on his album Duets II , and these two have recorded " The Lady Is a Tramp " for the album . In September 2012 , Bennett confirmed to Rolling Stone that Gaga wanted to record a jazz album with him and there was a well @-@ known composer associated with the project , and although not on a par with songwriters like George Gershwin or Cole Porter , he had had several hits to his name . Swing band and composer Marion Evans were also under consideration for collaborating on the album ; Bennett confirmed recording sessions would start soon after . 
 In January 2013 , Evans confirmed that he would have a fairly significant part in the making of the album , stating " I don 't know at this point exactly how many songs will be on the CD , but I 'm sure we 'll have about four or five different @-@ sized orchestras or bands . It 'll turn into a giant panic , I can assure you . That 's just how this business is . " Later that month , Gaga , after her performance with Bennett at the final inaugural ball of President Obama 's second inauguration , announced the album formally through her Twitter . " And here 's me and my handsome date , I simply cannot wait for our album together , he 's my darling ! " she wrote as a caption for a photo tweeted of the pair , along with revealing the title of the album as Cheek to Cheek . In September 2013 , Bennett explained that for the album , they recorded " all great standards , quality songs ; George Gershwin , Cole Porter , Jerome Kern , Irving Berlin , songs like that . With a big swingin ' band and great , great , jazz artists playing . " He told Chicago Tribune that his main intention of recording the album with Gaga was to introduce the jazz standards to a younger audience , believing that the tracks had a " universal appeal " and " timeless quality " about them . Gaga told The Daily Telegraph that with her earlier releases like The Fame ( 2008 ) , The Fame Monster ( 2009 ) , and Born This Way ( 2011 ) , she felt unable to achieve her full vocal potential . She described Cheek to Cheek as a " rebellious " and " liberating " album for her because she was able to sing without worrying about record producers engineering it for radio . 
 Bennett said that Gaga had written an original song for the album titled " Paradise " . It also contained solo performances along with the duets ; Gaga later clarified that the album contained only standards . The songs were handpicked by Bennett and Gaga ; they selected tracks from the Great American Songbook including " Anything Goes " , a Porter song , " It Don 't Mean a Thing ( If It Ain 't Got That Swing ) " and " Sophisticated Lady " by Duke Ellington , " Lush Life " by Billy Strayhorn , and the title track by Berlin . In an interview with French newspaper La Presse , Bennett said : 
 I do not understand why [ Gaga ] had to make contemporary music ! When she sings great standards , she does it with such emotion ... It will surprise people by the quality of her voice when making quality songs . We sing a duet again on the album , but also separately . With this album , I think she will become bigger than Elvis Presley ! Of course we recorded the album in New York . As the saying goes : ' If you can make it in New York , you 'll make it anywhere . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 Although the project was in development and discussions were taking place as early as September 2012 , the recording did not start until the Spring of 2013 , being delayed by Gaga 's hip surgery and cancellation of her Born This Way Ball tour . The recording took place over a year in New York City , and featured jazz musicians associated with both artists . Bennett 's quartet was present , including Mike Renzi , Gray Sargent , Harold Jones and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier . Along with Evans , jazz trumpeter Brian Newman , a long @-@ time friend and colleague of Gaga , played on the album with his New York City based jazz quintet . Tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and flautist Paul Horn were also enlisted as musicians . 
 According to Gaga , Bennett wanted her to sing different songs and was impressed by her vocals during " Lush Life " , referring to the Billy Strayhorn written standard that has been recorded by everyone from Nancy Wilson and Sarah Vaughan to Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt . Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett . " I just wanted him to hear I have an authentic jazz voice and that I studied that ... If he can hear that , I 'm okay . If he can 't hear it , I 'm not an authentic jazz voice , " she added . Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse , who died in July 2011 ; Gaga added " I thought of her almost every day in the studio . I wish she was still here . She was jazz to her core " . The songs were recorded live with the band , and during the recording process Gaga asked for carpets to be placed on the studio floor , so that it looked like a film set and it could be photographed . 
 In Cheek to Cheek , Gaga sings solo on " Lush Life " , " Bang Bang ( My Baby Shot Me Down ) " and " Ev 'ry Time We Say Goodbye " , while Bennett 's solo includes " Don 't Wait Too Long " and " Sophisticated Lady " . According to Gaga , " Lush Life " and " Sophisticated Lady " complemented each other ; for Bennett , the complement came from the fact that Duke Ellington wrote " Sophisticated Lady " and later collaborated with Strayhorn for " Lush Life " . Gaga sang " Lush Life " in her school choir , but it was only later she understood the lyrical interpretation of the track , about failure and heartache . During Cheek to Cheek 's recording , she was emotionally upset about her professional and personal conflicts during the Artpop era ; Bennett had to support and guide her through the process . Newman recalled that " Bang Bang ( My Baby Shot Me Down ) " was recorded during the taping of the duo 's show at Lincoln Center . Gaga had informed the musicians about performing the song , and piano player Alex Smith made the necessary musical arrangements the night before the concert . They did not rehearse it , and recorded it live when Gaga performed the song in front of the audience . 
 The first song , " Anything Goes " , was recorded by Bennett for his 1959 collaboration with Count Basie and his Orchestra , Strike Up the Band , and Gaga first came to know about it when she was 13 years old . Gaga thought that " Anything Goes " was a funny track with a " real sexy , powerful vibe to it , and it 's just because we 're having fun singing it . " The version on Cheek to Cheek finds Bennett and Gaga swapping the lyrics between themselves , and was described by Bobby Olivier , from The Star @-@ Ledger , as " smooth as silk " . The syllables are pronounced strongly by Gaga in syncopation while her vibrato complemented Bennett 's characteristic jazz vocals and swing . Olivier added , " Gaga 's voice , when stripped of its bells and whistles , showcases a timelessness that lends itself well to the genre . " " I Can 't Give You Anything but Love " was originally written in 1928 by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields for the Broadway revue , Blackbirds of 1928 . The version on Cheek to Cheek opens with the sound of high @-@ hat and an electronic organ . Gaga alters the lyrics to sing " Gee , I 'd like to say you 're looking swell , Tony " , who later rejoins with the line " Diamond bracelets won 't work , doesn 't sell , Gaga " . " Nature Boy " was first released as a single in 1948 by Cole , and it became a commercial success for him . Written by eccentric songwriter eden ahbez , the song about a " strange enchanted boy " features instrumentation from flutes and drums , and has an orchestral arrangement . A <unk> version , Gaga sings in a Liza Minnelli inspired voice with a breathy range , followed by Bennett complimenting her with the story of meeting the titular character .

The singer explained that she and Bennett were sitting and talking when Klein had suddenly photographed them . For the standard edition , Bennett and Gaga are shown in a New York newspaper with the album name atop the image , while the deluxe edition just features the same image .

It would include limited edition items , like personal snapshots , Cheek to Cheek sheet music autographed by Bennett , 8 × 10 art prints housed in a vellum envelope and others . 
 Bennett told Billboard that they were also inspired by Porter 's 1936 musical , Red , Hot and Blue , for a possible sequel to Cheek to Cheek . He wanted to see how Cheek to Cheek fared after its release , but Gaga wanted to start working on the collaboration " right away " . Bennett added : " we 're gonna do two albums in a row with her . We 'll have to try and do that as soon as possible , just as a follow @-@ up for a second album . "

After its release , " I Can 't Give You Anything but Love " debuted at number @-@ one on the Jazz Digital Songs chart of Billboard , on the week ending September 6 , 2014 , and the French Singles Chart at number 173 . 
 Additionally , " Nature Boy " was released for streaming on Gaga 's Vevo channel from September 16 , 2014 . Gaga had previously tweeted about the background of the song , as well as about the death of flautist Horn . The song debuted on the Billboard Trending 140 Chart at number five and quickly rose to number one . After Cheek to Cheek 's release , " Bang Bang ( My Baby Shot Me Down ) " debuted at number one on the Jazz Digital Songs chart , which became Gaga 's first entry as a solo artist .

MTV News 's Gil Kaufman praised the album , calling Bennett and Gaga " a match made in heaven " . He added that the singers were able to " flawlessly " merge their unique vocals , that was reflected in their in @-@ studio rapport , and thus onto the songs on Cheek to Cheek . Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian awarded the album with four out of five stars , claiming that " Gaga is a wonder " . She also praised that " Cheek to Cheek reveals the considerable warmth and depth of her voice " . The Times critic Will Hodgkinson praised the album giving it a rating of four out of five stars .

Jazz critic Marc Myers reviewed the album for The Wall Street Journal , claiming that " the biggest surprise on the album is Gaga 's solo vocal on ' Lush Life ' , a difficult song that has troubled even the most seasoned jazz @-@ pop singers , including Frank Sinatra . Her lower register is warm and her phrasing is heartfelt . " In his favorable review , Chicago Tribune critic Howard Reich wrote that " Cheek to Cheek serves up the real thing , start to finish ... Both singers revel in swing rhythm , eager to buoy from one offbeat to the next and the next . They achieve considerable energy . But it 's when things slow down that you can hear what these artists are capable of as interpreters , alone and together . " 
 Jazz author Ted Gioia , who reviewed the album for The Daily Beast , was surprised by Gaga 's ability to sing jazz , saying that " in all fairness to Lady Gaga , any singer who matches up with Tony Bennett needs to get loud and assertive ... Her voice projects an appealing innocence [ on ] ' But Beautiful ' and ' Ev 'ry Time We Say Goodbye ' " . Rating it four out of five stars , Lewis Corner from Digital Spy complimented the vocal mix on the album , adding that " Cheek to Cheek may not be the glittering spectacle we 've come to expect from Lady Gaga , but with Tony Bennett 's guidance the pair have delivered an authentic and solid jazz record that respects the genre 's generous history . Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars and praised Gaga 's vocals . Dolan felt the album " proves she can be a sophisticated lady " . Charles J. Gan from Associated Press also praised Bennett and Gaga 's singing , writing that " Had she been born in an earlier era , Gaga would have been right at home in an MGM musical " . Idolator 's Bianca Gracie described the album as " a refreshing listen that highlights the undeniable talent of both Bennett and Gaga and how well they work together " . Writing for the National Post , Mike Doherty observed that Gaga took " liberties with the beat , bends notes , purrs and whoops away " with the vocals , while Bennett was able to complement with his characteristic " dapper approach " .

" San Francisco Chronicle writer Aidin Vaziri was disappointed with Bennett and Gaga not " highlight [ ing ] each other 's wildly distinguishing features " , adding that " the background music is far more exciting than the people singing over it " . Mikael Wood from Los Angeles Times complimented Gaga 's vocals in the album but panned her " cheap exploitation : of a bunch of important songs she brings nothing to ; of an 88 @-@ year @-@ old legend with whom she has zero chemistry ; and , most disappointingly , of our eagerness to follow her down an unlikely creative path . " At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8 , 2015 , Cheek to Cheek won a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album .

 The Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway ( CCE & HR ) , also known as the Hampstead tube , was a railway company established in 1891 that constructed a deep @-@ level underground " tube " railway in London . Construction of the CCE & HR was delayed for more than a decade while funding was sought . In 1900 it became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) , controlled by American financier Charles Yerkes . The UERL quickly raised the funds , mainly from foreign investors . Various routes were planned , but a number of these were rejected by Parliament . Plans for tunnels under Hampstead Heath were authorised , despite opposition by many local residents who believed they would damage the ecology of the Heath . 
 When opened in 1907 , the CCE & HR 's line served 16 stations and ran for 7 @.@ 67 miles ( 12 @.@ 34 km ) in a pair of tunnels between its southern terminus at Charing Cross and its two northern termini at Archway and Golders Green . Extensions in 1914 and the mid @-@ 1920s took the railway to Edgware and under the River Thames to Kennington , serving 23 stations over a distance of 14 @.@ 19 miles ( 22 @.@ 84 km ) . In the 1920s the route was connected to another of London 's deep @-@ level tube railways , the City and South London Railway ( C & SLR ) , and services on the two lines were merged into a single London Underground line , eventually called the Northern line . 
 Within the first year of opening , it became apparent to the management and investors that the estimated passenger numbers for the CCE & HR and the other UERL lines had been over @-@ optimistic . Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways , and the later extensions , the CCE & HR struggled financially . In 1933 the CCE & HR and the rest of the UERL were taken into public ownership . Today , the CCE & HR 's tunnels and stations form the Northern line 's Charing Cross branch from Kennington to Camden Town , the Edgware branch from Camden Town to Edgware , and the High Barnet branch from Camden Town to Archway .

 In November 1891 , notice was given of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the construction of the Hampstead , St Pancras & Charing Cross Railway ( HStP & CCR ) . The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Heath Street in Hampstead to Strand in Charing Cross . The route was to run beneath Hampstead High Street , Rosslyn Hill , Haverstock Hill and Chalk Farm Road to Camden Town and then under Camden High Street and Hampstead Road to Euston Road . The route then continued south , following Tottenham Court Road , Charing Cross Road and King William Street ( now William IV Street ) to Agar Street adjacent to Strand . North of Euston Road , a branch was to run eastwards from the main alignment under Drummond Street to serve the main line stations at Euston , St Pancras and King 's Cross . Stations were planned at Hampstead , Belsize Park , Chalk Farm , Camden Town , Seymour Street ( now part of Eversholt Street ) , Euston Road , Tottenham Court Road , Oxford Street , Agar Street , Euston and King 's Cross . Although a decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains , a power station was planned on Chalk Farm Road close to the London and North Western Railway 's Chalk Farm station ( later renamed Primrose Hill ) which had a coal depot for deliveries . 
 The promoters of the HStP & CCR were inspired by the recent success of the City and South London Railway ( C & SLR ) , the world 's first deep @-@ tube railway . This had opened in November 1890 and had seen large passenger numbers in its first year of operation . Bills for three similarly inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 legislative session , and , to ensure a consistent approach , a Joint Select Committee was established to review the proposals . The committee took evidence on various matters regarding the construction and operation of deep @-@ tube railways , and made recommendations on the diameter of tube tunnels , method of traction , and the granting of wayleaves . After preventing the construction of the branch beyond Euston , the Committee allowed the HStP & CCR bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration . The rest of the route was approved and , following a change of the company name , the bill received royal assent on 24 August 1893 as the Charing Cross , Euston , and Hampstead Railway Act , 1893 . 
 = = = Search for financing , 1893 – 1903 = = = 
 Although the company had permission to construct the railway , it still had to raise the capital for the construction works . The CCE & HR was not alone ; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors – the Baker Street & Waterloo Railway ( BS & WR ) , the Waterloo & City Railway ( W & CR ) and the Great Northern & City Railway ( GN & CR ) ( the three other companies that put forward bills in 1892 ) and the Central London Railway ( CLR , which had received assent in 1891 ) . Only the W & CR , which was the shortest line and was backed by the London and South Western Railway with a guaranteed dividend , was able to raise its funds without difficulty . For the CCE & HR and the rest , much of the remainder of the decade saw a struggle to find investors in an uninterested market . A share offer in April 1894 had been unsuccessful and in December 1899 only 451 out of the company 's 177 @,@ 600 £ 10 shares had been part sold to eight investors . 
 Like most legislation of its kind , the act of 1893 imposed a time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital . To keep the powers granted by the act alive , the CCE & HR submitted a series of further bills to Parliament for extensions of time . Extensions were granted by the Charing Cross Euston and Hampstead Railway Acts , 1897 , 1898 , 1900 , and 1902 . 
 A contractor was appointed in 1897 , but funds were not available and no work was started . In 1900 , foreign investors came to the rescue of the CCE & HR : American financier Charles Yerkes , who had been <unk> involved in the development of Chicago 's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s , saw the opportunity to make similar investments in London . Starting with the purchase of the CCE & HR in September 1900 for £ 100 @,@ 000 , he and his backers purchased a number of the unbuilt tube railways , and the operational but struggling Metropolitan District Railway ( MDR ) . 
 With the CCE & HR and the other companies under his control , Yerkes established the UERL to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the steam @-@ operated MDR . The UERL was capitalised at £ 5 million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors . Further share issues followed , which raised a total of £ 18 million ( equivalent to approximately £ 1 @.@ 74 billion today ) to be used across all of the UERL 's projects .

 While the CCE & HR raised money , it continued to develop the plans for its route . On 24 November 1894 , a bill was announced to purchase additional land for stations at Charing Cross , Oxford Street , Euston and Camden Town . This was approved as the Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway Act , 1894 on 20 July 1895 . On 23 November 1897 , a bill was announced to change the route of the line at its southern end to terminate under Craven Street on the south side of Strand . This was enacted as the Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway Act , 1898 on 25 July 1898 . 
 On 22 November 1898 , the CCE & HR published another bill to add an extension and to modify part of the route . The extension was a branch from Camden Town to Kentish Town where a new terminus was planned as an interchange with the Midland Railway 's Kentish Town station . Beyond the terminus , the CCE & HR line was to come to the surface for a depot on vacant land to the east of Highgate Road ( occupied today by the <unk> Road Estate ) . The modification changed the Euston branch by extending it northwards from Euston to connect to the main route at the south end of Camden High Street . The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted . Included in the bill were powers to purchase a site in Cranbourn Street for an additional station ( Leicester Square ) . It received royal assent as the Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway Act , 1899 on 9 August 1899 . 
 On 23 November 1900 , the CCE & HR announced its most wide @-@ ranging modifications to the route . Two bills were submitted to Parliament , referred to as No. 1 and No. 2 . Bill No. 1 proposed the continuation of the railway north from Hampstead to Golders Green , the purchase of land and properties for stations and the construction of a depot at Golders Green . Also proposed were minor adjustments to route alignments previously approved . Bill No. 2 proposed two extensions : from Kentish Town to Brecknock Road , Archway Tavern , Archway Road and Highgate in the north and from Charing Cross to Parliament Square , Artillery Row and Victoria station in the south . 
 The extension to Golders Green would take the railway out of the urban and suburban areas and into open farmland . While this provided a convenient site for the CCE & HR 's depot it is believed that underlying the decision was Yerkes ' plan to profit from the sale of development land previously purchased in the area that would rise in value when the railway opened . 
 The CCE & HR 's two bills were submitted to Parliament at the same time as a large number of other bills for underground railways in the capital . As it had done in 1892 , Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor to review the bills . By the time the committee had produced its report , the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session . Bills No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3 . The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the Victoria Embankment where it would provide an interchange with the existing MDR station ( then called Charing Cross ) . 
 The bills were again examined by a joint committee , this time under Lord Ribblesdale . The sections which dealt with the proposed north @-@ eastern extension from Archway Tavern to Highgate and the southern extension from Charing Cross to Victoria were deemed to not comply with parliamentary standing orders and were struck @-@ out . 
 = = = = Hampstead Heath controversy = = = = 
 A controversial element of the CCE & HR 's plans was the extension of the railway to Golders Green . The route of the tube tunnels took the line under Hampstead Heath and strong opposition was raised , concerned about the effect that the tunnels would have on the ecology of the Heath . The Hampstead Heath Protection Society claimed that the tunnels would drain the sub @-@ soil of water and the vibration of passing trains would damage trees . Taking its lead from the Society 's objections , The Times published an alarmist article on 25 December 1900 claiming that " a great tube laid under the heath will , of course , act as a drain ; and it is quite likely that the grass and gorse and trees on the Heath will suffer from the loss of moisture ... Moreover , it seems to be established beyond question that the trains passing along these deep @-@ laid tubes shake the earth to its surface , and the constant jar and quiver will probably have a serious effect upon the trees by loosening their roots . " 
 In fact , the tunnels were to be excavated at a depth of more than 200 feet ( 61 m ) below the surface , the deepest of any on the London Underground . In his presentation to the joint committee , the CCE & HR 's counsel disparagingly refuted the objections : " Just see what an absurd thing ! Disturbance of the water when we are 240 feet down in the London clay – about the most impervious thing you can possibly find ; almost more impervious than granite rock ! And the vibration on this railway is to shake down timber trees ! Could anything be more ludicrous than to waste the time of the Committee in discussing such things presented by such a body ! " 
 A second railway company , the Edgware & Hampstead Railway ( E & HR ) , also had a bill before Parliament which proposed tunnels beneath the Heath as part of its planned route between Edgware and Hampstead . The E & HR had planned to connect to the CCE & HR at Hampstead but , to avoid the needless duplication of tunnels between Golders Green and Hampstead , the two companies agreed that the E & HR would instead connect to the CCE & HR at Golders Green . 
 The Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead had initially objected to the line but gave consent on the condition that a station be constructed between Hampstead and Golders Green to provide access for visitors to the Heath . A new station was added to the plans at the northern edge of the Heath at North End where it could also serve a new residential development planned for the area . Once Parliament was satisfied that the extension would not damage the Heath , the CCE & HR bills jointly received royal assent on 18 November 1902 as the Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway Act , 1902 . On the same date , the E & HR bill received its assent as the Edgware and Hampstead Railway Act , 1902 . 
 = = = Construction , 1902 – 1907 = = = 
 With the funds available from the UERL and the route decided , the CCE & HR started site demolitions and preparatory works in July 1902 . On 21 November 1902 , the CCE & HR published another bill which sought compulsory purchase powers for additional buildings for its station sites , planned the take @-@ over of the E & HR and abandoned the permitted but redundant section of the line from Kentish Town to the proposed depot site near Highgate Road . This bill was approved as the Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway Act , 1903 on 21 July 1903 . 
 Tunnelling began in September 1903 . Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house @-@ style . This consisted of two @-@ storey steel @-@ framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi @-@ circular windows on the upper floor . Each station was provided with two or four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft . 
 While construction proceeded , the CCE & HR continued to submit bills to Parliament . The Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway Act , 1904 , which received assent on 22 July 1904 , granted permission to buy additional land for the station at Tottenham Court Road , for a new station at Mornington Crescent and for changes at Charing Cross . The Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway Act , 1905 received assent on 4 August 1905 . It dealt mainly with the acquisition of the subsoil under part of the forecourt of the South Eastern Railway 's Charing Cross station so that the CCE & HR 's station could be excavated during the 3 months closure following the recent roof collapse . 
 The sale of the building land at North End to conservationists to form the Hampstead Heath extension in 1904 , meant a reduction in the number of residents who might use the station there . Work continued below ground at a reduced pace , and the platform tunnels and some passenger circulation tunnels were excavated , but North End station was abandoned in 1906 before the lift and stair shafts were dug and before a surface building was constructed . 
 Tunnelling was completed in December 1905 , after which work continued on the construction of the station buildings and the fitting @-@ out of the tunnels with tracks and signalling equipment . As part of the UERL group , the CCE & HR obtained its electricity from the company 's Lots Road Power Station , originally built for the electrification of the MDR ; the proposed Chalk Farm generating station was not built . The final section of the approved route between Charing Cross and the Embankment was not constructed , and the southern terminus on opening was Charing Cross . After a period of test running , the railway was ready to open in 1907 . 
 = = Opening = = 
 The CCE & HR was the last of the UERL 's three tube railways to open and was advertised as the " Last Link " . The official opening on 22 June 1907 was made by David Lloyd George , President of the Board of Trade , after which the public travelled free for the rest of the day . From its opening , the CCE & HR was generally known by the abbreviated names Hampstead Tube or Hampstead Railway and the names appeared on the station buildings and on contemporary maps of the tube lines .

 The service was provided by a fleet of carriages manufactured for the UERL by the American Car and Foundry Company and assembled at Trafford Park in Manchester . These carriages were built to the same design used for the BS & WR and the GNP & BR and operated as electric multiple unit trains without the need for separate locomotives . Passengers boarded the trains via folding lattice gates at each end of cars which were operated by Gate @-@ men who rode on the outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived . The design became known on the Underground as the 1906 stock or Gate stock .

 Despite the UERL 's success in financing and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years , its opening was not the financial success that had been expected . In the Hampstead Tube 's first twelve months of operation it carried 25 million passengers , just half of the 50 million that had been predicted during the planning of the line . The UERL 's pre @-@ opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be greatly over @-@ optimistic , as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets . 
 The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the tube and sub @-@ surface railway companies , but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses , replacing slower , horse @-@ drawn road transport , took a large number of passengers away from the trains . The problem was not limited to the UERL ; all of London 's seven tube lines and the sub @-@ surface MDR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to a degree and the reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders . 
 In an effort to improve the financial situation , the UERL together with the C & SLR , the CLR and the GN & CR began , from 1907 , to introduce fare agreements . From 1908 , they began to present themselves through common branding as the Underground . The W & CR was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement as it was owned by the mainline London and South Western Railway . 
 The UERL 's three tube railway companies were still legally separate entities with their own management and shareholder and dividend structures . There was duplicated administration between the three companies and , to streamline the management and reduce expenditure , the UERL announced a bill in November 1909 that would merge the Hampstead Tube , the Piccadilly Tube and the Bakerloo Tube into a single entity , the London Electric Railway ( LER ) , although the lines retained their own individual branding . The bill received assent on 26 July 1910 as the London Electric Railway Amalgamation Act , 1910 .

 In November 1910 , the LER published notice of a bill to revive the unused 1902 permission to continue the line from Charing Cross to Embankment . The extension was planned as a single tunnel , running in a loop under the Thames , connecting the ends of the two existing tunnels . Trains were to run in one direction around the loop stopping at a single @-@ platform station constructed to provide an interchange with the BS & WR and MDR at Embankment station . The bill received assent as the London Electric Railway Act , 1911 on 2 June 1911 . The loop was constructed from a large excavation north @-@ west of the MDR station and was connected to the sub @-@ surface line with escalators . The station opened on 6 April 1914 as :

 In the decade after the E & HR received royal assent for its route from Edgware to Hampstead , the company continued to search for finance and revised its plans in conjunction both with the CCE & HR and a third railway company , the Watford & Edgware Railway ( W & ER ) which had plans to build a line linking the E & HR to Watford . 
 Following the enactment of the Watford and Edgware Railway Act , 1906 , the W & ER briefly took over the powers of the E & HR to construct the line from Golders Green to Edgware . Struggling to find funds , the W & ER attempted a formal merger with the E & HR through a bill submitted to Parliament in 1906 , with the intention of constructing and operating the whole of the route from Golders Green to Watford as a light railway but the bill was rejected by Parliament and , when the W & ER 's powers lapsed , control returned to the CCE & HR . 
 The E & HR company had remained in existence and had obtained a series of acts to preserve and develop its plans . The Edgware and Hampstead Railway Acts , 1905 , 1909 and 1912 granted extensions of time , approved changes to the route , gave permissions for viaducts and a tunnel and allowed the closure and re @-@ <unk> of roads to be crossed by the railway 's tracks . It was intended that the CCE & HR would provide and operate the trains and this was formalised by the London Electric Railway Act , 1912 , which approved the LER 's take over of the E & HR . 
 No immediate effort was made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started . With wartime restrictions in place , construction work for the railway was prevented . Yearly extensions to the earlier E & HR acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922 , giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924 . Although the permissions had been maintained , the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works . Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans . 
 The project was made possible when the government introduced the Trade Facilities Act , 1921 by which the Treasury underwrote loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment . With this support , the UERL raised the funds and work began on extending the Hampstead tube to Edgware . The UERL group 's Managing Director / Chairman , Lord Ashfield , ceremonially cut the first sod to begin the works at Golders Green on 12 June 1922 . 
 The extension crossed farmland , meaning it could be constructed on the surface more easily and cheaply than a deep tube line below the surface . A viaduct was constructed across the Brent valley and a short section of tunnel was required at The Hyde , Hendon . Stations were designed in a suburban pavilion style by the UERL 's architect Stanley Heaps . The first section opened on 19 November 1923 with stations at : 
 Brent ( now Brent Cross ) 
 Hendon Central 
 The remainder of the extension opened on 18 August 1924 with stations at : 
 Colindale 
 Burnt Oak ( opened 27 October 1924 ) 
 Edgware 
 = = = Kennington , 1922 – 1926 = = = 
 On 21 November 1922 , the LER announced a bill for the 1923 parliamentary session . It included the proposal to extend the line from its southern terminus to the C & SLR 's station at Kennington where an interchange would be provided . The bill received royal assent as the London Electric Railway Act , 1923 on 2 August 1923 . 
 The work involved the rebuilding of the below ground parts of the CCE & HR 's former terminus station to enable through running and the loop tunnel was abandoned . Tunnels were extended under the Thames to Waterloo station and then to Kennington where two additional platforms were constructed to provide the interchange to the C & SLR . Immediately south of Kennington station , the CCE & HR tunnels connected to those of the C & SLR . The new service was opened on 13 September 1926 to coincide with the opening of the extension of the C & SLR to Morden . The Charing Cross to Kennington link had stations at : 
 Waterloo 
 Kennington 
 The C & SLR had been under the control of the UERL since its purchase by the group in 1913 . An earlier connection between the CCE & HR and the C & SLR had been opened in 1924 linking the C & SLR 's station at Euston with the CCE & HR 's at Camden Town . With the opening of the Kennington extension , the two railways began to operate as an integrated service using the newly built Standard Stock trains . On tube maps the combined lines were shown in a single colour although the separate names continued in use into the 1930s . 
 = = Move to public ownership , 1923 – 1933 = = 
 Despite improvements made to other parts of the network , the Underground railways were still struggling to make a profit . The UERL 's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company ( LGOC ) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group , through the pooling of revenues , to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways . However , competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group . 
 In an effort to protect the UERL group 's income Lord Ashfield lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area . Starting in 1923 , a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction , with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor ( later MP and Minister of Transport ) Herbert Morrison , at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought . Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC 's tram system ; Morrison preferred full public ownership . After seven years of false starts , a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) , a public corporation that would take control of the UERL , the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area . The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full nationalisation – and came into existence on 1 July 1933 . On this date , the LER and the other Underground companies were liquidated .

 Finding a suitable name for the combined CCE & HR and C & SLR routes proved a challenge for the LPTB and a number of variations were used including Edgware , Morden & Highgate Line in 1933 and Morden @-@ Edgware Line in 1936 . In 1937 , Northern line was adopted in preparation for the uncompleted Northern Heights plan . Today , the Northern line is the busiest on the London Underground system , carrying 206 @.@ 7 million passengers annually , a level of usage which led it to be known as the Misery line during the 1990s due to overcrowding and poor reliability . 
 = Cultivated plant taxonomy = 
 Cultivated plant taxonomy is the study of the theory and practice of the science that identifies , describes , classifies , and names cultigens — those plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity . Cultivated plant taxonomists do , however , work with all kinds of plants in cultivation . 
 Cultivated plant taxonomy is one part of the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens , large nurseries , universities , or government departments . Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include : searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation ( plant hunting ) ; communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics ; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions ( horticultural floras ) ; maintaining databases , herbaria and other information about cultivated plants . 
 Much of the work of the cultivated plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes . The provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( Botanical Code ) serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific community , while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ( Cultivated Plant Code ) are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce — the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture , forestry and horticulture . These names , sometimes called variety names , are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names , and they assist communication among the community of foresters , farmers and horticulturists . 
 The history of cultivated plant taxonomy can be traced from the first plant selections that occurred during the agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans . The naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar . Since that time the classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path . 
 = = Distinctive characteristics = = 
 Cultivated plant taxonomy has been distinguished from the taxonomy of other plants in at least five ways . Firstly , there is a distinction made according to where the plants are growing — that is , whether they are wild or cultivated . This is alluded to by the Cultivated Plant Code which specifies in its title that it is dealing with cultivated plants . Secondly , a distinction is made according to how the plants originated . This is indicated in Principle 2 of the Cultivated Plant Code which defines the scope of the Code as " ... plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to the intentional actions of mankind " — plants that have evolved under natural selection with human <unk> , cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with plant variation that requires the use of special classification categories that do not conform with the hierarchy of ranks implicit in the Botanical Code , these categories being the cultivar , Group and grex ( which are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code ) . This feature is also referred to in the Preamble to the Cultivated Plant Code which states that " The purpose of giving a name to a taxon is not to indicate its characters or history , but to supply a means of referring to it and to indicate to which category it is assigned . " Fourthly , cultivated plant taxonomy serves a particular community of people : the Botanical Code focuses on the needs of plant taxonomists as they attempt to maintain order and stability for the scientific names of all plants , while the Cultivated Plant Code caters for the needs of people requiring names for plants used in the commercial world of agriculture , forestry and horticulture . Finally , the difference between cultivated plant taxonomy and the taxonomy of other plants has been attributed to the purpose for which the taxonomy has been devised , it being plant @-@ centred in the Botanical Code and human @-@ centred in the Cultivated Plant Code . 
 = = Scientific and anthropocentric classification = = 
 The key activities of cultivated plant taxonomy relate to classification ( taxonomy ) and naming ( nomenclature ) . The rules associated with naming plants are separate from the methods , principles or purposes of classification , except that the units of classification , the taxa , are placed in a nested hierarchy of ranks – like species within genera , and genera within families . There are three classification categories used in the Cultivated Plant Code , the cultivar and the Group and the grex , but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code . 
 From the time of the ancient world , at least , plants have been classified in two ways . On the one hand there is the detached academic , philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves : this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function . Then there is the practical , utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use . Cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture , horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code . This Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature , it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce . Those cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria : they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name ; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations ( except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name ) ; it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation . 
 The terms cultigen and cultivar may be confused with each other . <unk> is a general @-@ purpose term for plants that have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans , while cultivar is a formal classification category . Cultigens include not only plants with cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group . The Cultivated Plant Code points out that cultigens are : deliberately selected plants that may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation , by selection from existing cultivated stocks , or from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation . Included within the group of plants known as cultigens are genetically modified plants , plants with binomial Latin names that are the result of ancient human selection , and any plants that have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names . In practice most cultigens are cultivars . 
 The following account of the historical development of cultivated plant taxonomy traces the way cultigens have arisen and been incorporated into botanical science ; it also demonstrates how two approaches to plant nomenclature and classification have led to the present @-@ day International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants and International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants . 
 = = Historical development = = 
 The history of cultigen nomenclature has been discussed by William T. Stearn and <unk> , <unk> and Berg . It has also been examined from a botanical perspective and from the origin of the Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 until 2004 . 
 The early development of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general as the early listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds . Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy and it was not until the mid @-@ 19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy . 
 = = = 10 @,@ 000 to 400 BCE – plant domestication = = = 
 William T. Stearn ( 1911 – 2001 ) , taxonomic botanist , classical scholar and author of the book Botanical Latin has commented that " cultivated plants [ cultigens ] are mankind 's most vital and precious heritage from remote antiquity " . Cultigens of our most common economic plants probably date back to the first settled communities of the Neolithic Revolution 10 @,@ 000 to 12 @,@ 000 years ago although their exact time and place of true origin will probably remain a mystery . In the Western world among the first cultigens would have been selections of the cereals wheat and barley that arose in the early settlements of the Fertile Crescent ( the fertile river valleys of the Nile , Tigris and Euphrates ) in the Western Mediterranean . Food plant selections would also have been made in the ten or so other centres of settlement that occurred around the world at this time . Confining crops to local areas gave rise to <unk> ( selections that are highly adapted to local conditions ) although these are now largely replaced by modern cultivars . Cuttings are an extremely effective way of perpetuating desirable characters , especially of woody plants like grapes , figs and olives so it is not surprising that these are among the first known plant selections perpetuated in cultivation in the West . Migrating people would take their plant seeds and cuttings with them ; there is evidence of early Fertile Crescent cereal cultigens being transferred from Western Asia to surrounding lands . 
 = = = 400 BCE to 1400 – the ancient world : Greco @-@ Roman influence to the Middle Ages = = = 
 As early as the 5th century BCE the Greek philosopher Hippo expressed the opinion that cultigens ( as we call them now ) were produced from wild plants as the result of the care bestowed on them by man , a revolutionary view at a time when they were regarded as the special creation and gift of the gods . In devising ways of classifying organisms the philosopher Aristotle ( 384 – 322 BCE ) established the important idea of a <unk> <unk> — the principle that groups can be progressively subdivided . This has been assumed in biological classification ever since and is congruent with the relatively recent idea of evolution as descent with modification . All biological classification follows this principle of groups within groups , known as a nested hierarchy , but this form of classification does not necessarily presuppose evolution . 
 The earliest scientific ( rather than utilitarian ) approach to plants is attributed to Aristotle 's student Theophrastus ( 371 – 286 BCE ) , known as the " father of botany " . In his Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus described 480 kinds of plant , dividing the plant kingdom into trees , shrubs , undershrubs and herbs with further subdivision into wild and cultivated , flowering and non @-@ flowering , deciduous or evergreen . 
 The utilitarian approach , classifying plants according to their medicinal properties , is exemplified by the work of Roman nobleman , scientist and historian , Pliny the Elder ( 29 – 79 CE ) author of Naturalis <unk> . " Cultivars " listed here are named after people , places or special plant characteristics . Most notable is the work of Dioscorides ( <unk> – <unk> CE ) a Greek doctor who worked with the Roman army . His five @-@ volume Materia Medica was a forerunner of the herbal which led to the modern pharmacopoeia . This work was endlessly plagiarised by later herbals including those printed between about 1470 and 1670 CE : it listed 600 to 1000 different kinds of plants including the cultigens Gallica , <unk> , the rose of uncertain origin known as Alba and other rose cultivars grown by the Romans . 
 The first record of a named cultigen occurs in De Agri <unk> written about 160 BCE by Roman statesman Cato the Elder ( 234 – 149 BCE ) in a list that includes 120 kinds ( cultivars ) of figs , grapes , apples and olives . The names are presented in a way that implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans . The " cultivar " names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar ( the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made ) . Writers up to the 15th century added little to this early work . In the Middle Ages the book of hours , early herbals , illuminated manuscripts and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens . For example , in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem <unk> by <unk> Strabo as growing in the monastery garden of St Gallen in Switzerland : sage , rue , southernwood , wormwood , <unk> , fennel , German iris , <unk> , chervil , Madonna lily , opium poppy , <unk> , mint , <unk> , <unk> , catmint , radish , gallica rose , bottle gourd and melon . It seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of Charlemagne ( 742 – 814 CE ) . 
 = = = 1400 to 1700 – Renaissance , imperial expansion , herbals = = = 
 The revival of learning during the Renaissance reinvigorated the study of plants and their classification . From about 1400 CE European expansion established Latin as the common language of scholars and it was adopted for biological nomenclature . Then , from about 1500 CE , the publication of herbals ( books often illustrated with woodcuts describing the appearance , medicinal properties , and other characteristics of plants used in herbal medicine ) extended the formal documentation of plants and by the late 16th century the number of different plant kinds described in Europe had risen to about 4 @,@ 000 . In 1623 Gaspard Bauhin published his <unk> theatre <unk> an attempt at a comprehensive compilation of all plants known at that time : it included about 6000 kinds . The combined works of a German physician and botanist Valerius Cordus ( 1515 – 1544 CE ) which were published in 1562 included many named " cultivars " including 30 apples and 49 pears , presumably local German selections . English herbalist John Parkinson 's Paradisi in Sole ... ( 1629 ) lists 57 apple " cultivars " , 62 pears , 61 plums , 35 cherries and 22 peaches . 
 With increasing trade in economic and medicinal plants the need for a more comprehensive classification system increased . Up to about 1650 CE plants had been grouped either alphabetically or according to utilitarian folk taxonomy – by their medicinal uses or whether they were trees , shrubs or herbs . Between 1650 and 1700 CE there was a move from the utilitarian back to a scientific natural classification based on the characters of the plants themselves . 
 = = = 1700 to 1750 – dawn of scientific classification = = = 
 In 1700 French botanist J.P. de Tournefort although still using the broad groupings of " trees " and " herbs " for flowering plants , began to use flower characteristics as distinguishing features and , most importantly , provided a clear definition of the genus as a basic unit of classification . In Institutiones Rei <unk> he listed about 10 @,@ 000 different plants , which he called species , organised into 698 genera with illustrations . The establishment of this precursor of scientific classification vastly improved the organisation of plant variation into approximately equivalent groups or ranks and many of his genera were later taken up by Carl Linnaeus . There was still at this time no common agreement on the way to present plant names so they ranged in length from one word to lengthy descriptive sentences . As the number of recorded plants increased this naming system became more unwieldy . 
 In England the tradition of documenting garden plants was established long before Linnaeus ' Species Plantarum starting with the herbals , but the most prominent early chronicler was Philip Miller ( 1691 – 1771 ) who was a master gardener in charge of the Chelsea Physic Garden in London from 1722 to 1770 . New plants were coming into Western Europe from southern Europe and the overseas colonies of the Dutch , British and French . These new plants came largely to the botanic gardens of Amsterdam , Leiden , Chelsea and Paris and they needed recording . In 1724 Miller produced a two @-@ volume compendium of garden plants called The Gardeners and Florists Dictionary or a complete System of Horticulture . The first edition was in 1724 , subsequently revised and enlarged until the last and 8th edition in 1768 by which time he had adopted Linnaean binomials . For a while this publication was taken as the starting point for " horticultural " nomenclature equivalent to Linnaeus ' Species Plantarum which is now taken as the starting point for botanical nomenclature in general . Miller 's Dictionary was the first of many English horticultural <unk> whose history has been traced by William Stearn . 
 = = = 1750 to 1800 – Linnaeus and binomial nomenclature = = = 
 In the early 18th century colonial expansion and exploration created a demand for the description of thousands of new organisms . This highlighted difficulties in communication about plants , the replication of their descriptions , and the importance of an agreed way of presenting , publishing and applying their names . 
 It was the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus who finally put order into this situation as he attempted to name all the known organisms of his day . In 1735 his Systema Naturae , which included animals ( the tenth edition became the starting point for zoological nomenclature ) was followed by Critica Botanica in 1737 , and Philosophia Botanica in 1751 . But it was his most comprehensive work on plants , the 1753 publication Species Plantarum that formalised the name of a genus with a single epithet to form the name of a species as two words , the binomial thus making secure the biological system of binomial nomenclature . In these works Linnaeus used a third name as a variety within a species . These varieties included both wild and horticultural variants . The horticultural varieties were still written in Latin and some have persisted to this day . 
 Linnaeus had very definite and uncomplimentary views about cultigens , regarding them as inferior plants for the amusement of those people he disparagingly called <unk> ( flower @-@ lovers ) ; these were plants not deserving the attention of serious botanists . His views revealed both his prejudice , his stance on special creation , and his recognition of the difficulties entailed in cultivated plant taxonomy : 
 = = = 1800 to 1900 – global plant trade = = = 
 The natural distribution of plants across the world has determined when and where cultigens have been produced . The botanical and horticultural collection of economically important plants , including ornamentals , was based in Europe . Although economic herbs and spices had a long history in trade , and there are good records of cultivar distribution by the Romans , European botanical and horticultural exploration rapidly increased in the 19th century with the colonial expansion taking place at the time . New plants were brought back to Europe while , at the same time , valuable economic plants , including those from the tropics , were distributed among the colonies . This plant trade has provided the common global heritage of economic and ornamental cultigens that we use today and which formed the stock for modern plant selection , breeding , and genetic engineering . The plant exchange that occurred as a result of European trade can be divided into several phases : 
 to 1560 mostly within Europe 
 1560 – 1620 Near East ( esp. bulbous plants from Turkey – " tulipomania " ) 
 1620 – 1686 Canada and Virginia herbaceous plants 
 1687 – 1772 Cape of South Africa 
 1687 – 1772 North American trees and shrubs 
 1772 – 1820 Australia , Tasmania , New Zealand 
 1820 – 1900 Tropical glasshouse plants ; hardy Japanese plants 
 1900 – 1930 West China 
 1930 Intensive breeding and selection programs 
 = = = 1900 to 1950 – the Botanical Code and cultigen nomenclature = = = 
 As the community of people dealing with the cultigens of commerce grew so , once again , the divergence between taxonomy serving scientific purposes and utilitarian taxonomy meeting human needs re @-@ emerged . In 1865 German botanist Karl Koch , who became General Secretary of the Berlin Horticultural Society , expressed resentment at the continued use of Latin for cultigen names . Many proposals to deal with this were made , perhaps the most prominent being the Lois de la nomenclature botanique submitted in 1867 to the fourth Horticultural and Botanical Congress by Swiss botanist Alphonse de Candolle who , in Article 40 stated : 
 " Seedlings , half @-@ breeds ( métis ) of unknown origin or sports should receive from horticulturists fancy names ( noms de fantaisie ) in common language , as distinct as possible from the Latin names of species or varieties . " 
 This Article , making provision for the cultigens of horticultural nomenclature was to remain in the Botanical Code ( with a minor amendment in 1935 suggesting the use of the letter ' c ' before the horticultural name and <unk> formal recognition of the cultivar ) through 1906 , 1912 and 1935 until the separation , in 1953 , of the Horticultural Code , precursor to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ( Cultivated Plant Code ) . In 1900 there was the first International Botanical Congress and in 1905 at the second Congress in Vienna an agreed set of nomenclatural rules was established , the Vienna Rules , which became known from then on as the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature ( now the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ) . After World War II the responsibility for the Botanical Code was taken up by the International Association for Plant Taxonomy and meetings to discuss revisions are held at six @-@ yearly intervals , the latest being in 2005 
 In horticulture at this time there existed all the problems that had confronted botanists in the 19th century – a plethora of names of various length , written and published in many languages with much duplication . The period between 1867 and 1953 was an uneasy time in which American horticulturists and other groups in Europe , such as the specialist orchid community , made attempts to put order into this chaos within their particular group of interest and devising their own rules for naming the plants of commerce . Friedrich <unk> ( 1820 – 1872 ) , who used Latin variety names , in a monographic study of beans , lentils and other legumes distinguished three infraspecific taxonomic categories : <unk> ( subspecies ) , <unk> Gruppe and Kultur @-@ <unk> , all with Latin names . In doing this he was probably laying the ground for the later establishment of the cultigen classification categories cultivar and Group . In conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component . 
 As a result of general dissatisfaction and a submission from the Royal Horticultural Society the Règles de Nomenclature <unk> was established . The use of simple descriptive Latin names ( e.g. compactus , nanus , <unk> ) for horticultural variants was accepted and so too were names in the local language – which were not to be translated and should preferably consist of one word and a maximum of three . This first Horticultural Code consisted of 16 Articles . With the intercession of a World War I it was not until the 9th Horticultural Congress in London in 1930 that the rules of a Horticulture Nomenclature Committee were agreed and added as an appendix to the 1935 Botanical Code . The rules established in 1935 were accepted but needed to be extended to include the cultigens of agriculture and forestry , but it was only a result of discussions at the 1950 International Botanical Congress in Stockholm and the 18th International Horticultural Congress in London in 1952 the first International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants was published in 1953 . The American horticultural botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey was responsible for coining the word cultigen in 1918 and cultivar in 1923 , the word cultivar only coming into general circulation with the new Code of 1953 . The use of these two terms belies the multitude of classification terms and categories that had been suggested as designations for cultigens . 
 = = = 1953 – the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants = = = 
 The first Cultivated Plant Code ( Wageningen ) , which was published in 1953 , has been followed by eight subsequent editions – in 1958 ( Utrecht ) , 1961 ( update of 1958 ) , 1969 ( Edinburgh ) , 1980 ( Seattle ) , 1995 ( Edinburgh ) , 2004 ( Toronto ) and 2009 ( Wageningen ) . 
 Following the structure of the Botanical Code the Cultivated Plant Code is set out in the form of an initial set of Principles followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles . Amendments to the Cultivated Plant Code are prompted by international symposia for cultivated plant taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants . Each new Cultivated Plant Code includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995 . 
 = = International Association for Cultivated Plant Taxonomy = = 
 Recent concerns have focused on international communication on cultivated plant taxonomy , organisation of international symposia , and general communication on topics of interest . In 1988 a Horticultural Taxonomy Group ( Hortax ) was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation , the Nomenclature and Registration Working Group of the <unk> <unk> Commissie in the Netherlands . One development promoting discussion was the newsletter Hortax News which was superseded in February 2006 by the first issue of <unk> , a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural taxonomy . This filled a gap left when the American journal <unk> ceased publication in the early 1990s . Another development was the launch , in 2007 , at the Sixth Symposium on the Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants at Wageningen of the International Association for Cultivated Plant Taxonomy . Hortax also publishes Plant Names : A Guide for Horticulturists , <unk> , Gardeners and Students . 
 = = Presenting cultigen names = = 
 Most cultigens have names consisting of a Latin name that is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants e.g. Malus domestica , to which is added a cultigen epithet , enclosed in single quotes e.g. Malus domestica ' Granny Smith ' . The formation and use of the three classification categories ( ranks ) used for cultigens , the cultivar , Group and grex , is regulated by the <unk> . Examples of acceptable ways to present cultigen names are given below : 
 Prunus serrata Sato @-@ <unk> Group

 Current challenges for cultivated plant taxonomists include : the use of large plant name databases ; ways of dealing with the use of non @-@ scientific names in commerce ( known as trade designations ) , especially for plant labels in nurseries ; intellectual property and plants ; adapting modern technology , in particular molecular techniques , to the creation and identification of cultivars ; maintaining germplasm collections of cultivars , including herbaria ; the recording and registration of cultivars . 
 The ways in which the plant variation resulting from human activity is named and classified remains contentious . The replacement of the expression " cultivated plant " with the word " cultigen " is not universally accepted . The debate continues concerning the notions of ranks and taxa as applied to cultigens . Is it appropriate to call the highly modified transgenic products of human artificial selection " taxa " in the same way we do for the products of natural selection in the wild ? To overcome this difficulty the term <unk> ( pl. <unk> ) has been suggested to replace the word taxon when speaking about cultigens . 
 Then , most " wild " plants fit neatly into the nested hierarchy of ranks used in Linnaean classification ( species into genera , genera into families etc . ) which aligns with Darwinian descent with modification . Choosing classification categories for cultigens is not clear @-@ cut . Included among cultigens are : simple selections taken from plants in the wild or in cultivation ; artificial hybrids produced both by accident and intention ; plants produced by genetic engineering ; clonal material reproduced by cuttings , grafting , budding , layering etc . ; graft @-@ chimaeras ; selections from the wild ; ancient selections of crops that date back thousands of years ; selections of aberrant growth such as witches brooms ; the results of deliberate repeatable single crosses between two pure lines to produce plants of a particular general appearance that is desirable for horticulture , but which are not genetically identical . The question remains as to whether the classification categories of cultivar , Group and grex are the most appropriate and efficient way to deal with this broad range of plant variation . 
 = The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover = 
 The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover are two 1910 American silent short comedies produced by the Thanhouser Company . Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects . The Girls He Left Behind Him focuses on a young man , Jack Redfern , who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his . This prompts him to reminiscence about all the girls he has had affections for on the eve of his wedding . All the old sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to wish him well . The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie . Tom , who plays a game of chess with her father , ends up quarreling with him and he is thrown out of the house . The next day , Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie 's birthday , but is dismissed by the angry father . Tom decides to dress up in a suit of armor and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself . The suit of armor is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down the junk dealer to free Tom from the suit of armor . Both films were released on December 9 , 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror . Both films are presumed lost . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Though the films are presumed lost , the synopsis of both film survive in The Moving Picture World from December 10 , 1910 . The plot of the The Girls He Left Behind Him follows Jack Redfern , a young bachelor , who is soon to be married . Jack receives a letter in feminine handwriting from an " old sweetheart " of his , stating how glad she is to hear of his approaching marriage . Jack goes through visions , remembering the various girls of his life and his interactions with each of them . Betty , Kate , Tootsie , Elizabeth , Clara , Jeanette , and Helen . According to the synopsis , the last vision he has is of all the old sweethearts of his waving good luck to him as he marries Mary . Though a review states that he awakes and is obliged to hurry to his wedding . Bowers believes the synopsis to be in error and that the film actually concluded with all the girls present at the wedding , rather than it being a " vision " .

Tom , naturally nervous , plays such a poor game that he and the old man quarrel and Tom is ordered from the house . Next day is Bessie 's birthday . Tom brings a bouquet and a box of candy .

Tom , unable to stand this , tries to announce himself , but only succeeds in stumbling over and breaking a valuable vase . Bessie 's pa has the ' armor ' thrown out . Dick 's conscience makes him tell Bessie that Tom was in the armor and they started the rescue . They were horrified to learn that the old man has sold the armor to a junk dealer ; and Dick and Bessie have an exciting chase before the junk man is rounded up , when it takes combined efforts of a policeman , locksmith , and plumber to release Tom from his iron suit .

 The writer of the scenarios are unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film directors are unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil and / or Lucius J. Henderson . Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith , Carl Louis Gregory , and Alfred H. Moses , Jr. though none are specifically credited . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The cast credits of both films are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H.

 The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were released together on a single reel , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet in length , on December 9 , 1910 . Both films are comedies , but Thanhouser advertisements refer to The Girls He Left Behind Him as a drama . The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain , but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls He Left Behind Him as being three @-@ quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel in length . This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production , which could have been about 625 feet and 400 feet in length and still be a single reel . Very few advertisements for the films have been found , but the films likely had a wide national release . One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri , but The Girls He Left Behind Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater . Selig would release a similarly titled work The Girl He Left Behind in 1912 . 
 The Girls He Left Behind Him received praise from the reviewer from The Moving Picture World who stated , " [ It is a ] comedy , not by any means original , but with a sentimental touch , ... this excellent film has placed in visible form these visions of the past which often haunt the middle aged or the younger person who about to take some important step . The mechanical work is well done and the audience follows the picture with interest . " The New York Dramatic Mirror also gave it faint praise by stating that " The picture has some novelty and interest . " For The Iron Clad Lover received minor praise from both publications for being a novel even if the story was impossible . 
 = Bowes Castle = 
 Bowes Castle was a medieval castle in the village of Bowes in County Durham , England . Built within the perimeter of the former Roman fort of <unk> , the early timber castle on the site was replaced by a more substantial stone structure between 1170 and 1174 on the orders of Henry II . A planned village was built alongside the castle . Bowes Castle withstood Scottish attack during the Great Revolt of 1173 @-@ 74 but was successfully looted by rebels in 1322 . The castle went into decline and was largely dismantled after the English Civil War . The ruins are now owned by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 12th century = = = 
 Bowes Castle was built within the ruins of the Roman fort of <unk> . The route was one of the few upland passes to link England and Scotland and had remained strategically important during the medieval period . The castle site lay within the Honour of Richmond , a grouping of lands traditionally owned by the Counts of Brittany during the early medieval period , but the land itself was a demesne estate , owned by the Crown . 
 Around 1136 , Alan de Bretagne , the Count of Brittany , built a timber castle in the north @-@ west corner of the old fort . The use made of the older Roman fortification at Bowes was similar to that at the nearby castles of Brough and Malton . This castle was inherited by his son , Conan , and when he in turn died in 1171 , it was claimed by Henry II . 
 Royal concerns over security led to Henry II investing heavily in a new castle structure on the site between 1171 and 1174 . It was unusual for a new royal castle to be built in this part of England during the 12th century , and Henry appears to have been driven by the military threat from Scotland before and during the Great Revolt of 1173 to 1174 . Henry II spent almost £ 600 on the castle between 1170 and 1187 , most of it in the first few years , rebuilding the older structure under the supervision of the Count of Brittany 's local tenants , <unk> , Osbert and Stephen of <unk> . 
 The rebuilt castle featured a hall @-@ keep , an uncommon design in English castles ; built of stone , this was a three @-@ storied structure 82 feet ( 25 m ) long , 60 feet ( 18 m ) wide and 50 feet ( 15 m ) high . Internally the keep was divided to form a long hall and a solar and was lit by large , rounded windows . The keep had architectural similarities to various nearby castles in the region , but in particular to those at Middleham and <unk> . A ditch formed an inner defensive bailey around the keep , with the ramparts of the old fort forming a larger , outer bailey . A mill , then an essential part of any castle , was built by the River Greta to supply flour for the garrison . The village of Bowes was built after the castle and formed a planned site running up to the castle , complete with a church and a market place ; this form of planned village is again unusual in England . 
 In England , the Great Revolt against Henry 's rule involved a coalition of rebel barons , bolstered by support from the King of Scotland and European allies . William the Lion pushed south from Scotland in 1173 and Bowes Castle was damaged in the raids ; work was carried out in anticipation of further attacks the following year , including repairs to the chamber , gates and the construction of bulwarks around the keep . The next year William of Scotland directly besieged the castle , but was he forced to retreat after the arrival of a relief force led by Henry 's illegitimate son Geoffrey , then the Bishop of Lincoln . 
 = = = 13th - 14th centuries = = = 
 Henry II was successful in quelling the Great Revolt , imprisoning William the Lion until a peace treaty was agreed , extending Henry 's authority north into Scotland . In the subsequent years the security situation in the north of England improved significantly . King John gave control of Bowes Castle to Robert de Vieuxpont , an important administrator in the north , in 1203 and he retained control of the fortification until 1228 . John stayed there himself in 1206 and in 1212 , and the castle was also used briefly to hold John 's niece Eleanor of Brittany , who had been placed under the custody of Vieuxpont . Henry III granted it briefly to William de Blockley and Gilbert de <unk> , until it was given to Duke Peter of Brittany in 1232 , and then to William de Valence . In 1241 Peter II , the Count of Savoy was made the Earl of Richmond and was then given Bowes by the king . 
 The castle remained in the hands of the Earls of Richmond until 1322 , by when it was in a poor state of repair . Edward II then gave Bowes Castle to John de Scargill instead ; the local tenants of the Earl of Richmond rebelled and attacked the castle . The lord of the castle was away at the time , and the attackers burnt part of a hall , drank four tuns of wine and stole armour , <unk> and other goods . Conflict with Scotland led to further raids against the castle and the surrounding manor ; the neighbouring fields were abandoned as a result and by 1340 the castle was in ruins and the manor worth nothing . 
 = = = Later history = = = 
 Still ruined , Bowes Castle was reclaimed by the Crown in 1361 ; between 1444 and 1471 it was controlled by the Neville family , powerful regional landowners , before reverting to the Crown once again . James I sold the castle in the early 17th century and the remaining fortifications were dismantled in the mid @-@ 17th century after the English Civil War . By 1928 , the castle was in a poor condition , with little interest being shown in it from locals or its owner , Lady Lorna Curzon @-@ Howe . Facing death duties on her estate , Curzon @-@ Howe agreed to pass the castle into the care of the Office of Works in 1931 . 
 In the 21st century , the castle is controlled by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction . The ruins of the keep survive , largely intact , and are protected as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument . 
 = Mani Ratnam = 
 Gopala Ratnam Subramaniam ( born 2 June 1955 ) , commonly known by his screen name Mani Ratnam , is an Indian film director , screenwriter , and producer who predominantly works in Tamil cinema . Cited by the media as one of India 's most acclaimed and influential filmmakers , Mani Ratnam is widely credited with revolutionising the Tamil film industry and altering the profile of Indian cinema . Although working in the mainstream medium , his films are noted for their realism , technical finesse , and craft . The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri , acknowledging his contributions to film in 2002 . 
 Despite being born into a film family , Mani Ratnam did not develop any interest towards films when he was young . Upon completion of his post graduation in management , he started his career as a consultant . He entered the film industry through the 1983 Kannada film Pallavi Anu Pallavi . The failure of his subsequent films would mean that he was left with little offers . However , his fifth directorial outing , Mouna Ragam ( 1986 ) , established him as a leading filmmaker in Tamil cinema . He followed that with the <unk> Nayagan ( 1987 ) , which is regarded as a cult film over the years . Mani Ratnam is well known for his " Political trilogy " consisting of Roja ( 1992 ) , Bombay ( 1995 ) , and Dil Se .. ( 1998 ) . The commercial and critical success of Roja established him as a leading filmmaker in Indian cinema . 
 Mani Ratnam is married to Tamil actress Suhasini and has a son with her . He has won several film awards , including six National Film Awards , Six Filmfare Awards South and three <unk> Filmfare Awards , and a few awards at various international film festivals . 
 = = Early and personal life = = 
 Mani Ratnam was born on 2 June 1955 , as the second child of a family that was closely associated with film production . His father S. Gopala Ratnam was a film distributor who worked for Venus Pictures , and his uncle " Venus " Krishnamurthy was a film producer . His elder brother G. Venkateswaran would go on to produce some of his films . His younger brother , G. Srinivasan , who like Venkateswaran would co @-@ produce some of his films . Mani Ratnam grew up in Madras ( now Chennai ) , along with his siblings and cousins in a joint @-@ family . Despite being a film family , the children were not allowed to watch films as the elders considered it a " taboo " . " As a youngster , films seemed like a waste of time " , he claimed in a 1994 interview ; however , he started watching films more actively when he was studying in the Besant Theosophical School , Adyar , Madras . During this time , he developed an admiration towards actors like Sivaji Ganesan and Nagesh , and watched all their films . By the time when he was 15 , he got to know about director K. Balachander , and became a fan of his . Upon completing his schooling , he graduated with a degree in commerce from the Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College , affiliated to the Madras University . Later , he did his Master of Business Administration in finance from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies , Mumbai . After finishing his post @-@ graduation in 1977 , he was employed in a firm in Madras as a management consultant , and continued to work there for sometime . 
 Mani is married to Suhasini , an established actress in South Indian cinema then . The two first met in 1988 and got married the same year . The couple have a son <unk> ( born 1992 ) . The family resides in <unk> , Chennai , where he runs his production company , Madras Talkies .

 Mani Ratnam was not satisfied with his job as a consultant as he found it to be a mere extension of his academics . During this time his friend Ravi Shankar , son of director B. R. Panthulu , was in the process of making his first film , in Kannada . Mani Ratnam had accompanied Ravi Shankar along with another friend called Raman , son of filmmaker S. Balachander , to complete the script of the film . Mani Ratnam took a sabbatical from his job in order to ensure his participation in the making of the film . Being inexperienced , the makers were largely dependent upon the American Cinematographer magazine . The principal cast included Vishnuvardhan , Srinath , <unk> , Lakshmi , and Roja Ramani . When the filming was about to begin in Kolar , Karnataka , Mani Ratnam left his consulting job and joined the crew . The film , however , did not take off and was eventually shelved . Nevertheless , he was firm in his idea of becoming a film @-@ maker . Although not pleased with the films made in Tamil cinema till then , he was " amazed " at P. Bharathiraja 's 16 Vayathinile ( 1977 ) , and J. Mahendran 's Mullum Malarum ( 1978 ) and Uthiripookkal ( 1979 ) . During this time , he befriended a group of people namely P. C. Sreeram , Santhana Bharathi , and P. Vasu , who shared common interests of entering into the film industry . 
 With a script in hand , Mani Ratnam had an idea to either get a producer for his film or to narrate the script to a " celebrated " film @-@ maker , so that he could get a chance to work along with them and get to know about the various aspects involved in film @-@ making . He chose three directors — Balachander , Bharathiraja , and Mahendran . As the attempts to meet and convince all the three proved to be unsuccessful , he decided to look out for a producer . In the process , he along with P. C. Sreeram — who would collaborate with him in most of his future projects — met around 20 people ; however , all the efforts turned out to be unsuccessful . 
 = = = Early years and struggle : 1983 – 1986 = = = 
 Mani Ratnam developed a script — originally written in English — into a film and named it Pallavi Anu Pallavi . His uncle Krishnamurthy agreed to produce the film but imposed a condition that it should be made under a limited budget in Kannada , to which he agreed . As a debutant , Mani Ratnam wanted to make sure that the technical aspects of the film are good . He persuaded Balu Mahendra to do the cinematography as he found the latter 's work to be very impressive . He managed to get other crew members B. Lenin ( for editing ) , Thotta Tharani ( for art direction ) and Ilaiyaraaja ( for music composer music ) , all leading craftsmen in their respective fields then . For the male lead , he cast Anil Kapoor after watching his performance in the Telugu film Vamsa <unk> ( 1980 ) . Lakshmi who was a leading actress then , was signed up as the female lead . The film explored the relationship between a young man and an older woman . Although an average grosser at the box @-@ office , the film fetched Mani Ratnam the Best Screenplay Award from the Karnataka State Government for the year 1983 . After watching Pallavi Anu Pallavi , N. G. John , a Malayalam film producer , offered him a chance to direct a film in Malayalam . Scripted by T. <unk> , <unk> was about the corruption in labour unions of Kerala . The film was completed with in two months and got released in April 1984 . Mani Ratnam attributed the failure of the film to the conflict of interests that he and the producer had . Following this , he entered Tamil cinema when G. Thyagarajan of Sathya Jyothi Films offered him a chance to direct Pagal Nilavu ( 1985 ) . The film had Murali and Revathi playing lead roles . It was different from his previous two films in a way that it included dance sequences and a " comedy track " . However , the film turned out to be another failure for him . The same year , he directed another Tamil film Idaya Kovil , a romantic drama . He remodeled a ready made script on the lines of Charlie Chaplin 's Limelight ( 1952 ) . Described by himself as an unsatisfied work , the film was a major box @-@ office success . The phase between 1983 and 1986 was the toughest of his career with only Pallavi <unk> being a <unk> film ; the rest three were done with a lot of " compromises " .

Although he was unsuccessful in early battles , the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam temporarily halted the Confederate invasion of the northern states . He was later removed from his post by President Abraham Lincoln , whom he unsuccessfully ran against in the 1864 presidential election . McClellan ran again for public office after the war , serving as the 24th Governor of New Jersey . 
 Shortly after McClellan 's death in 1885 , the Society of the Army of the Potomac , a fraternal organization consisting of Union veterans , began plans to erect a monument honoring the general . It wasn 't until March 3 , 1901 , that Congress appropriated $ 50 @,@ 000 for the erection of the statue of McClellan . The following month a statue commission , originally led by Secretary of War Elihu Root , Senator George P. Wetmore and General George D. Ruggles , was formed to oversee the project . An advisory committee , composed of sculptors Daniel Chester French and Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens , and architect Charles <unk> McKim , was also formed to provide recommendations to the commission . A resolution adopted at one of the first commission meetings stated : " That the monument of Gen. McClellan be an equestrian statue , and that this resolution be communicated by the secretary to any commission hereinafter appointed to execute the work . " 
 In 1902 , a design competition was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art with a bonus of $ 500 for each of the four sculptors who submitted the best models of the McClellan statue . Twenty @-@ three designs were submitted by May 1 , which was later narrowed down to four finalists : Austin Hays , Charles Henry Niehaus , Attilio Piccirilli and Thomas Waldo Story . The four sculptors were later asked to submit larger models for further review by the advisory committee . The model submitted by Story was favored by McClellan 's widow , Nelly . In 1903 , the committee rejected three of the designs , citing a lack of individuality and symbolism . The fourth design , by Niehaus , was reluctantly approved by the committee , though the commission rejected all of the designs stating " no model submitted upon the competition is satisfactory . " 
 In August 1903 , the commission chose Frederick William MacMonnies ( 1863 – 1937 ) , an American artist and sculptor who lived in Paris , to create the statue . MacMonnies was a graduate of the École des Beaux @-@ Arts who had apprenticed with Saint @-@ Gaudens for four years beginning at the age of seventeen . His previous works included a statue of Nathan Hale in New York City , Columbian Fountain at the World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and Bacchante and Infant Faun at the Boston Public Library . MacMonnies ' other well @-@ known Civil War work is the sculptural groupings on the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Arch in Brooklyn , New York . After his initial design was rejected due to costs overruns , he submitted a new design to the committee , which was later approved by the officials and Nelly McClellan . The accepted design reflected the influence of MacMonnies ' teacher in Paris , Alexandre <unk> , rather than Saint @-@ Gaudens . James <unk> was chosen to design the monument while the statue was founded by Edmond Gruet Jeune . The Society of the Army of the Potomac paid for the costs associated with improving the monument site . 
 The site chosen for the monument changed several times throughout the planning process . Suggested locations included the intersection of Florida Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue NW , Sheridan Circle ( current site of the General Philip Sheridan statue ) and the intersection of N Street and Connecticut Avenue NW ( current site of the Doctor John Witherspoon statue ) . In 1906 , residents of the Kalorama Triangle neighborhood , then called Washington Heights , represented by cartoonist Clifford K. Berryman and Rear Admiral Thomas Oliver Selfridge , Jr . , asked the statue commission to consider placing the monument in their neighborhood . The commission , then led by Secretary of War and future President William Howard Taft , Senator Wetmore and General Horatio Collins King , approved the suggested site at the intersection of Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road NW , describing it as a " more satisfactory and imposing " location . An additional factor that led to the site 's approval was that the area had been a Union camp during the summer of 1861 when McClellan arrived in Washington , D.C. 
 = = = Dedication = = = 
 The dedication of the monument was first planned for October 18 , 1906 , to coincide with the 37th annual reunion of the Society of the Army of the Potomac . A fire at MacMonnies ' polishing works prevented him from finishing the pedestal in time , so the dedication and reunion were rescheduled for the following May . During the delay , MacMonnies exhibited the statue at the 1906 Salon d 'Automne in Paris before shipping it to the United States . The reunion began on May 1 , 1907 , with opening events held at the Belasco Theater ( present site of the Howard T. Markey National Courts Building ) , Corcoran Gallery of Art and Thomas Jefferson Building . 
 The dedication took place on Thursday , May 2 , at 2 : 30 pm . Prior to the ceremony , around 700 veterans gathered at the intersection of 18th Street and Columbia Road NW , and marched down Columbia Road in a military parade to the dedication site . Veterans who were unable to march were seated in reviewing stands . The area surrounding the monument included a temporary stand and viewing boxes decorated with bunting , large flags , flowers and shields , while the statue was draped with two American flags . Prominent attendees at the ceremony included the main speaker , President Theodore Roosevelt , New York City mayor and McClellan 's son , George B. McClellan , Jr . , William Howard Taft , New Jersey governor Edward C. Stokes , Generals George Lewis Gillespie , Jr . , Frederick Dent Grant and Wallace F. Randolph , and Nelly McClellan . Additional attendees included members of Congress , foreign diplomats , members of the president 's cabinet and thousands of citizens . The event was led by Brigadier General Henry C. Dwight , president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac . 
 Following an invocation by Episcopal bishop Henry Y. Satterlee , a brief history of the statue was given by General Horatio Collins King . McClellan , Jr. then unveiled the statue to cheers and applause from the crowd . After the unveiling , the Fourth Battery of the Field Artillery saluted as " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " was played by the Marine Band . After a military parade consisting of thousands of troops led by General J. Franklin Bell passed the statue and the reviewing stands , the main speech by Roosevelt was given . Roosevelt 's remarks , which covered various topics including war , peace , national pride and family , included the following : " Modern statuary has added a new terror to death . But I wish on behalf of those who live in the capital of the nation to express my very profound acknowledgment to those who had the good taste to choose a great sculptor to do this work . I thank them for having erected here in so well a chosen site a statue which , not only because of the man it commemorates , but because of its intrinsic worth , adds to the nobility and beauty of the capital city of the country . " Following the president 's remarks , an overture from Semiramide , " On the Field of Glory " , was played . General Oliver O. Howard then spoke about his interactions with McClellan and General Grenville M. Dodge read a letter from General Daniel Sickles ( who was ill at the time ) that discussed his personal experiences with McClellan General Dwight 's speech included the statement : " Statues may crumble to dust . Veterans ' graves will be obliterated by time , but the grandest monument of the service of valor of the soldiers and sailors of the Civil War , the United States of America , the hope and joy of the world , consecrated to liberty by the blood and treasure of the nation , the undying testimonial of the patriotism of her people , will continue years and years . " The benediction was given by William R. <unk> , Episcopal archdeacon of Jersey City , followed by the band closing the ceremony with " My Country , ' Tis of Thee . "

 The statue is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington , D.C. that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) on September 20 , 1978 , and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3 , 1979 . It is also designated a contributing property to the Kalorama Triangle Historic District , listed on the NRHP on May 4 , 1987 . The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service ( NPS ) , a federal agency of the Interior Department . 
 In 2009 , the monument underwent a $ 114 @,@ 000 restoration by <unk> Conservation supervised by NPS architectural conservator Catherine Dewey . It was the first major conservation of the statue since its dedication in 1907 . Scaffolding and nylon mesh were installed around the monument for several months during the restoration , which included cleaning , painting and waxing the statue . Damage to the monument that was repaired during the process included removing spray paint from the base , removing water leakage inside the horse 's legs and stomach , and replicating a bronze shield that was missing from the pedestal .

 The monument is sited on a prominent location at the intersection of California Street , Columbia Road and Connecticut Avenue NW , on the southern edge of the Kalorama Triangle Historic District . The statue faces south down Connecticut Avenue toward Dupont Circle and downtown Washington , D.C. It is surrounded by a small public park . Adjacent landmarks include the Churchill Hotel to the west , Lothrop Mansion to the north and Washington Hilton to the east . 
 The bronze statue is 13 @.@ 6 feet ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) tall . It depicts McClellan dressed in his Union Army military uniform , including gauntlets , a hat , sash and sword , while riding a horse . He is holding the horse 's reins with the left hand while the right hand is placed on his hip . The granite pedestal , which measures 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) tall and 9 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 9 m ) long , rests on a base measuring 44 ft ( 13 m ) long and 30 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) wide . Near the top of the pedestal are eight shield @-@ shaped emblems noting Civil War battles McClellan led : Antietam , Fair Oaks , Gaines 's Mill , Malvern Hill , Mechanicsville , South Mountain , Williamsburg and Yorktown .

 = Chatteris = 
 Chatteris / <unk> / is a civil parish and one of four market towns in the Fenland district of Cambridgeshire , England , situated in The Fens between Huntingdon , March and Ely . The town is in the North East Cambridgeshire parliamentary constituency . 
 The parish of Chatteris is large , covering 6 @,@ 099 hectares , and for much of its history was a raised island in the low @-@ lying wetland of the Fens . Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 , the town has evidence of settlement from the Neolithic period . After several fires in the 18th and 19th centuries , the majority of the town 's housing dates from the late Victorian period onwards , with the tower of the parish church the only medieval building remaining . 
 Following the draining of the Fens , beginning in the 17th century and completed in the 19th century , the town 's economy has been based on agriculture and related industry . Due to its proximity to Cambridge , Huntingdon and Peterborough , the town has emerged as a commuter town . The town had a population of 10 @,@ 453 at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2011 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Toponymy and early history = = = 
 Chatteris 's name probably derives from the Celtic <unk> - <unk> meaning a wood and Rid , a ford , although it may also derive from " <unk> " , meaning hill fort , suggesting a similar site to the nearby <unk> Camp . The town was mentioned in the Domesday Book as " <unk> " and " <unk> " . 
 Archaeological evidence has been found of Neolithic , Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements in the area , and Chatteris possesses what has been interpreted as the only upstanding Neolithic boundaries in Fenland . Saxon evidence is less well preserved , although in 679 , <unk> , the chaplain to Æthelthryth of Ely built a hermitage on Honey Hill . More <unk> , Chatteris is reputed to have been the last refuge of Boudica as she fled from the Romans . 
 = = = Medieval period = = = 
 The miraculous story of the first known parishioner of the town , Bricstan , is documented in the Historia Ecclesiastica by the Chronicler Orderic Vitalis ( 1075 - <unk> ) . According to the legend , Bricstan was a pious free tenant from the town who had joined the monastery at Ely Cathedral in 1115 to begin training as a monk . However , he was accused of theft and imprisoned in London . The legend recounts that one night he had a vision of Saint Etheldreda coming towards him , and as if by a miracle , his heavy chains fell from him and he was shackled no longer . When he awoke from his dream , he discovered that this was indeed true and he was free of his chains . The wife of Henry I , Matilda of Scotland , heard of the miracle , and she assured herself that he was no rogue or thief , issued a writ of pardon and declared him a free man . 
 During the Medieval period , the town was dominated by Chatteris Abbey , a small Benedictine nunnery dedicated to St Mary , built in 980 by <unk> the niece of King Edgar and one of only eight nunneries mentioned in the Domesday Book . Throughout its existence , the abbey was comparatively poor compared to other foundations , due to a lack of royal patronage and a consequent lack of tithe estates . As a result , the abbey survived the first wave of closures during the Dissolution of the Monasteries , but was surrendered to the king 's commissioners in 1538 , by which time there were eleven nuns in residence . 
 At this date fourteen local families still used the abbey church as parochial but this , unusually , did not save it from demolition , the parishioners being transferred to nearby St Peter and St Paul 's Church in the area . It has been conjectured that due to the short space between them , the parish church may have been the abbey church , although Claire Breay 's Cartulary of Chatteris Abbey discounts this idea , citing that historical documentation clearly defines two separate churches . A range of the cloister buildings survived as part of a mansion known as Park House . This was demolished in 1847 and the site has now completely vanished beneath streets and housing , although the " Park Streets " of Chatteris mark the boundary of its walls and several buildings contain stone originating from the abbey . A large portion of the town was destroyed by a great fire in 1310 , which destroyed the nunnery and a large portion of the church , leaving only sections of the base of the tower . 
 = = = Early modern and contemporary = = = 
 Later fires in 1706 and 1864 destroyed most medieval and Georgian architecture , and a large proportion of the town 's listed buildings date from the Victorian period onwards . However , many of the pasture fields on the outskirts of the town have evidence of ridge and furrow farming practices , although these are under threat by current building proposals . 
 To the north of the town runs the Forty Foot Drain , a large river also called Vermuyden 's Drain , after the Dutch engineer whose name is associated with the fen drainage works of the middle of the 17th century . Several of the older buildings of the town show evidence of the Dutch architectural style . 
 Chatteris is a market town and has possessed this designation since 1834 , although an earlier market existed in the town , which was discontinued due to poor roads in 1808 . A small market is still held every Friday . Following the Beeching Axe , Chatteris railway station , formerly on the St. Ives extension of the Great Eastern Railway was closed in March 1967 . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The town is in the North East Cambridgeshire parliamentary constituency , with the incumbent MP being the Conservative Stephen Barclay . The constituency is now considered a safe Conservative seat , although the Liberal MP Clement Freud held the seat from 1973 to 1987 . The town is locally governed by Cambridgeshire County Council , Fenland District Council and Chatteris Town Council , each performing separate functions . 
 The town is historically part of the Isle of Ely , once under the secular jurisdiction of the Bishop of Ely , a power ended by the Liberty of Ely Act , 1837 . After various changes throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , following the recommendations of the Local Government Commission for England , on 1 April 1965 the bulk of the area was merged to form Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely , and since the Local Government Act 1972 , Chatteris has been part of the wider Cambridgeshire County Council . 
 Under the Police Act 1964 and local government reform in 1974 , the Isle of Ely Constabulary became part of the present Cambridgeshire Constabulary . A small police station is situated in East Park Street , but it is no longer open to the public . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Chatteris is situated between Huntingdon , St Ives , Peterborough , March and Ely , in the middle of The Fens — the lowest @-@ lying area in the United Kingdom — with most of the land surrounding the town being below sea level , although the highest point in the Fens ( 36 feet above sea level ) is within Chatteris 's parish boundaries . The peaty land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture , drained by numerous ditches and dykes , and there are two large drainage rivers near the town - the Forty Foot Drain , also known as Vermuyden 's Drain , and the Sixteen Foot Drain . 
 Chatteris is a key turning point on the <unk> road ( known as the Isle of Ely way ) and the starting point of the A142 road to Ely and Suffolk ( known as Ireton 's Way ) . The town also has important links to Cambridge and the A14 via the <unk> to Bar Hill . The town centre traffic was bypassed in 1986 , with the disused route of the former St Ives extension of the Great Eastern Railway being used to build the <unk> to March and <unk> . 
 There are no Met Office recording stations in the Fens , but an indication of rainfall and temperature of the county town Cambridge on the edge of the Fens shows that rainfall is below the national average , and in a wider study of East Anglia , the region had temperatures comparable with London , the warmest part of the UK .

 The parish church of St Peter & St Paul is situated in the centre of the town . A church has been on the site since at least 1162 , although the current tower dates from 1352 . The building had fallen into disrepair during the 19th century , and the majority of the building is the result of an intensive restoration in 1910 . This included restoring a pitched roof and adding new aisles , although the nave arches are original . In 1935 , a new two manual Harrison & Harrison organ was installed , a fine example of a pneumatic action instrument . Recent years have seen the construction of several new facilities , such as the Bricstan room extension . The church lists itself as being of the low church branch of the Church of England . The church also hosts the town 's Catholic congregation . 
 The Emmanuel Church in East Park Street was created through the union of the Methodist , United Reformed and Baptist Union churches in Chatteris in 1990 .
