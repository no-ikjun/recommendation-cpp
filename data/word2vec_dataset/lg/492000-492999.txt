 Often , once an antibody and antigen bind , they become an immune complex , which functions as a unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right , being countered by other antibodies . Similarly , <unk> are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves , but once they bind to proteins , the resulting complex or hapten @-@ carrier adduct is antigenic . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Antibodies can come in different varieties known as isotypes or classes . In placental mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA , IgD , IgE , IgG , and IgM . They are each named with an " Ig " prefix that stands for immunoglobulin , a name sometimes used interchangeably with antibody , and differ in their biological properties , functional locations and ability to deal with different antigens , as depicted in the table . The different suffixes of the antibody isotypes denote the different types of heavy chains the antibody contains , with each heavy chain class named alphabetically : α , γ , δ , ε , and μ . This gives rise to IgA , IgG , IgD , IgE , and IgM , respectively . 
 The antibody isotype of a B cell changes during cell development and activation . Immature B cells , which have never been exposed to an antigen , express only the IgM + isotype in a cell surface bound form . The B lymphocyte , in this ready @-@ to @-@ respond form , is known as a " naive B lymphocyte . " The naive B lymphocyte expresses both surface IgM + and IgD + . The co @-@ expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen . B cell activation follows engagement of the cell @-@ bound antibody molecule with an antigen , causing the cell to divide and differentiate into an antibody @-@ producing cell called a plasma cell . In this activated form , the B cell starts to produce antibody in a secreted form rather than a membrane @-@ bound form . Some daughter cells of the activated B cells undergo isotype switching , a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes , IgE , IgA , or IgG , that have defined roles in the immune system . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Antibodies are heavy ( ~ 150 kDa ) globular plasma proteins . They have sugar chains ( glycans ) added to conserved amino acid residues . In other words , antibodies are glycoproteins . The attached glycans are critically important to the structure and function of the antibody . Among other things the expressed glycans can modulate an antibody 's affinity for its corresponding FcR ( s ) . 
 The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) monomer ( containing only one Ig unit ) ; secreted antibodies can also be dimeric with two Ig units as with IgA , tetrameric with four Ig units like teleost fish IgM , or pentameric with five Ig units , like mammalian IgM . 
 The variable parts of an antibody are its V regions , and the constant part is its C region . 
 = = = Immunoglobulin domains = = = 
 The Ig monomer is a " Y " -shaped molecule that consists of four polypeptide chains ; two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains connected by disulfide bonds . Each chain is composed of structural domains called immunoglobulin domains . These domains contain about 70 – 110 amino acids and are classified into different categories ( for example , variable or <unk> , and constant or <unk> ) according to their size and function . They have a characteristic immunoglobulin fold in which two beta sheets create a " sandwich " shape , held together by interactions between conserved cysteines and other charged amino acids . 
 = = = Heavy chain = = = 
 There are five types of mammalian Ig heavy chain denoted by the Greek letters : α , δ , ε , γ , and μ . The type of heavy chain present defines the class of antibody ; these chains are found in IgA , IgD , IgE , IgG , and IgM antibodies , respectively . Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition ; α and γ contain approximately 450 amino acids , whereas μ and ε have approximately 550 amino acids . 
 Each heavy chain has two regions , the constant region and the variable region . The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype , but differs in antibodies of different isotypes . Heavy chains γ , α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem ( in a line ) Ig domains , and a hinge region for added flexibility ; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains . The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells , but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone . The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain . 
 = = = Light chain = = = 
 In mammals there are two types of immunoglobulin light chain , which are called lambda ( λ ) and kappa ( κ ) . A light chain has two successive domains : one constant domain and one variable domain . The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids . Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical ; only one type of light chain , κ or λ , is present per antibody in mammals . Other types of light chains , such as the iota ( ι ) chain , are found in other vertebrates like sharks ( Chondrichthyes ) and bony fishes ( Teleostei ) . 
 = = = CDRs , Fv , Fab and Fc regions = = = 
 Some parts of an antibody have the same functions . The arms of the Y , for example , contain the sites that can bind to antigens ( in general , identical ) and , therefore , recognize specific foreign objects . This region of the antibody is called the Fab ( fragment , antigen @-@ binding ) region . It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody . The paratope is shaped at the amino terminal end of the antibody monomer by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains . The variable domain is also referred to as the FV region and is the most important region for binding to antigens . To be specific , variable loops of β @-@ strands , three each on the light ( VL ) and heavy ( VH ) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen . These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions ( CDRs ) . The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by <unk> et al. and more recently by North et al. and <unk> et al . In the framework of the immune network theory , CDRs are also called idiotypes . According to immune network theory , the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes . 
 The base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity . This region is called the Fc ( Fragment , <unk> ) region , and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody . Thus , the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen , by binding to a specific class of Fc receptors , and other immune molecules , such as complement proteins . By doing this , it mediates different physiological effects including recognition of <unk> particles ( binding to FcγR ) , lysis of cells ( binding to complement ) , and degranulation of mast cells , basophils , and eosinophils ( binding to <unk> ) . 
 In summary , the Fab region of the antibody determines antigen specificity while the Fc region of the antibody determines the antibody 's class effect . Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody , the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects . Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha , gamma , delta , epsilon , and mu , and they define the antibody 's isotypes IgA , G , D , E , and M , respectively . This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors . Possible class effects of antibodies include : <unk> , agglutination , haemolysis , complement activation , mast cell degranulation , and neutralisation ( though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region ) . It also implies that Fab @-@ mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins , whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules ( see below ) . 
 = = Function = = 
 The main categories of antibody action include the following : 
 <unk> , in which neutralizing antibodies block parts of the surface of a bacterial cell or virion to render its attack ineffective 
 Agglutination , in which antibodies " glue together " foreign cells into clumps that are attractive targets for phagocytosis 
 Precipitation , in which antibodies " glue together " serum @-@ soluble antigens , forcing them to precipitate out of solution in clumps that are attractive targets for phagocytosis 
 Complement activation ( fixation ) , in which antibodies that are latched onto a foreign cell encourage complement to attack it with a membrane attack complex , which leads to the following : 
 Lysis of the foreign cell 
 Encouragement of inflammation by <unk> attracting inflammatory cells 
 Activated B cells differentiate into either antibody @-@ producing cells called plasma cells that secrete soluble antibody or memory cells that survive in the body for years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures . 
 At the prenatal and neonatal stages of life , the presence of antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother . Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies , and usually appear within the first years of life . Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream , they are said to be part of the humoral immune system . Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen ( an example is a virus capsid protein fragment ) . Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways : They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them ; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen ; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway . Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens ( helminths , allergens ) . 
 = = = Activation of complement = = = 
 Antibodies that bind to surface antigens ( for example , on bacteria ) will attract the first component of the complement cascade with their Fc region and initiate activation of the " classical " complement system . This results in the killing of bacteria in two ways . First , the binding of the antibody and complement molecules marks the microbe for ingestion by phagocytes in a process called opsonization ; these phagocytes are attracted by certain complement molecules generated in the complement cascade . Second , some complement system components form a membrane attack complex to assist antibodies to kill the bacterium directly ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Activation of effector cells = = = 
 To combat pathogens that replicate outside cells , antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together , causing them to agglutinate . Since an antibody has at least two paratopes , it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens . By coating the pathogen , antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region . 
 Those cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors , which , as the name suggests , interact with the Fc region of IgA , IgG , and IgE antibodies . The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell ; phagocytes will phagocytose , mast cells and neutrophils will <unk> , natural killer cells will release cytokines and cytotoxic molecules ; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe . The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as antibody @-@ dependent cell @-@ mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) – this process may explain the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies used in biological therapies against cancer . The Fc receptors are isotype @-@ specific , which gives greater flexibility to the immune system , invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens . 
 = = = Natural antibodies = = = 
 Humans and higher primates also produce " natural antibodies " that are present in serum before viral infection . Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection , vaccination , other foreign antigen exposure or passive immunization . These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated . Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide galactose α ( 1 @,@ 3 ) <unk> ( α @-@ Gal ) , which is found as a terminal sugar on glycosylated cell surface proteins , and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut . Rejection of <unk> organs is thought to be , in part , the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α @-@ Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue . 
 = = Immunoglobulin diversity = = 
 Virtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response . Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies ; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens . It has been estimated that humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies , each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen . Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual , the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited by the size of the human genome . Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes . 
 = = = Domain variability = = = 
 The chromosomal region that encodes an antibody is large and contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody — the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes ( IGH @ ) is found on chromosome 14 , and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes ( IGL @ and <unk> @ ) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans . One of these domains is called the variable domain , which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody , but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells . Differences , between the variable domains , are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions ( HV @-@ 1 , HV @-@ 2 and HV @-@ 3 ) or complementarity determining regions ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) . CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions . The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs . Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability . This combination is called V ( D ) J recombination discussed below . 
 = = = V ( D ) J recombination = = = 
 Somatic recombination of immunoglobulins , also known as V ( D ) J recombination , involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region . The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces — known as gene segments ( subgenes ) . These segments are called variable ( V ) , diversity ( D ) and joining ( J ) segments . V , D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains , but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains . Multiple copies of the V , D and J gene segments exist , and are <unk> arranged in the genomes of mammals . In the bone marrow , each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V , one D and one J gene segment ( or one V and one J segment in the light chain ) . As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment , and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region , this process generates a huge number of antibodies , each with different paratopes , and thus different antigen specificities . Interestingly , the rearrangement of several subgenes ( i.e. V2 family ) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR @-@ 650 , which further influences biology of B @-@ cells . 
 RAG proteins play an important role with V ( D ) J recombination in cutting DNA at a particular region . Without the presence of these proteins , V ( D ) J recombination would not occur . 
 After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V ( D ) J recombination , it cannot express any other variable region ( a process known as allelic exclusion ) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain . 
 = = = Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation = = = 
 Following activation with antigen , B cells begin to proliferate rapidly . In these rapidly dividing cells , the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of point mutation , by a process called somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) . SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene , per cell division . As a consequence , any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains . 
 This serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody 's antigen @-@ binding affinity . Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction ( low affinity ) with their antigen than the original antibody , and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction ( high affinity ) . B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells , whereas those with low affinity antibodies will not , and will die by apoptosis . Thus , B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival . The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called affinity maturation . Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V ( D ) J recombination , and is dependent on help from helper T cells . 
 = = = Class switching = = = 
 <unk> or class switching is a biological process occurring after activation of the B cell , which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody ( IgA , IgE , or IgG ) . The different classes of antibody , and thus effector functions , are defined by the constant ( C ) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain . Initially , naive B cells express only cell @-@ surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions . Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function ; therefore , after activation , an antibody with an IgG , IgA , or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen . Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes . Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching ; the variable regions , and therefore antigen specificity , remain unchanged . Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies , all specific for the same antigen , but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge . Class switching is triggered by cytokines ; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment . 
 Class switching occurs in the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination ( CSR ) . This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs , called switch ( S ) regions , found in DNA upstream of each constant region gene ( except in the δ @-@ chain ) . The DNA strand is broken by the activity of a series of enzymes at two selected S @-@ regions . The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non @-@ homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) to the desired constant region ( γ , α or ε ) . This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype . 
 = = = Affinity designations = = = 
 A group of antibodies can be called monovalent ( or specific ) if they have affinity for the same epitope , or for the same antigen ( but potentially different epitopes on the molecule ) , or for the same strain of microorganism ( but potentially different antigens on or in it ) . In contrast , a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent ( or unspecific ) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms . Intravenous immunoglobulin , if not otherwise noted , consists of polyvalent IgG . In contrast , monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope . 
 = = = Asymmetrical antibodies = = = 
 Heterodimeric antibodies , which are also asymmetrical and antibodies , allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms . One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “ knobs @-@ into @-@ holes ” format . This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies . The “ knobs ” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one . It fits into the “ hole ” , which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one . What connects the “ knobs ” to the “ holes ” are the disulfide bonds between each chain . The “ knobs @-@ into @-@ holes ” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity . Single chain variable fragments ( scFv ) are connected to the variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide . The linker is rich in glycine , which gives it more flexibility , and serine / threonine , which gives it specificity . Two different scFv fragments can be connected together , via a hinge region , to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain . This gives the antibody <unk> , allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens . The “ knobs @-@ into @-@ holes ” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn ’ t suppress homodimer formation . 
 To further improve the function of heterodimeric antibodies , many scientists are looking towards artificial constructs . Artificial antibodies are largely diverse protein motifs that use the functional strategy of the antibody molecule , but aren ’ t limited by the loop and framework structural constraints of the natural antibody . Being able to control the combinational design of the sequence and three @-@ dimensional space could transcend the natural design and allow for the attachment of different combinations of drugs to the arms . 
 Heterodimeric antibodies have a greater range in shapes they can take and the drugs that are attached to the arms don ’ t have to be the same on each arm , allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment . Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional <unk> , and even <unk> , antibodies . The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality . 
 = = Medical applications = = 
 = = = Disease diagnosis = = = 
 Detection of particular antibodies is a very common form of medical diagnostics , and applications such as serology depend on these methods . For example , in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis , a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein @-@ Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood . If those antibodies are not present , either the person is not infected or the infection occurred a very long time ago , and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed . 
 In clinical immunology , levels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by <unk> ( or <unk> ) to characterize the antibody profile of patient . Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear . For example , elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis , elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis , while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis , autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis . 
 Autoimmune disorders can often be traced to antibodies that bind the body 's own epitopes ; many can be detected through blood tests . Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test . The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women . 
 Practically , several <unk> methods based on detection of complex antigen @-@ antibody are used to diagnose infectious diseases , for example ELISA , immunofluorescence , Western blot , immunodiffusion , <unk> , and magnetic immunoassay . Antibodies raised against human chorionic gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests . 
 = = = Disease therapy = = = 
 Targeted monoclonal antibody therapy is employed to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , psoriasis , and many forms of cancer including non @-@ Hodgkin 's lymphoma , colorectal cancer , head and neck cancer and breast cancer . 
 Some immune deficiencies , such as X @-@ linked <unk> and hypogammaglobulinemia , result in partial or complete lack of antibodies . These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of immunity called passive immunity . Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready @-@ made antibodies in the form of human or animal serum , pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies , into the affected individual . 
 = = = Prenatal therapy = = = 
 Rhesus factor , also known as Rhesus D ( RhD ) antigen , is an antigen found on red blood cells ; individuals that are Rhesus @-@ positive ( Rh + ) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rhesus @-@ negative ( Rh – ) do not . During normal childbirth , delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy , blood from a fetus can enter the mother 's system . In the case of an Rh @-@ incompatible mother and child , consequential blood mixing may <unk> an <unk> mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh + child , putting the remainder of the pregnancy , and any subsequent pregnancies , at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn . 
 Rho ( D ) immune globulin antibodies are specific for human Rhesus D ( RhD ) antigen . Anti @-@ RhD antibodies are administered as part of a prenatal treatment regimen to prevent sensitization that may occur when a Rhesus @-@ negative mother has a Rhesus @-@ positive fetus . Treatment of a mother with Anti @-@ RhD antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and delivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother 's system from the fetus . It is important to note that this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to " remember " Rh antigen by generating memory B cells . Therefore , her humoral immune system will not make anti @-@ Rh antibodies , and will not attack the Rhesus antigens of the current or subsequent babies . Rho ( D ) Immune <unk> treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to Rh disease , but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself . 
 = = Research applications = = 
 Specific antibodies are produced by injecting an antigen into a mammal , such as a mouse , rat , rabbit , goat , sheep , or horse for large quantities of antibody . Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies — multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen — in the serum , which can now be called antiserum . Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in egg yolk . To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen , antibody @-@ secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line . The fused cells are called <unk> , and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture . Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody ; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies . Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A / G or antigen @-@ affinity chromatography . 
 In research , purified antibodies are used in many applications . Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers , or through use of a specialist search engine . Research antibodies are most commonly used to identify and locate intracellular and extracellular proteins . Antibodies are used in flow cytometry to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express ; different types of cell express different combinations of cluster of differentiation molecules on their surface , and produce different intracellular and <unk> proteins . They are also used in immunoprecipitation to separate proteins and anything bound to them ( co @-@ immunoprecipitation ) from other molecules in a cell lysate , in Western blot analyses to identify proteins separated by electrophoresis , and in immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells with the assistance of a microscope . Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies , using ELISA and <unk> techniques . 
 Researchers using antibodies in their work need to record them correctly in order to allow their research to be reproducible ( and therefore tested , and qualified by other researchers ) . Less than half of research antibodies referenced in academic papers can be easily identified . A paper published in <unk> in 2014 provided researchers with a guide for reporting research antibody use .

 The importance of antibodies in health care and the biotechnology industry demands knowledge of their structures at high resolution . This information is used for protein engineering , modifying the antigen binding affinity , and identifying an epitope , of a given antibody . X @-@ ray crystallography is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures . However , crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time @-@ consuming . Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography , but their results are more equivocal , since they do not produce empirical structures . Online web servers such as Web Antibody Modeling ( WAM ) and Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure ( PIGS ) enables computational modeling of antibody variable regions . Rosetta Antibody is a novel antibody FV region structure prediction server , which incorporates sophisticated techniques to minimize CDR loops and optimize the relative orientation of the light and heavy chains , as well as homology models that predict successful docking of antibodies with their unique antigen . 
 The ability to describe the antibody through binding affinity to the antigen is supplemented by information on antibody structure and amino acid sequences for the purpose of patent claims . 
 = = History = = 
 The first use of the term " antibody " occurred in a text by Paul Ehrlich . The term Antikörper ( the German word for antibody ) appears in the conclusion of his article " Experimental Studies on Immunity " , published in October 1891 , which states that , " if two substances give rise to two different <unk> , then they themselves must be different " . However , the term was not accepted immediately and several other terms for antibody were proposed ; these included Immunkörper , <unk> , <unk> , substance <unk> , copula , Desmon , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The word antibody has formal analogy to the word antitoxin and a similar concept to Immunkörper ( immune body in English ) . As such , the original construction of the word contains a logical flaw ; the antitoxin is something directed against a toxin , while the antibody is a body directed against something . 
 The study of antibodies began in 1890 when Kitasato Shibasaburō described antibody activity against diphtheria and tetanus toxins . Kitasato put forward the theory of humoral immunity , proposing that a mediator in serum could react with a foreign antigen . His idea prompted Paul Ehrlich to propose the side @-@ chain theory for antibody and antigen interaction in 1897 , when he hypothesized that receptors ( described as " side @-@ chains " ) on the surface of cells could bind specifically to toxins – in a " lock @-@ and @-@ key " interaction – and that this binding reaction is the trigger for the production of antibodies . Other researchers believed that antibodies existed freely in the blood and , in 1904 , Almroth Wright suggested that soluble antibodies coated bacteria to label them for phagocytosis and killing ; a process that he named <unk> . 
 In the 1920s , Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery observed that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies and went on to show that antibodies are made of protein . The biochemical properties of antigen @-@ antibody @-@ binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack . The next major advance was in the 1940s , when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock @-@ and @-@ key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition . In 1948 , Astrid <unk> discovered that B cells , in the form of plasma cells , were responsible for generating antibodies . 
 Further work concentrated on characterizing the structures of the antibody proteins . A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by Gerald Edelman and Joseph Gally of the antibody light chain , and their realization that this protein is the same as the Bence @-@ Jones protein described in 1845 by Henry Bence Jones . Edelman went on to discover that antibodies are composed of disulfide bond @-@ linked heavy and light chains . Around the same time , antibody @-@ binding ( Fab ) and antibody tail ( Fc ) regions of IgG were characterized by Rodney Porter . Together , these scientists deduced the structure and complete amino acid sequence of IgG , a feat for which they were jointly awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . The Fv fragment was prepared and characterized by David <unk> . While most of these early studies focused on IgM and IgG , other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the 1960s : Thomas Tomasi discovered secretory antibody ( IgA ) ; David S. Rowe and John L. Fahey discovered IgD ; and <unk> Ishizaka and <unk> Ishizaka discovered IgE and showed it was a class of antibodies involved in allergic reactions . In a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976 , Susumu Tonegawa showed that genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies . 
 = = Antibody mimetic = = 
 Antibody mimetics are organic compounds that , like antibodies , can specifically bind antigens . They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa . Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics , but not artificial antibodies , antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these . Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility , tissue penetration , stability towards heat and enzymes , and comparatively low production costs . Antibody mimetics such as the <unk> and the <unk> have being developed and commercialised as research , diagnostic and therapeutic agents .

 The Charodeika class was a pair of monitors built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1860s . They were designed by the British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell and built in Saint Petersburg . Both ships were assigned to the Baltic Fleet and had fairly uneventful careers mostly assigned to training units . Rusalka struck a rock in 1869 and had to be run aground lest she sink . They were reclassified as coast @-@ defense ironclads in 1892 and Rusalka sank during a storm in the Gulf of Finland the next year with the loss of all hands . Her sister ship Charodeika continued in service until 1907 and was eventually scrapped in 1911 – 12 . Rusalka 's wreck was discovered in 2003 by an expedition sponsored by the Estonian Maritime Museum . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 By late 1863 , the Russian Admiralty Board had begun planning for the second generation of ironclads to succeed those ships then under construction and issued a requirement on 12 November for a twin @-@ screw low @-@ freeboard ship that could sail throughout the Baltic Sea . It was to be armed with 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) smoothbore Dahlgren guns and protected by up to 6 in ( 152 mm ) of armor . Before even deciding which designs to accept , the Admiralty decided to order eight ships of various types in March 1864 . Charles Mitchell was allocated only one of the eight ships before he submitted four different designs for the competition in May – June . Two ships of his simplest design were awarded to a new builder , S. G. Kudriavtsev , who was provided facilities at the state @-@ owned <unk> Island Shipyard . In addition the Admiralty committed itself to furnishing the armament , armor , engines and boilers as well as a variety of smaller components for the two ships . 
 The Charodeika @-@ class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessor , Smerch , and were 206 feet ( 62 @.@ 8 m ) long at the waterline . They had a beam of 42 feet ( 12 @.@ 8 m ) and a maximum draft of 12 feet 7 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . The ships were designed to displace 1 @,@ 882 long tons ( 1 @,@ 912 t ) , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced 2 @,@ 100 long tons ( 2 @,@ 100 t ) . They were fitted with a plough @-@ shaped ram that projected four feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) forward of the bow . The <unk> were fitted with a double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by watertight bulkheads into 25 compartments . Their crew numbered 13 officers and 171 crewmen in 1877 . 
 The ships had a freeboard of only two feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) and their decks were often awash in any sort of moderate sea . They rolled heavily and were very unmaneuverable , often not responding to the ship 's wheel until 20 degrees of rudder was applied . The monitors were fitted with three iron pole masts , probably fore @-@ and @-@ aft rigged , and used to steady the ship rather than for propulsion . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Charodeika class had two simple horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engines , built by the Baird Works of Saint Petersburg . The engines had a bore of 38 inches ( 0 @.@ 97 m ) and a stroke of 18 inches ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) and each drove a single four @-@ bladed 8 @-@ foot @-@ 6 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 59 m ) propeller . Steam was provided by two rectangular boilers at a pressure of 1 @.@ 6 atm ( 162 kPa ; 24 psi ) . The engines were designed to produce a total of 875 indicated horsepower ( 652 kW ) , but only produced 705 – 786 ihp ( 526 – 586 kW ) which gave the ships speeds between 8 @.@ 5 – 9 knots ( 15 @.@ 7 – 16 @.@ 7 km / h ; 9 @.@ 8 – 10 @.@ 4 mph ) when they ran their sea trials in 1869 . The monitors also had a donkey boiler for the small steam engine that powered the ventilation fans and pumps . The Charodeika class carried a maximum of 250 long tons ( 254 t ) ; their range , however , is unknown . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The monitors were designed to be armed with four Obukhov 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) rifled guns , a pair in each Coles @-@ type turret . Various deckhouses and ventilation hatches prevented the turrets from firing directly forward or aft , so that each turret could bear approximately 150 ° to each side . Difficulties in manufacturing the guns and the delayed construction of the monitors themselves forced the Admiralty to change the armament to a pair of the 9 @-@ inch guns in the forward turret and a pair of 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading Rodman guns in the aft turret . These guns were replaced by another pair of 9 @-@ inch rifled guns beginning in 1871 . They were replaced in their turn in 1878 – 79 by two longer , more powerful 9 @-@ inch Obukhov guns . The ship carried 75 rounds for each gun . 
 Light guns for use against torpedo boats are not known to have been fitted aboard the Charodeika @-@ class ships before the 1870s when a variety of guns were added , although their numbers , calibers , and locations are only partially known . Charodeika received four 4 @-@ pounder 3 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 86 mm ) guns , two mounted on the roofs of each gun turret while Rusalka had a total of three guns with only one gun on her aft turret . Other guns known have been fitted included 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) Engström quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) QF Hotchkiss guns , 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) QF Hotchkiss five @-@ barreled revolving cannon , and 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) Nordenfelt guns . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The Charodeika @-@ class monitors had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick amidships and thinned to 3 @.@ 25 inches ( 83 mm ) aft and 3 @.@ 75 inches ( 95 mm ) forward . It was 7 feet 6 inches ( 2 m ) high and completely covered the hull to 5 feet 6 inches ( 2 m ) below the waterline . The armor was backed by 12 to 18 inches ( 305 to 457 mm ) of teak . The turrets had 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 140 mm ) of armor , also backed by teak , and the conning tower was 4 @.@ 5 inches thick . Amidships , the deck was 1 inch thick , although it thinned to 0 @.@ 25 – 0 @.@ 5 inches ( 6 – 13 mm ) at the ends of the ship .

 The monitors were intended to be delivered by 27 May 1867 , but construction was held up by delays in delivery of the blueprints , armor , changes made while under construction and the untimely death of Kudriavtsev in August 1865 . The contract was transferred to Mitchell who completed them in 1869 , two years after their scheduled delivery date for the cost of 762 @,@ 000 roubles each . Both ships spent their entire careers with the Baltic Fleet . In June , Charodeika ripped a 28 @-@ foot ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) long hole in her hull when she struck an uncharted rock in the Gulf of Finland and had to be deliberately run aground to prevent her sinking . She was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment of the Baltic Fleet in March 1870 and Charodeika was later assigned to the Mine ( Torpedo ) Training Detachment . 
 Both monitors were reclassified as coast @-@ defense ironclads on 13 February 1892 and Rusalka sank in a storm on 7 September 1893 during a voyage between Reval ( Tallinn ) and Helsingfors ( Helsinki ) with the loss of her entire crew of 177 officers and enlisted men . Despite an extensive search , the only traces of her found were one body and some debris that washed ashore . Charodeika remained in service until 31 March 1907 when she was turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal . The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 7 April and was finally scrapped in 1911 – 12 . 
 Rusalka 's wreck was discovered on 22 July 2003 in the Gulf of Finland , 25 kilometers ( 13 nmi ) south of Helsinki , by a joint expedition of the Estonian Maritime Museum and the commercial diving company <unk> <unk> . The wreck is generally intact although draped with snagged fishing nets . The aft turret , however , has fallen out of the ship .

The song received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics and was released to United States radio on April 1 , 2002 . 
 While it did not perform well on the Billboard charts in the United States , " Overprotected " peaked at number 22 in Canada , while reaching the top five in Italy , Romania , Sweden and United Kingdom . An accompanying music video , directed by Billie Woodruff , portrays Spears dancing inside an abandoned factory , while singing about being overprotected ; the music video for " The Darkchild Remix " , directed by Chris Applebaum , portrays Spears dancing and having fun with her friends . Spears has performed " Overprotected " a number of times including at the Dream Within a Dream Tour ( 2001 ) and The Onyx Hotel Tour ( 2004 ) . In 2003 , the song received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance . The song was also featured in the animated film Hotel Transylvania .

 During the Oops ! ... I Did It Again Tour ( 2000 ) , Spears revealed she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay @-@ Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound . In February 2001 , Spears signed a $ 7 – 8 million promotional deal with Pepsi , and released another book co @-@ written with her mother , entitled A Mother 's Gift . On the same month , Spears started to record material for her third studio album , with " Overprotected " being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm , Sweden . Additional recording was done in April 2001 at Maratone in Sweden , in which the song 's vocals were completed . Background vocals were provided by Spears and <unk> , with the track being mixed by Martin and Rami at Maratone Studios . Her third studio album , Britney , was released in November 2001 . In an interview with the Daily Record , Spears concluded she can relate to " Overprotected " " on a personal basis , because I feel kind of overprotected . When I want to go out , everything has to be organized in advance . I think that other kids of my age can relate to it to a certain extent . "

 " <unk> " is a teen pop and dance @-@ pop song that lasts for three minutes and 18 seconds . David Browne of Entertainment Weekly noticed Europop influences on the song , while other critics compared it to previous songs released by Spears . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group , " Overprotected " is composed in the key of C minor and is set in time signature of common time , with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute . Spears vocal range spans from A ♭ 3 to C5 . 
 Lyrically , the track is about a girl who is tired of being manipulated by people around her and doesn 't need to be told what to do , which is perceived in lines such as " You 're gonna have to see through my perspective / I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am / And I don 't want to be so damn protected " . Dana Alice Heller , author of Makeover television : realities remodelled ( 2007 ) , said that , with " Overprotected " , " Spears addresses the problem of being a teen star whose personal and professional are handled by others . " She also compared " Overprotected " with the singer 's first reality show , Britney & Kevin : Chaotic ( 2005 ) , saying that " Britney frames her makeover as a move toward to independence , a rebellion against overly controlling parents and their stand @-@ ins . "

 After being hired by Jive Records to create a remix for " <unk> " , Rodney Jerkins revealed that the label " needed a remix that 's crazy . " Jerkins said the remix has " an old @-@ school @-@ type rhythm , which I think is kinda cool because it 's an element [ that Spears ] never had , but I still gave it her edge . I was up all night rocking that joint . [ It has the ] same lyrics , I just reproduced the track . " " The Darkchild Remix " was initially being sent to radio stations in the United States in mid @-@ March 2002 and then became the opening track of the compilation album Now That 's What I Call Music ! 10 later that year ; however , it was only released on April 1 , 2002 . The remix was heavily played in dance clubs , and Jerkins said he wasn 't surprised with the popularity of it , since " [ Britney ] reinvented herself . Everybody thought she was gonna come back with another ' Oops ! ... I Did It Again ' , but she went left and came with the ' I 'm a Slave 4 U ' joint , which is basically a club banger . You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves . I always said she was gonna be one of the people that 's gonna be around for a minute , because I see that in her . " Finnish musician and record producer Jaakko <unk> also created two remixes for the track , titled " JS16 Dub " and " JS16 Remix " . The latter was included on the promotional soundtrack of Spears ' debut movie , Crossroads ( 2002 ) .

 " Overprotected " received generally positive reviews from music critics . Jocelyn Vena of MTV said that " with songs like " Overprotected " and " Let Me Be , " Spears seemed to be letting out her adolescent angst , " while Kyle Anderson of MTV Newsroom said , " the real first blush with emancipation from [ the singer ] teen pop past came with [ ' Overprotected ' ] " . While reviewing Spears ' third studio album Britney ( 2001 ) , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the track , along with " I 'm Not a Girl , Not Yet a Woman " and " What It 's Like to Be Me " , " are pivotal moments on Britney Spears ' third album , the record where she strives to deepen her persona ( not the same thing as her character , of course ) , making it more adult while still recognizably Britney " . 
 Critic Robert Christgau also considered " Overprotected " and " Cinderella " as the highlights of Britney , while saying , " hardly the first not @-@ terribly @-@ bright teenager to approach self @-@ knowledge via the words of others " . Nikki Tranker of PopMatters said the song " is an absolute belter reminiscent of Britney ’ s previous big @-@ bang singles , ' Oops ! I Did It Again ' and ' You Drive Me Crazy ' [ sic ] " , while commenting that Spears " sings about ridding herself of the girlie chains around her , gripes about her need for space in the whirlwind that is her life , and lets us know she don ’ t need nobody telling her what to do . " In 2003 , the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance .

 The music video for " The Darkchild Remix " was directed by Chris Applebaum and filmed in the first weekend of March 2002 in Los Angeles , California . It was produced under A Band Apart Productions , while the choreography for this version was also created by Brian Friedman . The full shooting took 23 hours , and Applebaum was said to be impressed with Spears ' " stamina and patience through the marathon shoot , which wrapped 5 a.m. " According to Joe D 'Angelo of MTV , " the clip furthers her ' I 'm Not a Girl , Not Yet a Woman ' crusade to shirk her adolescent image , as she and five friends outsmart her bodyguard with the old ' you 're wanted elsewhere ' trick and sneak out of a hotel and into an underground dance club . " It was released on March 26 , 2002 . 
 Spears directly referenced Janet Jackson 's " Son of a Gun ( I Betcha Think This Song Is About You ) " music video in the " Overprotected ( Darkchild Remix ) " video during the elevator scenes and scenes of her and her dancers walking down the hotel lobby . Both videos also use the same hotel setting , filmed at Los Angeles ' Millennium Biltmore Hotel . Spears also references and draws inspiration from Janet Jackson in several other music videos , including " Stronger " , " Circus " , and " Womanizer " , which she mentioned in her " For the Record " documentary . 
 The video opens with Spears and her friends in a hotel room , where a tabloid reporter on television criticizes her for the sexy , revealing outfits she 's often seen wearing publicly . Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report . Spears , determined to be self @-@ sufficient and unaffected by media comments , then makes a phone call to her bodyguard , and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice , coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day . They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby . A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows . As they leave the hotel , they follow towards the dance club . However , before they arrive , they 're caught in an alley by several paparazzi , and start to perform a dance routine in the middle of the rain . As they make their entrance , they 're dripping wet , an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter .

 " Overprotected " was performed for the first time on 2001 's Dream Within a Dream Tour . During the performance , Spears was dancing to the song surrounded by laser lights . The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears , with her hair growing as the song went along . However , the backdrop was later removed for unknown reasons . After the announcement of the 2002 extension of the tour , some changes were made to the setlist , replacing the original mix of the song by " The Darkchild Remix " . The remix was later performed on The Onyx Hotel Tour ( 2004 ) , during the opening act , right after the performance of " Toxic " ( 2003 ) .

 = Clevedon Court = 
 Clevedon Court is a manor house on Court Hill in Clevedon , North Somerset , England , dating from the early 14th century . It is now owned by the National Trust . It is designated as a Grade I listed building . 
 The house was built and added to over many years . The great hall and chapel block are the earliest surviving parts of the structure with the west wing being added around 1570 , when the windows and decoration of the rest of the building were changed . Further construction and adaptation was undertaken in the 18th century when it was owned by the Elton baronets . The house was acquired by the nation and was given to the National Trust in part @-@ payment for death duties in 1960 . The Elton family is still resident in the house , which is now open to the public . 
 In addition to the main house , the grounds include a selection of walls and outbuildings , some of which date back to the 13th century . The gardens are listed ( Grade II * ) on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens . 
 = = History = = 
 Much of the present house was built in the early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon . There is speculation that it may lie on the site of a Roman building , based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961 / 62 . The house incorporates remnants of a 13th @-@ century building which lie at an angle to the rest of the house . It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew , which stands on the coast . 
 After the Norman Conquest of 1066 , the manor of Clevedon was granted by the King to Matthew de <unk> , who in turn granted it to his sub @-@ tenant , Hildebert . It is thought that Sir John was a descendant of either Matthew or Hildebert . Perhaps because of the distance to the parish church , the manor house included a chapel dedicated , in the 1320s , to Saint Peter . The house has undergone considerable change since it was built , almost every century seeing structural alterations , but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house . 
 The de Clevedon family line ended in 1376 , and the manor eventually passed , by marriage , to the Northamptonshire family of Wake , who were Lords of the Manor until 1630 . John Wake made major additions to the house in the late 16th century , including a new west wing . The manor was sold by Sir John Wake to Sir John Digby in 1630 . Digby 's estates were confiscated during the English Civil War , but were recovered after the Restoration by his heir . In 1709 the house was bought by Abraham Elton , a merchant from Bristol . 
 The Eltons were a prominent Bristol family , and Abraham 1st was Sheriff of Bristol in 1702 , a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers becoming Master in 1708 , Mayor of Bristol in 1710 , and High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1716 . He became a member of parliament for the five years preceding his death in 1728 . He was created a baronet in 1717 as the first of the Elton baronets . The family wealth originally came from copper and brass ( including mining in the Mendip Hills ) and other commerce , and property . His descendants , not only at Clevedon , also profited from the slave trade . 
 Sir Abraham Elton was succeeded by four further Sir Abraham Eltons . Sir Abraham Elton , 2nd Baronet , and his son Sir Abraham Elton , 3rd Baronet , were also Sheriff and Mayor of Bristol in their time , and the second Baronet was also MP for Taunton 1722 – 1727 , succeeding to his father 's seat of Bristol in 1727 until his own death in 1742 , despite being nearly ruined in the South Seas Bubble crisis . The third Baronet died bankrupt , and the estate ( which had been entailed to protect it from his creditors ) passed in 1761 to his brother , Sir Abraham Isaac Elton , 4th Baronet . He made substantial changes to the house and grounds in the then fashionable Gothic revival style , and was succeeded in 1790 by his son , Sir Abraham Elton , 5th Baronet . He was ordained as a young man , and was a curate in West Bromwich before inheriting the title . He was a supporter of Hannah More , and a fervent opponent of Methodism , at one time inducing the vicar of Blagdon to sack his curate , causing a national scandal . His second wife , Mary , made further alterations to the house in the early 19th century , and also made many improvements to the town , including a school . One of the town 's modern primary schools is named after her . 
 The line of Abrahams came to an end in 1842 when Sir Charles Abraham Elton , 6th Baronet , succeeded his father . Sir Charles was a writer , and contributed to several periodicals including The Gentleman 's Magazine . Sir Charles ' sister Julia was married to the historian Henry Hallam , and his nephew Arthur Hallam is buried in the Elton family vault at St Andrew 's church . Arthur Hallam is the subject of Alfred Tennyson 's poem In Memoriam <unk> .. Tennyson visited Clevedon Court in 1850 , the year in which the poem was published , and also in which he was created Poet Laureate . William Makepeace Thackeray was a visitor to the court during Sir Charles 's time and it was the inspiration for the house <unk> which featured in his novel The History of Henry Esmond although , contrary to common belief , it is improbable that he wrote any of it at Clevedon Court . Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in Clevedon briefly during this period and may have visited the Court . 
 Sir Arthur Elton , 7th Baronet , inherited the house and title in 1853 and , like his father , was a writer . He resigned as MP for Bath in 1859 and spent the rest of his life improving the town , setting up a lending library and allotments , and building and funding the cottage hospital ( still in existence ) . All Saints ' Church , near the Court , was built in 1860 on the orders of Sir Arthur , and he also made additions to the fabric of the Court itself . The West Wing of the house was largely destroyed by a fire in 1882 . It was rebuilt , with C. E. Davis as the architect . During these building works , the chapel was rediscovered , the East window having been filled and altar broken off ( perhaps during the English Protestant Reformation ) , and the room having been known until then as the " Lady 's Bower " . 
 Sir Edmund Elton , 8th Baronet , nephew and son @-@ in @-@ law of Sir Arthur , inherited the estate and title in 1883 . He was an enthusiastic voluntary fireman , and inventor of one of the first forked bicycle brakes , as well as a device to prevent ladies ' skirts from becoming entangled in bicycle wheels . He was also a well @-@ known potter , setting up his " Sunflower Pottery " in the Court grounds with the help of a local boy called George Masters . " Elton ware " became popular , especially in America where it was marketed by Tiffany & Co . Elton and Masters ' work typically has a variety of rich colours , bas @-@ relief decoration of flowers in a style similar to Art Nouveau , and in the later works metallic glazes are often used . 
 Sir Edmund 's son Sir Ambrose succeeded him in 1920 . His son Sir Arthur was one of the pioneers of documentary film making in the years prior to , during and after the Second World War , working with John Grierson . He inherited the title on his father 's death in 1951 . The house was acquired by the Nation , and was given to the National Trust , in part @-@ payment of death duties , in 1960 . The West Wing was immediately demolished , being considered to have no architectural or historical significance , to reduce running costs and to return the house to its supposed mediaeval ground plan . Sir Arthur died in 1973 and was succeeded by his son Sir Charles . The Elton family is still resident in the house , which is now open to the public .

 The site faces south , with its back to Court Hill , and the road may have passed east @-@ west within 15 metres ( 49 ft ) of the front door . The great hall , screens passage , porches and chapel blocks have all survived from the early 14th century and the square headed chapel windows contain reticulated tracery of the decorated period . These buildings were probably complete by 1322 although the parapets of the porches and chapel may have been remodelled at a later date . The 14th @-@ century building embodied older structures including a small four @-@ storey tower that dates , perhaps , to the mid to late 13th century , and the building that became the 14th @-@ century kitchen ( now the museum ) was probably the earlier hall . 
 Alterations during the late mediaeval period were limited to the addition of a two @-@ storey latrine tower at the rear of the house and some rearrangement of the rooms around it . In about 1570 a substantial west wing was added , adjoining and parallel to the solar wing . Apparently typical of its period , it would have transformed the living arrangements of the Wake family who built it . Presumably at the same time , the front of the solar block and east wing were " <unk> " with new windows , and the gable end of the kitchen block at the eastern end was decorated with finials . 
 There is little evidence of the building work that must have been done in the early 1700s following a period of near @-@ disuse and it may have been restricted to repairs . Substantial alterations in the 1760s and 1770s included the replacement and <unk> of the great hall roof , the new gothic south window of the great hall complete with the ogee parapet above it and the provision of a ceiling within the hall . At the same time , the west wing façade was remodelled in " Chinese Gothic " style . 
 Sir Arthur Elton ( 7th Bt ) began updating the house before 1850 ( and the lodge at the gate dates from 1851 ) but it was in 1860s that he made major changes . The west wing was extended and remodelled , this time with an Elizabethan style façade . Less obvious alterations to the east end ( where the servants lived and worked ) probably also date to this period . The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house . In the rebuilding that followed , an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained . Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912 , when it was given a square head again , in Elizabethan style . 
 In the late 1950s , when the National Trust agreed to take on the house , the Victorian west wing ( but not its Elizabethan south front ) were demolished as were a plethora of minor 18th- and 19th @-@ century buildings at the rear . The new west front was given a stonework façade and incorporated the Elizabethan south front .

 In the grounds , the only certain survivor from the medieval period is the small crenellated drum tower . Its original purpose is unknown . It adjoins a substantial wall that may also have origins in the 13th century . The other garden walls have unknown dates of origin but mostly pre @-@ date around 1730 , when the stables were built . All of the other buildings , including the lodge at the South entrance ( 1851 ) are Georgian or Victorian . The medieval appearance of the eastern barn resulting from incorporation of stone from the former medieval barn that stood in front of the house . 
 An early picture of the court shows a building known as Wake 's Tower on Court Hill . It is included in Saxton 's map of 1570 but was demolished before 1738 . Towers such as this were popular Elizabethan features and were lookouts or summer houses . A summerhouse was built on the site but this too was in ruins by the early 19th century .

 The central and largest room in the house is the great hall which was the original dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms . The staircase to the north of the hall was added in the 18th century . The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882 ; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons ' former house in Queen Square , Bristol . The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery , which dominates the front of the house . The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire . The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century . The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of <unk> and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways . 
 = = Gardens = = 
 The gardens of Clevedon Court are listed ( Grade II * ) on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens . 
 Nestling at the foot of Court Hill , on a sheltered south @-@ facing site largely protected from the winds which blow off the Bristol Channel , the front lawns of Clevedon Court run gently down to the perimeter wall . The bulk of the house conceals the dramatic architectural quality of the garden behind , carved out of the hillside in a series of terraces , which rise steeply back to merge with the woodland above . They are surrounded by what Gertrude Jekyll described as " One of the noblest ranges of terrace walls in England . " 
 Although a court roll of 1389 mentions two gardens , there is no record of where these were sited , nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed . The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730 , as can be seen in a portrait of the house from that period . Later in the 18th century , the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace , which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond . The Octagon , a garden pavilion , was built about the same time , as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace . Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks , which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon . The garden is still largely in its 18th @-@ century form , though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded . A single rose <unk> remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009 , marking 300 years of the Elton family 's presence at Clevedon Court . 
 Very little is known about the mid @-@ 18th century planting , although there remains , in front of the house , a gnarled black mulberry tree , which was described as ancient in 1822 . However , 19th @-@ century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes , finally swept away in the 1960s . Today there is a more informal style , emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall ; it is also an easier style to maintain . In recent years , native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage . The lower garden , below the front of the house , now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees , such as a splendid late @-@ leafing catalpa ( an oriental plane tree ) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring , allowing <unk> and bluebells to make a fine showing . 
 As with many English gardens , this one is at its best in May and June , when the <unk> are in bloom and luxurious plants , such as peonies and <unk> , are flowering . An ongoing initiative is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer . There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and day lilies , together with such rarities as a <unk> and an Arbutus menziesii .

 Persona 2 : Innocent Sin ( ペルソナ2 <unk> , Perusona Tsū : Tsumi ) is a Japanese role @-@ playing video game developed and released by Atlus for the PlayStation in 1999 . It is the second entry in the Persona series , itself a subseries of the Megami Tensei franchise , and acts as a sequel to the original Persona . The game was re @-@ released in 2011 for the PlayStation Portable . The original version was not localized for western territories , however the PSP version was released in North America and Europe under the title Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 2 : Innocent Sin . 
 Innocent Sin takes place in the fictional Sumaru City , focusing on a group of high school students from Seven Sisters High School . The protagonist , Tatsuya Suou , and a group of friends must confront a villainous figure called the Joker , who is causing the spread of reality @-@ warping rumors through the city . The group are aided in their quest by their Personas , personified aspects of their personalities . The gameplay features turn @-@ based battle gameplay , where characters use their Personas in battle against demons , and a separate Rumor system , where rumors spread around the city can influence events in the characters ' favor . 
 Development on Innocent Sin began after the release of the original Persona , and retained most of the original 's staff . The game carried over the story themes and basic gameplay mechanics of Persona , while changing and improving on some of the mechanics . The characters were designed by Kazuma Kaneko and Shigenori Soejima . The original release was not localized due to staff shortages and concerns over its content . Reception to the game was generally positive for its original release , but reviews were more mixed for its remake due to its age . A direct sequel to Innocent Sin , Persona 2 : Eternal Punishment , was released in 2000 in Japan and North America . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Persona 2 : Innocent Sin is a role @-@ playing game where the player takes control of a group of high school students as they explore the fictional city of Sumaru . The camera follows the party from an adjustable angled overhead perspective . The city in general is navigated using an overworld map . The game 's main party holds up to five characters . Whenever the party is in a " safe " area ( i.e. a room with no demon encounters ) , each party member can be conversed with . The party 's route through dungeons can be traced using the Auto @-@ Map , a basic floor plan of the current dungeon . As the main character moves around , the map will automatically mark new areas . A key gameplay and story element is the Rumor system : if the party hears a rumor from an NPC , they can spread that rumor using the Kuzunoha detective agency , making the rumor become real and creating effects on the environment . These effects can range from making an accessory or character @-@ specific weapon appear , to triggering the appearance of new shops for the party 's use . 
 Battles include both story @-@ triggered encounters and random encounters inside dungeons : during these encounters , the party is assigned a set of commands and performs them within a turn , then is given the option to change their strategy during the next turn . During battle , characters fight using melee attacks , use items purchased from shops outside battle , and cast a variety of spells using their Personas . Each character has a starting Persona , and each Persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses . Different Personas can be used for defense , healing or elemental attacks . While a Persona is originally quite weak , if it is used enough , it will achieve a higher rank . In addition to individual actions , the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell : when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells , they will automatically summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack . The party can be manually controlled or act using an Auto @-@ battle option . 
 During battles , players can converse with most enemies : depending on which character talks with which enemy , they will trigger a different response . If the enemy is talked with in the right way , they will leave either items or spell cards ( tarot cards linked to a certain Arcanum or Persona family group ) , items used to summon new Personas : certain cards give access to different Persona family groups . After a Persona is summoned and assigned to a character , that character 's stats and abilities change . Active Personas can also be fused with spell cards to create more powerful versions . These Persona summonings and fusions take place in the Velvet Room , a special location separate from the rest of the game 's environments . In addition to pre @-@ set spell cards , the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation . These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family .

 Innocent Sin takes place in 1999 in Sumaru ( <unk> ) , a fictional seaside city in Japan with a population over 1 @.@ 28 million . Most of the protagonists come from two high schools in Sumaru : Seven Sisters ( <unk> ) , a prestigious school which the protagonist attends , and the less @-@ prestigious Kasugayama ( <unk> ) . During the course of the game , popular rumors of various kinds around the city begin to come true , sometimes with dire consequences . The party wields the power to summon Personas : they are defined in the game 's instruction manual as " another side of [ the protagonists ] " . The power of Persona is granted to the party by Philemon ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a being from the collective unconscious who acts as a spiritual guide and helper . A key element of the story is the Oracle of Maia , a prophecy foretelling of a series of events which will lead to the world 's end during a planetary conjunction called the Grand Cross . 
 The protagonist of Innocent Sin is Tatsuya Suou , a senior student at Seven Sisters : popular with most students , he keeps himself isolated from the rest of the school . He later joins with other students to investigate the happenings around Sumaru : Lisa " Ginko " Silverman , whose parents were originally from overseas before becoming Japanese nationals ; Eikichi " Michel " <unk> , a second @-@ year from Kasugayama High who is the leader of a band ; Maya Amano , a reporter for a teen magazine ; and Yukino " <unk> " Mayuzumi , a former student of St. Hermelin High and Maya 's photographer . They are later joined by Jun Kurosu , a former childhood friend of Tatsuya 's . Other important characters include members of the Masked Circle , a group influencing the rumors around Sumaru ; and Nyarlathotep , a representative of the collective unconscious who acts as Philemon 's opposite . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Innocent Sin begins with Tatsuya and Lisa being lured by Eikichi to where his band is rehearsing in an effort to get Tatsuya to join his band . During the ensuing argument , their Personas reveal themselves and Philemon contacts them , warning them that rumors are becoming reality in Sumaru . The group then act out a game where a figure called the Joker is summoned to grant a wish . When Eikichi and his band do this , the Joker is summoned , then drains all the players but Lisa of their " Ideal Energy " ( the essence of hopes and dreams ) using a crystal skull . The Joker then attacks Tatsuya , Lisa and Eikichi , accusing them of some unspecified " sin " , but leaves when they cannot remember that sin . As the group attempt to learn the Joker 's identity , they are joined by Maya and Yukino , the latter of whom is able to explain their Persona abilities . They are eventually brought into conflict with the executives of the Masked Circle , a cult led by the Joker who are gathering Ideal Energy using assigned crystal skills . They are King Leo ( Tatsuya Sudou ) , a deranged man whose eye was burnt out ; Prince Taurus ( <unk> Sasaki ) , a record producer who manipulates Lisa 's budding girl group for his own ends ; and Lady Scorpio ( Anna <unk> ) , a former student at Seven Sisters who is brainwashed by the group . The group are gradually fulfilling the Oracle of Maia , recorded by <unk> Kashihara ( Jun 's father ) under the influence of Nyarlathotep . 
 After defeating Sasaki and Sudou , the group are contacted by Philemon , who directs them into caverns beneath the city 's Alaya Shrine , where the group are gradually told about their " sin " . Ten years prior , Tatsuya , Eikichi , Lisa , and Jun were part of a group named the Masked Circle , where many of them sought solace from their awkward home lives . After Maya announced that she needed to leave , Eikichi and Lisa locked her in the town 's Alaya Shrine in an attempt to force her to stay . In a tragic twist of fate , the deranged Tatsuya Sudou set fire to the shrine , and it was only Maya awakening to her Persona that saved her from death . Sudou attempted to kill Maya in his madness , and Tatsuya burnt out his eye with his own Persona . These events were so traumatic that everyone but Sudou willingly forgot them . Jun , manipulated by Nyarlathotep into believing Maya had died in the fire , took on the mantle of the Joker to punish his former friends and make people 's wishes come true . Confronting the Joker and the final member of the Circle , Jun 's estranged mother Junko , they and the Circle are attacked by group of rumor @-@ generated Nazis called the Last Battalion , led by a resurrected " Fuhrer " . Junko , realizing what she and Jun have done , dies protecting Jun from an attack by the Fuhrer using the Spear of Destiny . After battling him , Jun repents , causing his " Ideal Father " to remove his Persona ability and take control of the Masked Circle . Sumaru City is then raised into the sky as part of Xibalba , a spacecraft manifested through rumors surrounding Kashihara 's writings , fulfilling part of the Masked Circle 's plans . 
 After being rescued , Yukino grants Jun her Persona powers with Philemon 's help . With the Masked Circle and the Last Battalion waging war with each other , the party decide to return the city to normal by removing the five elemental crystal skulls being fought over by the two factions , then confront the Ideal Father . As they collect the crystal skulls , all the party but Jun confront Shadow <unk> , manifestations of their suppressed insecurities . On the way to collect the final skull from the heart of Xibalba , they are forced to stop Maya Okamura , a former colleague of Kashihara who has been driven insane by events , from fulfilling the Oracle . Upon reaching the heart of Xibalba , they battle the Fuhrer and the Ideal Father , who turn out to be Nyarlathotep in disguise . After their fight , Philemon appears and explains their status as manifestations of humanity 's opposing feelings , and that they have been competing over whether humans can find a higher purpose while holding contradictory feelings . Maya is then fatally wounded by Okamura using the Spear of Destiny , the Oracle is fulfilled , and all the world but Sumaru City is decimated . After Nyarlathotep and Okamura leave , Philemon tells the remaining group that they can reverse Nyarlathotep 's work by willing the day the five first met as children from existence : in exchange , they must give up their shared memories . The group agree , and a new timeline is created where each character 's life has been improved , though their friendship is forgotten . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of Innocent Sin began after the release and success of Persona . The main staff from the previous game returned , including Koji Okada ( who acted as producer ) , designer Kazuma Kaneko , and writer Tadashi Satomi . From a technical standpoint , the game not only changed to an overhead view from the first Persona 's mixture of overhead and first person navigation , but also made improvements to elements that were criticized in Persona , such as load times and save point frequency . To separate the Persona series from the Megami Tensei series , the first game 's banner title Megami Ibunroku was dropped . The theme of Innocent Sin , as with the previous entry , was exploration of the human psyche and the main characters discovering their true selves . The central character theme of Innocent Sin was the growth of teenagers and how they overcome their personal troubles . Another key element was the " power of Kotodama " , the Japanese belief that words can influence the physical and spiritual world , with this power manifesting in the world of Persona 2 through the spreading of rumors . Terms and concepts used in the games , including Persona , Shadows and the character Philemon , were drawn from Jungian psychology and archetypes . The character of Nyarlathotep , who had made a cameo appearance as a Persona in the original game , was inspired by the character of the same name from H. P. Lovecraft 's Cthulhu Mythos . Other antagonists and enemy creatures in the games were also drawn from the Cthulhu Mythos and played a key role in the narrative . 
 The main characters were designed by Kaneko , while secondary characters were designed by Shigenori Soejima . While designing the main characters , Kaneko needed to take the character focus into account . The protagonists of Innocent Sin all wore the same school uniform and were given personal items to help distinguish them . The character of the Joker was based on a tradition of flamboyantly @-@ dressed mystery men , along with attacks on people by masked assailants . To emphasize his flamboyant appearance and link him aesthetically to the source of his power , Joker was clad in a strangely colored school uniform . His appearance as a demonic clown was inspired by his actions of absorbing people 's dreams . The flower the original Joker holds , an Iris , symbolizes revenge , and connects directly to the Joker 's true identity . The various districts of Sumaru City were based on various regions around Japan , including Shibuya , Yamate and Odaiba . In addition to relationships with the female characters in Innocent Sin , Tatsuya could also foster a same @-@ sex relationship with Jun. This was done as an experiment by the team to gauge audience reaction to such a relationship , and an attempt to appeal to fans of yaoi anime and manga . 
 = = = Port and localization = = = 
 There was a debate at Atlus over whether to localize Innocent Sin : in addition to concerns that American audiences might not understand references to Japanese culture , there were concerns over potentially controversial content including symbolic allusions to Nazis , Adolf Hitler , and the appearance of Nazi Swastikas . In the end , it was decided to not to localize Innocent Sin . Later , it was stated by Atlus staff that the main reason for this choice was a shortage of staff and resources , as most of the team needed to localize Innocent Sin were already working on its sequel Eternal Punishment , though the localization team did attempt to change this decision . Despite this , it was reported in 2001 that there was still a chance of Innocent Sin being localized , with its release depending on whether Eternal Punishment was successful in North America . Years after its release , a fan translation of the original version was developed . 
 A remake of Innocent Sin for the PlayStation Portable was announced by Famitsu in 2010 . As with the previous PSP port of Persona , the remake was directed by Shoji Meguro . Due to the unexpected success of Persona 's port , the production team was allotted a higher budget to work with , and they decided to use the additional funding to add more features to the game . There were plans to include both Innocent Sin and its sequel in a single game , but they could not fit both games in a single UMD . A new opening movie was produced by animation studio <unk> , who had become famous in Japan through their work on Macross Frontier and <unk> ! . While most game openings were intended as a simple introduction , the team wanted this one to be about the re @-@ imagination the game had undergone , so they decided to have an experienced outside studio work on it rather than internal staff . One of the biggest challenges while creating the movie was remaining faithful to Kaneko 's character artwork while establishing its own look and style . Meguro and Kaneko were both heavily involved with how the characters were portrayed during the opening . 
 For the remake , the gameplay was adjusted to resemble its sequel , along with adjusting it to a 16 : 9 screen ratio from the original 4 : 3 , and interface adjustments for ease of play . The character artwork was redone by Soejima . The voice work was remastered instead of being rerecorded as some of the characters ' voice actors had retired . In addition to these changes , a new story quest set in <unk> High School , the setting for Shin Megami Tensei If ... , was added . The storyline for the new quest was written by Kazuyuki Yamai . The remake was announced for a western release in May 2011 . Until this point , Innocent Sin was the only Persona game not to be released overseas . For its European release , the game was published by Ghostlight . The western release did suffer a few content cuts : namely , the ability to create custom quests in the Climax Theater and additional DLC episodes for the Climax Theater that included several former Persona and Shin Megami Tensei settings . They were removed due to what were described as " a number of challenges — technical and otherwise " . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music for Innocent Sin was composed by Toshiko Tasaki , Kenichi Tsuchiya , Masaki Kurokawa . Tsuchiya had previously done minor sound work on the original Persona . While he worked on future Persona titles , Shoji Meguro , who had composed music for Persona , was busy composing music for Maken X and so was unable to work on the title or its sequel . Tsuchiya found working on the title difficult , retrospectively calling it his most difficult task until his work on Shin Megami Tensei IV . While he found the CD @-@ based recording medium gave more freedom than the cartridge @-@ based SNES , he had difficulties adjusting the pitches of overlapping instruments and managing memory space . The game 's theme song , " Kimi no Tonari " ( <unk> , " Next to You " ) , was written and sung by Hitomi Furuya . Innocent Sin was one of the first Megami Tensei titles to feature voice acting . 
 The music was remixed by Toshiki Konishi , Ryota Kozuka and Atsushi Kitajoh . The reason for this was that Meguro , in addition to directing the remake , was handling the music for Catherine , so had to give the task to others . Meguro had also asked Tsuchiya due to his involvement with the original version , but he declined . The amount of music that needed remixing was very large , consisting of over 100 tracks . The majority of remixing was to add subtle effects to tracks that could not be included for the original version . Due to player feedback about the music for the Persona port , the team included the option to switch to the original versions . The new opening 's theme song , " Unbreakable Tie " , was written by Japanese hip @-@ hop artist and long @-@ time collaborator Lotus Juice and sung by J @-@ pop singer Asami Izawa .

 In its year of release , Innocent Sin reached # 62 in the Japanese sales charts , selling 274 @,@ 798 copies .

 Famitsu was positive about the story in both its reviews , saying that it was highly enjoyable for newcomers and those who had played Persona , while the reviewers for the PSP version said that the story " is still innovative even today . " RPGFan 's Neal Chandran was generally positive in his review of the PlayStation version , particularly noting how the characters confronted their past as well as fighting the main threat , and feeling impressed by the game 's ability to move him despite him not understanding much of the dialogue . John McCarroll , writing for the same site , said that the story was one of the few aspects of the game that had not become dated . GameSpot 's Peter Bartholow , reviewing the original , gave the game similar praise , saying " [ Innocent Sin ] ' s story is darker , stranger , and more involving than most of the fluffy fantasy fare crowding today 's marketplace . " This opinion was generally shared by Carolyn Petit in her review of the PSP version , with her saying that despite a very slow start , the story and characters became interesting for her . IGN 's Vince Ingenito , while noting the game 's differences from later Persona titles , called it " a wonderfully original story " , and praised the localization . RPGamer 's Zach Welhouse said that the game " uses its grand , cosmic backdrop to magnify the adolescent concerns of its protagonists until they pop with energy . " 
 The gameplay was praised by Bartholow , calling the Persona system " Surprisingly simple and well balanced " , and admired the game 's polish despite its limited use of the PlayStation hardware . Ingenito found the gameplay entertaining , saying that it would appeal to fans of the Pokémon series due to its Persona @-@ collecting mechanic . Famitsu , reviewing the original , said that the genera ; gameplay was " quite orthodox " , but found the battle system stood out from other RPGs and praised the Rumor system 's story and gameplay role . Chandran found many parts of the gameplay enjoyable despite noting the lack of its sequel 's more autonomous Fusion Spells , saying that " had loads of fun playing [ Innocent Sin ] . " Welhouse was generally <unk> enthusiastic in his review of the PSP remake , citing the battles as slow and dungeons as boring . 
 The original audio was lauded by Bartholow , stating the voice acting " [ added ] dimension to the already @-@ excellent characterizations " , and called the music " almost always appropriate and exciting " with its blending of rock and techno music genres . Ingenito was less positive about the voice acting for the remake , but generally praised the music . Chandran generally praised the music , although noting that some of the game 's looped themes were repetitive . He also called the voice acting " generally pretty good " , despite finding Tatsuya and Maya 's inconsistent . 
 One of the Famitsu reviewers for the PSP remake was a little critical , saying that long load times when entering battles and the lack of guidance were among minor things that " <unk> me " . Despite this , features such as the ability to switch soundtracks and the Theatre Mode were praised . Petit was highly critical of the remake , citing the gameplay as " Tedious [ and ] repetitive " , referred to the Rumor system as " dull " , and generally felt that the game had not aged well . Ingenito also noted long loading times , along with a very high encounter rate and low @-@ quality graphics carried over from the original . McCarroll commented that many of the remake 's faults stemmed from the expectations for an RPG when the original was released . Welhouse shared multiple criticisms with other reviewers , despite generally enjoying the experience .

 During the development of Innocent Sin , the writer Tadashi Satomi felt that the story needed an alternate viewpoint to that of the main hero . This formed the basis for Persona 2 : Eternal Punishment . Localized for the west , Eternal Punishment was released in 2000 in Japan and North America . The game , along with Eternal Punishment , received a spin @-@ off manga titled Persona : Tsumi to Batsu ( ペルソナ <unk> , Persona : Sin and Punishment ) , featuring new characters from Seven Sisters . Its 2011 reprint featured new content connecting the manga to Innocent Sin . In 2007 , Atlus and Bbmf created and published a mobile version of Innocent Sin . Titled Persona 2 : Innocent Sin - Lost Memories ( ペルソナ2 <unk> <unk> , Perusona Tsū : Tsumi <unk> Memorīzu ) , it carried over the crucial systems of Innocent Sin , including the Persona and Rumor systems , while tailoring them for a mobile format . Maya Amano and Lisa Silverman were later featured in an internal tech demo for the graphics engine used in Shin Megami Tensei : Nocturne . 
 = Tropical Storm Bill ( 2003 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Bill was a tropical storm that affected the Gulf Coast of the United States in the summer of 2003 . The second storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season , Bill developed from a tropical wave on June 29 to the north of the Yucatán Peninsula . It slowly organized as it moved northward , and reached a peak of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) shortly before making landfall in south @-@ central Louisiana . Bill quickly weakened over land , and as it accelerated to the northeast , moisture from the storm , combined with cold air from an approaching cold front , produced an outbreak of 34 tornadoes . Bill became extratropical on July 2 , and was absorbed by the cold front later that day . 
 Upon making landfall on Louisiana , the storm produced a moderate storm surge , causing tidal flooding . In a city in the northeastern portion of the state , the surge breached a levee , which flooded many homes in the town . Moderate winds combined with wet soil knocked down trees , which then hit a few houses and power lines , and left hundreds of thousands without electric power . Two people drowned from rough surf in Florida . Further inland , tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage . Throughout its path , Tropical Storm Bill caused around $ 50 million in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 64 @.@ 3 million 2016 USD ) and four deaths . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave developed scattered convection in the central Caribbean Sea on June 24 , while interacting with an upper @-@ level low . It moved slowly northwestward , and remained disorganized due to strong upper level wind shear . Late on June 27 , the convection became slightly better organized around a broad low pressure area , though land interaction prevented further development as it moved towards the Yucatán Peninsula . The area of low pressure became better defined over the central Yucatán Peninsula , and after the system turned to the northwest , convection quickly organized while located over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico . On June 29 , following the development of a closed circulation , the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 40 miles ( 60 km ) north of Progreso , Yucatán . 
 The depression quickly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Bill later on June 29 . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it attained tropical storm status . Initially , the system resembled a subtropical cyclone , with the strongest winds and deep convection located far from the center , though it was classified tropical due to its tropical origins . The storm steadily intensified as wind shear decreased , and early forecasts from the National Hurricane Center mentioned the possibility of Bill intensifying to hurricane status if the low level circulation organized beneath the area of deepest convection . Bill turned to the north @-@ northwest , and later to the north , as it moved around the periphery of a ridge of high pressure . On June 30 , Tropical Storm Bill reached a peak intensity of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , one hour before making landfall in southwestern Terrebonne Parish , Louisiana . It moved onshore at peak intensity , and quickly weakened to a depression over land as it accelerated to the northeast . Bill remained a tropical cyclone as it moved through the southeast United States , until it became attached to an approaching cold front on July 2 near the Tennessee / Virginia border . The remnant extratropical storm was absorbed by the cold front on July 3 near central Virginia , while the remnant low pressure area continued northeastward until reaching the Atlantic Ocean later on July 3 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Shortly after forming , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from the southern end of Galveston Island to Morgan City , Louisiana . As a more northward motion occurred , the watch was canceled and replaced with a tropical storm warning from High Island , Texas to Pascagoula , Mississippi . Shortly before the storm made landfall , the warning was discontinued between High Island and Cameron , Louisiana . The National Hurricane Center briefly issued a hurricane watch from Intracoastal City to Morgan City , Louisiana , but it was discontinued when Tropical Storm Bill failed to strengthen . Prior the storm making landfall , local National Weather Service offices issued flash flood watches and a tornado watch for large portions of the Gulf Coast . 
 The threat of Tropical Storm Bill caused 41 oil platforms and 11 oil rigs to evacuate . This resulted in a loss of production of over 71 trillion barrels ( 1 @.@ 13 × 1013 m3 ) of oil and 610 million cubic feet ( 17 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of gas . 
 The American Red Cross mobilized workers and brought food , water , and other supplies to Louisiana prior to the storm 's arrival . At the request of Louisiana emergency management officials , the organization opened two shelters for residents in low @-@ lying areas . Several floodgates in New Orleans were closed before the storm made landfall , and many universities and government offices were closed as well . Parishes along the coastline closed summer camps and prepared sand bags , boats , and high @-@ wheeled vehicles . Officials declared a voluntary evacuation for Grand Isle , though few residents heeded the recommendation . Louisiana Governor Mike Foster declared a statewide state of emergency to easily make state resources available , and Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove made a similar declaration for Harrison , Hancock , and Jackson Counties , where shelters were also opened . Officials in Mississippi ordered the evacuation of flood @-@ prone areas in anticipation for a moderate storm surge and above @-@ normal tides .

 Bill caused four direct deaths along its path , as well as minor to moderate damage . Damage estimates totaled to over $ 50 million ( 2003 USD , $ 55 million 2007 USD ) , primarily as a result of flooding or tornadic damage . Throughout its path , Bill spawned 34 tornadoes , ranking it fourteenth in the list of North Atlantic hurricanes generating the most tornadoes . The tornado outbreak was caused by wind shear , moist air from the storm , and cool air from an approaching cold front . In spite of the large numbers of tornadoes , most were weak and short @-@ lived . Prior to forming , the storm produced rainfall along coastal areas of Mexico along the Bay of Campeche , peaking at nearly 4 inches ( 100 mm ) in Yucatán , and over 3 inches ( 75 mm ) in Campeche . 
 = = = Western Gulf Coast = = = 
 The outer bands of Bill dropped light rain across southeastern Texas , peaking at 1 @.@ 07 inches ( 27 mm ) in Jamaica Beach . Sustained winds from the storm remained weak , and peak wind gusts were 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) in eastern Galveston County . Upon making landfall , Bill caused a storm surge of up to 3 @.@ 81 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) at Pleasure Pier . Effects in Texas were minimal , limited to minor beach erosion on the Bolivar Peninsula . 
 A moderate storm surge accompanied Tropical Storm Bill as it made landfall on Louisiana . In the state , the maximum reported surge was 5 @.@ 8 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , and it occurred at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium facility in Chauvin . In <unk> , the surge breached a levee still was damaged from the effects of Hurricane Lili 9 months before . The breach flooded many homes in the town , forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood . As a result , 150 homes in the town were damaged , with half of them severely . The storm surge affected numerous low @-@ lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways , including the only road to Grand Isle , stranding residents and visitors . The road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded . The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish . Damage from the storm surge totaled to $ 4 @.@ 1 million ( 2003 USD ) . Rough waves sank two boats offshore , though their occupants were rescued . 
 The tornado outbreak associated with the storm began with an F0 in St. Bernard Parish that destroyed a boat house . A short @-@ lived F1 tornado touched down in Reserve , striking a private high school , where it destroyed one @-@ half of one classroom and damaged several others . Later , the F1 tornado passed through a trailer park and severely damaged or destroyed 20 trailers . One trailer with a woman and three children was lifted into the air and dropped 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) away ; although all four occupants were injured none of them was wounded seriously . Damage from the tornado amounted to $ 2 million ( 2003 USD , $ 2 @.@ 57 million 2016 USD ) . A third tornado , rated an F0 , struck Orleans Parish , damaging a car and a portion of a roof . 
 Winds of 35 to 45 mph ( 55 to 70 km / h ) were common across southeastern Louisiana , with the highest sustained wind being 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) in Chauvin and a peak gust of 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) on the northern end of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway . The winds knocked trees and tree branches into power lines , leaving 224 @,@ 000 residents without power . The storm dropped moderate to heavy amounts of precipitation , peaking at 10 @.@ 2 inches ( 259 mm ) at a location 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 6 km ) south of Folsom . The rainfall led to flash flooding , which inundated roads and cars and overwhelmed local drainage capacities . The rainfall also led to overflown rivers and creeks , resulting in flooding along the Tangipahoa River in southern Tangipahoa Parish , and the Bogue Falaya and <unk> River in St. Tammany Parish . The Bogue Falaya River crested at 57 feet ( 17 @.@ 4 m ) on July 1 , 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) above flood stage , which became a record for the recording station . The flooding damaged several structures and roadways . Less severe river flooding occurred in Washington and Livingston Parishes . In all , damage in Louisiana totaled to $ 44 million ( 2003 USD , $ 56 @.@ 6 million 2016 USD ) .

 Upon making landfall , Bill produced a peak storm surge of 4 @.@ 99 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in Waveland , Mississippi . The storm surge led to beach erosion , damage to piers , and flooded roadways , with damage from the surge amounting to around $ 1 million ( 2003 USD , $ 1 @.@ 29 million 2016 USD ) . The maximum sustained wind from the storm recorded in Mississippi was 43 mph ( 69 km / h ) , at the Gulfport @-@ Biloxi International Airport , while the airport and Keesler Air Force Base both reported a peak wind gust of 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) . Tropical Storm Bill dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the state , peaking at 9 @.@ 49 inches ( 241 mm ) in Van Cleave . The moderate wind gusts , along with the saturated ground , downed trees in several locations . 34 roads in Pike and Walthall Counties were blocked by fallen trees , and two homes were damaged . Additionally , power outages were reported near the coast . The rainfall flooded streets in various portions of the state and led to overflown rivers . An overflown creek in Pearl River County flooded structures and roadways . The outer rainbands of Bill produced a weak tornado that touched down briefly in Waveland , blowing down several trees which resulted in minor damage to roofs . Statewide damage accrued to $ 5 million ( 2003 USD , $ 6 @.@ 43 million 2016 USD ) , primarily from flooding . 
 As Tropical Storm Bill made landfall on Louisiana , its effects were felt in the Alabama coast as well , as heavy surf and tidal flooding pounded the coastline of the state . High waters closed a road to Dauphin Island and portions of a road along Mobile Bay . Bill dropped over 3 inches ( 25 mm ) of rain across the southern half of Alabama , with isolated locations receiving over 8 inches ( 205 mm ) . Due to wet conditions for months preceding the storm , rainfall from Bill led to flash flooding in many counties . The deluge led to overflown rivers and streams , and left several roadways temporarily impassable from high floodwaters . Saturated grounds and wind gusts of 30 to 35 mph ( 45 to 55 km / h ) downed numerous trees . Many downed trees landed on power lines , which caused power outages for around 19 @,@ 000 people . One downed tree destroyed a car , and another damaged a roof of a house . In Lee County , a man was required to be rescued after driving through high flood waters . Roadway flooding resulted in a few minor traffic accidents . Also , the outer bands of the storm spawned an F1 tornado in Crenshaw County . Early in its path , it was narrow , and damage was limited to downed trees , two destroyed sheds , and a few houses experiencing light shingle damage or damage from fallen trees . Later , it expanded to reach a width of 1 @,@ 800 feet ( 548 m ) as it moved northwestward . The tornado destroyed the roofs of two houses , one of which experienced damage to its walls . The tornado dissipated eight minutes after its 3 mile ( 5 km ) path began , resulting in $ 200 @,@ 000 in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 257 thousand 2016 USD ) and only slight injuries A second tornado , rated F0 in the Fujita scale , occurred in southwestern Montgomery County . A small tornado with a width of only 180 feet ( 55 m ) , it moved to the northwest and tore down a few trees that fell onto a mobile home , a house , and two cars . The tornado dissipated six minutes after its 5 mile ( 8 km ) path began . Throughout Alabama , Tropical Storm Bill caused around $ 300 @,@ 000 in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 386 thousand 2016 USD ) . 
 Rainfall from the storm began affecting Florida a few days before the storm formed , and locations in the southern portion of the state received over 3 inches ( 75 mm ) of rain . Along the Florida Panhandle , Bill dropped over 8 inches ( 205 mm ) of rain as it made landfall , closing several roads or leaving them impassable due to flooding . A stationary line of thunderstorms in Okaloosa County produced downpours of up to 6 inches ( 150 mm ) in one hour , resulting in flash flooding which washed out a portion of a bridge . In Bay County , heavy rainfall and flooding damaged 40 homes , while several residents in an apartment in Parker needed to be rescued by boat from the floodwaters . Rough surf produced by the storm killed two swimmers at Panama City Beach , while a dozen had to be rescued . Part of the tornado outbreak spawned by the storm extended into northern Florida . Damage in Florida totaled to around $ 1 million ( 2003 USD , $ 1 @.@ 29 million 2016 USD ) .

 Tropical Storm Bill dropped light rainfall of around 1 inch ( 25 mm ) in northeastern Arkansas and southeastern Missouri , and over 5 inches ( 125 mm ) in isolated parts of eastern Tennessee . The storm also produced moderate rainfall in northwestern Georgia , which peaked at 7 @.@ 1 inches ( 180 mm ) in Monroe . Areas in southeastern Georgia received generally around 1 inch ( 25 mm ) , although some coastal areas did not receive any precipitation from the storm . Rainfall resulted in flooding in numerous locations around the Atlanta metropolitan area , leaving some roads impassable or closed . The combination of moist air from the south , cool temperatures from a cold front to the north , and low pressures led to the development of supercells throughout Georgia and South Carolina , several of which produced tornadoes . An F1 tornado touched down 3 miles ( 5 km ) north @-@ northeast of Pennington ; first it passed through a farm , causing severe damage to two dairy sheds , a John Deere tractor , and three metal storage buildings . The tornado destroyed a hay barn , a carport , and a car inside the carport as well , while also causing a tree to fall and kill one cow . The tornado passed through a forested area , where it toppled or sheared off hundreds of trees . As it entered a more urban area , it downed 30 isolated trees , some of which fell on a portion of Interstate 20 , temporarily closing the roadway . The tornado damaged seven houses , primarily to roof damage , although one experienced damage to several windows , while another had a utility trailer and a car damaged by fallen trees ; a commercial building was damaged as well . An F2 tornado was reported in Clito , which knocked down trees and damaged mobile homes . Severe thunderstorms from the remnants of Bill caused considerable damage to a house near Louisville and knocked down several trees . Moreover , a tornado was briefly associated with the storms . Bill also caused thunderstorms in Kite which uprooted several trees onto a car and a house . One man in Atlanta died due to a falling tree . Damage in Georgia totaled to $ 244 @,@ 500 ( 2003 USD , $ 315 thousand 2016 USD ) . 
 The tornado outbreak spawned by Bill was the greatest in the Charleston , South Carolina National Weather Service area since the outbreak provoked by Hurricane Earl in 1998 . One such tornado was an F1 that struck Hampton , which uprooted trees and downed power lines . The tornado severely damaged a Dollar General store , while several houses were damaged from fallen trees . An F1 tornado also touched down near <unk> , which uprooted several trees , resulted in a crush car due to a fallen tree , caused severe roof damage to a mobile home , and killed one dog . The storm produced heavy rainfall in the northern portion of the state , with some locations reporting over 7 inches ( 175 mm ) . The rainfall resulted in flash flooding in areas , which caused some damage . 
 In North Carolina , the remnants of the storm dropped around 5 inches ( 125 mm ) in the east @-@ central part of the state , while the southwestern portion of the state received totals of over 7 inches ( 175 mm ) . In Raleigh , a boy drowned from the floodwaters . The tornado outbreak from the storm extended into North Carolina , though specifics are unknown . Bill produced light to moderate precipitation in the Mid @-@ Atlantic , including over 5 inches ( 125 mm ) in central Virginia . In Virginia , a line of thunderstorms from the system produced small amounts of hail in Falls Church . The tornado outbreak associated with Bill ended in New Jersey ; a narrow F0 tornado briefly touched down in a marsh near Goshen . The tornado remained away from the city , and caused no damage or injuries .

 = Losh , Wilson and Bell = 
 Losh , Wilson and Bell , later Bells , Goodman , then Bells , Lightfoot and finally Bell Brothers , was a leading Northeast England manufacturing company , founded in 1809 by the partners William Losh , Thomas Wilson , and Thomas Bell . 
 The firm was founded at Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne with an ironworks and an alkali works nearby at Walker . The alkali works was the first in England to make soda using the Leblanc process ; the ironworks was the first to use Cleveland Ironstone , presaging the 1850s boom in ironmaking on Teesside . 
 The so @-@ called discoverer of Cleveland Ironstone , the mining engineer John Vaughan , ran a rolling mill for the company before leaving to found the major rival firm Bolckow Vaughan . The other key figure in the company was Lowthian Bell , son of Thomas Bell ; he became perhaps the best known ironmaster in England . 
 As Bell Brothers , the firm continued until 1931 , when it was taken over by rival Dorman Long . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founders = = = 
 The company was named after William Losh , Thomas Wilson , and Thomas Bell . 
 William Losh ( 1770 Carlisle – 4 August 1861 , Ellison Place , Newcastle ) came from a rich family that owned coal mines in Northeast England . He was educated in Hamburg , and trained in Newcastle , Sweden and France . He married Alice Wilkinson of Carlisle on 1 March 1798 at Gateshead . He was a friend of the explorer Alexander von Humboldt and a one @-@ time business partner of rail pioneer George Stephenson . His brother James Losh was also a partner in the firm , and kept a diary recording his anxieties about the firm during the Napoleonic wars . 
 Thomas Wilson ( 1773 – 9 May 1858 ) of Low Fell , Gateshead joined the Losh , <unk> counting house . In 1807 , Wilson became a partner and the firm took the name Losh , Wilson and Bell . In 1810 he married Mrs Fell of <unk> . 
 Thomas Bell , ( 5 March 1784 – 20 April 1845 ) partner , was married to Katherine Lowthian of Newbiggin , Cumberland on 25 March 1815 . Bell 's father was a blacksmith . 
 = = = Origins : from alkali to iron = = = 
 The firm 's origins can be traced back to 1790 when Archibald Dundonald , with John and William Losh , experimented on how to produce soda from salt . In about 1793 they opened a works at Bells Close , near Newcastle . Dundonald sent William Losh to Paris to study Nicolas Leblanc 's process for making soda from salt . In 1807 , the <unk> opened an alkali works at Walker , Newcastle upon Tyne , Northumberland . It was the first in England to use the Leblanc process . Dundonald left the partnership and the business continued as Walker Alkali Works . 
 Losh , Wilson & Bell 's first ironworks was founded in 1809 at Walker , beside the alkali works , carrying out a mixture of engineering work but not building steam engines . By 1818 , George Stephenson 's original wooden wagonway was completely relaid with cast @-@ iron edge @-@ rails made in collaboration between Stephenson , who owned the patent , and Losh , Wilson and Bell . Around 1821 , George Stephenson was briefly a partner in the Walker Ironworks . 
 = = = Wealth = = = 
 In 1827 a rolling mill capable of 100 tons of bar iron per week was installed at the Walker Ironworks ; in the same year , Losh , Wilson and Bell 's Walker foundry was listed in Parson and White 's gazetteer of Durham and Northumberland as a steam engine manufacturer . In 1833 , the iron puddling process was installed at Walker . In 1835 , while working as an inspector of construction on the Whitby & Pickering Railway , Thomas Wilson noted the presence of ironstone in a railway cutting at Grosmont , and arranged for drift mines to exploit the find ; the new railway carried the ore to Whitby . In that year , at the age of nineteen , Thomas Bell 's son Lowthian Bell entered the firm 's Newcastle office under his father . In 1836 he joined his father at the firm 's ironworks at Walker . 
 In 1838 , a second mill for rolling rails was added , run by the engineer John Vaughan ( who went on to found Bolckow Vaughan ) ; he strongly influenced Lowthian Bell to become an ironmaster . In the same year , The Athenaeum Journal reported that the Losh , Wilson & Bell works was manufacturing tin and iron plate in large quantities , along with iron bars for making railway @-@ carriage wheels . The firm 's adjacent alkali works was one of several such operations on the Tyne that were collectively producing more than 250 tons of crystallised soda and about 100 tons of soda ash weekly . The journal called William Losh " the father of soda @-@ making on the Tyne " and described him as the head of the firm ( although it was a partnership ) . 
 In 1842 , the shortage of pig iron persuaded Bell to install its own blast furnace for smelting mill cinder ; this was a key decision , enabling the firm to expand . Only two years later , in 1844 , the firm installed a second furnace at Walker for Cleveland Ironstone from Grosmont , six years before the boom in Cleveland iron when Vaughan and Marley discovered ironstone in the Eston Hills in 1850 . From 1849 , Losh , Wilson and Bell were subcontractors on the Newcastle @-@ Gateshead High Level Bridge , responsible for constructing the bridge approaches . 
 On 25 January 1851 , Lowthian Bell left the partnership with William Losh , Thomas Wilson , Catherine Bell , Thomas Bell and John Bell . The business at that time was described in the London Gazette as " Iron Manufacturers , and Ship and Insurance Brokers , under the style or firm of Losh , Wilson , and Bell " . He went on to have a career in chemistry and politics , becoming a member of parliament among many other distinctions . 
 On 8 October 1855 , there was a serious boiler explosion at the Walker Iron Works , which killed at least seven workers . According to a contemporary account , the boiler 
 unfurled like a sail , was blown upwards , carrying with it two <unk> of the sheds , and blowing down two furnaces , with their chimneys , and scattering the molten metal and red hot bricks around , while one end of it was hurled into the midst of the works , and the other about 200 yards over the hill top , into the lumber @-@ yard . 
 All the dead were aged between 19 and 33 , and the event created something of a sensation at the time . In 1857 , John Marley , in his account of the Cleveland Ironstone , described the Bell Ironworks as follows : 
 These iron @-@ works , situate on the Tyne , and belonging to Messrs. Losh , Wilson , & Bell , originally consisted of only one furnace , being the first blast furnace that was specially erected for this bed of ironstone ( in connection with Scotch , and other ores , for mixing ) , viz . , about the year 1842 or 1843 , and which ironstone was purchased from the aforesaid mines belonging to Mrs. Clark , in the Whitby district , the first cargo being sent in June or July , 1843 , since which time these works have been increased by one extra furnace , built for the Whitby district ironstone in 1844 , and by other three [ at Port Clarence ] for the north part of Cleveland , about 1852 , making now a total of five furnaces .

 From 1869 at the latest , the company owning the Walker Engine Works was Bells , Goodman & Co . In that year the firm made the tunnelling shield and iron castings to line the Tower subway tunnels . In 1871 the firm made pumping and winding engines for Seghill Colliery . In 1875 it made machinery to condense smoke and gases for Clyde Lead Works of Glasgow . 
 = = = Bells , Lightfoot = = = 
 In 1875 , the Bells , Goodman partnership was dissolved when Alfred Goodman retired . The firm became known as Bells , Lightfoot & Co . In 1876 it supplied a 90 " Cornish beam engine for Springhead Pumping Station near Anlaby in the East Riding of Yorkshire ; it had an unusual box @-@ section wrought iron beam , and continued running until 1952 . On 30 November 1876 , Thomas Bell Lightfoot , Managing Partner , was granted a patent for his developments on machines for squeezing metals into shape . However , on 28 August 1883 , Thomas Bell moved to Bilbao , Spain , where he continued to describe himself as an Ironmaster , and by mutual consent his partnership with Henry Bell and Thomas Bell the younger was dissolved . The deed was witnessed on 7 December 1883 . 
 = = = Bell Brothers = = = 
 By 1873 , Bell Brothers owned 9 coal mines in County Durham and Yorkshire . There were 10 mines in 1882 ; in 1888 the " Clarence Salt Works " was also recorded . In 1896 and 1902 the company had 11 mines . In 1914 there are 12 ; in 1921 there are 14 . The 1881 – 1891 Arts and Crafts classical style Bell Brothers office building at Zetland Road in Middlesbrough was designed by architect Philip Webb ; it was his only commercial development . According to English Heritage it is architecturally the most important building in Middlesbrough . 
 In 1903 , Isaac Lowthian Bell , then aged 87 , sold a majority holding of the Bell companies to the rival firm Dorman Long . It was not a comfortable merger . Bell Brothers , along with the plate maker Consett Iron Company and another family ironmaking firm of Northeast England , Bolckow Vaughan , the companies 
 had expanded their capacity during World War I and the boom that immediately followed . As in other regions , expansion had come in a piecemeal fashion . Inefficient plant , excess capacity , and low profits had increased these firms ' debts and brought creditors onto their boards . 
 Further , as regards the Bells and the <unk> , 
 Over the years the two families rarely agreed as to how the firm should be run . Indeed , the company was known locally not as Dorman Long but as " Dorman versus Bell " . 
 Bell Brothers was recorded in the Colliery Year Book and Coal Trades Directory of 1923 as having an annual output of 600 @,@ 000 tons of coal for coking and manufacturing . Sir Hugh Bell was chairman and managing director ; Arthur Dorman and Charles Dorman were directors . That same year , Bell Brothers , described in the Sydney Morning Herald as " owners of coal and ironstone mines and blast furnaces and rolling mills " , was finally merged completely with Dorman Long . Sir Arthur Dorman was chairman ; both Hugh Bell and his son Maurice Bell were among the directors . When Arthur Dorman died in 1931 , Hugh Bell , aged 87 , briefly became chairman of ' Dorman versus Bell ' ; he died on 29 June 1931 .

 John Roby <unk> wrote a report in 1842 for the Children 's Employment Commission entitled " Employment of Children and Young Persons in the Collieries , Lead Mines , and Iron Works of Northumberland and the North of Durham ; and on the Condition , Treatment , and Education of such Children and Young Persons " . <unk> found that Losh , Wilson & Bell paid its workers 30 to 36 shillings per week for a scrap @-@ puddler ; £ 2 5 shillings per week for a <unk> ; 18 shillings per week for a plate mill @-@ furnace man ; and 25 shillings per week for an <unk> . The boiler engineer 's family of wife and four children spent 18 shillings per week on provisions and 3 shillings per week on rent , leaving only 4 shillings for all other expenditure . 
 In sport , an iron puddler , Robert Chambers of the company 's Walker works , won the sculling championship at the 1857 Thames Regatta . The heavy work stirring the iron was said to have strengthened his arms and shoulders . Chambers also won the return match , held on the Tyne on 19 April 1859 , even after a collision with a moored boat left him a hundred yards behind .

 Metroid Prime is a first @-@ person action @-@ adventure video game developed by Retro Studios and Nintendo for the GameCube console . It was released in North America on November 17 , 2002 , and in Japan and Europe the following year . Metroid Prime is the fifth main installment and the first 3D game in the Metroid series . Because exploration takes precedence over combat , Nintendo classifies Metroid Prime as a first @-@ person adventure rather than a first @-@ person shooter . On the same day as its North American release , Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion , marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight @-@ year hiatus following Super Metroid ( 1994 ) . In 2009 , an enhanced version was released for Wii as a standalone game in Japan and as part of Metroid Prime : Trilogy internationally . 
 Metroid Prime is the first of the three @-@ part Prime storyline , which takes place between the original Metroid and Metroid II : Return of Samus . Like previous games in the series , Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran . The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV . 
 The game was a collaboration between Retro 's staff in Austin , Texas , and Japanese Nintendo employees , including producer Shigeru Miyamoto , who suggested the project after visiting Retro 's headquarters in 2000 . Despite initial backlash against the game 's first @-@ person perspective , the game garnered critical praise and commercial success , selling more than a million units in North America alone . It won a number of Game of the Year awards , and it is considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games ever made , remaining one of the highest @-@ rated games on Metacritic .

 Metroid Prime is the first of the three @-@ part Prime storyline . Retro Studios wrote an extensive storyline for Metroid Prime , which was considered a major difference from previous Metroid games . Short cutscenes appear before important battles , and a scanner in the heads @-@ up display extracts backstory @-@ related information from objects . 
 The Prime trilogy is set between the events of Metroid and Metroid II , but according to some sources , including <unk> — Brazil 's former Nintendo distributor — and the Nintendo Power comics adaptation of Metroid Prime , the events in the Prime games occur after Super Metroid . The Brazilian publicity states that the Phazon meteor is a piece of Zebes , which was destroyed after Super Metroid . In Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption , however , it was confirmed that the meteor was a " Leviathan " from the planet Phaaze . 
 The game takes place on planet Tallon IV , formerly inhabited by the Chozo race . Five decades before the game 's events , the Chozo civilization fell after a meteor collided into Tallon IV . The said meteor contaminated the planet with a corrupting substance that the Space Pirates named " Phazon " , and also brought with it a creature known to the Chozo as " The Worm " . A large containment field emitter of the " Artifact Temple " in the Tallon Overworld area was designed as a seal to the meteor 's energies and influence within the crater where it landed , which the Space Pirates attempt to disable or bypass in order to gain better access in order to extract the Phazon . The containment field is controlled by twelve Chozo artifacts that are scattered around the planet . The player assumes the role of the bounty hunter Samus Aran , who receives a distress signal from Space Pirate Frigate Orpheon and travels to Tallon IV to investigate and stop the Space Pirate activity she found . Her investigation leads her to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting Phazon and stop the spread of Phazon on Tallon IV . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Samus intercepts a distress signal from the Space Pirate frigate Orpheon , whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates ' own genetically modified , experimental subjects . At the ship 's core , she battles with the Parasite Queen — a giant version of the tiny parasites aboard the ship . The Parasite Queen is defeated and falls into the ship 's reactor core , initiating the destruction of the ship . While Samus is escaping from the doomed frigate , she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta Ridley . During her escape , an electrical surge and explosion destroys her suit upgrades , forcing her to revert to her original Power Suit . Samus escapes the frigate and chases her nemesis in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV . 
 Samus initially lands on Tallon IV at a rainforest location referred to as " Tallon Overworld " . After a brief period of exploring , she discovers the Chozo Ruins , the remains of the Chozo civilization . After further investigation , Samus learns that many years ago , the planet was struck by a meteor , which carried with it a substance the Chozo and Space Pirates call Phazon . The meteor also contained a creature called " The Worm " . The Chozo built an Artifact Temple over the crater to contain " The Worm " and to stop the Phazon from spreading over the planet . The temple 's sealed entrance is controlled by twelve Chozo artifacts , which must be found to gain access to the crater . After obtaining the Varia Suit in the ruins , Samus finds her way to the Magmoor Caverns , a series of magma @-@ filled underground tunnels , which are used by the Space Pirates as a source of geothermal power and connect the game 's areas together . Following the tunnels , Samus travels to the Phendrana Drifts , a cold , mountainous location which is home to an ancient Chozo ruin and Space Pirate research labs used to study Metroids , as well as ice caves and valleys home to electrical and ice @-@ creatures . After obtaining the Gravity Suit in Phendrana , Samus explores the interior of the crashed Orpheon , then infiltrates the Phazon Mines — the mining and research complex which is the center of the Space Pirates ' Tallon IV operations . Here she battles Phazon @-@ enhanced Space Pirates and obtains the Phazon Suit after defeating the monstrous , Phazon @-@ mutated Omega Pirate . 
 During her exploration of Tallon IV , Samus finds the twelve keys to the Artifact Temple and lore recorded by the Chozo and the Space Pirates , providing insight into the history of the planet and the two races ' colonization of it . As Samus puts the final key in place , Meta Ridley appears and attacks her . Samus defeats it with help from the temple 's defensive artillery . The Chozo Artifacts and Phazon Suit allow Samus to enter the Impact Crater , where she finds the so @-@ called " Worm " : the Metroid Prime , the source of the Phazon on Tallon IV . After she defeats it , all the Phazon on Tallon IV disappears , but the Metroid Prime absorbs Samus 's Phazon Suit in a final effort to survive , reverting her armor to the Gravity Suit . Samus escapes the collapsing crater and leaves Tallon IV in her ship . In a post @-@ credits scene , only viewable if the player has collected all of the items , Metroid Prime uses the Phazon Suit to reconstruct its body , becoming the entity known as Dark Samus — one of the antagonists of Metroid Prime 2 : Echoes and the main antagonist of Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 As in previous Metroid games , Metroid Prime takes place in a large , open @-@ ended world in which regions are connected by elevators . Each region has a set of rooms separated by doors that can be opened with a shot from the correct beam . The gameplay involves solving puzzles to reveal secrets , platform jumping , and shooting foes with the help of a " lock @-@ on " mechanism that allows circle strafing while staying aimed at the enemy . Metroid Prime is the first game in the Metroid series to use a first @-@ person view instead of side @-@ scrolling , except in Morph Ball mode , when Samus ' suit transforms into an armored ball and the game uses a third @-@ person camera . 
 The protagonist , Samus Aran , must travel through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open the path to the Phazon meteor impact crater , while collecting power @-@ ups that enable the player to reach previously inaccessible areas . The Varia Suit , for example , protects Samus ' armor against dangerously high temperatures , allowing her to enter volcanic regions . Some of the items are obtained after boss and mini @-@ boss fights , which are encountered in all regions except Magmoor Caverns . Items must be collected in a specific order so that the player may progress . For example , players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors , or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses . Like the rest of the series , players are incentivized to explore the open world to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health . 
 The heads @-@ up display , which simulates the inside of Samus ' helmet , features a radar display , a map , ammunition for missiles , a health meter , a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials , and a health bar and name display for bosses . The display can be altered by exchanging visors ; one uses thermal imaging , another has x @-@ ray vision , and another features a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses and interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators . Metroid Prime introduces a hint system that provides the player with clues about ways to progress through the game . 
 = = = Items = = = 
 Throughout the game , players must find and collect items that improve Samus 's arsenal and suit , including weapons , armor upgrades for Samus 's Power Suit and items that grant abilities — including the Morph Ball which allows Samus to roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs , and the Grapple Beam which works by latching onto special hooks called grapple points , allowing Samus to swing across gaps . Unlike those in earlier games in the series , the beam weapons in Metroid Prime have no stacking ability , in which the traits of each beam merge . Instead , the player must cycle the four beam weapons ; there are charge combos with radically different effects for each . 
 Items from previous Metroid games appear with altered functions . Art galleries and different endings are unlockable if the player collects a high percentage of items and Scan Visor logs . Prime is one of the first Metroid games to address the reason Samus does not start with power @-@ ups acquired in previous games ; she begins the game with some upgrades , including the Varia Suit , Missiles and Grapple Beam , but they are lost during an explosion on the Space Pirate frigate Orpheon . The producers stated that starting with some power @-@ ups was a way to give the player " different things to do " and to learn the functions of these items before settling into the core gameplay . 
 Players can gain two features by connecting Prime with Metroid Fusion using a Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable : use of the Fusion Suit that Samus wears in Fusion and the ability to play the original Metroid .

 After Super Metroid , fans of the series eagerly awaited a sequel . It was allegedly due for release for the Nintendo 64 , but while the game was mentioned several times , it never entered production . Producer Shigeru Miyamoto said this was because Nintendo " couldn 't come out with any concrete ideas " . Metroid co @-@ creator Yoshio Sakamoto said that he considered creating a new installment for the Nintendo 64 , but was not interested in being part of its development , mainly because of the console 's controller . He said , " I just couldn 't imagine how it could be used to move Samus around " . Sakamoto also said Nintendo approached another company to make an N64 Metroid , but the offer was declined because the developers thought they could not make a game that could equal Super Metroid 's standards . 
 Metroid Prime was a collaboration between Retro Studios and important Nintendo EAD and R & D1 members . The overall game design was a collaborative effort , while the art and engineering was done entirely at Retro , and the music was fully handled in Japan . Retro Studios was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg . The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic . After establishing its offices in Austin , Texas in 1999 , Retro started working on four different GameCube projects . When producer Shigeru Miyamoto visited Retro in 2000 , he suggested the development of a new Metroid game after seeing the prototype of a first @-@ person shooter engine they created . In 2000 and early 2001 , three games in development at Retro were canceled , and in July 2001 , an RPG called Raven Blade was terminated , leaving Prime as the only game in development there . During the last nine months of development , Retro 's staff worked <unk> to 100 @-@ hour weeks to reach the deadline imposed by Nintendo . 
 The Japanese crew , which included producers Miyamoto , Kensuke Tanabe , Kenji Miki and game designer and Metroid co @-@ creator Yoshio Sakamoto , communicated with the Texas @-@ based studio through e @-@ mails , telephone conferences and personal gatherings . The game was originally planned as having third @-@ person perspective gameplay , but after Miyamoto intervened this was changed to first @-@ person perspective and almost everything already developed was scrapped . The change from third @-@ person perspective was prompted by camera problems experienced by Rare Ltd . , which was developing Jet Force Gemini . According to game director Mark Pacini , Miyamoto " felt that shooting in third person was not very intuitive " ; Pacini also said that exploration is easier using first @-@ person . Pacini said that after picking that perspective , the crew decided not to make a traditional first @-@ person shooter . He said , " We weren 't trying to fit in that genre . We had to break down the stereotypes of what a first @-@ person game is and make a fun Metroid game . 
 Pacini stated that Retro tried to design the game so that the only difficult parts would be boss battles and players would not be afraid to explore because " the challenge of the game was finding your way around " . Senior designer Mike Wikan also said that the focus on exploration led the development team to spend much time making the platform jumping " approachable to the player " , and to ensure the resulting gameplay had " shooting [ as ] a very important , though secondary , consideration " . Retro Studios developed the storyline of Metroid Prime under the supervision of Yoshio Sakamoto , who verified that the plot ideas were consistent with the lore of the series ' earlier games . The developers intended that Kraid , a boss from Metroid and Super Metroid , would appear in Prime ; designer Gene Kohler modeled and skinned him for that purpose . However , time constraints prevented Kraid from being included in the final version of the game . The development team considered implementing the Speed Booster power @-@ up from Super Metroid but concluded it would not work well because of the first @-@ person perspective and " limitations imposed by the scale of our environment " , and discarded it . 
 The first public appearance of the game was a ten @-@ second video at SpaceWorld 2000 . In November of the same year , Retro Studios confirmed its involvement with the game in the " job application " part of its website . In February 2001 , the game was confirmed by Nintendo , which also announced that because of its emphasis on exploration and despite the first @-@ person perspective , Metroid Prime would be a first @-@ person adventure rather than a first @-@ person shooter . In May 2001 , the game was showcased at E3 2001 , with its name confirmed as Metroid Prime . The first views of the game drew a mixed reactions from fans because of the change from 2D side @-@ scrolling to 3D first @-@ person navigation .

 Kenji Yamamoto , assisted by Kouichi <unk> , composed the music for Prime . The soundtrack contains arrangements of tracks from previous games in the series because Yamamoto wanted " to satisfy old Metroid fans . It 's like a present for them " , he said . The initial Tallon Overworld theme is a reinterpretation of Metroid 's Brinstar theme , the music heard in Magmoor Caverns is a new version of the music from Super Metroid 's Lower <unk> area , and the music heard during the fight with Meta Ridley is a fast @-@ paced reimagining of the Ridley boss music first featured in Super Metroid — which has reappeared in most Metroid games since . Tommy Tallarico Studios initially provided sound effects for the game , but Shigeru Miyamoto thought they were not yet good enough for an extended presentation at SpaceWorld 2001 . The game supports Dolby Pro Logic II setups and can be played in surround sound . The official soundtrack to the game was released on an album called Metroid Prime & Fusion Original Soundtracks , which was published by Scitron on June 18 , 2003 . 
 = = = Versions = = = 
 Prime was released for the GameCube in five versions . The original North American and Japanese NTSC versions and the second North American version , which contained minor changes , all used a loader that sometimes caused the game to crash in specific rooms . The European PAL version resolved these glitches and contained altered elements of the gameplay to prevent sequence breaking , a slower loader that prevented the occasional crashes , slightly different story details , and narration in the opening and closing scenes . Some of these changes were carried over from the PAL version to the NTSC region 's Player 's Choice re @-@ release , along with additional changes not made in other releases . This version , which was bundled with a silver GameCube , also contained a second disc featuring a preview trailer and a demo for Metroid Prime 2 : Echoes , a timeline of Metroid games , and an art gallery . 
 Metroid Prime was re @-@ released in Japan in 2009 for Wii as part of the New Play Control ! series . It has improved controls that use the Wii Remote 's pointing functionality . The credit system from Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption is also included to unlock the original bonus content and the ability to take snapshots of gameplay . Internationally , the Wii version was released in Metroid Prime : Trilogy , a single @-@ disc compilation containing Prime , Echoes , and Corruption for Wii . On January 29 , 2015 , the compilation became available for download from the Wii U 's Nintendo eShop .

Criticisms included the unusual control scheme , lack of focus on the story , and repetitive backtracking . Game Informer considered the control scheme awkward , Entertainment Weekly compared the game to a " 1990s arcade game , filled with over the top battle sequences , spectacular visual effects — and a pretty weak plot " , and GamePro stated that inexperienced players " might find it exhausting to keep revisiting the same old places over and over and over " . 
 On GameRankings , Metroid Prime is the 11th @-@ highest rated game ever reviewed , with an average score of 96 @.@ 35 % as of April 2014 , making it the second @-@ highest reviewed game of the sixth generation after Soulcalibur for the Sega Dreamcast .

 After Metroid Prime , three more games in the first @-@ person perspective and a pinball spin @-@ off were released . The sequel Metroid Prime 2 : Echoes — in which Samus travels to planet Aether and discovers that a Phazon meteor crashed there , creating an alternate reality and Samus fights a mysterious enemy called Dark Samus — was released in November 2004 for the GameCube . It was followed by Metroid Prime Pinball , a spin @-@ off game featuring the locations and bosses of Metroid Prime , developed by Fuse Games and released in 2005 for the Nintendo DS . 
 The next game released was Metroid Prime Hunters for the Nintendo DS ; its storyline takes place between the events of Prime and Echoes . A demo of the game , titled Metroid Prime Hunters — First Hunt , was bundled with the Nintendo DS , and the full game was released on March 20 , 2006 , in North America and May 5 , 2006 , in Europe . In its narrative , Samus tries to discover an " ultimate power " while facing six rival bounty hunters . Hunters was not developed by Retro Studios , but by Nintendo 's Redmond @-@ based subsidiary Nintendo Software Technology . The game contains more first @-@ person shooter aspects than Prime and Echoes , with removal of assisted aiming , more action @-@ oriented gameplay , and various multiplayer modes . 
 Metroid Prime 's second full sequel is Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption , which closes the Prime series . It was released on August 27 , 2007 , for Nintendo 's Wii console . In Corruption 's story , Samus is corrupted by Phazon after being attacked by Dark Samus , who has become the leader of a Space Pirate group and is sending Phazon Seeds to corrupt planets . Corruption 's gameplay differs from that of Prime and Echoes ; the assisted aiming is replaced with free aiming with the Wii Remote , and the interchangeable beams is replaced with a stackable upgrade system . 
 Elements of Metroid Prime have appeared in other games , such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl in which the frigate Orpheon is a playable stage , featuring the Parasite Queen in the background and several music tracks from Metroid Prime as background music . Metroid Prime 's style of gameplay and <unk> also influenced and was compared to later first @-@ person shooters , such as Geist and Star Wars : Republic Commando .

The singer commented about a woman : " She was to do her trials and ' tickled ' , as the song says , all my roof , and those tickles didn 't let me sleep . " He further commented that when he planned to meet her , he discovered that she was " very beautiful " . " <unk> " is a piano ballad themed about tenderness , poetry and romanticism . 
 " Nadie Sabe A Donde Va " is inspired by the bombings which occurred on 11 March 2004 in Madrid at the <unk> train station .

 William W. Powers State Recreation Area is an Illinois state park administered by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources on 580 acres ( 230 ha ) in the Hegewisch community area of the City of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States . The area includes 419 acres ( 170 ha ) of water in Wolf Lake that provides about 6 miles ( 10 km ) of shoreline to fishermen . The park hosts about half a million visitors annually . The park contains numerous species , and is one of the most important biological sites in the Chicago region . 
 = = History = = 
 Wolf Lake in Illinois has a storied history that somehow has lost track of the origins of the name that goes back over 150 years . Part of this history includes visits by Abraham Lincoln in which Mary Todd Lincoln nearly drowned . In 1947 , the state acquired a 160 acres ( 65 ha ) parcel known as the Wolf Lake State Recreation Area . Later acquisitions were added to the property and have increased the area which was known as Wolf Lake Conservation Area . In 1965 , the Illinois General Assembly named the area after William W. Powers . Powers had been a Chicago alderman on the Chicago City Council and Illinois General Assembly legislator in the 1920s , and used the site for picnics to feed the needy during the Great Depression . 
 The park also has a military history . There is a defunct Nike Ajax missile honoring the missile site that occupied the area during the Cold War years . Memorial Day , Independence Day , and Veterans Day ceremonies attract veterans who place flags at markers near a former re @-@ dedication ceremony site that featured the Moving Vietnam Wall . 
 Unlike the Lake Michigan shoreline which has been reshaped by sand and clay , Wolf Lake has been filled in large part with slag from steel mills . 
 = = Wildlife = = 
 Wolf Lake contains largemouth bass , northern pike , bluegill , <unk> sunfish , crappie , bullhead , carp , walleye , hybrid <unk> , and yellow perch . There is also an occasional salmon and rainbow trout caught in the lake . Salmon can access the lake via the Calumet River and its Indian Creek tributary . 
 Native trumpeter ( Cygnus buccinator ) and tundra swans ( Cygnus columbianus ) and non @-@ native mute swans ( Cygnus olor ) may all be found on the lake in winter . Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest , however , the non @-@ native , Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non @-@ migrating trumpeter swan population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes . Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals , blue jays , finches , orioles , woodpeckers , teal , mallards , resident and migratory Canada geese , and an occasional bald eagle . 
 Birdwatchers enjoy the non @-@ native monk parakeet , which is a South American parrot , that nests in the park . Hunters enjoy the seasonal waterfowl . The South American monk parakeets arrived at the site in 1999 and have since established two nests with seven or eight birds each . They are presumed to have migrated from the Hyde Park community area . 
 The park contains many willow and cottonwood trees . 
 The park also attracts city dwelling mammals such as squirrels , rabbits , raccoons , muskrats , opossums , and the occasional coyote and white @-@ tailed deer . Beaver sign indicates that there are beaver on the lake currently . 
 On August 23 , 2002 , Wolf Lake was one of three neighboring regions that hosted the Calumet BioBlitz . This <unk> convened over 150 expert scientists to identify and record as many living organisms as possible within 24 hours . The purpose was to demonstrate the resilience of the extraordinary range of organisms in nature 's battle against the South Side of Chicago 's collage of factories , warehouses , forest preserves , residences , and highways as well as its battle of survival against killer pest species . Unofficially , the BioBlitz counted 1 @,@ 815 species . The BioBlitz included teams of scientists from Eastern Illinois University , Field Museum , Forest Preserve District of Cook County , Illinois Natural History Survey , Indiana Department of Natural Resources , University of Illinois - Champaign , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , and U.S. Fish & Wildlife . 
 Lake sturgeon , endangered in both Indiana and Illinois , as well as banded killifish , threatened in Illinois , are both part of the Wolf Lake ecology . The lake supports the nesting habitat for four species of endangered birds : little blue heron , yellow @-@ crowned night heron , black @-@ crowned night heron , and yellow @-@ headed blackbird . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Illinois Water Survey are studying ways to halt degradation of the lake and the USDA Forest Service is helping with a study of public interests in recreation at Wolf Lake . The Wolf Lake water level determines the drainage to Lake Michigan because the connecting Calumet River flows southward during elevated levels and northward during lowered levels . The water in Wolf Lake was about 18 inches higher until 1998 when the Illinois Department of Natural Resources removed several beavers and their dams that had been built across Indian Creek . The subsequent drop in water depth encouraged weed growth and changed fishing conditions . 
 The Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the City of Hammond , IN initiated the Reconnaissance Report in December 1998 . It was approved in September 2000 . An environmental assessment was held in 2002 . The Project Cooperation Agreement commenced in 2005 . The Wolf Lake ecosystem degradation problem is multifaceted . It includes exotic plant species proliferation , low diversity of plant and fish species , water depth inadequacy , poor aquatic habitat , contaminant impact , and shoreline erosion . Proposed project features include new aquatic and wetland habitat plantings ; shoreline restoration ; creating deep holes to locally diversify the lake bottom ; <unk> and biological controls ; channels clearing , and dikes and causeways construction to restore natural water levels . 
 = = Use = = 
 The park offers stoves and has shelters available by reservation for picnicking . Two of the shelters each have capacity for 50 people , and two others each have capacity for 100 people . Fishing and hunting is permitted in accordance with regulations , but camping is not allowed . Ice fishing is permitted in the winter and 10 horsepower ( 7 @.@ 5 kW ) motorboats are permitted during the summer . The lake has several dikes that temper the wave height . There are 25 hunting blinds to hunt waterfowl . These sites are awarded in yearly lotteries held in late July . During the season , daily drawings are held to allocate blinds of absentee blind holders . 
 The use of the park is protected by several types of volunteers . For example , at the 14th Annual Earth Day Wolf Lake Cleanup on April 21 , 2001 , more than 350 volunteers , including Hammond , IN Mayor Duane <unk> , Jr . , helped clean up and remove an estimated 36 @,@ 000 pounds ( 16 t ) of waste . A week later , Friends of Wolf Lake and associates collected more than 3 @,@ 000 discarded tires from the lake and its shoreline . Semi @-@ annual cleanups are organized by the Southeast Sportsmen 's Club and the Wolf Lake Rod and Gun Club who work with the scouts , community organizations and the Hegewisch Chamber of Commerce .

 Wolf Lake extends across the Illinois and Indiana State line between 120th and 134th streets . It is an 804 acres ( 325 ha ) lake that has 419 acres ( 170 ha ) within the city of Chicago and the remainder in the city of Hammond . Its maximum depth is 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) . Wetlands adjacent to the lake include the 250 acres ( 100 ha ) Eggers Woods Forest Preserve , 175 acres ( 71 ha ) <unk> Lake Prairie , and 40 acres ( 16 ha ) Hyde Lake Wetland . William W. Powers State Recreation Area is on Chicago 's far southeast side , off highways 94 , 90 , and 41 . The main park entrance is at <unk> South Avenue O. 
 At one time , the Wolf lake was connected to Lake Michigan by a creek running through Hammond on the Indiana side , but the creek has long since been blocked by development . On the Illinois side , Wolf Lake empties into Indian Creek , which feeds into the Calumet River . The Illinois and Indiana are separated by State Line Road , which is a road elsewhere along the border , but it is only represented by a rock @-@ and @-@ gravel dike that passes through the lake . State Line Road ends in foot bridges where water enters from the Indiana side .

He was invited to Colorado 's training camp that fall , and impressed the team such that he made the team as an 18 @-@ year @-@ old . Tanguay and the Avalanche , however , were unable to come to terms on a contract and he was instead returned to Halifax for the 1998 – 99 season . 
 A few games into his third season with the Mooseheads , he tied a franchise record with five points in one game , an 11 – 3 victory over the Baie @-@ Comeau Drakkar on October 9 , 1998 , then tied another record with four goals in a 6 – 1 defeat of the Drummondville Voltigeurs six nights later .

During the season , he had a career best 16 @-@ game point streak which set a Colorado team record . He also scored his first career NHL hat trick on March 22 , 2003 , against the Chicago Blackhawks . He was nearly traded to the Boston Bruins early in the season when both he and the team were struggling . Colorado had offered Tanguay and Martin <unk> to Boston for Martin Lapointe and Kyle McLaren , though the deal failed to materialize . 
 He improved to a new personal best of 79 points in 2003 – 04 , good enough for ninth place in league scoring , while his 54 assists tied him for fourth in the NHL . The league named him to the Western Conference team at the 2004 All @-@ Star Game . While the 2004 – 05 season was cancelled by a labour dispute , Tanguay signed to play for HC Lugano of the Swiss National League A. He appeared in six games with Lugano , scoring six points .

Tanguay scored two goals in an April 15 , 2006 , game against the Vancouver Canucks to reach 400 points for his career . 
 Though he was the team 's second leading scorer , Tanguay continued to be the subject of trade talks throughout the season . Set to become a restricted free agent in July 2006 , the Avalanche chose to trade his negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for defenceman Jordan Leopold and two second round draft picks . Tanguay felt that the team chose to trade him after he failed to live up to the team 's expectations in the playoffs even though he continued to struggle with his knee injury .

 Tanguay enjoyed a career season in 2006 – 07 , his first in Calgary , scoring a career @-@ high 81 points in 81 games . He was second on the team in scoring , and led the Flames with 57 assists . Additionally , he played in his 500th career game on February 2 , 2007 , against the Columbus Blue Jackets . The 2007 – 08 season was a difficult one for Tanguay , as speculation that he would not mesh well with new coach Mike Keenan 's style resulted in his being the subject of trade rumours throughout the year . 
 Pre @-@ season fears of a conflict with Keenan were realized , as the coach reduced his time on the power play and forced him into a defensive role he was not comfortable with . Unhappy with being pushed into a checking role , and believing that the way Keenan was using him was not allowing him to give the Flames fair value on his contract , Tanguay requested a trade at the Christmas break . He and general manager Darryl Sutter agreed to keep it quiet so as not to become a distraction to the team , although Tanguay 's request was revealed in the off @-@ season . He suffered offensively , falling to 58 points .

 Tanguay opted to return to Calgary , signing a one @-@ year , $ 1 @.@ 7 million contract for the 2010 – 11 season . He said that the Flames , who were now coached by Brent Sutter , were one of his top choices and that he felt he had unfinished business with the team .

The decision proved successful , as Tanguay re @-@ established himself as one of his team 's top offensive players . He finished second to Jarome Iginla in team scoring with 69 points , and led the Flames with 47 assists .

 M @-@ 142 is a state trunkline highway in The Thumb region of the US state of Michigan . It is a " trans @-@ peninsular " highway in that it travels through an agricultural area from Bay Port on Saginaw Bay to Harbor Beach on Lake Huron . The current trunkline in Huron County was originally parts of other state highways that date back to the initial 1919 signposting of the state highway system in the state . The designation was applied in 1939 , and the road has remained unchanged since it was completely paved in the 1950s . One other highway , near Lake City , carried the number in the 1930s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 142 begins just a few miles south of Bay Port at an intersection with M @-@ 25 near the Bay Port Cemetery , about two @-@ thirds of a mile ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) inland from Saginaw Bay . From there , the road travels eastward through farm country on Pigeon Road . The highway follows a direct course over the Pigeon River to the village of Pigeon , when M @-@ 142 turns south on Main Street to exit town . South of town , the Pigeon Road name resumes , and after about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , M @-@ 142 turns back eastward near the Grand Lawn Cemetery . The road then continues eastward through more farms to Elkton , diverting off a direct course to cross a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway on the east side of town . 
 North of Bad Axe , M @-@ 142 leaves Pigeon Road to turn southward along Van Dyke Road for about mile and a half ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) . Along this section , the highway runs concurrently with M @-@ 53 into town . At the intersection with Huron Avenue , M @-@ 142 turns east and M @-@ 53 turns west , ending the overlap of the two highways . M @-@ 142 exits town and follows Sand Beach Road through farm country . About three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of Bad Axe , M @-@ 142 meets the northern terminus of M @-@ 19 ( <unk> Road ) . Continuing eastward , the highway crosses two branches of the Willow River as it passes through the unincorporated community of Verona . East of that location , the trunkline turns northeasterly , roughly parallel to the Rock Falls Creek , as it angles to Harbor Beach . M @-@ 142 follows State Street through town , and the trunkline terminates at the intersection with M @-@ 25 about a quarter mile ( 0 @.@ 4 km ) west of Lake Huron . 
 Like other state highways in Michigan , M @-@ 142 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . In 2011 , the department 's traffic surveys showed that on average , 8 @,@ 887 vehicles used the highway daily in the city of Bad Axe east of M @-@ 53 and 832 vehicles did so each day between M @-@ 25 and Pigeon , the highest and lowest counts along the highway , respectively .

 When the state highway system was first signed in 1919 , one of the original trunklines was numbered M @-@ 31 , originally running northward from Port Huron to Harbor Beach and then westward to Saginaw . When the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11 , 1926 , M @-@ 31 was decommissioned in favor of alternate numbers . The roadway between Bay Port and Harbor Beach was assigned the M @-@ 83 designation ; Between Bay Port and Bad Axe , the highway was also a part of the contemporary M @-@ 29 . By 1933 , the M @-@ 29 designation was removed when that highway was realigned to follow the Saginaw Bay shoreline and later became parts of an extended US Highway 25 and a new M @-@ 25 . 
 In 1939 , a section of M @-@ 83 was returned to local control , which would have resulted in a discontinuous routing . Segments of the trunkline were absorbed into other existing highways . The former routing of M @-@ 83 from Bay Port , eastward across The Thumb , to Harbor Beach where it met up with US 25 was redesignated M @-@ 142 .

The city 's historical monuments include the Kailasanathar Temple and the Vaikunta Perumal Temple . Historically , Kanchipuram was a centre of education and was known as the <unk> , or " place of learning " .

 = = Etymology = = 
 Kanchipuram was known in early Tamil literature as Kachi or <unk> but was later <unk> to Kanchi or Kanchipuram . According to legend , the name Kanchi is derived from Ka referring to the Hindu god Brahma and <unk> , referring to his worship of Hindu god Vishnu at this place . The earliest inscription from the Maurya period ( 325 – 185 BCE ) denote the city as Kanchipuram , where King <unk> was defeated by <unk> Maurya ( 320 – 298 BCE ) . Patanjali ( 150 BCE or 2nd century BCE ) refers to the city in his <unk> as <unk> . The city was referred to by various Tamil names like Kanchi , <unk> and Sanskrit names like Kanchipuram . The Pallava inscriptions from ( 250 – 355 ) and the inscriptions of the Chalukya dynasty refers the city as <unk> . Jaina Kanchi refers to the area around <unk> <unk> . During the British rule , the city was known as Conjeevaram and later as Kanchipuram . The municipal administration was renamed <unk> , while the district retains the name Kanchipuram . 
 = = History = = 
 While it is widely accepted that Kanchipuram had served as an Early Chola capital , the claim has been contested by Indian historian P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar who wrote that the Tamil culture of the Sangam period did not spread through the Kanchipuram district , and cites the Sanskritic origins of its name in support of his claim . The earliest references to Kanchipuram are found in the books of the Sanskrit grammarian Patanjali , who lived between the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE . The city is believed to have been part of the mythical Dravida Kingdom of the Mahabharatha , and was described as " the best among cities " ( Sanskrit : <unk> Kanchi ) by the 4th @-@ century Sanskrit poet , Kalidasa . The city was regarded as the " Banaras of the South " . 
 Kanchipuram grew in importance when the Pallavas of southern Andhra Pradesh , wary of constant invasions from the north , moved their capital south to the city in the 6th century . The Pallavas fortified the city with ramparts , wide moats , well @-@ laid @-@ out roads , and artistic temples . During the reign of the Pallava King Mahendravarman I , the Chalukya King Pulakesin II ( 610 – 642 ) invaded the Pallava kingdom as far as the Kaveri River . The Pallavas successfully defended Kanchipuram and foiled repeated attempts to capture the city . A second invasion ended disastrously for Pulakesin II , who was forced to retreat to his capital Vatapi which was besieged and Pulakesin II was killed by Narasimhavarman I ( 630 – 668 ) , son of Mahendravarman I ( 600 – 630 ) , at the Battle of Vatapi . Under the Pallavas , Kanchipuram flourished as a centre of Hindu and Buddhist learning . King Narasimhavarman II built the city 's important Hindu temples , the Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple , the Varadharaja Perumal Temple and the <unk> Temple . Xuanzang , a Chinese traveller who visited Kanchipuram in 640 , recorded that the city was 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) in circumference and that its people were renowned for their bravery , piety , love of justice , and veneration for learning . 
 The Medieval Chola king Aditya I conquered the Pallava kingdom , including Kanchipuram , after defeating the Pallava ruler <unk> ( 880 – 897 ) in about 890 . Under the Cholas , the city was the headquarters of the northern viceroyalty . The province was renamed " <unk> <unk> " during the reign of King Raja Raja Chola I ( 985 – 1014 ) , who constructed the <unk> Temple and renovated the Kamakshi Amman Temple . His son , Rajendra Chola I ( 1012 – 44 ) constructed the <unk> Perumal Temple . According to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , Rajendra Chola I brought a band of <unk> with him on his return from the Chola expedition to North India and settled them in Kanchipuram . In about 1218 , the Pandya king Maravarman Sundara Pandyan ( 1216 – 1238 ) invaded the Chola country , making deep inroads into the kingdom which was saved by the intervention of the Hoysala king Vira Narasimha II ( 1220 – 1235 ) , who fought on the side of the Chola king Kulothunga Chola III . Inscriptions indicate the presence of a powerful Hoysala garrison in Kanchipuram , which remained in the city until about <unk> afterwards , Kanchipuram was conquered by the Telugu Cholas , from whom <unk> Sundara Pandyan I took the city in 1258 . The city remained with the Pandyas until 1311 when the <unk> declared independence , taking advantage of the anarchy caused by Malik Kafur 's invasion . After short spells of occupation by <unk> Kulasekhara of Venad ( Quilon , Kerala ) in 1313 – 1314 and the Kakatiya ruler <unk> II , Kanchipuram was conquered by the Vijayanagar general Kumara Kampana , who defeated the Madurai Sultanate in 1361 . 
 The Vijayanagar Empire ruled Kanchipuram from 1361 to 1645 . The earliest inscriptions attesting to Vijayanagar rule are those of Kumara Kampanna from 1364 and 1367 , which were found in the precincts of the Kailasanathar Temple and Varadaraja Perumal Temple respectively . His inscriptions record the re @-@ institution of Hindu rituals in the Kailasanathar Temple that had been abandoned during the Muslim invasions . Inscriptions of the Vijayanagar kings Harihara II , Deva Raya II , Krishna Deva Raya , Achyuta Deva Raya , Sriranga I , and Venkata II are found within the city . Harihara II endowed grants in favour of the Varadaraja Perumal <unk> the 15th century , Kanchipuram was invaded by the Velama Nayaks in 1437 , the Gajapati kingdom in 1463 – 1465 and 1474 – 75 and the Bahmani Sultanate in about 1480 . A 1467 inscription of Virupaksha Raya II mentions a cantonment in the vicinity of Kanchipuram . In 1486 , Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya , the governor of the Kanchipuram region , overthrew the Sangama Dynasty of Vijayanagar and founded the Saluva Dynasty . Like most of his predecessors , Narasimha donated generously to the Varadaraja Perumal Temple . Kanchipuram was visited twice by the Vijayanagar king Krishna Deva Raya , considered to be the greatest of the Vijayanagar rulers , and 16 inscriptions of his time are found in the Varadaraja Perumal Temple . The inscriptions in four languages – Tamil , Telugu , Kannada , and Sanskrit – record the genealogy of the Tuluva kings and their contributions , along with those of their nobles , towards the upkeep of the shrine . His successor , Achyuta Deva Raya , reportedly had himself weighed against pearls in Kanchipuram and distributed the pearls amongst the poor . Throughout the second half of the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries , the Aravidu Dynasty tried to maintain a semblance of authority in the southern parts after losing their northern territories in the Battle of Talikota . Venkata II ( 1586 – 1614 ) tried to revive the Vijayanagar Empire , but the kingdom relapsed into confusion after his death and rapidly fell apart after the Vijayanagar king Sriranga III 's defeat by the Golconda and Bijapur sultanates in 1646 . 
 After the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire , Kanchipuram endured over two decades of political turmoil . The Golconda Sultanate gained control of the city in 1672 , but lost it to Bijapur three years later . In 1676 , Shivaji arrived in Kanchipuram at the invitation of the Golconda Sultanate in order to drive out the Bijapur forces . His campaign was successful and Kanchipuram was held by the Golconda Sultanate until its conquest by the Mughal Empire led by Aurangazeb in October <unk> the course of their southern campaign , the Mughals defeated the Marathas under Sambhaji , the elder son of Shivaji , in a battle near Kanchipuram in 1688 which caused considerable damage to the city but cemented Mughal rule . Soon after , the priests at the Varadaraja Perumal , <unk> and Kamakshi Amman temples , mindful of Aurangazeb 's reputation for iconoclasm , transported the idols to southern Tamil Nadu and did not restore them until after Aurangazeb 's death in 1707 . Under the Mughals , Kanchipuram was part of the viceroyalty of the Carnatic which , in the early 1700s , began to function independently , retaining only a nominal acknowledgement of Mughal rule . The Marathas invaded Kanchipuram during the Carnatic period in 1724 and 1740 , and the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1742 . 
 Kanchipuram was a battlefront for the British East India Company in the Carnatic Wars against the French East India Company and in the Anglo @-@ Mysore Wars with the Sultanate of <unk> popular 1780 Battle of Pollilur of the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War , known for the use of rockets by Hyder Ali of Mysore , was fought in the village of <unk> near Kanchipuram . In 1763 , the British East India Company assumed indirect control from the Nawab of the Carnatic over the erstwhile Chingleput District , comprising the present @-@ day Kanchipuram and <unk> districts , in order to defray the expenses of the Carnatic wars . The Company brought the territory under their direct control during the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War , and the <unk> of Chingleput was created in 1794 . The district was split into two in 1997 and Kanchipuram made the capital of the newly created Kanchipuram district .

 = = Education = = 
 Kanchipuram is traditionally a centre of religious education for the Hindu , Jainism and Buddhism faiths . The Buddhist monasteries acted as nucleus of the Buddhist educational system .

The Pallava kings , <unk> , Mahendra Varman and <unk> ( 550 – 560 ) followed Jainism , until the advent of Nayanmars and Azhwars during the 6th and 7th centuries . Mahendravarman I converted from Jainism to Hinduism under the influence of the <unk> , Appar , was the turning point in the religious geography . The two sects of Hinduism , Saivism and Vaishnavism were revived under the influence of Adi Sankara and Ramanuja respectively . Later Cholas and Vijayanagara kings tolerated Jainism , and the religion was still practised in Kanchi . <unk> / Chandraprabha temple is a twin Jain temple that has inscriptions from Pallava king , Narasimhavarman II and the Chola kings Rajendra Chola I , Kulothunga Chola I and Vikrama Chola , and the Kanarese inscriptions of Krishnadevaraya . The temple is maintained by Tamil Nadu archaeological department . 
 = = = Hinduism = = = 
 Hindus regard Kanchipuram to be one of the seven holiest cities in India , the Sapta Puri . According to Hinduism , a kṣetra is a sacred ground , a field of active power , and a place where final attainment , or moksha , can be obtained . The Garuda Purana says that seven cities , including Kanchipuram are providers of moksha . The city is a pilgrimage site for both Saivites and Vaishnavites . It has close to 108 shiva temples . 
 Ekambareswarar Temple in northern Kanchipuram , dedicated to Shiva , is the largest temple in the city . Its gateway tower , or gopuram , is 59 metres ( 194 ft ) tall , making it one the tallest temple towers in India . The temple is one of five called Pancha Bhoota Stalams , which represent the manifestation of the five prime elements of nature ; land , water , air , sky , and fire . Ekambareswarar temple temple represents earth . 
 Kailasanathar Temple , dedicated to Shiva and built by the Pallavas , is the oldest Hindu temple in existence and is declared an archaeological monument by the Archaeological Survey of India . It has a series of cells with sculptures inside . In the Kamakshi Amman Temple , goddess Parvati is depicted in the form of a yantra , Chakra or <unk> ( basement ) . In this temple , the yantra is placed in front of the deity . Adi Sankara is closely associated with this temple and is believed to have established the Kanchi matha after this temple . 
 <unk> Temple , built by Nandivarman Pallava II ( 720 – 796 ) and <unk> Temple built by Narasimhavarman Pallava II ( 720 – 728 ) are the other Shiva temples from the Pallava period . Kachi <unk> – <unk> Temple , <unk> Tali , Kachi <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Temple in <unk> are the Shiva temples in the city <unk> in Tevaram , the Tamil Saiva canonical work of the 7th – 8th centuries . 
 <unk> Temple , dedicated to Muruga , is located between the Ekambareswarar temple and Kamakshi Amman temple , leading to the cult of Somaskanda ( Skanda , the child between Shiva and Parvati ) . <unk> , the Tamil religious work on Muruga , translated from Sanskrit <unk> , was composed in 1625 by <unk> <unk> in the temple . 
 Varadharaja Perumal Temple , dedicated to Vishnu and covering 23 acres ( 93 @,@ 000 m2 ) , is the largest Vishnu temple in Kanchipuram . It was built by the Cholas in 1053 and was expanded during the reigns of <unk> Chola I ( 1079 – 1120 ) and Vikrama Chola ( 1118 – 1135 ) . It is one of the <unk> , the 108 holy abodes of Vishnu . The temple features carved lizards , one platted with gold and another with silver , over the <unk> of India is said to have presented an emerald necklace to the temple .

 The Kanchi Matha is a Hindu monastic institution , whose official history states that it was founded by Adi Sankara of <unk> , tracing its history back to the 5th century BCE . A related claim is that Adi Sankara came to Kanchipuram , and that he established the Kanchi mutt named " Dakshina <unk> <unk> Sri Kanchi <unk> Peetam " in a position of supremacy , namely <unk> Peetha , over the other mathas ( religious institutions ) of the subcontinent , before his death there . Other historical accounts state that the mutt was established probably in the 18th century in Kumbakonam , as a branch of the Sringeri Matha , and that it declared itself independent . 
 Another mutt which was famous in ancient times was the Upanishad Bramham Mutt , located near Kailasanathar temple , Kanchipuram .

 = The Irascibles = 
 The Irascibles or <unk> 18 were the labels given to a group of American abstract artists who put name to an open letter , written in 1950 , to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art , rejecting the museum 's exhibition American Painting Today - 1950 and boycotting the accompanying competition . The subsequent media coverage of the protest and a now iconic group photograph , that appeared in Life magazine , gave them notoriety , popularised the term Abstract Expressionist and established them as the so @-@ called first generation of the putative movement . 
 = = The emergence of the New York School = = 
 The emergence of abstract art coincided with the invention of Cubism in Paris in the first decade of the 20th Century . Paris remained the centre of gravity for later art movements like Futurism , <unk> , Vorticism , <unk> @-@ Futurism , Dada , Constructivism and Surrealism until the outbreak of World War II and the Nazi persecution of " degenerate art " , which precipitated a mass migration of artists and performers to the United States . New York became home to the transplanted avant @-@ garde . 
 The early 1940s was of particular importance in American art as American scene painting ( Regionalism ) came to be seen as an inadequate mode of artistic expression in a tumultuous time . In 1942 , Peggy Guggenheim , who had fled Europe with her husband , Surrealist artist Max Ernst , opened her gallery Art of This Century , showing European and promising American avant @-@ garde artists . Jackson Pollock had his first one @-@ man show there in 1943 and , in 1945 , Guggenheim showed Mark Rothko . 
 When Guggenheim closed her gallery in 1947 to move to Venice , artists like Pollock had to find new representation . The Betty Parsons Gallery , which opened the previous year , began representing Pollock , Barnett Newman , Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still . Parsons was already representing Adolph Gottlieb , Hedda Sterne and Theodoros Stamos . It was while Pollock showed at Parsons ' gallery that he started making his iconic drip @-@ paintings in 1947 . It was also here that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950 . Rothko , who had arrived at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947 , first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery . 
 At the time , the only galleries who were prepared to show the so @-@ called New York School ( Robert Motherwell 's term ) were Parsons Gallery , the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery . To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster . The highest price paid for a Pollock , before 1947 , was $ 740 and Rothko had peaked with the sale of a $ 120 painting in 1946 . At the Kootz Gallery , from 1946 to 1948 , Hans Hoffman , William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $ 100 and $ 950 , likely fetching much lower actual sales prices . Kootz closed in 1948 as a result of the financial strain . The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine , most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951 . 
 = = The preamble to the protest = = 
 Since January 1943 an agreement existed between the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art on a coalition which would culminate in the combining of their collections of American art in a new building , paid for from the endowment of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney . By this unwritten agreement , the Whitney acquired American art while the Metropolitan concentrated their acquisitions on what they termed classic art . 
 Juliana Force , the Whitney 's director since 1931 until her death on August 28 , 1948 , harboured grave concerns and advocated the abandonment of the coalition . On October 1 , 1948 , the Whitney trustees cited " serious divergences " especially with regard to the showing of advanced trends in art , something the Whitney made a special point of doing . They unilaterally withdrew the Whitney from the coalition . 
 On December 6 , 1948 , the Met announced it would form its own Department of American Art , which it did on January 1 , 1949 . Robert Beverly Hale was appointed as Associate Curator of American Painting and Sculpture and head of the department . A Trustees ' Committee on American Art was set up to advise the Associate Curator . The members of this committee were Elihu Root , Jr . , Chairman , Walter C. Baker , and Sam A. Lewisohn . Lewisohn , although a highly respected collector of Impressionists , was noted for calling avant @-@ garde abstract art " <unk> " . 
 In July 1949 , Roland J. McKinney , formerly Director of the Baltimore Museum of Art and of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , was appointed as a consultant . On his advice , it was decided the The Met would host a series of open national competitive exhibitions with five regional juries . The first of these , American Painting Today - 1950 , was announced as part of a statement of policy on January 1 , 1950 . 
 The five regional juries , meeting respectively in Santa Barbara , Dallas , Chicago , Richmond and New York would make selections , which would be submitted to a National Jury , composed of five regional jurors and two jurors appointment by the Metropolitan .

 In 1948 , William Baziotes , David Hare , Robert Motherwell and Mark Rothko founded the Subjects of the Artist School , which held artists ' discussions in a loft at 35 East Eighth Street , Manhattan which came to be known as Studio 35 . A closed panel symposium took place from April 21 to 23 , 1950 . It was organised by Robert <unk> and moderated by Richard Lippold , Robert Motherwell and Alfred H. Barr , Jr. director of the Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) . The purpose was the framing of an art movement . 
 At the end of the closed session it was suggested by Adolph Gottlieb that the assembled artists protest the conservative bias of the jury for the upcoming competition at the Metropolitan . 
 = = The open letter = = 
 Gottlieb spent the better part of three weeks drafting an open letter to the president of the Metropolitan , conferring with Ad Reinhardt and Barnett Newman while soliciting consensus among other artists by mail or phone . The final version was sent to the individual artists to sign ; 28 doing so . Newman called Jackson Pollock from Gottlieb 's apartment in Brooklyn , asking him to come into the city immediately to sign the letter . Pollock sent a telegram instead : 
 I <unk> THE LETTER <unk> THE <unk> <unk> OF ART 1950 <unk> SHOW STOP <unk> <unk> 
 The letter was underwritten by Jimmy Ernst , Adolph Gottlieb , Robert Motherwell , William Baziotes , Hans Hofmann , Barnett Newman , Clyfford Still , Richard <unk> @-@ Dart , Theodoros Stamos , Ad Reinhardt , Jackson Pollock , Mark Rothko , Bradley Walker Tomlin , Willem de Kooning , Hedda Sterne , James Brooks , Weldon Kees and Fritz <unk> . The supporting sculptors were Herbert Ferber , David Smith , <unk> <unk> , Mary Callery , Day Schnabel , Seymour Lipton , Peter <unk> , Theodore Roszak , David Hare and Louise Bourgeois . 
 On Sunday May 21 , 1950 , Barnett Newman took the signed statement to the city editor of the New York Times . Newman had run for mayor of New York as a write @-@ in candidate in 1933 and knew Monday to be a slow news day at the Times . The statement , entitled OPEN LETTER TO <unk> L. <unk> , dated May 20 , appeared on the front page of the Times of May 22 . 
 Newman told the Times that they were critical of the membership of the five regional juries and especially opposed to the New York jury , the National Jury of Selection and the Jury of Awards . The New York jurors were Charles Burchfield , Yasuo Kuniyoshi , Leon Kroll , Ogden <unk> , Vaclav <unk> and Paul Sample . The national jury consisted of Robert Beverly Hale , Ogden <unk> , Maurice Sterne , Millard Sheets , Howard Cook , Lamar Dodd , Francis Chapin , Zoltan <unk> and Esther Williams . The jury of awards included William M. Milliken , Franklin C. Watkins and Eugene Speicher . 
 = = The resulting polemic = = 
 The first response to the letter came on the editorial page of The Herald Tribune of May 23 , 1950 . The editorial attacked the artists for " distortion of fact " in claiming the Metropolitan had " contempt " for modern painting . The Herald Tribune 's art critic at the time was Emily <unk> . It was widely assumed that she had written the editorial , which gave name to the group . 
 Gottlieb , aided by Newman and Reinhardt , drafted a rebuttal , which was signed by 12 painters and three sculptors , and addressed to the editor of the Tribune . It was never published . Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation , calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Francis Henry Taylor a philistine . Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans , an oblique reference to Taylor 's 1948 comments in the Atlantic Monthly . 
 Instead of soaring like an eagle through the heavens as did his ancestors ... the contemporary artist has been reduced to the status of a flat @-@ chested pelican , strutting upon the intellectual wastelands and beaches , content to take whatever nourishment he can from his own too meager breast . 
 Alfred Barr , seeking to distinguish the MoMA , further electrified the situation by selecting <unk> Gorky , Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock for the American pavilion of the 25th Venice Biennale , held from June to October 1950 . In the June 1950 issue of ARTnews , he referred to the painters as " leaders " of a " predominant vanguard " . Barr 's act signalled to the art world that abstract expressionism should be given serious consideration by museums . 
 On July 3 , 1950 , a group of 75 artists issued a statement via an open letter to the president of the Met , defending the museum . Signers included Milton Avery , Will Barnet , Philip Evergood , Xavier Gonzalez , George Grosz , Henry Koerner , Reginald Marsh , Waldo Peirce , Manfred Schwartz and Harry Sternberg . 
 = = The Life photograph = = 
 Life magazine decided to publish a photo story for their January 15 , 1951 edition , which would document the results of the competition and feature a photograph of the protesters . Life initially wanted to photograph the painters on the steps of the Metropolitan , with their paintings . They refused on the grounds that it would look like they were trying to enter the museum , but were being rebuffed . The magazine capitulated ; art editor for Life , Dorothy <unk> , sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street . They assembled there on November 24 . Only three of the original signatories were absent : Weldon Kees , Hans Hofmann , and Fritz <unk> . Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session . 
 Nina Leen took twelve pictures , of which one appeared in Life . Barnett Newman had insisted that the group be photographed like bankers . The artists were allowed to position themselves . Hedda Sterne , who had arrived late , is seen in the back ( standing on a table ) . She is the only woman in the photograph and would later describe the experience as " probably the worst thing that happened to me " . Painter Lee Krasner believed Sterne was allowed at the insistence of art dealer Betty Parsons , who represented many in the group . 
 They all were very furious that I was in it because they all were sufficiently macho to think that the presence of a woman took away from the seriousness of it all . 
 The caption to the published photograph referred to the group as solemn . It was true that many of the group had reservations at appearing in a mainstream media publication ; Rothko especially . Yet none could have mistaken the consequences of Pollock 's three @-@ page spread in Life of August 8 , 1949 . Pollock 's next show , opening November 21 , 1949 , at Betty Parsons Gallery , was an unmistakable triumph . Famously , Willem de Kooning was heard to say to Milton Resnick : " Look around . These are the big shots . Jackson has finally broken the ice . " In the ensuing year , Betty Parsons sent Pollock checks totalling $ 6 @,@ 508 @.@ 23 on gross sales of over $ 10 @,@ 000 , at a time when more than two thirds of American families lived on less than $ 4 @,@ 000 per year . Pollock seems to have been invited to sign the Studio 35 open letter , at least in part , because of his notoriety , almost entirely attributable to the Life article . In the end the sitting was an uncomfortable accommodation between the system of values under which the artists had laboured and their desire for career success . 
 I think they loved having their pictures taken , but they seemed to be afraid to be nice - they didn 't want to appear too commercial . 
 = = The legacy of the polemic = = 
 The subsequent Life article did more than provide the public with an image of the group , looking more like bankers than irascible . It placed the picture larger and before the pictures of the Metropolitans competition winning art works . It also reiterated the word advanced , echoing the Madison Avenue advertising speak of the day . The picture caption also referred to the protest as in keeping with avant @-@ garde tradition , mentioning the Salon des Refusés of 1863 and the Ashcan School . 
 Irving Sandler , a historian of the New York School and Abstract Expressionism wrote that the Leen photograph " has become the image whereby we <unk> the artists who achieved the triumph of American painting " . 
 The artists ' discomfort with being labelled , individually or as a group , was clear . At the end of the three @-@ day symposium at Studio 35 in 1950 , Alfred Barr challenged the group to name themselves , to which de Kooning responded : " it is disastrous to name ourselves " . Pollock , on his part , refused to sign the Times letter unless it was clear that they were not a group ; it is noteworthy that he did not . 
 Despite their subsequent labels as Abstract Expressionist , action painters and so forth , this is a picture of a group that never was a group , a picture of fifteen individuals , unified only by the click of a camera at a particular time and place . 
 Already in 1951 , relationships had deteriorated enough for Pollock , Newman , Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons with the idea of showing them exclusively , effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves . She declined the offer . Over the following three years Pollock , Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery . After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art , Newman did not show in New York again until 1959 . 
 In 1954 , Ad Reinhardt engaged in a public ridiculing of Rothko , Newman , de Kooning , Gottlieb and Still , resulting in Newman suing him for libel . Clyfford Still repudiated Mark Rothko for " living an evil , an untrue life " . " It all went from love to hate in four years " , Betty Parsons recalled in 1975 . 
 Nina Leen 's 1951 Life photograph has become the touchstone for canonical lists of the New York School . Irving Sandler used it as the frontispiece and rear dust jacket photograph of his The Triumph of American Painting : A History of Abstract Expressionism , published in 1970 . This book defined Abstract Expressionism for a generation of scholars . 
 = Battle of Borovo Selo = 
 The Battle of Borovo Selo on 2 May 1991 ( known in Croatia as the Borovo Selo massacre , Croatian : Pokolj u <unk> <unk> and in Serbia as the Borovo Selo incident , Serbian : <unk> у <unk> <unk> ) was one of the first armed clashes in the conflict which became known as the Croatian War of Independence . The clash was precipitated by months of rising ethnic tensions and armed combat in Pakrac and at the Plitvice Lakes in March . The immediate cause for the confrontation in the heavily ethnic Serb village of Borovo Selo , just north of Vukovar , was a failed attempt to replace a Yugoslav flag in the village with a Croatian one . The unauthorised effort by four Croatian policemen resulted in the capture of two by a Croatian Serb militia in the village . To retrieve the captives , Croatian authorities deployed additional police , who drove into an ambush . At least twelve Croatian policemen and an unknown number of Serbs were killed in the battle before the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) intervened and stopped the fighting . 
 The confrontation resulted in a further deterioration of the overall situation in Croatia , leading Croats and Serbs to accuse each other of overt aggression and of being enemies of their nation . For Croatia , the event was provocative because the bodies of some of the dead Croat policemen killed in the incident were reportedly mutilated . The clash in Borovo Selo eliminated any hopes that the escalating conflict could be defused politically and made the war almost inevitable . The Presidency of Yugoslavia met days after the fighting and authorised the JNA to deploy to the area to prevent further conflict but despite this deployment , skirmishes persisted in the region . After the war , a former Serb irregular was convicted of war crimes for his role in abusing the two captured policemen , and ultimately sentenced to three years in prison . Four others were indicted in absentia but remain at large outside Croatia . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( Hrvatska demokratska zajednica – HDZ ) , ethnic tensions between Serbs and Croats worsened . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated the weapons of Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) in order to minimise the possibility of violence following the elections . On 17 August , inter @-@ ethnic tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin , and parts of Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia . In July 1990 , local Serbs established a Serbian National Council to coordinate opposition to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman 's policy of pursuing Croatian independence from Yugoslavia . Milan Babić , a dentist from Knin , was elected president of the council , while Knin 's police chief , Milan Martić , established a number of paramilitary militias . The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the Serb Autonomous Oblast of Krajina ( SAO Krajina ) , a self @-@ declared state incorporating the Serb @-@ inhabited areas of Croatia . In March 1991 , SAO Krajina authorities , backed by the government of Serbia , began consolidating control over the Serb @-@ populated areas of Croatia , resulting in a bloodless skirmish in Pakrac and the first fatalities in the Plitvice Lakes incident . 
 At the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . In an effort to bolster its defence , it doubled the number of police personnel to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the police force was the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police , which was deployed in twelve military @-@ style battalions . In addition , Croatia had 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police officers organised in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In 1991 , the village of Borovo Selo , situated on the right bank of the Danube opposite Serbia , was a part of the Vukovar municipality . While the city of Vukovar itself had an ethnically mixed population ( 47 @.@ 2 percent Croats and 32 @.@ 2 percent Serbs ) , smaller settlements in the area were more homogenous . Fourteen were predominantly populated by Croats , ten ( including Borovo Selo ) were inhabited primarily by Serbs , two by Ruthenians and the remaining two were ethnically mixed . 
 Amid the worsening ethnic tensions , Borovo Selo was barricaded on 1 April , one day after the Plitvice Lakes clash . Two days later , the JNA garrison in Vukovar increased its combat readiness to the maximum level . In early spring , the Croats and Serbs reached an agreement whereby Croatian police would not enter Borovo Selo without explicit consent from local Serb authorities . A political rally was held in Borovo Selo on 14 April , and by the end of the month the situation had become more volatile . Speakers at the rally — Serbian Radical Party ( Srpska radikalna stranka – SRS ) leader Vojislav Šešelj , Serbian National Assembly member Milan <unk> and Serbian Minister of Diaspora Stanko <unk> — promoted the creation of Greater Serbia , a state which would unite all Serbs within a single country . They all repeated their speeches , together with an open call for dissenting Croats to be killed , a week later in <unk> , north of Osijek . In addition , White Eagles paramilitaries arrived in Borovo Selo in mid @-@ April at the request of Borovo Selo militia commander Vukašin Šoškoćanin . The paramilitaries were armed by the Serbian police directly , or the SAO Krajina @-@ aligned local militia under the approval of Serbian officials . By the end of April 1991 , the White Eagles in Borovo Selo were joined by Dušan Silni paramilitaries , who were linked to the Serbian National Renewal party . 
 In mid @-@ April , three Armbrust rockets were fired from Croatian positions outside Borovo Selo into the village with the specific aim of inflaming ethnic tensions . One of the rockets hit a house and another landed in a field , failing to explode . There were no casualties , but the already tense situation was made worse when the unexploded rocket was shown on Serbian Television as evidence of Croatian aggression against Serbs . The rockets were fired by a group of men including Gojko Šušak , a high @-@ ranking HDZ official who later became Croatia 's Defence Minister . The men were led to the site by Osijek police chief Josip Reihl @-@ Kir , who was later murdered by Croat irregulars . Šušak later claimed he had nothing to do with the incident but had been in the area at the time . Croatia 's interior minister Josip Boljkovac said the group included Šušak , Branimir Glavaš and Vice <unk> .

 During the evening of 1 May 1991 , four Croatian policemen entered Borovo Selo in an unauthorised attempt to replace a Yugoslav flag in the village with a Croatian one . The attempt resulted in an armed clash . Two of the policemen were wounded and taken prisoner , and the other two fled after sustaining minor injuries ( one a wounded foot and the other a grazing wound to the head ) . According to the Croatian Ministry of the Interior , the police had been patrolling the Dalj – Borovo Selo road at the time of the incident . Even though the officers were assigned to the Osijek police administration , the Vinkovci police administration — which was assigned authority over the Vukovar municipality — asked the Vukovar police station to contact Šoškoćanin about the incident . Vukovar police contacted him at 4 : 30 a.m. , but Šoškoćanin reportedly said he knew nothing . At 9 : 00 a.m. , Vinkovci police chief Josip <unk> telephoned Šoškoćanin and received the same answer . When Reihl @-@ Kir contacted Šoškoćanin half an hour later , the latter confirmed the incident and said the police had shot at members of the local population , wounding one . Reihl @-@ Kir failed to secure the release of the two captured officers . 
 Reihl @-@ Kir and <unk> concluded that a party should be sent to Borovo Selo , and Šoškoćanin agreed to grant the police safe passage under a white flag . However , when the force of between 20 and 30 policemen entered Borovo Selo under the white flag , they were ambushed by paramilitaries and members of a local militia . Approximately 150 police arrived from Osijek and Vinkovci on buses and were deployed as reinforcements . The force dispatched from Vinkovci entered Borovo Selo and was ambushed , while the reinforcements sent from Osijek via Dalj were stopped at a roadblock north of Borovo Selo and failed to enter the village . A firefight ensued and lasted until 2 : 30 p.m. , when seven JNA armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) moved into the village from Dalj . Another convoy of APCs deployed by the JNA through Borovo Naselje , just south of Borovo Selo , was stopped by a crowd of Croat women who refused to let them through . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 At least a dozen Croatian policemen were killed and 21 injured in the ambush . The two captured policemen were ferried across the Danube and transported to Novi Sad , but were released and returned to Osijek by the evening of 2 May . Several Serbs in Borovo Selo were also killed in the fighting , but the exact figure was never officially released . Sources disagree on the number of Serb casualties . The figure ranges from three dead , to 17 militiamen and 20 civilians killed . Šešelj said only one civilian died in Borovo Selo , while a 22 @-@ strong defending force he led in the battle killed 100 policemen . Residents of Borovo Selo interviewed by reporters said 13 policemen were killed after they took women and children hostage and that the residents defeated the police unassisted , freeing the hostages and sustaining one fatality . 
 Some of the police killed at Borovo Selo were found to have been mutilated ; their ears were cut , their eyes gouged out and their throats slit . These acts were meant to inflame ethnic hatred . The clash led Tuđman 's advisers to advocate an immediate declaration of independence from Yugoslavia and retaliation against the JNA , which Croats viewed as being pro @-@ Serb . On 3 May , Tuđman opined that Croatia and Serbia were virtually at war , but said he hoped the international community would stop the violence . The outcome of the fighting reinforced the cautious approach of the Croatian leadership towards long @-@ term decisions . According to Croatian historian Davor Marijan , Tuđman 's decision not to retaliate against the JNA was often interpreted at the time as cowardice bordering treason , leading to public criticism and the resignation of General Martin Špegelj from the post of Defence Minister . Nonetheless , the decision afforded Croatia much @-@ needed time to prepare for war , as Yugoslav Navy Fleet Admiral Branko <unk> later acknowledged . The incident shocked the Croatian public , causing a massive shift in public opinion towards demonization of Serbs , supported by the Croatian media . Serbs were collectively labelled " Chetniks " , " terrorists " and " enemies of Croatia " . Similarly , Serbs referred to Croats as " Ustaše " and " enemies of the Serb people " . Hence , chances for a political settlement to avoid all @-@ out war were greatly reduced . After the clash , war appeared unavoidable . 
 On 8 – 9 May , the Presidency of Yugoslavia met to discuss the events in Borovo Selo and a JNA request for military intervention . Presidents of all Yugoslav constituent republics were present at the meeting , where the Croatian leadership accepted the decision to deploy the JNA in crisis areas of Croatia . On 9 May , representatives of the federal and Croatian governments visited Vukovar . The federal representatives also visited Borovo Selo , unlike the Croatian government officials who stated that they " refused to talk to terrorists " . In response to the Borovo Selo clash , the JNA redeployed a part of the 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade from Osijek and the 1st Mechanised Battalion of the 453rd Mechanised Brigade based in Sremska Mitrovica to the Vukovar area . At the same time , the 2nd Mechanised Battalion of the 36th Mechanised Brigade was moved from Subotica to Vinkovci . Despite the deployment of the JNA in the area , ethnically motivated skirmishes persisted until the start of the Battle of Vukovar in late August . 
 = = = Memorial controversy and prosecution = = = 
 During the 1996 – 98 United Nations administration established pursuant to the Erdut Agreement to restore the area to Croatian control , three Croatian non @-@ governmental organizations erected a memorial on public property at the entrance to Borovo Selo , but the site was quickly vandalised . A new monument was erected in the centre of the village in 2002 , but this was also vandalised soon after completion . A new plaque bearing the names of the 12 Croatian policemen killed in the incident was added to the monument in 2012 , but was also subject to vandalism . Although the vandalism was condemned by local Serb politicians , they complained that the memorial was offensive to the Serb minority and imposed guilt on the entire community because it branded Serb forces at Borovo Selo in 1991 as " Serb terrorists " . 
 In February 2012 , an Osijek court convicted Milan <unk> of war crimes and sentenced him to 3 ½ years in prison for mistreating the two captured Croatian police officers . In 2014 , <unk> 's sentence was reduced to three years on appeal . Four other men were indicted in relation to the officers ' mistreatment , but all four live outside Croatia , and are not subject to prosecution by the Croatian judiciary . 
 = Félix Houphouët @-@ Boigny = 
 Félix Houphouët @-@ Boigny ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] or [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; 18 October 1908 – 7 December 1993 ) , affectionately called Papa Houphouët or Le Vieux ( The Old One ) , was the first President of Côte d 'Ivoire ( 1960 to 1993 ) , serving for more than three decades until his death . A tribal chief , he worked as a medical aide , union leader , and planter before being elected to the French Parliament . He served in several ministerial positions within the French government before leading Côte d 'Ivoire following independence in 1960 . Throughout his life , he played a significant role in politics and the decolonization of Africa . 
 Under Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's politically moderate leadership , Côte d 'Ivoire prospered economically . This success , uncommon in poverty @-@ ridden West Africa , became known as the " Ivorian miracle " and was due to a combination of sound planning , the maintenance of strong ties with the West ( particularly France ) , and development of the country 's significant coffee and cocoa industries . However , the exploitation of the agricultural sector caused difficulties in 1980 , after a sharp drop in the prices of coffee and cocoa . 
 Throughout his presidency , Houphouët @-@ Boigny maintained a close relationship with France , a policy known as Françafrique , and he built a close friendship with Jacques Foccart , the chief adviser on African policy in the de Gaulle and Pompidou governments . He aided the conspirators who ousted Kwame Nkrumah from power in 1966 , took part in the coup against Mathieu Kérékou in 1977 , and was suspected of involvement in the 1987 coup that removed Thomas Sankara from power in Burkina Faso . Houphouët @-@ Boigny maintained a strong anti @-@ communist foreign policy , which resulted in , among other things , severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1969 ( after first establishing relations in 1967 ) and refusing to recognise the People 's Republic of China until 1983 . He provided assistance to UNITA , a United States @-@ supported , anti @-@ communist rebel movement in Angola . In 1986 he re @-@ established relations with the Soviet Union , shortly before the fall of its confederation . 
 In the West , Houphouët @-@ Boigny was commonly known as the " Sage of Africa " or the " Grand Old Man of Africa " . Houphouët @-@ Boigny moved the country 's capital from Abidjan to his hometown of Yamoussoukro and built the world 's largest church there , the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro , at a cost of US $ 300 million . At the time of his death , he was the longest @-@ serving leader in Africa 's history and the third longest @-@ serving leader in the world , after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il @-@ sung of North Korea . In 1989 , UNESCO created the Félix Houphouët @-@ Boigny Peace Prize for the " safeguarding , maintaining and seeking of peace " . After his death , conditions in Côte d 'Ivoire quickly deteriorated . From 1994 until 2002 , there were a number of coups d 'état , a currency devaluation , an economic recession , and , beginning in 2002 , a civil war . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Birth , childhood and education = = = 
 According to his official biography , Houphouët @-@ Boigny was probably born on 18 October 1908 , in Yamoussoukro to a family of hereditary chiefs of the Baoulé people . Unofficial accounts , however , place his birth date up to seven years earlier . Born into the animist <unk> tribe , he was named Dia Houphouët : his first name Dia means " prophet " or " magician . " His father was N <unk> Houphouët . Dia Houphouët was the great @-@ nephew through his mother of Queen <unk> and the village chief , <unk> N <unk> . When N <unk> was murdered in 1910 , Dia was named to succeed him as chief . Due to his young age , his stepfather <unk> <unk> ruled as regent until Dia came of age ; Dia 's father had already died . 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny descended from tribal chiefs through his mother , <unk> N <unk> ( also known as N ’ Dri Kan ) . She died much later in 1936 . Doubts remain as to the identity of his father , N <unk> . Officially a native of the N ’ <unk> of <unk> tribe , N ’ Doli Houphouët died shortly after the birth of his son Augustin , although no reliable information regarding his death exists . This uncertainty has given rise to rumors , including a widespread one that his father was a Sudanese @-@ born Muslim named Cissé . Houphouët @-@ Boigny had two elder sisters , <unk> ( 1898 ? – 1998 ) and <unk> ( d . 1987 ) , as well as a younger brother Augustin ( d . 1939 ) . 
 The French colonial administration recognised tribal leaders ; they arranged to have Houphouët go to school at the military post in <unk> , not far from his village , in order to prepare for his future as a leader , despite strenuous objections from relatives , especially his great @-@ aunt <unk> . In 1915 , he was transferred to the école <unk> supérieure ( secondary ) at <unk> in spite of his family 's reluctance to have him go to boarding school . The same year , at <unk> , Houphouët converted to Christianity ; he considered it a modern religion and an obstacle to the spread of Islam . He chose to be christened Félix . 
 First in his class , Houphouët was accepted into the École William Ponty in 1919 , and earned a teaching degree . In 1921 , he attended the École de <unk> de l <unk> ( French West Africa School of Medicine ) in French Senegal , where he came first in his class in 1925 and qualified as a medical assistant . As he never completed his studies in medicine , he could qualify only as a <unk> <unk> , a poorly paid doctor . 
 = = = Medical career = = = 
 On 26 October 1925 , Houphouët began his career as a doctor 's aide at a hospital in Abidjan , where he founded an association of indigenous medical personnel . This undertaking proved short @-@ lived as the colonial administration viewed it unsympathetically , considering it a trade union . As a consequence , they decided to move Houphouët to a lesser hospital in <unk> on 27 April 1927 . After he proved his considerable talents , however , he was promoted on 17 September 1929 to a post in Abengourou , which until then had been reserved for Europeans . At Abengourou , Houphouët witnessed the mistreatment of indigenous cocoa farmers by the colonists . 
 In 1932 , he decided to act , leading a movement of farmers against the influential white landowners and for the economic policies of the colonial government , who favoured the farmers . On 22 December , he published an article titled " On nous a trop <unk> " ( They have stolen too much from us ) , in the Trait d <unk> , an Ivorian socialist newspaper . It was published under a pseudonym . 
 The following year , Houphouët was called by his tribe to assume the responsibilities of village chief . Preferring to pursue his medical career , he relinquished the office to his younger brother Augustin . Wishing to live closer to his village , he obtained a transfer to <unk> on 3 February 1934 and then to <unk> on 28 June 1936 . While Houphouët had displayed professional qualities , his attitude had chafed those around him . As a result , in September 1938 , his clinical director demanded that he choose between his job as a doctor and his involvement in local politics . The choice was quickly made for him : his brother died in 1939 , and Houphouët became chef de canton ( an office created by the colonial administration to collect taxes ) . Due to this , Houphouët ended his medical career the next year . 
 = = = First marriage = = = 
 In 1930 , Houphouët married <unk> Racine Sow ( 1913 – 2006 ) in Abengourou ; their union was controversial because he was a practising Catholic and she was the daughter of a wealthy Muslim from Senegal . The families of the two eventually overcame their opposition and accepted the interfaith union , the first ever celebrated in Côte d 'Ivoire . The couple had five children : Felix ( who died in infancy ) , Augustine , Francis , Guillaume and Marie , all raised as Catholics . 
 = = = Chef de canton and union leader = = = 
 By becoming chef de canton , Houphouët assumed responsibility for the administration of <unk> , a canton which comprised 36 villages . He also took charge of the family plantation — at the time one of the most important in the country — and worked to diversify its rubber , cocoa and coffee crops . He soon became one of Africa 's richest farmers . On 3 September 1944 , he established , in cooperation with the colonial administration , the African Agricultural Union ( Syndicat agricole <unk> , SAA ) . Under his presidency , the SAA brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their working conditions and worked to protect their interests against those of European planters . Anti @-@ colonialist and anti @-@ racist , the organisation demanded better working conditions , higher wages , and the abolition of unfree labor . The union quickly received the support of nearly 20 @,@ 000 plantation workers , together with that of the left @-@ wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government . Its success irritated colonists to the extent that they took legal action against Houphouët , accusing him of being anti @-@ French for never seeking French citizenship . However , Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies , who ordered the charges dropped . They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André <unk> with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit . 
 Houphouët entered electoral politics in August 1945 , when elections for the Abidjan city council were held for the first time . The French electoral rules established a common roll : half of the elected would have to be French citizens ( who were mostly Europeans ) and the other half non @-@ citizens . Houphouët reacted by creating a multi @-@ ethnic all @-@ African roll with both non @-@ citizens and citizens ( mostly Senegalese with French citizenship ) . As a result , most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining , thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc . 
 In October 1945 , Houphouët moved onto the national political scene ; the French government decided to represent its colonies in the <unk> constituante ( English : Constituent Assembly ) and gave Côte d 'Ivoire and Upper Volta two representatives in Parliament combined . One of these would represent the French citizens and another would represent the indigenous population , but the suffrage was limited to less than 1 % of the population . In an attempt to block Houphouët , the governor de Mauduit supported a rival candidature , and provided him the full backing of the administration . Despite that and thanks to the SAA 's strong organization , Houphouët , running for the indigenous seat , easily came first with a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ vote majority . He failed , however , to obtain an absolute majority , due to the large number of candidates running . Houphouët emerged victorious again in the second round of elections held on 4 November 1945 , in which he narrowly defeated an Upper <unk> candidate with 12 @,@ 980 votes out of a total of 31 @,@ 081 . At this point , he decided to add " Boigny " to his surname , meaning " irresistible force " in Baoulé and symbolizing his role as a leader .

 = = = Member of Parliament = = = 
 In taking his seat at the National Assembly in the Palais Bourbon alongside compatriots Ouezzin Coulibaly and <unk> <unk> , Houphouët @-@ Boigny had to first decide with which group to side , and he opted for the Mouvement <unk> de la Résistance ( <unk> ) , a small party composed of Communist sympathizers but not formal members of the Communist Party . He was appointed a member of the Commission des <unk> d <unk> @-@ mer ( Commission of Overseas Territories ) . During this time , he worked to implement the wishes of the SAA , in particular proposing a bill to abolish forced labor — the single most unpopular feature of French rule . The Assembly adopted this bill , known as Loi Houphouët @-@ Boigny , on 11 April 1946 , greatly enhancing the author 's prestige not only in his country . On 3 April 1946 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny proposed to unify labour regulations in the territories of Africa ; this would eventually be completed in 1952 . Finally , on 27 September 1946 , he filed a report on the public health system of overseas territories , calling for its reformation . Houphouët @-@ Boigny in his parliamentary tenure supported the idea of a union of French territories . 
 As the first constitution proposed by the Constituent Assembly was rejected by the voters , new elections were held in 1946 for a second constituent assembly . For these elections Houphouët @-@ Boigny organized on 9 April 1946 , with the help of the Groupes d <unk> <unk> ( English : Communist Study Groups ) , the Democratic Party of Côte d 'Ivoire ( PDCI ) , whose structure closely followed that of the SAA . It immediately became the first successful independent African party when the new party Houphouët @-@ Boigny easily swept the elections with 21 @,@ 099 out of 37 @,@ 888 votes , his opponents obtaining only a few hundred votes each . In this he was helped by the recall of Governor <unk> , whose predecessor had been fired by the Overseas Minister Marius Moutet for his opposition to the abolition of the <unk> . 
 With his return to the assembly he was appointed to the Commission du <unk> et du suffrage <unk> ( Commission for Regulation of Universal Suffrage ) ; as secretary of the commission from 1947 to 1948 , he proposed on 18 February 1947 to reform French West Africa ( AOF ) , French Equatorial Africa ( AEF ) , and the French territories ' federal council to better represent the African peoples . He also called for the creation of local assemblies in Africa so that Africans could learn how to be autonomous . 
 = = = Foundation of the RDA and Communist alliance = = = 
 During the holding of the second Constituent Assembly the African representatives witnessed a strong reaction against the colonial liberalism that had been embedded in the rejected constitution drafted by the previous assembly . The new text , approved by the voters on 13 October 1946 , reduced the African representatives from 30 to 24 , and reduced the number of those entitled to vote ; also , a large number of colonial topics were left in which the executive could govern by decree , and supervision over the colonial administration remained weak . Reacting to what they felt was a betrayal of the <unk> 's and the Socialists ' promises , the African deputies concluded they needed to build a permanent coalition independent from the French parties . Houphouët @-@ Boigny was the first to propose this to his African colleagues , and obtained their full support for a founding congress to be held in October at Bamako in French Sudan . The French government did all it could to sabotage the congress , and in particular the Socialist Overseas Minister was successful in persuading the African Socialists , who were originally among the promoters , from attending . This ultimately backfired , radicalizing those convened ; when they founded the African Democratic Rally ( RDA ) as an inter @-@ territorial political movement , it was the pro @-@ Communist Gabriel d <unk> who dominated the congress . The new movement 's goal was to free " Africa from the colonial yoke by the affirmation of her personality and by the association , freely agreed to , of a union of nations " . Its first president , confirmed several times subsequently , was Houphouët @-@ Boigny , while secretary @-@ general became d <unk> . As part of the bringing of the territorial parties in the organization , the PDCI became the <unk> branch of the RDA . 
 Too small to form their own parliamentary group , the African deputies were compelled to join one of the larger parties in order to sit together in the Palais Bourbon . Thus , the RDA soon joined the French Communist Party ( PCF ) as the only openly anti @-@ colonialist political faction and soon organised strikes and boycotts of European imports . Houphouët @-@ Boigny justified the alliance because it seemed , at the time , to be the only way for his voice to be heard : " Even before the creation of RDA , the alliance had served our cause : in March 1946 , the abolition of compulsory labour was adopted unanimously , without a vote , thanks to our tactical alliance . " 
 As the Cold War set in , the alliance with the Communists became increasingly damaging for the RDA . The French colonial administration showed itself increasingly hostile toward the RDA and its president , whom the administration called a " Stalinist " . Tensions reached their height at the beginning of 1950 , when , following an outbreak of anti @-@ colonial violence , almost the entire PDCI leadership was arrested ; Houphouët @-@ Boigny managed to slip away shortly before police arrived at his house . Although Houphouët @-@ Boigny would have been saved by his parliamentary immunity , his missed arrest was popularly attributed to his influence and his prestige . In the ensuing chaos , riots broke out in Côte d 'Ivoire ; the most significant of which was a clash with the police at <unk> in which 13 Africans were killed and 50 wounded . According to official figures , by 1951 a total of 52 Africans had been killed , several hundred wounded and around 3 @,@ 000 arrested ( numbers which , according to an opinion reported by journalist Ronald Segal in African Profiles , are certainly underestimated ) . In order to defuse the crisis , Prime Minister René Pleven entrusted the France 's Minister for Overseas Territories , François Mitterrand , with the task of detaching the RDA from the PCF , and in fact an official alliance between the RDA and Mitterrand 's party , the <unk> , was established in 1952 . Knowing he was at an impasse , in October 1950 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny agreed to break the Communist alliance . Asked in an undated interview why he worked with the communists , Houphouët @-@ Boigny replied : " I , a bourgeois landowner , I would preach the class struggle ? That is why we aligned ourselves with the Communist Party , without joining it . " 
 = = = Rehabilitation and entry into government = = = 
 In the 1951 elections , the number of seats was reduced from three to two ; while Houphouët @-@ Boigny still won a seat , the other RDA candidate , Ouezzin Coulibaly , did not . All in all , the RDA only garnered 67 @,@ 200 of 109 @,@ 759 votes in that election , and the party in direct opposition to it captured a seat . On 8 August 1951 , Boigny , speaking at René Pleven 's inauguration as president of the board , denied being the leader of a communist group ; he was not believed until the RDA 's 1952 affiliation with <unk> . On the 24th of that same month , Boigny delivered a statement in the Assembly contesting the result of the elections , which he declared tainted by fraud . He also denounced what he saw as the exploitation of overseas deputies as " voting machines " , who , as political pawns , supported the colonial government 's every action . Thereafter , Houphouët @-@ Boigny and the RDA were briefly unsuccessful before their success was renewed in 1956 ; at that year 's elections , the party received 502 @,@ 711 of 579 @,@ 550 votes cast . From then on , his relationship with Communism was forgotten , and he was embraced as a moderate . Named as a member of the Committees on Universal Suffrage ( distinct from the aforementioned committee regulating said suffrage ) , Constitutional Laws , Rules and Petitions . On 1 February 1956 , he was appointed Minister Discharging the Duties of the Presidency of the Council in the government of Guy Mollet , a post he held until 13 June 1957 . This marked the first time an African was elected to such a senior position in the French government . His principal achievement in this role was the creation of an organisation of Saharan regions that would help ensure sustainability for the French Union and counter Moroccan territorial claims in the Sahara . 
 On 6 November 1957 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny became Minister of Public Health and Population in the Gaillard administration and attempted to reform the public health code . He had previously served as Minister of State under Maurice <unk> @-@ <unk> ( 13 June – 6 November 1957 ) . Following his Gaillard ministry , he was again appointed Minister of State from 14 May 1958 ; – 20 May 1959 . In this capacity , he participated in the development of France 's African policy , notably in the cultural domain . At his behest , the Bureau of French Overseas Students and the University of Dakar were created . On 4 October 1958 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny was one of the signatories , along with de Gaulle , of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic . The last post he held in France was Minister @-@ Counsellor in the Michel Debré government , from 23 July 1959 to 19 May 1961 .

 Until the mid @-@ 1950s , French colonies in west and central Africa were grouped within two federations : French Equatorial Africa ( AEF ) and French West Africa ( AOF ) . Côte d 'Ivoire was part of the AOF , financing roughly two thirds of its budget . Wishing to free the country from the guardianship of the AOF , Houphouët @-@ Boigny advocated an Africa made up of nations that would generate wealth rather than share poverty and misery . He participated actively in the drafting and adoption of the framework of the <unk> Loi Cadre , a French legal reform which , in addition to granting autonomy to African colonies , would break the ties that bound the different territories together , giving them more autonomy by means of local assemblies . The <unk> Loi Cadre was far from unanimously accepted by Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's compatriots in Africa : Léopold Sédar Senghor , leader of Senegal , was the first to speak out against this attempted " <unk> " of Africa , arguing that the colonial territories " do not correspond to any reality : be it geographical , economic , ethnic , or linguistic " . Senghor argued that maintaining the AOF would give the territories stronger political credibility and would allow them to develop harmoniously as well as emerge as a genuine people . This view was shared by most members of the African Democratic Rally , who backed Ahmed Sékou Touré and Modibo Keïta , placing Houphouët @-@ Boigny in the minority at the 1957 congress in Bamako . 
 Following the adoption of the Loi Cadre reform on 23 June 1956 , a territorial election was held in Côte d 'Ivoire on 3 March 1957 , in which the PDCI — transformed under Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's firm control into a political machine — won many seats . Houphouët @-@ Boigny , who was already serving as a minister in France , as President of the Territorial Assembly and as mayor of Abidjan , chose Auguste Denise to serve as Vice President of the Government Council of Côte d 'Ivoire , even though Houphouët @-@ Boigny remained , the only interlocutor in the colony for France . Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's popularity and influence in France 's African colonies had become so pervasive that one French magazine claimed that by 1956 , the politician 's photograph " was in all the huts , on the lapels of coats , on the <unk> of African women and even on the handlebars of bicycles " . 
 On 7 April 1957 , the Prime Minister of Ghana , Kwame Nkrumah , on a visit to Côte d 'Ivoire , called on all colonies in Africa to declare their independence ; Houphouët @-@ Boigny retorted to Nkrumah : 
 Your experience is rather impressive ... But due to the human relationships between the French and the Africans , and because in the 20th century , people have become interdependent , we considered that it would perhaps be more interesting to try a new and different experience than yours and unique in itself , one of a Franco @-@ African community based on equality and fraternity . 
 Unlike many African leaders who immediately demanded independence , Houphouët @-@ Boigny wished for a careful transition within the " ensemble français " because , according to him , political independence without economic independence was worthless . He also invited Nkrumah to meet up with him in 10 years to see which one of the two had chosen the best approach toward independence . 
 On 28 September 1958 Charles de Gaulle proposed a constitutional referendum to the Franco @-@ African community : the territories were given the choice of either supporting the constitution or proclaiming their independence and being cut off from France . For Houphouët @-@ Boigny , the choice was simple : " Whatever happens , Côte d 'Ivoire will enter directly to the Franco @-@ African community . The other territories are free to group between themselves before joining . " Only Guinea chose independence ; its leader , Ahmed Sékou Touré , opposed Houphouët @-@ Boigny , stating that his preference was " freedom in poverty over wealth in slavery " . The referendum produced the French Community , an institution meant to be an association of free republics which had jurisdiction over foreign policy , defense , currency , common ethnic and financial policy , and strategic raw materials . 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny was determined to stop the hegemony of Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and Senegalese leaders . Houphouët @-@ Boigny refused to participate in the Inter @-@ African conference in Dakar on 31 December 1958 , which was intended to lay the foundation for the Federation of Francophone African States . Although that federation was never realised , Senegal and Mali ( known at the time as French Sudan ) formed their own political union , the Mali Federation . After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny tried to sabotage the federation 's efforts to wield political control ; in cooperation with France , he managed to convince Upper Volta , Dahomey , and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation , before it collapsed in August 1960 . 
 Two months after the 1958 referendum , seven member states of French West Africa , including Côte d 'Ivoire , became autonomous republics within the French Community . Houphouët @-@ Boigny had won his first victory against those supporting federalism . This victory established the conditions that made the future " Ivorian miracle " possible , since between 1957 and 1959 , budget revenues grew by 158 % , reaching 21 @,@ 723 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 CFA francs .

 Houphouët @-@ Boigny officially became the head of the government of Côte d 'Ivoire on 1 May 1959 . Although he faced no opposition from rival parties and the PDCI became the de facto party of the state in 1957 , he was confronted by opposition from his own government . Radical nationalists , led by Jean @-@ Baptiste Mockey , openly opposed the government 's Francophile policies . In an attempt to solve this problem , Houphouët @-@ Boigny decided to exile Mockey in September 1959 , claiming that Mockey had attempted to assassinate him using voodoo in what Houphouët @-@ Boigny called the " <unk> du chat noir " ( black cat conspiracy ) . 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny began drafting a new constitution for Côte d 'Ivoire after the country 's independence from France on 7 August 1960 . It drew heavily from the United States Constitution in establishing a powerful executive branch , and from the Constitution of France , which limited the capacities of the legislature . He transformed the National Assembly into a mere recording house for bills and budget proposals . On 27 November 1960 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny was elected unopposed to the Presidency of the Republic , while a single list of PDCI candidates was elected to the National Assembly . 
 1963 was marked by a series of alleged plots that played a decisive role in ultimately consolidating power in the hands of Houphouët @-@ Boigny . There is no clear consensus on the unfolding of the 1963 events ; in fact , there may have been no plot at all and the entire series of events may have been part of a plan by Houphouët @-@ Boigny to consolidate his hold on power . Between 120 and 200 secret trials were held in Yamoussoukro , in which key political figures — including Mockey and the president of the Supreme Court Ernest Boka — were implicated . There was discontent in the army , as the generals grew restive following the arrest of Defense Minister Jean Konan <unk> , and the president had to intervene personally to pacify them . 
 For the next 27 years , almost all power in Côte d 'Ivoire was centered in Houphouët @-@ Boigny . From 1965 to 1985 , he was reelected unopposed to five successive five @-@ year terms . Also every five years , a single list of PDCI candidates was returned to the National Assembly . For all intents and purposes , all of them were appointed by the president , since in his capacity as leader of the PDCI he approved all candidates . All adult citizens were required to be members of the PDCI . The media were tightly controlled , and served mainly as outlets for government propaganda . 
 While Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's regime was authoritarian , it was somewhat less harsh than other African regimes of the time . Once he had consolidated his power , he freed political prisoners in 1967 . Under his " unique brand of paternalistic authoritarianism " , Houphouët @-@ Boigny subdued dissent by offering government positions instead of incarceration to his critics . As a result , according to Robert Mundt , author of Côte d 'Ivoire : Continuity and Change in a Semi @-@ Democracy , he was never seriously challenged after 1963 . 
 In order to foil any plans for a coup d 'état , the president took control of the military and police , reducing their numbers from 5 @,@ 300 to 3 @,@ 500 . Defence was entrusted to the French armed forces that , pursuant to the treaty on defence cooperation of 24 April 1961 , were stationed at Port @-@ <unk> and could intervene at Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's request or when they considered French interests to be threatened . They subsequently intervened during attempts by the <unk> monarchists to secede in 1959 and 1969 , and again in 1970 , when an unauthorised political group , the <unk> Movement , was formed and Houphouët @-@ Boigny accused its leader <unk> <unk> of wishing to secede . 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny married the much younger Marie @-@ Thérèse Houphouët @-@ Boigny in 1962 , having divorced his first wife in 1952 . The couple had no children of their own , but they adopted one : Olivier Antoine in 1981 . 
 Helene <unk> Boigny – Abla <unk> - was legally recognized in 1960 by her father Mister Felix Houphouet Boigny who came to Court along with his three witnesses : his sisters Ms <unk> and <unk> Houphouet <unk> and his cousin Yao Simon Yamoussoukro 's chief of Canton ( Judgement <unk> <unk> – 26 <unk> 1960 – Tribunal of <unk> – A Court Session opened to the public ) . Madame Helene Houphouet Boigny is the granddaughter of the <unk> 's King <unk> <unk> <unk> II , her Mother being Madame <unk> <unk> . They both died in 1958 . 
 The marriage was not without scandal : in 1958 , Marie @-@ Thérèse went on a romantic escapade in Italy , while in 1961 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny fathered a child ( Florence , d . 2007 ) out of wedlock by his mistress Henriette <unk> . 
 = = = Leadership in Africa = = = 
 Following the example of de Gaulle , who refused proposals for an integrated Europe , Houphouët @-@ Boigny opposed Nkrumah 's proposed United States of Africa , which called into question Côte d 'Ivoire 's recently acquired national sovereignty . However , Houphouët @-@ Boigny was not opposed to collective African institutions if they were subject to his influence or control . 
 On 29 May 1959 , in cooperation with <unk> <unk> ( Niger ) , Maurice <unk> ( Upper Volta ) and Hubert Maga ( Dahomey ) , Houphouët @-@ Boigny created the Conseil de l <unk> ( English : Council of Accord or Council of Understanding ) . This regional organisation , founded in order to hamper the Mali Federation , was designed with three major functions : to allow shared management of certain public services , such as the port of Abidjan or the Abidjan – Niger railway line ; to provide a solidarity fund accessible to member countries , 90 % of which was provided by Côte d 'Ivoire ; and to provide funding for various development projects through low @-@ interest loans to member states ( 70 % of the loans were supplied by Côte d 'Ivoire ) . In 1966 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny even offered to grant dual citizenship to nationals from member countries of the Conseil de l <unk> , but the proposition was quickly abandoned following popular protests . 
 The ambitious Ivorian leader had even greater plans for French @-@ speaking Africa : he intended to rally the different nations behind a large organisation whose objective was the mutual assistance of its member states . The project became a reality on 7 September 1961 with the signing of a charter giving birth to the Union africaine et malgache ( UAM ; English : African and Malagasy Union ) , comprising 12 French @-@ speaking countries including Léopold Sédar Senghor 's Senegal . Agreements were signed in various sectors , such as economic , military and telecommunications , which strengthened solidarity among Francophone states . However , the creation of the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) in May 1963 affected his plans : the supporters of Pan @-@ Africanism demanded the dissolution of all regional groupings , such as the UAM . Houphouët @-@ Boigny reluctantly ceded , and transformed the UAM into the Organisation africaine et malgache de <unk> économique et <unk> ( English : African and Malagasy Organization of economic and cultural cooperation ) . 
 Considering the OAU a dead end organisation , particularly since Paris was opposed to the group , Houphouët @-@ Boigny decided to create in 1965 l 'Organisation commune africaine et malgache ( <unk> ; English : African and Malagasy Organization ) , a French organization in competition with the OAU . The organisation included among its members 16 countries , whose aim was to break revolutionary ambitions in Africa . However , over the years , the organisation became too subservient to France , resulting in the departure of half of the countries . 
 In the mid @-@ 1970s , during times of economic prosperity , Houphouët @-@ Boigny and Senghor put aside their differences and joined forces to thwart Nigeria , which , in an attempt to establish itself in West Africa , had created the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) . The two countered the ECOWAS by creating the Economic Community of West Africa ( ECWA ) , which superseded the old trade partnerships in the French @-@ speaking regions . However , after assurances from Nigeria that ECOWAS would function in the same manner as the earlier Francophone organisations , Houphouët @-@ Boigny and Senghor decided to merge their organization into ECOWAS in May 1975 . 
 = = = Françafrique = = = 
 Throughout his presidency , Houphouët @-@ Boigny surrounded himself with French advisers , such as Guy <unk> , Chief of Staff from 1960 to 1993 , and Alain <unk> , Secretary @-@ General of the Ivorian government , whose influence extended to all areas . This type of diplomacy , which he labelled " Françafrique " , allowed him to maintain very close ties with the former colonial power , making Côte d 'Ivoire France 's primary African ally . Whenever one country would enter an agreement with an African nation , the other would unconditionally give its support . Through this arrangement , Houphouët @-@ Boigny built a close friendship with Jacques Foccart , the chief adviser on African policy in the de Gaulle and Pompidou governments . 
 = = = = <unk> of revolutionary regimes = = = = 
 By claiming independence for Guinea through the 28 September 1958 French constitutional referendum , Ahmed Sékou Touré had not only defied de Gaulle , but also his fellow African , Houphouët @-@ Boigny . He distanced himself from Guinean officials in Conakry and the Guinean Democratic Party was excluded from the RDA . Tensions between Houphouët @-@ Boigny and Touré also began to rise due to the conspiracies of the French intelligence agency <unk> against the Sékou Touré regime . In January 1960 , Houphouët @-@ Boigny delivered small arms to former rebels in Man , Côte d 'Ivoire and incited his council in 1965 to agree to taking part in an attempt to overthrow Sékou Touré . In 1967 , he promoted the creation of the Front national de libération de la Guinée ( <unk> ; English : National Front for the Liberation of Guinea ) , a reserve of men ready to plot the downfall of Sékou Touré . 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny 's relationship with Kwame Nkrumah , the leader of neighboring Ghana , degraded considerably following Guinea 's independence , due to Nkrumah 's financial and political support for Sékou Touré . After Sékou Touré convinced Nkrumah to support the secessionist <unk> in Côte d 'Ivoire , Houphouët @-@ Boigny began a campaign to discredit the Ghanaian regime . He accused Nkrumah of trying to destabilise Côte d 'Ivoire in 1963 , and called for the Francophone states to boycott the Organisation of African Unity ( OAU ) conference scheduled to take place in Accra . Nkrumah was ousted from power in 1966 in a military coup ; Houphouët @-@ Boigny allowed the conspirators to use Côte d 'Ivoire as a base to coordinate the arrival and departure of their missions . 
 Also in collaboration with Foccart , Houphouët @-@ Boigny took part in the attempted coup of 16 January 1977 led by famed French mercenary Bob Denard against the revolutionary regime of Mathieu Kérékou in Dahomey . Houphouët @-@ Boigny , in order to fight against the Marxists in power in Angola , also lent his support to Jonas Savimbi 's UNITA party , whose feud with the MPLA party led to the Angolan Civil War . 
 Despite his reputation as a <unk> of regimes , Houphouët @-@ Boigny granted refuge to Jean @-@ Bédel Bokassa , after the exiled Central African Republic dictator had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979 . This move was met with international criticism , and thus , having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët @-@ Boigny , Bokassa was expelled from Côte d 'Ivoire in 1983 . 
 = = = = Alignment with France = = = = 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny was a participant in the November 1960 Congo Crisis , a period of political upheaval and conflict in Congo @-@ Kinshasa . The Ivorian leader supported President Joseph Kasa @-@ Vubu , an opponent of Lumumba , and followed France in supporting the controversial Congolese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe . Tshombe , disliked by much of Africa , was passionately defended by Houphouët @-@ Boigny and was even invited into <unk> in May 1965 . After the overthrow of Kasa @-@ Vubu by General Mobutu in November 1965 , the Ivorian president supported , in 1967 , a plan proposed by the French secret service which aimed to bring the deposed Congolese leader back into power . The operation was a failure . In response , Houphouët @-@ Boigny decided to boycott the fourth annual summit of the OAU held in September 1967 in Kinshasa . 
 Houphouët @-@ Boigny was also a major contributor to the political tensions in Biafra . Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French @-@ influenced African states , Foccart sent Houphouët @-@ Boigny and Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Raymond <unk> on a mission in 1963 to monitor political developments in the country . The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967 , when Biafra , led by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu , undertook to secede from Nigeria . French @-@ aligned African countries supported the secessionists who , provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean <unk> @-@ Beaupré , began a civil war . By the end of the 1960s , French @-@ supported nations suddenly and openly distanced themselves from France and Côte d 'Ivoire 's position on the civil war . Isolated on the international scene , both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu , who eventually went into exile in Côte d 'Ivoire . 
 At the request of Paris , Houphouet @-@ Boigny began forging relations with South Africa in October 1970 , justifying his attitude by stating that " [ t ] he problems of racial discrimination , so painful , so distressing , so revolting to our dignity of Negros , must not be resolved , we believe , by force . " He even proposed to the OAU in June 1971 that they follow his lead . In spite of receiving some support , his proposal was rejected . This refusal did not , however , prevent him from continuing his attempts to approach the Pretoria regime . His attempts bore fruit in October of that year , when a semi @-@ official meeting between a delegation of high level Ivorian officials and South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster was held in the capital of South Africa . Moreover , mindful of the Communist influence in Africa , he met Vorster in Geneva in 1977 , after the Soviet Union and Cuba tried to collectively spread their influence in Angola and Ethiopia . Relations with South Africa continued on an official basis until the end of his presidency .
