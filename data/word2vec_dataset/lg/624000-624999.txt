 Over four years after Cold Feet ended , ITV executives were still looking for a series that could comfortably replace it . On his appointment as chairman of ITV plc in 2007 , Michael Grade announced that he wanted the ITV network to be broadcasting long @-@ running series like Cold Feet to attract the younger , upmarket viewing demographic . 
 In 2008 , BBC One broadcast Mutual Friends , a six @-@ part television series written by Anil Gupta , which was compared to Cold Feet . While the BBC wanted the series to match the success of Cold Feet , producer Rob Bullock stressed that " Cold Feet is about a different period of life . It 's about people in their early thirties . Mutual Friends moves things on — what 's happening to our characters as they approach 40 is very different . Why do so many lives fall apart at 40 ? Because things haven 't worked out how we hoped and we 've had to turn to Plan B. The drama is all about the crisis caused by things not turning out as the characters planned . " Later in 2008 , ITV commissioned Married Single Other , a comedy drama executive @-@ produced by Andy Harries and directed by Declan Lowney , about three contemporary couples living in Leeds . 
 Granada Entertainment USA , the American arm of Granada Productions , tendered the series format to American networks and cable channels from late 1997 . The format was sold to NBC , which commissioned 13 x 60 @-@ minute episodes in May 1999 for the fall season , to be produced in association with Kerry <unk> Productions . The US series starred David Sutcliffe as Adam Williams and Jean Louisa Kelly as Shelley Sullivan ( the Rachel role ) . Low ratings lead to the series being cancelled after four episodes . In 2003 the format was sold to Italian network Mediaset for a 2004 broadcast . In 2008 , Polish broadcaster TVN secured the rights to a remake from Granada International . This version , entitled <unk> , <unk> , is set in Warsaw . The thirteen @-@ episode series began filming in May 2009 and was broadcast from 6 March 2010 . An adaptation entitled <unk> has also been developed for television audiences in the Czech Republic . The creators intend the show to run for three series of 13 episodes and tell a story over seven years . The first series was broadcast from September 2009 .

 = Tropical Storm Isidore ( 1984 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Isidore was the 15th tropical cyclone and 9th named storm of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season . Isidore formed as a tropical depression on September 25 , while situated off the southeastern Bahamas . The depression headed west , and was upgraded to a tropical storm in the central Bahamas the next day . It made landfall near Jupiter , Florida , and retaining tropical storm strength , Isidore curved to the northeast , emerging over water near Jacksonville , Florida . Isidore continued northeast until it was absorbed by a frontal system on October 1 . Though damage was generally light , the storm affected several regions from the Bahamas to the U.S. East Coast . One death was reported in Florida , and total damage is estimated at $ 1 million ( 1984 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The storm system that would become Isidore originated in a nearly stationary frontal boundary situated near the Bahamas . On September 24 , a ship reported winds of about 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) in association with the disturbance . However , satellite imagery indicated that convection was just beginning to organize . Satellite imagery and Air Force reconnaissance reports documented the formation of a tropical depression early on September 25 ; a special statement was later issued by the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) confirming the existence of the depression , and tropical cyclone advisories were initiated at 12 pm EDT . The depression moved west @-@ northwest while tracking through the Bahamas . As it did so , it moved across Cat Island and passed near several others . The cyclone attained tropical storm status on September 26 , receiving the name " Isidore " . 
 While located near the northern tip of Andros Island , Isidore reached its peak intensity . The barometric pressure fell to 999 mb , with sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . The storm continued moving northwest , though it failed to strengthen significantly over the Florida Current . The cyclone made landfall near Jupiter , Florida with sustained winds of about 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) and subsequently moved inland . Previously , a large high pressure area over the eastern United States had prevented the cyclone from moving northward . The high moved away , allowing for Isidore to curve to the northeast , emerging over water near Jacksonville , Florida . The storm continued towards the northeast , passing about 80 mi ( 130 km ) off of the Carolina coast . Isidore downgraded to a tropical depression on October 1 , and was absorbed in a frontal zone later that day . Isidore was one of many storms during the 1984 season that formed in relatively cool baroclinic environments . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Due to its mild nature , Isidore was described as a " safety test " . Gale warnings were issued from as far south as Key West , Florida , to as far north as Virginia , including parts of Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina . A private meteorological service stated that Isidore was to intensify to hurricane status , leading to some confusion regarding preparations . Along the Treasure Coast of Florida , citrus farmers burned seedlings potentially infected with canker to prevent heavy rains from spreading the disease . Red Cross volunteers readied a shelter with supplies such as cots and sheets , though it remained unused . In Martin County , hundreds of firefighters were on standby . In Miami , rain from the storm led to the cancellation of horse races at the Calder Race Course . State parks in Monroe County were temporarily closed . 
 In Indian River , Martin , and St. Lucie counties , students were sent home early , and after @-@ school actives were canceled . The South Beach Jetty Park in Fort Pierce was closed . In southern portions of the state , residents prepared their boats for the storm , and 50 F @-@ 4 Phantom fighter jets were evacuated from the Homestead Air Force Base and moved to bases in South Carolina . Lumber yards , groceries stores , and hardware stores reported unusually high demand for emergency supplies , though certain smaller businesses closed early . Gasoline stations in the region " were doing bumper @-@ to @-@ bumper business " . Farther to the south , in the Florida Keys , an emergency operations center was opened in response to the storm . 
 = = Impact = = 
 In Nassau , Bahamas , Isidore produced flooding rains and gales . There , the storm forced the closure of schools and banks . Heavy precipitation fell throughout the island chain , but no serious damage was reported . 
 Winds from Isidore gusted to 73 mph ( 117 km / h ) in the St. Augustine , Florida area . Elsewhere , 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) winds were recorded . At Mayport , winds were sustained at 43 mph ( 69 km / h ) . In northern portions of the state , peak rainfall totals ranged from 5 to 7 in ( 130 to 180 mm ) , much of which was associated with an intense convective band to the north and east of the cyclone 's center . One tornado , ranked F1 on the Fujita scale , touched down near Savannah , Georgia . Power outages were mostly minor and scattered . Tides generally ran under 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) above normal ; combined with high winds , the tides contributed to severe and widespread beach erosion along the eastern coast of central Florida , threatening structures at times . A large , $ 500 @,@ 000 beach restoration fill was washed away . Additionally , segments of State Road A1A were damaged . On Hutchinson Island , many eggs and nests of Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas , respectively , were destroyed . One man was electrocuted as a result of the storm near Orlando . Another man was injured while attempting to land his plane in high winds . Throughout the state , overall damage was generally insignificant . 
 The storm also dropped heavy precipitation along the coasts of Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina , with sporadic showers in parts of Virginia . Offshore , swells of 12 to 15 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 6 m ) extensively damaged a wooden ship , the Phoenix . The vessel " barely escaped destruction " , though a crew member suffered a cracked rib . Across its path , Isidore was estimated to have inflicted $ 1 million in damage . 
 = Battle of Torvioll = 
 The Battle of Torvioll , also known as the Battle of Lower Dibra , was fought on 29 June 1444 on the Plain of Torvioll , in what is modern @-@ day Albania . Skanderbeg was an Ottoman Albanian captain who decided to go back to his native land and take the reins of a new Albanian rebellion . He , along with 300 other Albanians fighting at the Battle of Niš , deserted the Ottoman army to head towards Krujë , which fell quickly through a subversion . He then formed the League of Lezhë , a confederation of Albanian princes united in war against the Ottoman Empire . Murad II , realizing the threat , sent one of his most experienced captains , Ali Pasha , to crush the rebellion with a force of 25 @,@ 000 men . 
 Skanderbeg expected a reaction so he moved with 15 @,@ 000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha 's army . The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other . The following day , 29 June , Ali came out of his camp and saw that Skanderbeg had positioned his forces at the bottom of a hill . Expecting a quick victory , Ali ordered all of his forces down the hill to attack and defeat Skanderbeg 's army . Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and had prepared his own stratagem . Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved , Skanderbeg ordered his forces hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear . The result was devastating for the Ottomans , whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed . 
 The victory lifted the morale of the Christian princes of Europe and was recognized as a great victory over the Muslim Ottoman Empire . On the Ottoman side , Murad realized the effect Skanderbeg 's rebellion would have on his realm and continued to take measures to defeat him , resulting in twenty @-@ five years of war . 
 = = Background = = 
 George Kastrioti Skanderbeg , the son of the powerful prince John Kastrioti , had been a vassal of the Ottoman Empire as a sipahi , or cavalry commander . After his participation in the Ottoman loss at the Battle of Niš , Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army and rushed to Albania alongside 300 other Albanians . By forging a letter from Murad II to the Governor of Krujë , he became lord of the city in November 1443 . Hungarian captain John Hunyadi 's continued operations against Sultan Murad II gave Skanderbeg time to prepare an alliance of the Albanian nobles . Skanderbeg invited all of Albania 's nobles to meet in the Venetian @-@ held town of Alessio ( Lezhë ) on 2 March 1444 . Alessio was chosen as the meeting point because the town had once been the capital of the Dukagjini family and to induce Venice to lend aid to the Albanian movement . Among the nobles that attended were George Arianiti , Paul Dukagjini , Andrea Thopia , Lekë <unk> , Teodor <unk> , Peter Spani , Lekë <unk> , and Paul Stres Balsha . Here they formed the League of Lezhë , a confederation of all of the major Albanian princes in alliance against the Ottoman Empire . The chosen captain ( Albanian : <unk> ) of this confederation was Skanderbeg . The League 's first military challenge came in the spring of 1444 , when Skanderbeg 's scouts reported that the Ottoman army was planning to invade Albania . Skanderbeg planned to move towards the anticipated entry point and prepared for an engagement . 
 = = Campaign = = 
 = = = Prelude = = = 
 Ali Pasha , one of Murad 's most favored commanders , left <unk> ( Skopje ) in June 1444 with an army of 25 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 troops and headed in Albania 's direction . Having brought together an army of 15 @,@ 000 men ( 8 @,@ 000 cavalry and 7 @,@ 000 infantry ) from the League of Lezhë , Skanderbeg exhorted to his soldiers the importance of the upcoming campaign . Orders were given for the distribution of soldiers ' pay and for religious services to be held . Afterwards , Skanderbeg and his army headed towards the planned place of battle in Lower Dibra , which is thought to be the Plain of <unk> , then called the Plain of Torvioll , north of <unk> . On the way there , he marched through the Black Drin valley and appeared at the expected Ottoman entry point . Skanderbeg had chosen the plain himself : it was 11 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 0 mi ) long and 4 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 0 mi ) wide , surrounded by hills and forests . After camping near Torvioll , Skanderbeg placed 3 @,@ 000 men under five commanders , Hamza Kastrioti , Muzaka of Angelina , Zecharia Gropa , Peter <unk> , and John <unk> , in the surrounding forests with orders to attack the Ottoman wings and rear only after a given signal . While Skanderbeg was preparing his ambush , the Ottoman Turks under Ali Pasha arrived and encamped opposite his forces . The night before the battle , the Ottomans celebrated the coming day , whereas the Albanians extinguished all their campfires and those who were not on guard were directed to rest . Parties of Ottomans made approaches to the Albanian camp and provoked Skanderbeg 's soldiers , but they remained quiet . Skanderbeg sent out a scouting party to obtain information about the Ottoman army and ordered his cavalry to engage in small skirmishes . 
 = = = Albanian positioning = = = 
 On the morning of 29 June , Skanderbeg arranged his army for battle . Apart from the 3 @,@ 000 warriors hidden behind the Ottoman army , Skanderbeg left another reserve force of 3 @,@ 000 under the command of Vrana Konti . The Albanian army was positioned in a crescent shape curving inwards . They were divided into three groups , each composed of 3 @,@ 000 men . They were all placed at the bottom of a hill , with the intention of luring the Ottoman cavalry @-@ based army into a downhill charge . The Albanian left wing was commanded by Tanush Thopia with 1 @,@ 500 horsemen and an equal number of infantrymen . On the right wing , Skanderbeg placed Moisi Golemi in the same manner as Thopia . In front of the wings , foot archers were placed to lure the Ottomans in . In the center , there were 3 @,@ 000 men under the command of Skanderbeg and Ajdin Muzaka . One @-@ thousand horsemen were placed in front of the main division with orders to blunt the initial Turkish cavalry charge . An equal number of archers , trained to accompany the horses , was placed next to these horsemen . The main body of infantry , commanded by Ajdin Muzaka , was placed behind the archers . 
 = = = Battle = = = 
 After the army was marshaled , Skanderbeg would not permit the trumpets to give the signal for battle until he saw Ali Pasha advancing . After looking upon the Albanian army , the Pasha ordered his army to charge with one of the units ahead of the rest . The Albanian front line retreated ; Skanderbeg sent a body of horsemen to prevent the line from breaking and marshaled the retreating troops back to their places . Ali Pasha believed he had the Albanians trapped . The same situation occurred on the left wing and , when all were in their places , the army prepared for the main offensive . As it began , the wings were fiercely led on by Thopia and Golemi and pushed back the Ottoman wings . In the centre , Skanderbeg assaulted a selected battalion . When the proper signal was given , the 3 @,@ 000 horsemen hidden in the woods sprung out and charged into the Ottoman rear , causing large parts of their army to rout . The wings of the Albanian army turned towards the Ottoman centre 's flanks . Ajdin Muzaka , having charged the Turkish centre , was met by fierce resistance and the Turks continued to pour in fresh forces until Vrana Konti came in with his reserves and decided the battle . The Turkish army was surrounded . The Ottoman front ranks were annihilated except for 300 soldiers . Ali Pasha 's personal battalion fled although the commander nearly met his death . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Between 8 @,@ 000 to 22 @,@ 000 Turks died in the battle , while 2 @,@ 000 were captured . The Albanians were originally attributed to have lost as little as 120 men , but modern sources suggest a higher figure of 4 @,@ 000 Albanians dead and wounded . Skanderbeg remained quiet in his camp for the remainder of that day and the following night . Having addressed his troops , he directed his infantry to mount the captured horses . The spoils of the victory were abundant and even the wounded took part in the pillaging . Skanderbeg thereafter ordered a general retreat toward Krujë . Skanderbeg 's victory was praised through the rest of Europe . The European states thus began to consider a crusade to drive the Ottomans out of Europe . When Ali Pasha returned to Adrianople ( Edirne ) , he explained to the sultan that the loss should be attributed to his forces and the " fortunes of war " and not his generalship . The battle of Torvioll thus opened up the quarter @-@ century war between Skanderbeg 's Albania and the Ottoman Empire . 
 = Hebrides = 
 The Hebrides ( / <unk> / ; Scottish Gaelic : Innse Gall ; Old Norse : Suðreyjar ) comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland . There are two main groups : the Inner and Outer Hebrides . These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic , and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic , Norse , and English @-@ speaking peoples . This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands , which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times . 
 Various artists have been inspired by their Hebridean experiences . Today the economy of the islands is dependent on crofting , fishing , tourism , the oil industry , and renewable energy . The Hebrides lack biodiversity in comparison to mainland Britain , but seals are present around the coasts in internationally important numbers . 
 = = Geology , geography and climate = = 
 The Hebrides have a diverse geology ranging in age from Precambrian strata that are amongst the oldest rocks in Europe to Paleogene igneous intrusions . 
 The Hebrides can be divided into two main groups , separated from one another by the Minch to the north and the Sea of the Hebrides to the south . The Inner Hebrides lie closer to mainland Scotland and include Islay , Jura , Skye , Mull , Raasay , Staffa and the Small Isles . There are 36 inhabited islands in this group . The Outer Hebrides are a chain of more than 100 islands and small skerries located about 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) west of mainland Scotland . There are 15 inhabited islands in this archipelago . The main islands include Barra , Benbecula , Berneray , Harris , Lewis , North Uist , South Uist , and St Kilda . In total , the islands have an area of approximately 7 @,@ 200 square kilometres ( 2 @,@ 800 sq mi ) and a population of 44 @,@ 759 . 
 A complication is that there are various descriptions of the scope of the Hebrides . The Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland describes the Inner Hebrides as lying " east of the Minch " , which would include any and all offshore islands . There are various islands that lie in the sea lochs such as Eilean <unk> and Eilean Donan that might not ordinarily be described as " Hebridean " , but no formal definitions exist . 
 In the past , the Outer Hebrides were often referred to as the Long Isle ( Scottish Gaelic : An t @-@ Eilean Fada ) . Today , they are also known as the Western Isles , although this phrase can also be used to refer to the Hebrides in general . 
 The Hebrides have a cool temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude , due to the influence of the Gulf Stream . In the Outer Hebrides the average temperature for the year is 6 ° C ( 44 ° F ) in January and 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) in summer . The average annual rainfall in Lewis is 1 @,@ 100 millimetres ( 43 in ) and sunshine hours range from 1 @,@ 100 – 1 @,@ 200 per annum . The summer days are relatively long , and May to August is the driest period .

 = = = Prehistory = = = 
 The Hebrides were settled during the Mesolithic era around 6500 BC or earlier , after the climatic conditions improved enough to sustain human settlement . Occupation at a site on Rùm is dated to <unk> ± 95 uncorrected radiocarbon years BP , which is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland . There are many examples of structures from the Neolithic period , the finest example being the standing stones at Callanish , dating to the 3rd millennium BC . <unk> <unk> , a Bronze Age settlement on South Uist is the only site in the UK where prehistoric mummies have been found . 
 = = = Celtic era = = = 
 In 55 BC , the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote that there was an island called <unk> ( which means " beyond the North Wind " ) , where a round temple stood from which the moon appeared only a little distance above the earth every 19 years . This may have been a reference to the stone circle at Callanish . 
 A traveller called Demetrius of Tarsus related to Plutarch the tale of an expedition to the west coast of Scotland in or shortly before AD 83 . He stated it was a gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands , but he had visited one which was the retreat of holy men . He mentioned neither the druids nor the name of the island . 
 The first written records of native life begin in the 6th century AD , when the founding of the kingdom of Dál Riata took place . This encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland and County Antrim in Ireland . The figure of Columba looms large in any history of Dál Riata , and his founding of a monastery on Iona ensured that the kingdom would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain . However , Iona was far from unique . Lismore in the territory of the Cenél Loairn , was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency and many smaller sites , such as on Eigg , <unk> , and Tiree , are known from the annals . 
 North of Dál Riata , the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control , although the historical record is sparse . Hunter ( 2000 ) states that in relation to King Bridei I of the Picts in the sixth century : " As for Shetland , Orkney , Skye and the Western Isles , their inhabitants , most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time , are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence . ” 
 = = = Norwegian control = = = 
 Viking raids began on Scottish shores towards the end of the 8th century and the Hebrides came under Norse control and settlement during the ensuing decades , especially following the success of Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord in 872 . In the Western Isles Ketill Flatnose may have been the dominant figure of the mid 9th century , by which time he had amassed a substantial island realm and made a variety of alliances with other Norse leaders . These princelings nominally owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown , although in practice the latter 's control was fairly limited . Norse control of the Hebrides was formalised in 1098 when Edgar of Scotland formally signed the islands over to Magnus III of Norway . The Scottish acceptance of Magnus III as King of the Isles came after the Norwegian king had conquered Orkney , the Hebrides and the Isle of Man in a swift campaign earlier the same year , directed against the local Norwegian leaders of the various island petty kingdoms . By capturing the islands Magnus imposed a more direct royal control , although at a price . His skald Bjorn <unk> recorded that in Lewis " fire played high in the heaven " as " flame spouted from the houses " and that in the Uists " the king dyed his sword red in blood " . 
 The Hebrides were now part of the Kingdom of the Isles , whose rulers were themselves vassals of the Kings of Norway . This situation lasted until the partitioning of the Western Isles in 1156 , at which time the Outer Hebrides remained under Norwegian control while the Inner Hebrides broke out under Somerled , the Norse @-@ Celtic kinsman of the Manx royal house . 
 Following the ill @-@ fated 1263 expedition of Haakon IV of Norway , the Outer Hebrides and the Isle of Man were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth . Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and place names , the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited . The best known find is the Lewis chessmen , which date from the mid 12th century . 
 = = = Scottish control = = = 
 As the Norse era drew to a close , the Norse @-@ speaking princes were gradually replaced by Gaelic @-@ speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris , Clan Donald and MacNeil of Barra . This transition did little to relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles , based on Islay , were in theory these chiefs ' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control . 
 The Lords of the Isles ruled the Inner Hebrides as well as part of the Western Highlands as subjects of the King of Scots until John MacDonald , fourth Lord of the Isles , squandered the family 's powerful position . A rebellion by his nephew , Alexander of Lochalsh provoked an exasperated James IV to forfeit the family 's lands in 1493 . 
 In 1598 , King James VI authorised some " Gentleman Adventurers " from Fife to civilise the " most barbarous Isle of Lewis " . Initially successful , the colonists were driven out by local forces commanded by Murdoch and Neil MacLeod , who based their forces on <unk> in Loch Ròg . The colonists tried again in 1605 with the same result , but a third attempt in 1607 was more successful and in due course Stornoway became a Burgh of Barony . By this time , Lewis was held by the Mackenzies of Kintail ( later the Earls of Seaforth ) , who pursued a more enlightened approach , investing in fishing in particular . The <unk> ' royalist inclinations led to Lewis becoming garrisoned during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms by Cromwell 's troops , who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway .

 With the implementation of the Treaty of Union in 1707 , the Hebrides became part of the new Kingdom of Great Britain , but the clans ' loyalties to a distant monarch were not strong . A considerable number of <unk> " came out " in support of the Jacobite Earl of Mar in the " 15 " and again in the 1745 rising including Macleod of Dunvegan and MacLea of Lismore . The aftermath of the decisive Battle of Culloden , which effectively ended Jacobite hopes of a Stuart restoration , was widely felt . The British government 's strategy was to estrange the clan chiefs from their kinsmen and turn their descendants into English @-@ speaking landlords whose main concern was the revenues their estates brought rather than the welfare of those who lived on them . This may have brought peace to the islands , but in the following century it came at a terrible price . In the wake of the rebellion , the clan system was broken up and islands of the Hebrides became a series of landed estates . 
 The early 19th century was a time of improvement and population growth . Roads and quays were built ; the slate industry became a significant employer on Easdale and surrounding islands ; and the construction of the Crinan and Caledonian canals and other engineering works such as Telford 's " Bridge across the Atlantic " improved transport and access . However , in the mid @-@ 19th century , the inhabitants of many parts of the Hebrides were devastated by the clearances , which destroyed communities throughout the Highlands and Islands as the human populations were evicted and replaced with sheep farms . The position was exacerbated by the failure of the islands ' kelp industry that thrived from the 18th century until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and large scale emigration became endemic . The " Battle of the Braes " involved a demonstration against lack of access to land and the serving of eviction notices . This event was instrumental in the creation of the Napier Commission , which reported in 1884 on the situation in the Highlands and disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 Crofters ' Act .

 For those who remained , new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle , commercial fishing and tourism . Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago 's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th century and for much of the 20th century . Lengthy periods of continuous occupation notwithstanding , many of the smaller islands were abandoned . 
 There were however continuing gradual economic improvements , among the most visible of which was the replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the islands ' populations have begun to increase after decades of decline . The discovery of substantial deposits of North Sea oil in 1965 and the renewables sector have contributed to a degree of economic stability in recent decades . For example , the Arnish yard has had a chequered history but has been a significant employer in both the oil and renewables industries .

 The Hebrides , also known as Fingal 's Cave , is a famous overture composed by Felix Mendelssohn while residing on these islands , while Granville Bantock composed the Hebridean Symphony . Contemporary musicians associated with the islands include Ian Anderson , Donovan and Runrig . The poet Sorley MacLean was born on Raasay , the setting for his best known poem , Hallaig . 
 The novelist Compton Mackenzie lived on Barra and George Orwell wrote 1984 whilst living on Jura . J.M. Barrie 's Marie Rose contains references to Harris inspired by a holiday visit to <unk> Castle and he wrote a screenplay for the 1924 film adaptation of Peter Pan whilst on Eilean Shona . Enya 's song " <unk> " from Shepherd Moons is named for the Hebrides ( see below ) . The 1973 British horror film The Wicker Man is set on the fictional Hebridean island of <unk> . The experimental first @-@ person adventure video game Dear Esther takes place on an unnamed Hebridean island . The 2011 British romantic comedy " The Decoy Bride " is set on the fictional Hebrides island of Hegg . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 The residents of the Hebrides have spoken a variety of different languages during the long period of human occupation . 
 It is assumed that Pictish must once have predominated in the northern Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides . The Scottish Gaelic language arrived via Ireland due to the growing influence of the kingdom of Dál Riata from the 6th century onwards and became the dominant language of the southern Hebrides at that time . For a time , the military might of the Gall @-@ <unk> meant that Old Norse was prevalent in the Hebrides and , north of Ardnamurchan , the place names that existed prior to the 9th century have been all but obliterated . The Old Norse name for the Hebrides during the Viking occupation was Suðreyjar , which means " Southern Isles " . It was given in contrast to the Norðreyjar , or the " Northern Isles " of Orkney and Shetland . 
 South of Ardnamurchan Gaelic place names are the most common and , after the 13th century , Gaelic became the main language of the entire Hebridean archipelago . The use of Scots and English became prominent in recent times but the Hebrides still contain the largest concentration of Scottish Gaelic speakers in Scotland . This is especially true of the Outer Hebrides , where the majority of people speak the language . The Scottish Gaelic college , Sabhal Mòr Ostaig , is based on Skye and Islay . 
 Ironically , given the status of the Western Isles as the last Gàidhlig @-@ speaking stronghold in Scotland , the Gaelic language name for the islands – Innse Gall – means " isles of the foreigners " which has roots in the time when they were under Norse colonisation . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The earliest written references that have survived relating to the islands were made by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History , where he states that there are 30 Hebudes , and makes a separate reference to Dumna , which Watson ( 1926 ) concludes is unequivocally the Outer Hebrides . Writing about 80 years later , in 140 @-@ 150 AD , Ptolemy , drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of Agricola , writes that there are five Ebudes ( possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides ) and Dumna . Later texts in classical Latin , by writers such as Solinus , use the forms Hebudes and <unk> . 
 The name Ebudes recorded by Ptolemy may be pre @-@ Celtic . Islay is Ptolemy 's <unk> , the use of the " p " hinting at a Brythonic or Pictish tribal name , Epidii , although the root is not Gaelic . Woolf ( 2012 ) has suggested that Ebudes may be " an Irish attempt to reproduce the word Epidii phonetically rather than by translating it " and that the tribe 's name may come from the root epos meaning " horse " . Watson ( 1926 ) also notes the possible relationship between Ebudes and the ancient Irish Ulaid tribal name <unk> and the personal name of a king <unk> recorded in the Silva Gadelica . 
 The names of other individual islands reflect their complex linguistic history . The majority are Norse or Gaelic but the roots of several other Hebrides may have a pre @-@ Celtic origin . Adomnán , the 7th century abbot of Iona , records Colonsay as <unk> and Tiree as <unk> , both of which may be pre @-@ Celtic names . The etymology of Skye is complex and may also include a pre @-@ Celtic root . Lewis is <unk> in Old Norse and although various suggestions have been made as to a Norse meaning ( such as " song house " ) the name is not of Gaelic origin and the Norse credentials are questionable . 
 The earliest comprehensive written list of Hebridean island names was undertaken by Donald Monro in 1549 , which in some cases also provides the earliest written form of the island name . The derivations of all of the inhabited islands of the Hebrides and some of the larger uninhabited ones are listed below . 
 = = = Outer Hebrides = = = 
 Lewis and Harris is the largest island in Scotland and the third largest in the British Isles , after Great Britain and Ireland . It incorporates Lewis in the north and Harris in the south , both of which are frequently referred to as individual islands , although they are joined by a land border . Remarkably , the island does not have a common name in either English or Gaelic and is referred to as " Lewis and Harris " , " Lewis with Harris " , " Harris with Lewis " etc . For this reason it is treated as two separate islands below . The derivation of Lewis may be pre @-@ Celtic ( see above ) and the origin of Harris is no less problematic . In the Ravenna Cosmography , <unk> may refer to Harris ( or possibly the Outer Hebrides as a whole ) . This word may derive from the Ancient Greek <unk> meaning " desert " . The origin of Uist ( Old Norse : <unk> ) is similarly unclear . 
 = = = Inner Hebrides = = = 
 There are various examples of Inner Hebridean island names that were originally Gaelic but have become completely replaced . For example , Adomnán records <unk> , Elena , <unk> and <unk> in the Inner Hebrides , which names must have passed out of usage in the Norse era and whose locations are not clear . One of the complexities is that an island may have had a Celtic name , that was replaced by a similar sounding Norse name , but then reverted to an essentially Gaelic name with a Norse " øy " or " ey " ending . See for example Rona below . 
 = = = Uninhabited islands = = = 
 The names of uninhabited islands follow the same general patterns as the inhabited islands . The following are the ten largest in the Hebrides and their outliers . 
 The etymology of St Kilda , a small archipelago west of the Outer Hebrides , and its main island Hirta is very complex . No saint is known by the name of Kilda and various theories have been proposed for the word 's origin , which dates from the late 16th century . Haswell @-@ Smith ( 2004 ) notes that the full name " St Kilda " first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666 , and that it may have been derived from Norse sunt <unk> ( " sweet <unk> " ) or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring Tobar Childa was dedicated to a saint . ( Tobar Childa is a tautological placename , consisting of the Gaelic and Norse words for well , i.e. " well well " ) . The origin of the Gaelic for " Hirta " , Hiort or Hirt , which long pre @-@ dates the use of " St Kilda " , is similarly open to interpretation . Watson ( 1926 ) offers the Old Irish <unk> , a word meaning " death " , possibly relating to the dangerous seas . Maclean ( 1977 ) , drawing on an Icelandic saga describing an early 13th @-@ century voyage to Ireland that mentions a visit to the islands of Hirtir , speculates that the shape of Hirta resembles a stag , <unk> being " stags " in Norse . 
 The etymology of small islands may be no less complex . In relation to Dubh Artach , R. L. Stevenson believed that " black and dismal " was a translation of the name , noting that " as usual , in Gaelic , it is not the only one . " 
 = = Natural history = = 
 In some respects the Hebrides generally lack biodiversity in comparison to mainland Britain , with for example only half the number of mammalian species the latter has . However these islands provide breeding grounds for many important seabird species including the world 's largest colony of northern gannets . Avian life includes the corncrake , red @-@ throated diver , rock dove , kittiwake , tystie , Atlantic puffin , goldeneye , golden eagle and white @-@ tailed sea eagle . The last named was re @-@ introduced to Rùm in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands , including Mull . There is a small population of red @-@ billed chough concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay . 
 Red deer are common on the hills and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers , with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles . The rich freshwater streams contain brown trout , Atlantic salmon and water shrew . Offshore , minke whales , Killer whales , basking sharks , porpoises and dolphins are among the <unk> that can be seen . 
 Heather moor containing ling , bell heather , cross @-@ leaved heath , bog myrtle and fescues is abundant and there is a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including Alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal . 
 Loch <unk> on South Uist is a national nature reserve owned and managed by Scottish Natural Heritage . The reserve covers 1 @,@ 677 hectares across the whole range of local habitats . Over 200 species of flowering plants have been recorded on the reserve , some of which are nationally scarce . South Uist is considered the best place in the UK for the aquatic plant slender <unk> , which is a European Protected Species . 
 There has been considerable controversy over hedgehogs . The animals are not native to the Outer Hebrides having been introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden pests , but their spread has posed a threat to the eggs of ground nesting wading birds . In 2003 , Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area although these were halted in 2007 with trapped animals then being relocated to the mainland .

 Carl Grimes ( Chandler Riggs ) recovers from his operation to remove fragments of a bullet , which he had received earlier when encountering a deer . He asks his father Rick ( Andrew Lincoln ) if his friend Sophia Peletier ( Madison Lintz ) is alright . Since Sophia is still missing , Rick reluctantly lies to Carl and tells him that she is fine . Dale Horvath ( Jeffrey DeMunn ) , Daryl Dixon ( Norman Reedus ) , Andrea ( Laurie Holden ) and Carol Peletier ( Melissa McBride ) move the vehicles and set up camp at the Greene home and are introduced to the Greene family . There , they lead a funeral procession for their ranch hand , Otis ( Pruitt Taylor Vince ) . Shane Walsh ( Jon Bernthal ) is asked to share Otis ' final moments ; Shane sticks to his lie that Otis had sacrificed his life to save Carl , while in reality Shane betrayed Otis . 
 Along with Hershel Greene ( Scott Wilson ) and his daughter Maggie ( Lauren Cohan ) , the group organize Sophia 's search . Since Shane is still injured and Rick is too weak from blood loss , Daryl ventures out on his own . Daryl eventually finds an abandoned house , but does not locate Sophia . He finds a <unk> rose , which is a Native American sign in which the gods protected their children , and gives it to Carol . 
 Maggie directs Dale and Theodore " T @-@ Dog " Douglas ( IronE Singleton ) to a nearby freshwater well , only to find a bloated zombie — commonly referred by the group as a " walker " — inside . Shane , Maggie , Andrea , Lori Grimes ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) and Glenn ( Steven Yeun ) join the two ; the group concludes that shooting it might further contaminate the water . They then decide to use Glenn as live bait and harness the walker to a rope to drag it out of the well . After a slight mishap , Glenn manages to saddle the walker . The group manages to pull the walker to the top of the well , but it becomes stuck at the top . Attempting to pull the walker free causes the walker 's body to get ripped in half , with the lower body , fluid , and organs spilling back into the well , contaminating the water . T @-@ Dog then kills the walker with an axe . 
 Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies . Before he leaves , Lori asks Glenn to search for something in the feminine hygiene section . At the pharmacy , Glenn discovers the item is a pregnancy test . When Maggie asks him what he 's looking for , he tries to make an excuse and accidentally grabs a box of condoms . Maggie then seduces and has sex with Glenn . Rick and Hershel tour the farmland , where Hershel reveals that the group has to leave once Carl fully recovers . Rick manages to convince Hershel for the group to stay for the meantime . However , there are rules they must follow . Rick pleads with Hershel to not force them to leave and to reconsider his request . 
 Later on , Rick is up in the room where Carl is recovering in bed . Once Carl wakes up , Rick admits that he lied to him about Sophia ; Carl reveals that his mother already told him the truth . Meanwhile , the pregnancy test reveals that Lori is pregnant .

 " Cherokee Rose " was written by Evan Reilly and directed by Billy <unk> . Filming for the episode occurred in downtown Sharpsburg , Georgia on August 1 , 2011 . Preparation for filming initiated in July 2011 , when producers converted an empty building into a temporary drug store . Herb Bridges , who owned the building at the time , was first contacted by producers of the series ' in January 2011 , and again four months later in May . Bridges informed them that the space would be rented by a woman who would open a children 's store there ; however , she had not moved into the space yet . This episode contains a scene in which Daryl searches for Sophia in an abandoned home . Filming for the scene transpired at an abandoned late @-@ nineteenth century Gothic revival home in <unk> , Georgia . Gregory Melton , the series ' production designer , was the first crew member to locate the house . Melton took a picture of it with his cell phone , and sent the picture to creator Frank Darabont . Darabont reacted positively to the image , and later wrote it in the episode 's script . 
 This episode marked the climax of the relationship between Maggie Greene and Glenn , in which they engage in sexual intercourse at a pharmacy . Writer Robert Kirkman insisted that it was important to view the storyline in a different perspective , explaining , " I don 't think we wanted to turn that into some kind of steamy , pornographic sex romp . " " Cherokee Rose " marked a turning point in the character development of Daryl Dixon . It contains a monologue that references the <unk> rose and its association to the Trail of Tears . The scene was devised and written by Evan Rielly . " I was actually on set during the filming of that , " stated Kirkman . " Almost every actor in the cast showed up , because they absolutely loved that scene and they wanted to see Melissa and Norman ’ s portrayal of it as it unfolded . " 
 The episode contains a scene in which the survivors pull a bloated walker out of a well in order to prevent contamination of the water . Such attempts prove to be unsuccessful , as all of the water retention severs the walker in half . Greg Nicotero , the special effects director for The Walking Dead , collaborated with KNB Efx Group to produce the sequence . Nicotero received a phone call from staff members of the company two hours after leaving production offices . They devised and expressed plans of creating a scenario in which a walker falls into a well . Nicotero worked with KNB Efx Group in several other films in the past . " One of the things we 've noticed — looking at some morgue research and cadaver research — is that everything gets really swollen , " he articulated . " The liquid saturates the skin so much that it swells up , and the skin starts to split . That was one of the things that we really wanted to play up . " A costume was sculpted using a body and a head cast . It was composed of three layers ; a thin skin @-@ like substance covers the exterior of the suit , followed by a layer of silicone and a layer of foam in the costume 's center . A mask that was previously utilized in the action horror film Grindhouse ( 2007 ) was used as part of the costume . Nicotero inserted water balloons between the silicone and foam layering . He explained that as the performer begins to move , the liquid transfers from one side of the costume to another . Nicotero added : " If we made it out of foam latex , it would 've been stiff . But we used silicone that was heavily plasticized — which means that the silicone was really soft . " The suit weighed approximately sixty pounds . 
 Brian Hilliard , a member of the KNB Efx Group , was chosen by producers as the walker . Hilliard was favored in lieu of another actor , who fell ill shortly after being cast . In his interview with Entertainment Weekly , Greg Nicotero explained why he chose Hilliard for the part : 
 I needed somebody who could perform , and who also had a lot of endurance , because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July . Silicone doesn ’ t have cell structure , like foam does . It doesn ’ t breathe . So Brian was basically encased in a sixty @-@ pound wet @-@ suit . Every part of his body was covered . He had facial prosthetics , hands , full legs , feet . It was all glued down . It wasn ’ t like we could take him out between takes . He was in . 
 The sequence was shot over a period of two days . Principal photography on the first day commenced inside a well , which was built by Gregory Melton in approximately four weeks . It measured over forty feet in height , and the base of the well was located in a swimming pool . Nicotero stated that " [ they ] could open the door , put the zombie actor in there , then close the door . The camera would shoot down . " Atop of the well was a lip that measured a height of six feet . Despite putting slime and K @-@ Y Jelly on a board inside of the well , Nicotero and his production team found the particular sequence to be difficult to shoot . " On ' action ' , we pulled him out , and he slid up and over the lip , " Nicotero stated . " It was challenging to get all those pieces to come together on a television schedule . " By the time Hilliard was pulled out of the well , producers used a second suit equipped with prosthetic legs and prosthetic body . Various blood bags were inserted in the torso of the suit ; each were filled with viscous liquids in a variety of colors . <unk> were lastly added inside the suit , as Nicotero asserted that his team wanted " a gigantic explosion of gore . " 
 To induce the splitting of the costume , the series ' special effect coordinator Darrell Pritchett inserted squibs inside of the suit . Nicotero stated : " On ' action ' , my makeup effects crew pulled the upper body apart , and the physical effects crew <unk> all the bags . Then visual effects guys went in and added those few little tendrils of stretching , ripping intestines . " Because rubber constituted a large percentage of the suit , weights were added on to ensure that it would sink in the water . While recording commenced , approximately 12 – 15 gallons of liquid were poured into the well following the dropping of the prosthetic legs . Four takes were produced of that sequence .

 " Cherokee Rose " attained favorable reviews from television critics . Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B + , and felt that it gave an accurate depiction of the characters . He opined : " I had a problem with the show 's tendency to wander into cul @-@ de @-@ sacs in the first season , mainly because so much of it felt redundant , the work of writers who had no real idea how to construct narrative television . But this season , I 'm starting to think they 're getting a handle on things , and " Cherokee Rose " is the sort of episode I 'd like to see more off [ sic ] as The Walking Dead continues . " Paste 's Josh Jackson asserted that the episode was superior to preceding installments , describing it as " simply a catch of breath . " Similarly , Josh Wigler of MTV evaluated that despite less violence than usual , the quality of " Cherokee Rose " improved from the previous episode . HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall echoed analogous sentiments , and argued that while the show 's character still need more development , the development displayed in the episode was a " definite step in the right direction on that front .

 Critics commended the development of the relationship between Maggie Green and Glenn . Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun stated that the storyline epitomized a " steamy romance " , while The Wall Street Journal 's Aaron Rutkoff called it " the funniest moment of the series . " Goldman opined that their sexual encounter felt genuine ; " He 's a nice guy , she seems like a cool gal , and it felt genuine when she noted she felt plenty lonely too and ready for some companionship . " Nick Venable of Cinema Blend asserted that the interactions between Maggie and Glenn was the highlight of the episode . " I 'm glad the writers are introducing this comic book plot point , as this show seriously needs a couple without closets full of skeletons . When Glenn accidentally grabs a box of condoms for Maggie to see , I chuckled heartily . The ensuing conversation also made me smile , which makes me wonder why humor is paid the least amount of attention on the show . " Jackson was surprised with the scene , and called it " unexpected " . Jen <unk> of The Washington Post compared Glenn to Little Mikey from the Life advertisements , and summated : " He has assumed this role without much choice in the matter , but he has done so with a certain quiet , occasionally petrified , baseball @-@ cap @-@ wearing dignity that makes him admirable . " 
 The water well sequence was critically acclaimed by critics . Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly described the scene as " hilarious " , and added , " I loved the horrific pointlessness of that entire plot , and it was yet more proof that makeup designer Greg Nicotero is the real star of [ The Walking Dead ] . I 'm not sure anything else TV can come up with this season will match the image of the bloated half @-@ zombie crawling across the ground with its water @-@ logged intestine hanging out . " Jackson , Rawlings , and the Houston Chronicle 's Pamela Mitchell felt that the sequence was one of the series ' most grotesque moments . Rawlings added : " Honestly , that right there is why many people watch The Walking Dead . " Wigler expressed that it was " very well done " , and noted that the walker was the " most vile , disgusting zombie that Greg Nicotero has ever created . " 
 The concluding sequence of " Cherokee Rose " was also well received by television critics . Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy admired the scene , and described it as " tense " . Halden opined that the scene was a reasonably solid storyline , and felt that it was the episode 's biggest foreshadowing event . 
 = Minnesota = 
 Minnesota ( / <unk> / ; locally [ <unk> ̞ <unk> ] ) is a state in the Midwestern United States . Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state on May 11 , 1858 , created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory . The name comes from the Dakota word for " clear blue water " . Owing to its large number of lakes , the state is informally known as the " Land of 10 @,@ 000 Lakes " . Its official motto is L 'Étoile du Nord ( French : Star of the North ) . Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states ; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul metropolitan area ( known as the " Twin Cities " ) , the center of transportation , business , industry , education , and government and home to an internationally known arts community . The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture ; deciduous forests in the southeast , now partially cleared , farmed and settled ; and the less populated North Woods , used for mining , forestry , and recreation . 
 Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout . Until European settlement , Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe / Anishinaabe . The French voyageurs and later English fur trappers were the earliest non @-@ native inhabitants . A large majority of the early territory and statehood settlers emigrated from the Eastern United States and Western Europe including Germany , Scandinavia , and Ireland . Eastern Europeans immigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century , with many first working in iron mines . In recent decades , immigration from Asia , Somalia , and Latin America has broadened the state 's historic demographic and cultural composition . Minnesota has America 's largest Somali population . Minnesota 's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States , and the state is also among the best @-@ educated and wealthiest in the nation . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River : <unk> . The root mni ( also spelled mini or <unk> ) means " water " and " tō " ( " ta " ) means " blue " . <unk> can be translated as clear blue water or clouded blue water depending on pronunciation . Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it <unk> . Many places in the state have similar names , such as Minnehaha Falls ( " laughing water " ( waterfall ) ) , <unk> ( " white water " ) , <unk> ( " much water " ) , Minnetonka ( " big water " ) , <unk> ( " crooked water " ) , and Minneapolis , a combination of mni and polis , the Greek word for " city " . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state ( after Alaska ) . Its isolated Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the only part of the 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel . The state is part of the U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America 's Great Lakes Region . It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east . Iowa is to the south , North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west , and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north . With 86 @,@ 943 square miles ( 225 @,@ 180 km2 ) , or approximately 2 @.@ 25 percent of the United States , Minnesota is the 12th @-@ largest state . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Minnesota contains some of the oldest rocks found on earth , gneisses that are about 3 @.@ 6 billion years old ( 80 percent as old as the planet ) . About 2 @.@ 7 billion years ago , basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the primordial ocean ; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota . The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota . Following a period of volcanism 1 @.@ 1 billion years ago , Minnesota 's geological activity has been more subdued , with no volcanism or mountain formation , but with repeated incursions of the sea , which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock . 
 In more recent times , massive ice sheets at least one kilometer thick ravaged the landscape of the state and sculpted its current terrain . The Wisconsin glaciation left 12 @,@ 000 years ago . These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast , an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock . This area is known as the Driftless Zone for its absence of glacial drift . Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50 feet ( 15 m ) or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated . Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13 @,@ 000 years ago . Its bed created the fertile Red River valley , and its outflow , glacial River Warren , carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling . Minnesota is geologically quiet today ; it experiences earthquakes infrequently , and most of them are minor . 
 The state 's high point is Eagle Mountain at 2 @,@ 301 feet ( 701 m ) , which is only 13 miles ( 21 km ) away from the low of 601 feet ( 183 m ) at the shore of Lake Superior . Notwithstanding dramatic local differences in elevation , much of the state is a gently rolling <unk> . 
 Two major drainage divides meet in the northeastern part of Minnesota in rural Hibbing , forming a triple watershed .

 = = = Flora and fauna = = = 
 Minnesota has four ecological provinces : Prairie Parkland , in the southwestern and western parts of the state ; the Eastern <unk> Forest ( Big Woods ) in the southeast , extending in a narrowing strip to the northwestern part of the state , where it transitions into <unk> Aspen Parkland ; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest , a transitional forest between the northern boreal forest and the broadleaf forests to the south . These northern forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar . 
 Much of Minnesota 's northern forest underwent logging at some time , leaving only a few patches of old growth forest today in areas such as in the Chippewa National Forest and the Superior National Forest , where the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has some 400 @,@ 000 acres ( 162 @,@ 000 ha ) of unlogged land . Although logging continues , regrowth and replanting keep about one third of the state forested . Nearly all of Minnesota 's prairies and oak savannas have been fragmented by farming , grazing , logging , and suburban development . 
 While loss of habitat has affected native animals such as the pine marten , elk , woodland caribou , and bison , others like whitetail deer and bobcat thrive . The state has the nation 's largest population of timber wolves outside Alaska , and supports healthy populations of black bears , moose , and gophers . Located on the Mississippi Flyway , Minnesota hosts migratory waterfowl such as geese and ducks , and game birds such as grouse , pheasants , and turkeys . It is home to birds of prey , including the largest number of breeding pairs of bald eagles in the lower 48 states as of 2007 , red @-@ tailed hawks , and snowy owls . The lakes teem with sport fish such as walleye , bass , muskellunge , and northern pike , and streams in the southeast and northeast are populated by brook , brown , and rainbow trout .

 = = History = = 
 Before European settlement of North America , Minnesota was populated by the Dakota people . As Europeans settled the east coast , Native American movement away from them caused migration of the Anishinaabe and other Native Americans into the Minnesota area . The first Europeans in the area were French fur traders who arrived in the 17th century . Late that century , Anishinaabe , also known as Ojibwe Indians migrated westward to Minnesota , causing tensions with the Dakota people . Explorers such as Daniel Greysolon , Sieur du Lhut , Father Louis Hennepin , Jonathan Carver , Henry Schoolcraft , and Joseph Nicollet mapped out the state . 
 In 1762 the region became part of Spanish Louisiana until 1802 . The portion of the state east of the Mississippi River became part of the United States at the end of the American Revolutionary War , when the Second Treaty of Paris was signed . Land west of the Mississippi River was acquired with the Louisiana Purchase , although a portion of the Red River Valley was disputed until the Treaty of 1818 . In 1805 , Zebulon Pike bargained with Native Americans to acquire land at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers . The construction of Fort Snelling followed between 1819 and 1825 . Its soldiers built a grist mill and a sawmill at Saint Anthony Falls , the first of the water @-@ powered industries around which the city of Minneapolis later grew . Meanwhile , squatters , government officials , and tourists had settled near the fort . In 1839 , the army forced them to move downriver and they settled in the area that became St. Paul . Minnesota Territory was formed on March 3 , 1849 . The first territorial legislature ( held September 2 , 1849 ) was dominated by men from New England or of New England ancestry . Thousands of people had come to build farms and cut timber , and Minnesota became the 32nd U.S. state on May 11 , 1858 . The founding population was so overwhelmingly of New England origins that the state was dubbed " the New England of the West " . 
 Treaties between European settlers and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands and on to smaller reservations . In 1861 , residents of Mankato formed the Knights of the Forest , with a goal of eliminating all Indians from Minnesota . As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota , tensions rose , leading to the Dakota War of 1862 . The result of the six @-@ week war was the execution of 38 Dakota and the exile of most of the rest of the Dakota to the Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory . As many as 800 white settlers died during the war . 
 Logging and farming were mainstays of Minnesota 's early economy . The sawmills at Saint Anthony Falls , and logging centers like Marine on St. Croix , Stillwater , and Winona , processed high volumes of lumber . These cities were situated on rivers that were ideal for transportation . Later , Saint Anthony Falls was tapped to provide power for flour mills . Innovations by Minneapolis millers led to the production of Minnesota " patent " flour , which commanded almost double the price of " bakers ' " or " clear " flour , which it replaced . By 1900 , Minnesota mills , led by Pillsbury , Northwestern and the Washburn @-@ Crosby Company ( a forerunner of General Mills ) , were grinding 14 @.@ 1 percent of the nation 's grain . 
 The state 's iron @-@ mining industry was established with the discovery of iron in the Vermilion Range and the Mesabi Range in the 1880s , and in the Cuyuna Range in the early 20th century . The ore was shipped by rail to Duluth and Two Harbors , then loaded onto ships and transported eastward over the Great Lakes . 
 Industrial development and the rise of manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century . Nevertheless , farming remained prevalent . Minnesota 's economy was hard @-@ hit by the Great Depression , resulting in lower prices for farmers , layoffs among iron miners , and labor unrest . Compounding the adversity , western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935 . New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround . The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations , and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self @-@ government . This provided natives a greater voice within the state , and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed . 
 After World War II , industrial development quickened . New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle , machine milking at dairy farms , and raising chickens in large buildings . Planting became more specialized with hybridization of corn and wheat , and the use of farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm . University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution . Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation . Increased mobility , in turn , enabled more specialized jobs . 
 Minnesota became a center of technology after World War II . Engineering Research Associates was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the United States Navy . It later merged with Remington Rand , and then became Sperry Rand . William Norris left Sperry in 1957 to form Control Data Corporation ( CDC ) . Cray Research was formed when Seymour Cray left CDC to form his own company . Medical device maker Medtronic also started business in the Twin Cities in 1949 .

 Saint Paul , located in east @-@ central Minnesota along the banks of the Mississippi River , has been Minnesota 's capital city since 1849 , first as capital of the Territory of Minnesota , and then as state capital since 1858 . 
 Saint Paul is adjacent to Minnesota 's most populous city , Minneapolis ; they and their suburbs are known collectively as the Twin Cities metropolitan area , the 13th @-@ largest metropolitan area in the United States and home to about 60 percent of the state 's population . The remainder of the state is known as " Greater Minnesota " or " <unk> Minnesota " . 
 The state has 17 cities with populations above 50 @,@ 000 ( as of the 2010 census ) . In descending order of population , they are Minneapolis , Saint Paul , Rochester , Duluth , Bloomington , Brooklyn Park , Plymouth , Saint Cloud , Woodbury , Eagan , Maple Grove , Coon Rapids , Eden Prairie , Minnetonka , Burnsville , Apple Valley , Blaine and Lakeville . Of these only Rochester , Duluth , and Saint Cloud are outside the Twin Cities metropolitan area . 
 Minnesota 's population continues to grow , primarily in the urban centers . The populations of metropolitan Sherburne and Scott counties doubled between 1980 and 2000 , while 40 of the state 's 87 counties lost residents over the same period .

The state is the U.S. ' s largest producer of sugar beets , sweet corn , and green peas for processing , and farm @-@ raised turkeys . Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans . Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States . Forestry remains strong , including logging , pulpwood processing and paper production , and forest products manufacturing . Minnesota was famous for its soft @-@ ore mines , which produced a significant portion of the world 's iron ore for over a century . Although the high @-@ grade ore is now depleted , taconite mining continues , using processes developed locally to save the industry . In 2004 , the state produced 75 percent of the country 's usable iron ore . The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore , coal , and agricultural products . The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry . The nation 's first indoor shopping mall was Edina 's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington 's Mall of America .

 = = Politics = = 
 Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry , and populism has been a longstanding force among the state 's political parties . Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout ( due in part to its liberal voter registration laws ) with virtually no evidence of unlawful voting . In the 2008 U.S. presidential election , 78 @.@ 2 percent of eligible Minnesotans voted — the highest percentage of any U.S. state — versus the national average of 61 @.@ 2 percent . Previously unregistered voters can register on election day at their polls with evidence of residency . 
 Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention . Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976 , longer than any other state . Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs . Minnesota has gone to the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960 , with the exception of 1972 , when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party . 
 Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major party status in Minnesota , but its state @-@ level " Democratic " party is actually a separate party , officially known as the Minnesota Democratic @-@ Farmer @-@ Labor Party ( DFL ) . Formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer @-@ Labor parties , its distinction from the national Democratic Party , while still official , is now but a technicality . 
 The state has had active third party movements . The Reform Party , now the Independence Party , was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998 . The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major party status . The Green Party , while no longer having major party status , has a large presence in municipal government , notably in Minneapolis and Duluth , where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices . Official " Major party " status in Minnesota ( which grants state funding for elections ) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election ( e.g. , Governor , Secretary of State , U.S. President ) . 
 The state 's U.S. Senate seats have generally been split since the early 1990s , and in the 108th and 109th Congresses , Minnesota 's congressional delegation was split , with four representatives and one senator from each party . In the 2006 midterm election , Democrats were elected to all state offices except for governor and lieutenant governor , where Republicans Tim Pawlenty and Carol <unk> narrowly won reelection . The DFL also posted double @-@ digit gains in both houses of the legislature , elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate , and increased the party 's U.S. House caucus by one . Keith Ellison ( DFL ) was elected as the first African American U.S. Representative from Minnesota as well as the first Muslim elected to Congress nationwide . In 2008 <unk> and former comedian and radio talk show host Al Franken beat incumbent Republican Norm Coleman in the United States Senate race by 312 votes out of 3 million cast . 
 In the election of 2010 , Republicans took control of both chambers of the Minnesota legislature for the first time in 38 years , and with Mark Dayton 's election the Democratic @-@ Farmer @-@ Labor party took the governor 's office for the first time in 20 years . Two years later , the DFL regained control of both houses , and with Governor Dayton in office , the party has same @-@ party control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990 . Two years later , the Republicans regained control of the Minnesota House in the 2014 election .

 = Punk rock = 
 Punk rock ( or simply punk ) is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States , United Kingdom , and Australia . Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music , punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock . Punk bands typically use short or fast @-@ paced songs , with hard @-@ edged melodies and singing styles , stripped @-@ down instrumentation , and often political , anti @-@ establishment lyrics . Punk embraces a DIY ethic ; many bands self @-@ produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels . 
 The term " punk " was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics in the early 1970s , to describe garage bands and their devotees . By late 1976 , bands such as Television and the Ramones in New York City , and the Sex Pistols , the Clash , and the Damned in London were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement . The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world , and it became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom . For the most part , punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream . An associated punk subculture emerged , expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing and adornment ( ranging from deliberately offensive T @-@ shirts , leather jackets , spike bands and other studded or spiked jewelry to bondage and S & M clothes ) and a variety of anti @-@ authoritarian ideologies . 
 By the beginning of the 1980s , faster , more aggressive styles such as hardcore ( e.g. Dead Kennedys ) and street punk ( e.g. The Exploited ) had become the predominant mode of punk rock . Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations , giving rise to post @-@ punk and the alternative rock movement . At the end of the 20th century , punk rock had been adopted by the mainstream , as pop punk and punk rock bands such as Green Day , the Offspring and Blink @-@ 182 brought the genre widespread popularity . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Philosophy = = = 
 The first wave of punk rock was aggressively modern , distancing itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock . According to Ramones drummer Tommy Ramone , " In its initial form , a lot of [ 1960s ] stuff was innovative and exciting . Unfortunately , what happens is that people who could not hold a candle to the likes of Hendrix started noodling away . Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere . By 1973 , I knew that what was needed was some pure , stripped down , no bullshit rock ' n ' roll . " John Holmstrom , founding editor of Punk magazine , recalls feeling " punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [ acts ] like Billy Joel and Simon and Garfunkel were being called rock and roll , when to me and other fans , rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music . " In critic Robert Christgau 's description , " It was also a subculture that scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower @-@ power silliness of hippie myth . " 
 Technical accessibility and a DIY spirit are prized in punk rock . In the early days of punk rock , this ethic stood in marked contrast to what those in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands . Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion . According to Holmstrom , punk rock was " rock and roll by people who didn 't have very much skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music " . In December 1976 , the English fanzine <unk> published a now @-@ famous illustration of three chords , captioned " This is a chord , this is another , this is a third . Now form a band " . The title of a 1980 single by the New York punk band <unk> , " Loud Fast Rules ! " inscribed a catchphrase for punk 's basic musical approach . 
 Some of British punk rock 's leading figures made a show of rejecting not only contemporary mainstream rock and the broader culture it was associated with , but their own most celebrated music predecessors : " No Elvis , Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977 " , declared the Clash song " 1977 " . The previous year , when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain , was to be both a musical and a cultural " Year Zero " . Even as nostalgia was discarded , many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols slogan " No Future " ; in the later words of one observer , amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977 , " punk 's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England . " While " self @-@ imposed alienation " was common among " drunk punks " and " gutter punks " , there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the " radical leftist utopianism " of bands such as Crass , who found positive , liberating meaning in the movement . As a Clash associate describes singer Joe Strummer 's outlook , " Punk rock is meant to be our freedom . We 're meant to be able to do what we want to do . " 
 The issue of authenticity is important in the punk subculture — the pejorative term " poseur " is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values and philosophy . Scholar Daniel S. <unk> argues that " attaining authenticity in the punk identity can be difficult " ; as the punk scene matured , he observes , eventually " everyone got called a poseur " . 
 = = = Musical and lyrical elements = = = 
 Punk rock bands often emulate the bare musical structures and arrangements of 1960s garage rock . Typical punk rock instrumentation includes one or two electric guitars , an electric bass , and a drum kit , along with vocals . Songs tend to be shorter than those of other popular genres . Most early punk rock songs retained a traditional rock ' n ' roll verse @-@ chorus form and 4 / 4 time signature . However , later bands have often broken from this format . In critic Steven Blush 's description , " The Sex Pistols were still rock 'n'roll ... like the craziest version of Chuck Berry . Hardcore was a radical departure from that . It wasn 't verse @-@ chorus rock . It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be . It 's its own form . " 
 Punk rock vocals sometimes sound nasal , and lyrics are often shouted instead of sung in a conventional sense , particularly in hardcore styles . Shifts in pitch , volume , or <unk> style are relatively infrequent . Complicated guitar solos are considered self @-@ indulgent and unnecessary , although basic guitar breaks are common . Guitar parts tend to include highly distorted power chords or barre chords , creating a characteristic sound described by Christgau as a " buzzsaw drone " . Some punk rock bands take a surf rock approach with a lighter , twangier guitar tone . Others , such as Robert Quine , lead guitarist of the Voidoids , have employed a wild , " gonzo " attack , a style that stretches back through the Velvet Underground to the 1950s recordings of Ike Turner . Bass guitar lines are often uncomplicated ; the quintessential approach is a relentless , repetitive " forced rhythm " , although some punk rock bass players — such as Mike Watt of the Minutemen and Firehose — emphasize more technical bass lines . Bassists often use a pick due to the rapid succession of notes , which makes fingerpicking impractical . Drums typically sound heavy and dry , and often have a minimal set @-@ up . Compared to other forms of rock , syncopation is much less the rule . Hardcore drumming tends to be especially fast . Production tends to be minimalistic , with tracks sometimes laid down on home tape recorders or simple four @-@ track <unk> . The typical objective is to have the recording sound <unk> and " real " , reflecting the commitment and " authenticity " of a live performance . 
 Punk rock lyrics are typically frank and confrontational ; compared to the lyrics of other popular music genres , they frequently comment on social and political issues . Trend @-@ setting songs such as the Clash 's " Career Opportunities " and Chelsea 's " Right to Work " deal with unemployment and the grim realities of urban life . Especially in early British punk , a central goal was to outrage and shock the mainstream . The Sex Pistols ' " Anarchy in the U.K. " and " God Save the Queen " openly disparaged the British political system and social mores . Anti @-@ sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common , as in " Love Comes in <unk> " , written by Richard Hell and recorded by him with the Voidoids . <unk> , variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell 's " Blank Generation " and the bluntness of the Ramones ' " Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue " , is a common theme . Identifying punk with such topics aligns with the view expressed by V. Vale , founder of San Francisco fanzine Search and Destroy : " Punk was a total cultural revolt . It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture , right @-@ wing imagery , sexual taboos , a delving into it that had never been done before by any generation in such a thorough way " . 
 = = = Visual and other elements = = = 
 The classic punk rock look among male American musicians harkens back to the T @-@ shirt , motorcycle jacket , and jeans ensemble favored by American greasers of the 1950s associated with the rockabilly scene and by British rockers of the 1960s . The cover of the Ramones ' 1976 debut album , featuring a shot of the band by Punk photographer Roberta Bayley , set forth the basic elements of a style that was soon widely emulated by rock musicians both punk and <unk> . Richard Hell 's more androgynous , ragamuffin look — and reputed invention of the safety @-@ pin aesthetic — was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario Malcolm McLaren and , in turn , British punk style . ( John D Morton of Cleveland 's Electric Eels may have been the first rock musician to wear a safety @-@ pin @-@ covered jacket ) . McLaren 's partner , fashion designer Vivienne Westwood , credits Johnny Rotten as the first British punk to rip his shirt , and Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious as the first to use safety pins , although few of those following Punk could afford to buy McLaren and Westwood 's designs so famously worn by the Pistols , so they made their own , diversifying the ' look ' with various different styles based on these designs . Young women in punk demolished the typical female types in rock of either " coy sex kittens or wronged blues belters " in their fashion . Early female punk musicians displayed styles ranging from Siouxsie Sioux 's bondage gear to Patti Smith 's " straight @-@ from @-@ the @-@ gutter androgyny " . The former proved much more influential on female fan styles . Over time , tattoos , piercings , and metal @-@ studded and <unk> accessories became increasingly common elements of punk fashion among both musicians and fans , a " style of adornment calculated to disturb and outrage " . Among the other facets of the Punk Rock scene , a punks hair is an important way of showing their freedom of expression . The typical male punk haircut was originally short and choppy ; the Mohawk later emerged as a characteristic style . Along with the mohawk , long spikes have been associated with the punk rock genre . 
 The characteristic stage performance style of male punk musicians does not deviate significantly from the macho postures classically associated with rock music . Female punk musicians broke more clearly from earlier styles . Scholar John Strohm suggests that they did so by creating personas of a type conventionally seen as masculine : " They adopted a tough , unladylike pose that borrowed more from the macho swagger of sixties garage bands than from the calculated bad @-@ girl image of bands like the Runaways . " Scholar Dave Laing describes how bassist Gaye Advert adopted fashion elements associated with male musicians only to generate a stage persona readily consumed as " sexy " . Laing focuses on more innovative and challenging performance styles , seen in the various erotically destabilizing approaches of Siouxsie Sioux , the Slits ' Ari Up , and X @-@ Ray Spex ' Poly <unk> . 
 The lack of emphatic syncopation led punk dance to " deviant " forms . The characteristic style was originally the pogo . Sid Vicious , before he became the Sex Pistols ' bassist , is credited with initiating the pogo in Britain as an attendee at one of their concerts . <unk> ( Slam Dancing ) is typical at hardcore shows . The lack of conventional dance rhythms was a central factor in limiting punk 's mainstream commercial impact . 
 Breaking down the distance between performer and audience is central to the punk ethic . Fan participation at concerts is thus important ; during the movement 's first heyday , it was often provoked in an adversarial manner — apparently perverse , but appropriately " punk " . First @-@ wave British punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Damned insulted and otherwise goaded the audience into intense reactions . Laing has identified three primary forms of audience physical response to goading : can throwing , stage invasion , and spitting or " <unk> " . In the hardcore realm , stage invasion is often a prelude to stage diving . In addition to the numerous fans who have started or joined punk bands , audience members also become important participants via the scene 's many amateur periodicals — in England , according to Laing , punk " was the first musical genre to spawn fanzines in any significant numbers " . 
 = = Precursors = = 
 = = = 1960s progenitors = = = 
 In the early- to mid @-@ 1960s , garage rock bands , often recognized as punk rock 's progenitors , began springing up around North America . The Kingsmen , from Portland , Oregon , had a hit with their 1963 cover of " Louie , Louie , " considered by some as punk rock 's defining " ur @-@ text . " The iconic song was originally written and performed by Richard Berry as an ode to the lovelorn confessions of a drunken Jamaican sailor and displays Latin influences , with its " El Loco Cha @-@ Cha " riffs that were later pared down to a more simple and primitive rock arrangement in the Kingsmen 's version providing a stylistic model for countless garage rock bands to come . After the Beatles ' first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show , and then with the subsequent string of other successful British acts , the garage band phenomenon gathered increased momentum . The minimalist sound of many garage rock combos was influenced by the harder @-@ edged wing of the British Invasion , exemplified by groups such as the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds . After 1967 , U.S. garage rock began to fall out of favor , but the raw sound and outsider attitude of groups , such as the Sonics , the Seeds , the Remains , the Standells , and the Shadows of Knight predicted the style of later bands such as MC5 and the Stooges . In the early 1970s , certain rock critics began to speak of the mid @-@ 1960s garage bands ( as well bands that they considered continuing in their line , such as MC5 and the Stooges ) as a genre that they called " punk rock . " However , since the advent of New York and London scenes of 1975 @-@ 1978 and the subculture that grew out of them , the term has become most commonly applied to music emerging after 1974 . Sixties garage bands are now typically described as garage rock , or , especially in the case of their immediate successors , proto @-@ punk . 
 From England in 1964 , largely under the grip of the mod youth movement and beat group explosion , came the Kinks ' hit singles , " You Really Got Me " and " All Day and All of the Night , " both influenced by " Louie , Louie " . They have been described as " predecessors of the whole three @-@ chord genre . " For instance , the Ramones ' 1978 ' I Don 't Want You , ' was largely Kink 's @-@ influenced . In 1965 , the Who progressed from their first single , " I Can 't Explain , " a virtual Kinks clone , to " My Generation " . Though it had little impact on the American charts , the Who 's mod anthem pre @-@ figured the kind of " cerebral mix of musical ferocity and rebellious posture " that would characterize much of the later British punk rock of the 1970s . John Reed describes the Clash 's emergence as a " tight ball of energy with both an image and rhetoric reminiscent of a young Pete Townshend — speed obsession , pop @-@ art clothing , art school ambition . " The Who and fellow mods the Small Faces were among the few rock elders acknowledged by the Sex Pistols . 
 The garage and beat phenomenon was not exclusive to North America and Great Briton . Various countries experienced grass @-@ roots rock movements which essentially served as counterparts to what was happening in the North America and Britain , several of which are sometimes retroactively referred to as Nederbeat ( Netherlands ) , Uruguayan Invasion ( Uruguay ) , or Group Sounds ( Japan ) , or in other cases as " beat " or " garage rock " . Australia and New Zealand had active beat / garage scenes , procuring a host of bands , such as the Missing Links whose brazenly primitivistic " Wild About You " would be covered a decade later by fellow compatriots , the Saints . There were numerous garage rock bands in India during the 1960s , perpetuating the style even into the early 1970s . Los Saicos out of Peru recoded 1965 's " <unk> " , which is a notable early example of protopunk . AllMusic , writing about Los Saicos , noted that " The guitars sound like nothing so much as fountains of sparks , the drums have a tribal post @-@ surf throb , and the vocals are positively unhinged " and " These guys were a punk rock band , even if nobody outside Lima knew it at the time " . The garage and beat boom dissipated in the late 1960s , but a handful of maverick acts , carried its influence into the 1970s , seizing on its protopunk elements , but brandishing them with greater intensity .

 In August 1969 , the Stooges , from Ann Arbor , premiered with a self @-@ titled album . According to critic Greil Marcus , the band , led by singer Iggy Pop , created " the sound of Chuck Berry 's Airmobile — after thieves stripped it for parts " . The album was produced by John Cale , a former member of New York 's experimental rock group the Velvet Underground . Having earned a " reputation as the first underground rock band , " the Velvet Underground inspired , directly or indirectly , many of those involved in the creation of punk rock . 
 In the early 1970s , the New York Dolls updated the original wildness of 1950 's rock ' n ' roll in a fashion that later became known as glam punk . The New York duo Suicide played spare , experimental music with a confrontational stage act inspired by that of the Stooges . At the Coventry club in the New York City borough of Queens , the Dictators used rock as a vehicle for wise @-@ ass attitude and humor . In Boston , the Modern Lovers , led by Velvet Underground devotee Jonathan Richman , gained attention with a minimalistic style . In 1974 , an updated garage rock scene began to coalesce around the newly opened Rathskeller club in Kenmore Square . Among the leading acts were the Real Kids , founded by former Modern Lover John Felice ; Willie Alexander and the Boom Boom Band , whose frontman had been a member of the Velvet Underground for a few months in 1971 ; and Mickey Clean and the Mezz . In 1974 , as well , the Detroit band Death — made up of three African @-@ American brothers — recorded " scorching blasts of feral ur @-@ punk , " but couldn 't arrange a release deal . In Ohio , a small but influential underground rock scene emerged , led by Devo in Akron and Kent and by Cleveland 's Electric Eels , Mirrors and Rocket from the Tombs . In 1975 , Rocket from the Tombs split into Pere Ubu and Frankenstein . The Electric Eels and Mirrors both broke up , and the <unk> emerged from the fallout . 
 Britain 's Deviants , in the late 1960s , played in a range of psychedelic styles with a satiric , anarchic edge and a penchant for <unk> @-@ style spectacle presaging the Sex Pistols by almost a decade . In 1970 , the act evolved into the Pink Fairies , which carried on in a similar vein . With his Ziggy Stardust persona , David Bowie made artifice and exaggeration central — elements , again , that were picked up by the Sex Pistols and certain other punk acts . The Doctors of Madness built on Bowie 's presentation concepts , while moving musically in the direction that would become identified with punk . Bands in London 's pub rock scene stripped the music back to its basics , playing hard , R & B @-@ influenced rock ' n ' roll . By 1974 , the scene 's top act , Dr. Feelgood , was paving the way for others such as the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer that would play a role in the punk explosion . Among the pub rock bands that formed that year was the <unk> , whose lead singer would soon adopt the name Joe Strummer . 
 Bands anticipating the forthcoming movement were appearing as far afield as Düsseldorf , West Germany , where " punk before punk " band <unk> ! formed in 1971 , building on the Krautrock tradition of groups such as Can . In Japan , the anti @-@ establishment <unk> <unk> ( Brain Police ) mixed garage @-@ psych and folk . The combo regularly faced censorship challenges , their live act at least once including onstage masturbation . A new generation of Australian garage rock bands , inspired mainly by the Stooges and MC5 , was coming even closer to the sound that would soon be called " punk " : In Brisbane , the Saints also recalled the raw live sound of the British Pretty Things , who had made a notorious tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1975 . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Between the late 16th and the 18th centuries , punk was a common , coarse synonym for prostitute ; William Shakespeare used it with that meaning in The Merry Wives of Windsor ( 1602 ) and Measure for Measure ( 1623 ) . The term eventually came to describe " a young male hustler , a gangster , a hoodlum , or a ruffian " . As Legs McNeil explains , " On TV , if you watched cop shows , Kojak , Baretta , when the cops finally catch the mass murderer , they 'd say , ' you dirty Punk . ' It was what your teachers would call you . It meant that you were the lowest . " The first known use of the phrase punk rock appeared in the Chicago Tribune on March 22 , 1970 , attributed to Ed Sanders , cofounder of New York 's anarcho @-@ prankster band the Fugs . Sanders was quoted describing a solo album of his as " punk rock — redneck sentimentality " . In the December 1970 issue of Creem , Lester Bangs , mocking more mainstream rock musicians , ironically referred to Iggy Pop as " that Stooge punk " . Suicide 's Alan Vega credits this usage with inspiring his duo to bill its gigs as a " punk mass " for the next couple of years . 
 Dave Marsh was the first music critic to employ the term punk rock : In the May 1971 issue of Creem , he described ? and the Mysterians , one of the most popular 1960s garage rock acts , as giving a " landmark exposition of punk rock " . Later in 1971 , in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp , Greg Shaw wrote about " what I have chosen to call " punkrock " bands — white teenage hard rock of ' 64 – 66 ( Standells , Kingsmen , Shadows of Knight , etc . ) " . Robert Christgau writing for the Village Voice in October , 1971 refers to " mid @-@ 60s punk " as a historical period of rock @-@ and @-@ roll . Lester Bangs would use the term " punk rock " in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid @-@ 1960s garage acts . In his June , 1971 piece in Creem , " Psychotic Reactions and <unk> Dung , " he wrote , " then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds ' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter . ... oh , it was beautiful , it was pure folklore , Old America , and sometimes I think those were the best days ever . " In several places in a 1971 article in Who Put the Bomp , Bangs refers to Britain 's the Troggs and bands of their ilk as " punk . " In June 1972 , the fanzine Flash included a " Punk Top Ten " of 1960s albums . By that December , the term was in circulation to the extent that The New Yorker 's Ellen Willis , contrasting her own tastes with those of Flash and fellow critic Nick <unk> , wrote , " Punk @-@ rock has become the favored term of endearment . " In the liner notes of the 1972 anthology LP , Nuggets , musician and rock journalist Lenny Kaye , later a member of the Patti Smith Group , used variations of the term in two places : first " punk rock , " in the essay liner notes , to describe the genre of 1960s garage bands , and then , later , " classic garage @-@ punk , " in the track @-@ by @-@ track notes , to describe a song recorded in 1966 by the Shadows of Knight . In the January 1973 Rolling Stone review of Nuggets , Greg Shaw commented " Punk rock at its best is the closest we came in the ' 60s to the original rockabilly spirit of Rock ' n Roll ... " In February 1973 , Terry Atkinson of the Los Angeles Times , reviewing the debut album by a hard rock band , Aerosmith , declared that it " achieves all that punk @-@ rock bands strive for but most miss . " Three months later , Billy Altman launched the short @-@ lived punk magazine , which pre @-@ dated the better @-@ known 1975 publication of the same name , but , unlike the later magazine , was largely devoted to discussion of 1960s garage and psychedelic acts . 
 In May 1974 , Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn reviewed the second New York Dolls album , Too Much Too Soon . " I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing , " he wrote , describing the album as " perhaps the best example of raw , thumb @-@ your @-@ nose @-@ at @-@ the @-@ world , punk rock since the Rolling Stones ' Exile on Main Street . " Bassist Jeff Jensen of Boston 's Real Kids reports of a show that year , " A reviewer for one of the free entertainment magazines of the time caught the act and gave us a great review , calling us a ' punk band . ' ... [ W ] e all sort of looked at each other and said , ' What 's punk ? ' " 
 By 1975 , punk was being used to describe acts as diverse as the Patti Smith Group , the Bay City Rollers , and Bruce Springsteen . As the scene at New York 's CBGB club attracted notice , a name was sought for the developing sound . Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement " street rock " ; John Holmstrom credits Aquarian magazine with using punk " to describe what was going on at <unk> " . Holmstrom , McNeil , and Ged Dunn 's magazine Punk , which debuted at the end of 1975 , was crucial in codifying the term . " It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular " , Holmstrom later remarked . " We figured we 'd take the name before anyone else claimed it . We wanted to get rid of the bullshit , strip it down to rock ' n ' roll . We wanted the fun and liveliness back . "

 The origins of New York 's punk rock scene can be traced back to such sources as late 1960s trash culture and an early 1970s underground rock movement centered on the Mercer Arts Center in Greenwich Village , where the New York Dolls performed . In early 1974 , a new scene began to develop around the CBGB club , also in lower Manhattan . At its core was Television , described by critic John Walker as " the ultimate garage band with pretensions " . Their influences ranged from the Velvet Underground to the staccato guitar work of Dr. Feelgood 's Wilko Johnson . The band 's bassist / singer , Richard Hell , created a look with cropped , ragged hair , ripped T @-@ shirts , and black leather jackets credited as the basis for punk rock visual style . In April 1974 , Patti Smith , a member of the Mercer Arts Center crowd and a friend of Hell 's , came to CBGB for the first time to see the band perform . A veteran of independent theater and performance poetry , Smith was developing an intellectual , feminist take on rock ' n ' roll . On June 5 , she recorded the single " Hey Joe " / " Piss Factory " , featuring Television guitarist Tom Verlaine ; released on her own Mer Records label , it heralded the scene 's do it yourself ( DIY ) ethic and has often been cited as the first punk rock record . By August , Smith and Television were gigging together at another downtown New York club , Max 's Kansas City . 
 Out in Forest Hills , Queens , several miles from lower Manhattan , the members of a newly formed band adopted a common surname . Drawing on sources ranging from the Stooges to the Beatles and the Beach Boys to Herman 's Hermits and 1960s girl groups , the Ramones condensed rock ' n ' roll to its primal level : " ' 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 ! ' bass @-@ player Dee Dee Ramone shouted at the start of every song , as if the group could barely master the rudiments of rhythm . " The band played its first gig at CBGB on August 16 , 1974 , on the same bill as another new act , Angel and the Snake , soon to be renamed Blondie . By the end of the year , the Ramones had performed seventy @-@ four shows , each about seventeen minutes long . " When I first saw the Ramones " , critic Mary Harron later remembered , " I couldn 't believe people were doing this . The dumb <unk> . " The Dictators , with a similar " playing dumb " concept , were recording their debut album . The Dictators ' Go Girl Crazy ! came out in March 1975 , mixing absurdist originals such as " Master Race Rock " and loud , straight @-@ faced covers of cheese pop like Sonny & Cher 's " I Got You Babe " . 
 That spring , Smith and Television shared a two @-@ month @-@ long weekend residency at CBGB that significantly raised the club 's profile . The Television sets included Richard Hell 's " Blank Generation " , which became the scene 's emblematic anthem . Soon after , Hell left Television and founded a band featuring a more stripped @-@ down sound , the Heartbreakers , with former New York Dolls Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan . The pairing of Hell and Thunders , in one critical assessment , " inject [ ed ] a poetic intelligence into mindless self @-@ destruction " . A July festival at CBGB featuring over thirty new groups brought the scene its first substantial media coverage . In August , Television — with Fred Smith , former Blondie bassist , replacing Hell — recorded a single , " Little Johnny Jewel " , for the tiny Ork label . In the words of John Walker , the record was " a turning point for the whole New York scene " if not quite for the punk rock sound itself — Hell 's departure had left the band " significantly reduced in fringe aggression " . 
 Other bands were becoming regulars at CBGB , such as Mink DeVille and Talking Heads , which moved down from Rhode Island . More closely associated with Max 's Kansas City were Suicide and the band led by Jayne County , another Mercer Arts Center alumna . The first album to come out of this downtown scene was released in November 1975 : Smith 's debut , Horses , produced by John Cale for the major Arista label . The inaugural issue of Punk appeared in December . The new magazine tied together earlier artists such as Velvet Underground lead singer Lou Reed , the Stooges , and the New York Dolls with the editors ' favorite band , the Dictators , and the array of new acts centered on CBGB and Max 's . That winter , Pere Ubu came in from Cleveland and played at both spots . 
 Early in 1976 , Hell left the Heartbreakers ; he soon formed a new group that would become known as the Voidoids , " one of the most harshly uncompromising bands " on the scene . That April , the Ramones ' debut album was released by Sire Records ; the first single was " Blitzkrieg Bop " , opening with the rally cry " Hey ! Ho ! Let 's go ! " According to a later description , " Like all cultural watersheds , Ramones was embraced by a discerning few and slagged off as a bad joke by the uncomprehending majority . " At the instigation of Ramones lead singer Joey Ramone , the members of Cleveland 's Frankenstein moved east to join the New York scene . <unk> as the Dead Boys , they played their first CBGB gig in late July . In August , Ork put out an EP recorded by Hell with his new band that included the first released version of " Blank Generation " . 
 Other New York venues apart from CBGB included the <unk> Lounge ( 41 First Avenue ) and Aztec Lounge ( 9th Street ) . 
 At this early stage , the term punk applied to the scene in general , not necessarily a particular stylistic approach as it would later — the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences . Among them , the Ramones , the Heartbreakers , Richard Hell and the Voidoids , and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style . Even where they diverged most clearly , in lyrical approach — the Ramones ' apparent guilelessness at one extreme , Hell 's conscious craft at the other — there was an abrasive attitude in common . Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed , however , had not yet come to define punk rock .

 Chickasha , Oklahoma gave birth to avant garde , glam @-@ punk bands Victoria Vein and the <unk> in 1974 and Debris ' in 1975 whose self @-@ released underground classic Static Disposal was released in 1976 . The album has been touted as an inspiration by numerous bands including Scream , Nurse With Wound , the Melvins and Sonic Youth . In 1975 , the Suicide Commandos formed in Minneapolis . They were one of the first U.S. bands outside of New York to play in the Ramones @-@ style harder @-@ louder @-@ faster mode that would define punk rock . Detroit 's Death self @-@ released one of their 1974 recordings , " Politicians in My Eyes " , in 1976 . As the punk movement expanded rapidly in the United Kingdom that year , a few bands with similar tastes and attitude appeared around the United States . The first West Coast punk scenes emerged in San Francisco , with the bands Crime and the Nuns , and Seattle , where the Telepaths , <unk> , and the <unk> played a groundbreaking show on May 1 . Rock critic Richard Meltzer cofounded <unk> ( short for " vomit " ) in Los Angeles . Meanwhile , in Los Angeles , performer Alice Bag formed the punk music group The Bags in 1977 . Alice influenced the Hollywood punk scene by incorporating Mexican and Chicano musical culture into her music through canción ranchera — which translates to " country song " and is associated with mariachi ensembles — as well as <unk> <unk> , a wild style of performance often seen in punk . In Washington , D.C. , raucous roots @-@ rockers the <unk> helped along a nascent punk scene featuring Overkill , the <unk> Boys , and the Look . Around the turn of the year , White Boy began giving notoriously crazed performances . In Boston , the scene at the Rathskeller — affectionately known as the Rat — was also turning toward punk , though the defining sound retained a distinct garage rock orientation . Among the city 's first new acts to be identified with punk rock was DMZ . In Bloomington , Indiana , the <unk> played in a jokey , raunchy , Dictators @-@ inspired style later referred to as " frat punk " . 
 Like their garage rock predecessors , these local scenes were facilitated by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools , garages , or warehouses , advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines . In some cases , punk 's do it yourself ethic reflected an aversion to commercial success , as well as a desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy . As Joe Harvard , a participant in the Boston scene , describes , it was often a simple necessity — the absence of a local recording industry and well @-@ distributed music magazines left little recourse but DIY .

 At the same time , a similar music @-@ based subculture was beginning to take shape in various parts of Australia . A scene was developing around Radio Birdman and its main performance venue , the Oxford Tavern ( later the Oxford Funhouse ) , located in Sydney 's Darlinghurst suburb . In December 1975 , the group won the RAM ( Rock Australia Magazine ) / Levi 's Punk Band Thriller competition . By 1976 , the Saints were hiring Brisbane local halls to use as venues , or playing in " Club 76 " , their shared house in the inner suburb of Petrie Terrace . The band soon discovered that musicians were exploring similar paths in other parts of the world . Ed <unk> , co @-@ founder of the Saints , later recalled : 
 One thing I remember having had a really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album . When I heard it [ in 1976 ] , I mean it was a great record ... but I hated it because I knew we ’ d been doing this sort of stuff for years . There was even a chord progression on that album that we used ... and I thought , " Fuck . We ’ re going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones " , when nothing could have been further from the truth . 
 On the other side of Australia , in Perth , germinal punk rock act the Cheap Nasties , featuring singer @-@ guitarist Kim Salmon , formed in August . In September 1976 , the Saints became the first punk rock band outside the U.S. to release a recording , the single " ( I 'm ) Stranded " . As with Patti Smith 's debut , the band self @-@ financed , packaged , and distributed the single . " ( I 'm ) Stranded " had limited impact at home , but the British music press recognized it as a groundbreaking record . At the insistence of their superiors in the UK , EMI Australia signed the Saints . Meanwhile , Radio Birdman came out with a self @-@ financed EP , Burn My Eye , in October . Trouser Press critic Ian McCaleb later described the record as the " archetype for the musical explosion that was about to occur " .

 By 1975 the movement was already well established in London and had been growing for a number of years , with non @-@ gigging and recording bands like The Flowers of Romance who went on to gain near mythical status . Inspired by music from The Velvet Underground , Iggy Pop and early David Bowie at one point the band featured Sid Vicious , Marco Pirroni and Viv Albertine , who later joined The Slits . Following a brief period unofficially managing the New York Dolls , Briton Malcolm McLaren returned to London in May 1975 , inspired by the new scene he had witnessed at CBGB . The Kings Road clothing store he co @-@ owned , recently renamed Sex , was building a reputation with its outrageous " anti @-@ fashion " . Among those who frequented the shop were members of a band called the Strand , which McLaren had also been managing . In August , the group was seeking a new lead singer . Another Sex habitué , Johnny Rotten , auditioned for and won the job . Adopting a new name , the group played its first gig as the Sex Pistols on November 6 , 1975 , at Saint Martin 's School of Art and soon attracted a small but ardent following . In February 1976 , the band received its first significant press coverage ; guitarist Steve Jones declared that the Sex Pistols were not so much into music as they were " chaos " . The band often provoked its crowds into near @-@ riots . Rotten announced to one audience , " Bet you don 't hate us as much as we hate you ! " McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement , " hard and tough " . As described by critic Jon Savage , the band members " embodied an attitude into which McLaren fed a new set of references : late @-@ sixties radical politics , sexual fetish material , pop history , ... youth sociology " . 
 Bernard Rhodes , a sometime associate of McLaren and friend of the Sex Pistols , was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS . Early in 1976 , London SS broke up before ever performing publicly , spinning off two new bands : the Damned and the Clash , which was joined by Joe Strummer , former lead singer of the 101'ers . On June 4 , 1976 , the Sex Pistols played Manchester 's Lesser Free Trade Hall in what came to be regarded as one of the most influential rock shows ever . Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig — they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February . Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division , the Fall , and — in the 1980s — the Smiths . 
 In July , the Ramones crossed the Atlantic for two London shows that helped spark the nascent UK punk scene and affected its musical style — " instantly nearly every band speeded up " . On July 4 , they played with the Flamin ' Groovies and the Stranglers before a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 at the Roundhouse . That same night , the Clash debuted , opening for the Sex Pistols in Sheffield . On July 5 , members of both bands attended a Ramones gig at Dingwalls club . The following night , the Damned performed their first show , as the Sex Pistols opening act in London . In critic Kurt Loder 's description , the Sex Pistols purveyed a " calculated , arty nihilism , [ while ] the Clash were unabashed idealists , proponents of a radical left @-@ wing social critique of a sort that reached back at least to ... Woody Guthrie in the 1940s " . The Damned built a reputation as " punk 's party boys " . This London scene 's first fanzine appeared a week later . Its title , Sniffin ' Glue , derived from a Ramones song . Its subtitle affirmed the connection with what was happening in New York : " + Other Rock ' n ' Roll Habits for Punks ! " 
 Another Sex Pistols gig in Manchester on July 20 , with a reorganized version of Buzzcocks debuting in support , gave further impetus to the scene there . In August , the self @-@ described " First European Punk Rock Festival " was held in Mont de Marsan in the southwest of France . Eddie and the Hot Rods , a London pub rock group , headlined . The Sex Pistols , originally scheduled to play , were dropped by the organizers who said the band had gone " too far " in demanding top billing and certain amenities ; the Clash backed out in solidarity . The only band from the new punk movement to appear was the Damned . 
 Over the next several months , many new punk rock bands formed , often directly inspired by the Sex Pistols . In London , women were near the center of the scene — among the initial wave of bands were the female @-@ fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X @-@ Ray Spex and the all @-@ female the Slits . There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and <unk> Bradley in the Nipple Erectors . Other groups included Subway Sect , Eater , the <unk> , the aptly named London , and Chelsea , which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield , Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham . In Durham , there was Penetration , with lead singer Pauline Murray . On September 20 – 21 , the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups ( London 's big three and Buzzcocks ) , as well as Paris 's female @-@ fronted Stinky Toys , arguably the first punk rock band from a non @-@ Anglophone country . Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival 's first night ; that same evening , Eater debuted in Manchester . On the festival 's second night , audience member Sid Vicious was arrested , charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl 's eye . Press coverage of the incident fueled punk 's reputation as a social menace . 
 Some new bands , such as London 's Alternative TV , Edinburgh 's Rezillos , and Leamington 's the Shapes , identified with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music . Others of a comparatively traditional rock ' n ' roll bent were also swept up by the movement : the Vibrators , formed as a pub rock – style act in February 1976 , soon adopted a punk look and sound . A few even longer @-@ active bands including Surrey neo @-@ mods the Jam and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene . Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated <unk> of the early Who , the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade , T.Rex , and Roxy Music . One of the groups openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones , from Derry in Northern Ireland . 
 In October , the Damned became the first UK punk rock band to release a single , the romance @-@ themed " New Rose " . The Vibrators followed the next month with " We <unk> " and , backing long @-@ time rocker Chris Spedding , " Pogo Dancing " . The latter was hardly a punk song by any stretch , but it was perhaps the first song about punk rock . On 26 November , the Sex Pistols ' " Anarchy in the U.K. " came out — with its debut single the band succeeded in its goal of becoming a " national scandal " . Jamie Reid 's " anarchy flag " poster and his other design work for the Sex Pistols helped establish a distinctive punk visual aesthetic . On December 1 , an incident took place that sealed punk rock 's notorious reputation : On Thames Today , an early evening London TV show , Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones was goaded into a verbal altercation by the host , Bill Grundy . Jones called Grundy a " dirty fucker " on live television , triggering a media controversy . Two days later , the Sex Pistols , the Clash , the Damned , and the Heartbreakers set out on the Anarchy Tour , a series of gigs throughout the UK . Many of the shows were cancelled by venue owners in response to the media outrage following the Grundy confrontation .

 By 1977 , a second wave of the punk rock movement was breaking in the three countries where it had emerged , as well as in many other places . Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other , reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era . While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America , Australia , and the new spots where it was emerging , in the UK it briefly became a major sensation .

 The California punk scene was in full swing by early 1977 . In Los Angeles , there were the Weirdos , the Zeros , Black Randy and the <unk> , the Germs , X , the Dickies , Bags , and the relocated <unk> , now dubbed the Screamers . San Francisco 's second wave included the Avengers , Negative Trend , the Mutants , and the <unk> the <unk> , from Carlsbad , moved between the two major cities . The Wipers formed in Portland , Oregon . In Seattle , there was the Lewd . Often sharing gigs with the Seattle punks were bands from across the Canadian border . A major scene developed in Vancouver , spearheaded by the Furies and Victoria 's all @-@ female Dee Dee and the <unk> the Skulls spun off into D.O.A. and the <unk> . The K @-@ <unk> ( later known as the Young Canadians ) and Pointed Sticks were among the area 's other leading punk acts . 
 In eastern Canada , the Toronto protopunk band Dishes had laid the groundwork for another sizable scene , and a September 1976 concert by the touring Ramones had catalyzed the movement . Early Ontario punk bands included the <unk> , the <unk> , Battered Wives , the <unk> , Forgotten Rebels , Teenage Head , the Poles , and the Ugly . Along with the <unk> , Toronto 's the Curse and B Girls were North America 's first all @-@ female punk acts . In July 1977 , the <unk> , <unk> , Curse , and Teenage Head headed down to New York City to play " Canada night " at CBGB . 
 By mid @-@ 1977 in downtown New York , punk rock was already ceding its cutting @-@ edge status to the anarchic sound of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and Mars , spearheads of what became known as no wave , although several original punk bands continued to perform and new ones emerged on the scene . The Cramps , whose core members were from Sacramento , California by way of Akron , had debuted at CBGB in November 1976 , opening for the Dead Boys . They were soon playing regularly at Max 's Kansas City . The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey . Still developing what would become their signature B movie – inspired style , later dubbed horror punk , they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977 . 
 Leave Home , the Ramones ' second album , had come out in January . The Dead Boys ' debut LP , Young , Loud and <unk> , was released at the end of August . October saw two more debut albums from the scene : Richard Hell and the Voidoids ' first full @-@ length , Blank Generation , and the Heartbreakers ' <unk> One track on the latter exemplified both the scene 's close @-@ knit character and the popularity of heroin within it : " Chinese Rocks " — the title refers to a strong form of the drug — was written by Dee Dee Ramone and Hell , both users , as were the Heartbreakers ' Thunders and Nolan . ( During the Heartbreakers ' 1976 and 1977 tours of Britain , Thunders played a central role in popularizing heroin among the punk crowd there , as well . ) The Ramones ' third album , Rocket to Russia , appeared in November 1977 . 
 The Ohio protopunk bands were joined by Cleveland 's the Pagans , Akron 's <unk> and Rubber City Rebels , and Kent 's Human Switchboard . Bloomington , Indiana , had MX @-@ 80 Sound and Detroit had the <unk> . The Suburbs came together in the Twin Cities scene sparked by the Suicide Commandos . The <unk> formed in Arizona . Atlanta had the Fans . In North Carolina , there was Chapel Hill 's H @-@ Bombs and Raleigh 's Th ' <unk> . The Chicago scene began not with a band but with a group of DJs transforming a gay bar , La Mere <unk> , into what became known as America 's first punk dance club . The Crucified , Tutu and the Pirates and Silver Abuse were among the city 's first punk bands . In Boston , the scene at the Rat was joined by the Nervous Eaters , Thrills , and Human Sexual Response . In Washington , D.C. , the Controls played their first gig in spring 1977 , but the city 's second wave really broke the following year with acts such as Urban Verbs , Half Japanese , D <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . By early 1978 , the D.C. jazz @-@ fusion group Mind Power had transformed into Bad Brains , one of the first bands to be identified with hardcore punk .

 The Sex Pistols ' live TV skirmish with Bill Grundy was the signal moment in British punk 's transformation into a major media phenomenon , even as some stores refused to stock the records and radio airplay was hard to come by . Press coverage of punk misbehavior grew intense : On January 4 , 1977 , The Evening News of London ran a front @-@ page story on how the Sex Pistols " vomited and spat their way to an Amsterdam flight " . In February 1977 , the first album by a British punk band appeared : Damned Damned Damned ( by the Damned ) reached number thirty @-@ six on the UK chart . The EP Spiral Scratch , self @-@ released by Manchester 's Buzzcocks , was a benchmark for both the DIY ethic and regionalism in the country 's punk movement . The Clash 's self @-@ titled debut album came out two months later and rose to number twelve ; the single " White Riot " entered the top forty . In May , the Sex Pistols achieved new heights of controversy ( and number two on the singles chart ) with " God Save the Queen " . The band had recently acquired a new bassist , Sid Vicious , who was seen as exemplifying the punk persona . 
 Scores of new punk groups formed around the United Kingdom , as far from London as Belfast 's Stiff Little Fingers and Dunfermline , Scotland 's the Skids . Though most survived only briefly , perhaps recording a small @-@ label single or two , others set off new trends . Crass , from Essex , merged a vehement , straight @-@ ahead punk rock style with a committed anarchist mission , and played a major role in the emerging anarcho @-@ punk movement . Sham 69 , London 's Menace , and the Angelic Upstarts from South Shields in the Northeast combined a similarly stripped @-@ down sound with populist lyrics , a style that became known as street punk . These expressly working @-@ class bands contrasted with others in the second wave that presaged the post @-@ punk phenomenon . Liverpool 's first punk group , Big in Japan , moved in a glam , theatrical direction . The band didn 't survive long , but it spun off several well @-@ known post @-@ punk acts . The songs of London 's Wire were characterized by sophisticated lyrics , minimalist arrangements , and extreme brevity . By the end of 1977 , according to music historian Clinton Heylin , they were " England 's arch @-@ exponents of New Musick , and the true heralds of what came next . " 
 Alongside thirteen original songs that would define classic punk rock , the Clash 's debut had included a cover of the recent Jamaican reggae hit " Police and Thieves " . Other first wave bands such as the Slits and new entrants to the scene like the Ruts and the Police interacted with the reggae and ska subcultures , incorporating their rhythms and production styles . The punk rock phenomenon helped spark a full @-@ fledged ska revival movement known as 2 Tone , centered on bands such as the Specials , the Beat , Madness , and the Selecter . 
 June 1977 saw the release of another charting punk album : the Vibrators ' Pure Mania . In July , the Sex Pistols ' third single , " Pretty Vacant " , reached number six and the Saints had a top @-@ forty hit with " This Perfect Day " . Recently arrived from Australia , the band was now considered insufficiently " cool " to qualify as punk by much of the British media , though they had been playing a similar brand of music for years . In August , the Adverts entered the top twenty with " Gary Gilmore 's Eyes " . As punk became a broad @-@ based national phenomenon in the summer of 1977 , punk musicians and fans were increasingly subject to violent assaults by Teddy boys , football <unk> , and others . A Ted @-@ aligned band recorded " The Punk <unk> Boogie " . 
 In September , Generation X and the Clash reached the top forty with , respectively , " Your Generation " and " Complete Control " . X @-@ Ray Spex ' " Oh Bondage Up Yours ! " didn 't chart , but it became a requisite item for punk fans . In October , the Sex Pistols hit number eight with " Holidays in the Sun " , followed by the release of their first and only " official " album , Never Mind the Bollocks , Here 's the Sex Pistols . Inspiring yet another round of controversy , it topped the British charts . In December , one of the first books about punk rock was published : The Boy Looked at Johnny , by Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons .

 In February 1977 , EMI released the Saints debut album , ( I 'm ) Stranded , which the band recorded in two days . The Saints had relocated to Sydney ; in April , they and Radio Birdman united for a major gig at Paddington Town Hall . Last Words had also formed in the city . The following month , the Saints relocated again , to Great Britain . In June , Radio Birdman released the album <unk> Appear on its own Trafalgar label . 
 The Victims became a short @-@ lived leader of the Perth scene , self @-@ releasing " Television Addict " . They were joined by the Scientists , Kim Salmon 's successor band to the Cheap Nasties . Among the other bands constituting Australia 's second wave were Johnny Dole & the Scabs , the Hellcats , and <unk> ( later known as the Lipstick Killers ) in Sydney ; The Leftovers , the Survivors , and <unk> in Brisbane ; and La Femme , the Negatives , and the <unk> ( later known as the News ) in Melbourne . Melbourne 's art rock – influenced Boys Next Door featured singer Nick Cave , who would become one of the world 's best @-@ known post @-@ punk artists .

 Meanwhile , punk rock scenes were emerging around the globe . In France , les punks , a Parisian subculture of Lou Reed fans , had already been around for years . Following the lead of Stinky Toys , Métal Urbain played its first concert in December 1976 . In August 1977 , Asphalt Jungle played at the second Mont de Marsan punk festival . Stinky Toys ' debut single , " <unk> Creed " , came out in September . It was perhaps the first non @-@ English @-@ language punk rock record , though as music historian George Gimarc notes , the punk enunciation made that distinction somewhat moot . The following month , Métal Urbain 's first 45 , " Panik " , appeared . After the release of their minimalist punk debut , " <unk> à dire " , Marie et les Garçons became involved in New York 's mutant disco scene . Asphalt Jungle 's " <unk> " and Gasoline 's " Killer Man " also came out before the end of the year , and other French punk acts such as <unk> and <unk> soon formed . 
 1977 also saw the debut album from Hamburg 's Big Balls and the Great White Idiot , arguably West Germany 's first punk band . Other early German punk acts included the Fred Banana Combo and Pack . Bands primarily inspired by British punk sparked what became known as the Neue Deutsche Welle ( NDW ) movement . Vanguard NDW acts such as the Nina Hagen Band and <unk> featured strident vocals and an emphasis on provocation . Before turning in a mainstream direction in the 1980s , NDW attracted a politically conscious and diverse audience , including both participants of the left @-@ wing alternative scene and neo @-@ Nazi skinheads . These opposing factions were mutually attracted by a view of punk rock as " politically as well as musically ... ' against the system ' . " 
 Scandinavian punk was propelled early on by tour dates by bands such as the Clash and the Ramones ( both in Stockholm in May 1977 ) , and the Sex Pistols ' tour through Denmark , Sweden and Norway in July the same year . The band <unk> jump @-@ started Finnish punk with its November 1977 single " I Really Hate Ya " / " I Want Ya Back " ; other early Finnish punk acts included <unk> <unk> and singer Pelle <unk> . The first Swedish punk single was " <unk> <unk> " / " <unk> <unk> " released by <unk> <unk> in February 1978 , which started an extensive Swedish punk scene featuring act such as Ebba Grön , <unk> , Rude Kids , <unk> , <unk> Lever , <unk> , <unk> , and many others . Within a couple of years , hundreds of punk singles were released in Sweden . 
 In Japan , a punk movement developed around bands playing in an art / noise style such as Friction , and " psych punk " acts like <unk> and <unk> Michio . In New Zealand , Auckland 's <unk> and Suburban Reptiles were followed by the Enemy of Dunedin . I. Punk rock scenes also grew in other countries such as Belgium ( the Kids , Chainsaw ) , the Netherlands ( the <unk> , the Ex ) , Spain ( La Banda <unk> Del Río , Kaka De <unk> ) , and Switzerland ( Nasal Boys , Kleenex ) . 
 Indonesia was a part of the largest punk movement in Southeast Asia , heavily influenced by Green Day , Rancid , and the Offspring . Young people created their own underground sub @-@ culture of punk , which over time developed into a style that was completely different to the original movement . 
 Punk emerged in South Africa as direct opposition to the conservative apartheid government and racial segregation enforcement of the time . Bands like Wild Youth and National Wake led the way in the late 1970s and early 1980s , followed by Powerage and Screaming Foetus from Durban and <unk> Sox in Johannesburg in the mid 1980s . 
 = = Schism and diversification = = 
 By 1979 , the hardcore punk movement was emerging in Southern California . A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd . Hardcore , appealing to a younger , more suburban audience , was perceived by some as anti @-@ intellectual , overly violent , and musically limited . In Los Angeles , the opposing factions were often described as " Hollywood punks " and " beach punks " , referring to Hollywood 's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore 's popularity in the shoreline communities of South Bay and Orange County . 
 As hardcore became the dominant punk rock style , many bands of the older California punk rock movement split up , although X went on to mainstream success and the Go @-@ Go 's , part of the Hollywood punk scene when they formed in 1978 , adopted a pop sound and became major stars . Across North America , many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved , while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk . Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts . A few , most notably the Ramones , Richard Hell and the Voidoids , and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers , continued to pursue the style they had helped create . Crossing the lines between " classic " punk , post @-@ punk , and hardcore , San Francisco 's Flipper was founded in 1979 by former members of Negative Trend and the Sleepers . They became " the reigning kings of American underground rock , for a few years " . 
 Radio Birdman broke up in June 1978 while touring the UK , where the early unity between bohemian , middle @-@ class punks ( many with art school backgrounds ) and working @-@ class punks had disintegrated . In contrast to North America , more of the bands from the original British punk movement remained active , sustaining extended careers even as their styles evolved and diverged . Meanwhile , the Oi ! and anarcho @-@ punk movements were emerging . Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore , they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti @-@ establishment messages . As described by Dave Laing , " The model for self @-@ proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight @-@ to @-@ the @-@ bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash . ... It became essential to sound one particular way to be recognized as a ' punk band ' now . " In February 1979 , former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious died of a heroin overdose in New York . If the Sex Pistols ' breakup the previous year had marked the end of the original UK punk scene and its promise of cultural transformation , for many the death of Vicious signified that it had been doomed from the start . 
 By the turn of the decade , the punk rock movement had split deeply along cultural and musical lines , leaving a variety of derivative scenes and forms . On one side were new wave and post @-@ punk artists ; some adopted more accessible musical styles and gained broad popularity , while some turned in more experimental , less commercial directions . On the other side , hardcore punk , Oi ! , and anarcho @-@ punk bands became closely linked with underground cultures and spun off an array of subgenres . Somewhere in between , pop punk groups created blends like that of the ideal record , as defined by Mekons cofounder Kevin Lycett : " a cross between Abba and the Sex Pistols " . A range of other styles emerged , many of them fusions with long @-@ established genres . The Clash album London Calling , released in December 1979 , exemplified the breadth of classic punk 's legacy . Combining punk rock with reggae , ska , R & B , and rockabilly , it went on to be acclaimed as one of the best rock records ever . At the same time , as observed by Flipper singer Bruce Loose , the relatively restrictive hardcore scenes diminished the variety of music that could once be heard at many punk gigs . If early punk , like most rock scenes , was ultimately male @-@ oriented , the hardcore and Oi ! scenes were significantly more so , marked in part by the slam dancing and moshing with which they became identified . 
 = = = New wave = = = 
 In 1976 — first in London , then in the United States — " New Wave " was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as " punk " ; the two terms were essentially interchangeable . NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term 's use ( adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s ) in this context . Over time , " new wave " acquired a distinct meaning : Bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene ; the Cars , who emerged from the Rat in Boston ; the Go @-@ Go 's in Los Angeles ; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette , incorporating dance @-@ oriented rhythms , and working with more polished production were specifically designated " new wave " and no longer called " punk " . Dave Laing suggests that some punk @-@ identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers . 
 Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop @-@ oriented , less " dangerous " styles , new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic . New wave became a catch @-@ all term , encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska , the mod revival inspired by the Jam , the sophisticated pop @-@ rock of Elvis Costello and XTC , the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox , synthpop groups like Tubeway Army ( which had started out as a straight @-@ ahead punk band ) and Human League , and the sui generis subversions of Devo , who had gone " beyond punk before punk even properly existed " . New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981 , which put many new wave videos into regular rotation . However , the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable . 
 = = = Post @-@ punk = = = 
 During 1976 – 77 , in the midst of the original UK punk movement , bands emerged such as Manchester 's Joy Division , the Fall , and Magazine , Leeds ' Gang of Four , and London 's the <unk> that became central post @-@ punk figures . Some bands classified as post @-@ punk , such as Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire , had been active well before the punk scene coalesced ; others , such as the Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees , transitioned from punk rock into post @-@ punk . A few months after the Sex Pistols ' breakup , John Lydon ( no longer " Rotten " ) cofounded Public Image Ltd . Lora Logic , formerly of X @-@ Ray Spex , founded Essential Logic . Killing Joke formed in 1979 . These bands were often musically experimental , like certain new wave acts ; defining them as " post @-@ punk " was a sound that tended to be less pop and more dark and abrasive — sometimes verging on the atonal , as with Subway Sect and Wire — and an anti @-@ establishment posture directly related to punk 's . Post @-@ punk reflected a range of art rock influences from Captain Beefheart to David Bowie and Roxy Music to Krautrock and , once again , the Velvet Underground . 
 Post @-@ punk brought together a new fraternity of musicians , journalists , managers , and entrepreneurs ; the latter , notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory , helped to develop the production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid @-@ 1980s . <unk> the edges of their style in the direction of new wave , several post @-@ punk bands such as New Order ( descended from Joy Division ) and the <unk> crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience . Bauhaus was one of the formative gothic rock bands . Others , like Gang of Four , the <unk> and Throbbing Gristle , who had little more than cult followings at the time , are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture . 
 A number of U.S. artists were retrospectively defined as post @-@ punk ; Television 's debut album Marquee Moon , released in 1977 , is frequently cited as a seminal album in the field . The no wave movement that developed in New York in the late 1970s , with artists such as Lydia Lunch and James Chance , is often treated as the phenomenon 's U.S. parallel . The later work of Ohio protopunk pioneers Pere Ubu is also commonly described as post @-@ punk . One of the most influential American post @-@ punk bands was Boston 's Mission of Burma , who brought abrupt rhythmic shifts derived from hardcore into a highly experimental musical context . In 1980 , Australia 's Boys Next Door moved to London and changed their name to the Birthday Party , which evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds . Led by the Primitive Calculators , Melbourne 's Little Band scene would further explore the possibilities of post @-@ punk . Later alternative rock musicians found diverse inspiration among these post @-@ punk predecessors , as they did among their new wave contemporaries . 
 = = = Hardcore = = = 
 A distinctive style of punk , characterized by superfast , aggressive beats , screaming vocals , and often politically aware lyrics , began to emerge in 1978 among bands scattered around the United States and Canada . The first major scene of what came to be known as hardcore punk developed in Southern California in 1978 – 79 , initially around such punk bands as the Germs and Fear . The movement soon spread around North America and internationally . According to author Steven Blush , " Hardcore comes from the bleak suburbs of America . Parents moved their kids out of the cities to these horrible suburbs to save them from the ' reality ' of the cities and what they ended up with was this new breed of monster " . 
 Among the earliest hardcore bands , regarded as having made the first recordings in the style , were Southern California 's Middle Class and Black Flag . Bad Brains — all of whom were black , a rarity in punk of any era — launched the D.C. scene . Austin , Texas 's Big Boys , San Francisco 's Dead Kennedys , and Vancouver 's D.O.A. were among the other initial hardcore groups . They were soon joined by bands such as the Minutemen , Descendents , Circle Jerks , Adolescents , and T.S.O.L. in Southern California ; D.C. ' s Teen Idles , Minor Threat , and State of Alert ; and Austin 's MDC and the Dicks . By 1981 , hardcore was the dominant punk rock style not only in California , but much of the rest of North America as well . A New York hardcore scene grew , including the relocated Bad Brains , New Jersey 's Misfits and <unk> O.D. , and local acts such as the <unk> , the Mob , Reagan Youth , and Agnostic Front . Beastie Boys , who would become famous as a hip @-@ hop group , debuted that year as a hardcore band . They were followed by the Cro @-@ Mags , Murphy 's Law , and Leeway . By 1983 , St. Paul 's Hüsker Dü , <unk> Neglect , Chicago 's Naked <unk> , Indianapolis 's Zero Boys , and D.C. ' s the Faith were taking the hardcore sound in experimental and ultimately more melodic directions . Hardcore would constitute the American punk rock standard throughout the decade . The lyrical content of hardcore songs is often critical of commercial culture and middle @-@ class values , as in Dead Kennedys ' celebrated " Holiday in Cambodia " ( 1980 ) . 
 Straight edge bands like Minor Threat , Boston 's SS <unk> , and Reno , Nevada 's 7 Seconds rejected the self @-@ destructive lifestyles of many of their peers , and built a movement based on positivity and abstinence from cigarettes , alcohol , drugs , and casual sex . 
 Skate punk innovators also pointed in other directions : Big Boys helped establish <unk> , while Venice , California 's Suicidal Tendencies had a formative effect on the heavy metal – influenced crossover thrash style . Toward the middle of the decade , D.R.I. spawned the superfast thrashcore genre . Both developed in multiple locations . Sacramento 's Tales of Terror , which mixed psychedelic rock into their hardcore sound , were an early influence on the grunge genre . D.C. ' s Void was one of the first punk @-@ metal crossover acts and influenced thrash metal . 
 = = = Oi ! = = = 
 Following the lead of first @-@ wave British punk bands Cock Sparrer and Sham 69 , in the late 1970s second @-@ wave units like Cockney Rejects , Angelic Upstarts , the Exploited , Anti @-@ Establishment and the 4 @-@ Skins sought to realign punk rock with a working class , street @-@ level following . For that purpose , they believed , the music needed to stay " accessible and unpretentious " , in the words of music historian Simon Reynolds . Their style was originally called " real punk " or street punk ; Sounds journalist Garry Bushell is credited with labelling the genre Oi ! in 1980 . The name is partly derived from the Cockney Rejects ' habit of shouting " Oi ! Oi ! Oi ! " before each song , instead of the time @-@ honored " 1 @,@ 2 @,@ 3 @,@ 4 ! " 
 The Oi ! movement was fueled by a sense that many participants in the early punk rock scene were , in the words of the Business guitarist Steve Kent , " trendy university people using long words , trying to be artistic ... and losing touch " . According to Bushell , " Punk was meant to be of the voice of the dole queue , and in reality most of them were not . But Oi was the reality of the punk mythology . In the places where [ these bands ] came from , it was harder and more aggressive and it produced just as much quality music . " Lester Bangs described Oi ! as " politicized football chants for unemployed louts " . One song in particular , the Exploited 's " Punks Not Dead " , spoke to an international constituency . It was adopted as an anthem by the groups of disaffected Mexican urban youth known in the 1980s as <unk> ; one banda named itself <unk> , after the song 's initials . 
 Although most Oi ! bands in the initial wave were apolitical or left wing , many of them began to attract a white power skinhead following . Racist skinheads sometimes disrupted Oi ! concerts by shouting fascist slogans and starting fights , but some Oi ! bands were reluctant to endorse criticism of their fans from what they perceived as the " middle @-@ class establishment " . In the popular imagination , the movement thus became linked to the far right . Strength Thru Oi ! , an album compiled by Bushell and released in May 1981 , stirred controversy , especially when it was revealed that the belligerent figure on the cover was a neo @-@ Nazi jailed for racist violence ( Bushell claimed ignorance ) . On July 3 , a concert at <unk> Tavern in Southall featuring the Business , the 4 @-@ Skins , and the Last Resort was firebombed by local Asian youths who believed that the event was a neo @-@ Nazi gathering . Following the Southall riot , press coverage increasingly associated Oi ! with the extreme right , and the movement soon began to lose momentum . 
 = = = Anarcho @-@ punk = = = 
 Anarcho @-@ punk developed alongside the Oi ! and American hardcore movements . Inspired by Crass , its Dial House commune , and its independent Crass Records label , a scene developed around British bands such as <unk> , Flux of Pink Indians , Conflict , Poison Girls , and the Apostles that was concerned as much with anarchist and DIY principles as it was with music . The acts featured ranting vocals , discordant instrumental sounds , primitive production values , and lyrics filled with political and social content , often addressing issues such as class inequalities and military violence . Anarcho @-@ punk musicians and fans disdained the older punk scene from which theirs had evolved . In historian Tim Gosling 's description , they saw " safety pins and Mohicans as little more than ineffectual fashion posturing stimulated by the mainstream media and industry .... Whereas the Sex Pistols would proudly display bad manners and opportunism in their dealings with ' the establishment , ' the anarcho @-@ punks kept clear of ' the establishment ' altogether " . 
 The movement spun off several subgenres of a similar political bent . Discharge , founded back in 1977 , established D @-@ beat in the early 1980s . Other groups in the movement , led by Amebix and <unk> , developed the extreme style known as crust punk . Several of these bands rooted in anarcho @-@ punk such as the <unk> , Discharge , and Amebix , along with former Oi ! groups such as the Exploited and bands from father afield like Birmingham 's Charged GBH , became the leading figures in the UK 82 hardcore movement . The anarcho @-@ punk scene also spawned bands such as Napalm Death , Carcass , and Extreme Noise Terror that in the mid @-@ 1980s defined grindcore , incorporating extremely fast tempos and death metal – style <unk> . Led by Dead Kennedys , a U.S. anarcho @-@ punk scene developed around such bands as Austin 's MDC and Southern California 's Another Destructive System . 
 = = = Pop punk = = = 
 With their love of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop , the Ramones paved the way to what became known as pop punk . In the late 1970s , UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones combined pop @-@ style tunes and lyrical themes with punk 's speed and chaotic edge . In the early 1980s , some of the leading bands in Southern California 's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers . According to music journalist Ben Myers , Bad Religion " layered their pissed off , politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies " ; Descendents " wrote almost surfy , Beach Boys – inspired songs about girls and food and being young ( ish ) " . Epitaph Records , founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion , was the base for many future pop punk bands . Bands that fused punk with light @-@ hearted pop melodies , such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel , began appearing around the country , in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring , who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales . Bands such as the Vandals and <unk> developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics . Eventually , the geographically large midwest U.S. punk scene , anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis , would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would talk a catchy , hooky pop @-@ punk approach and <unk> it with some of punk 's earlier grit and fury , creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag . This particular substrate still maintains an identity today . The mainstream pop punk of latter @-@ day bands such as Blink @-@ 182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees ; in critic Christine Di Bella 's words , " It 's punk taken to its most accessible point , a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all , except in the three @-@ chord song structures . " 
 = = = Other fusions and directions = = = 
 From 1977 on , punk rock crossed lines with many other popular music genres . Los Angeles punk rock bands laid the groundwork for a wide variety of styles : the Flesh Eaters with <unk> ; the <unk> with Chicano punk ; and Gun Club with punk blues . The Meteors , from South London , and the Cramps , who moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1980 , were innovators in the psychobilly fusion style . Milwaukee 's Violent Femmes <unk> the American folk punk scene , while the Pogues did the same on the other side of the Atlantic , influencing many Celtic punk bands . Hardcore punk was combined with hip hop , creating <unk> . 
 Other bands pointed punk rock toward future rock styles or its own foundations . New York 's Suicide , L.A. ' s the Screamers and Nervous Gender , Australia 's <unk> , and Germany 's Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft were pioneers of electropunk . The Ex , from the Netherlands , were in the art punk vanguard . Chicago 's Big Black was a major influence on noise rock , math rock , and industrial rock . Garage punk bands from all over — such as Medway 's Thee Mighty Caesars , Chicago 's Dwarves , and Adelaide 's Exploding White Mice — pursued a version of punk rock that was close to its roots in 1960s garage rock . Seattle 's Mudhoney , one of the central bands in the development of grunge , has been described as " garage punk " .

 The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music . The original punk explosion also had a long @-@ term effect on the music industry , spurring the growth of the independent sector . During the early 1980s , British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post @-@ punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche . Though commercially successful over an extended period , they maintained an underground @-@ style , subcultural identity . In the United States , bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic , explorative realm of what was then called " college rock " . 
 A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared , " Primal punk is passé . The best of the American punk rockers have moved on . They have learned how to play their instruments . They have discovered melody , guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans . Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead . " By the end of the 1980s , these bands , who had largely eclipsed their punk rock forebears in popularity , were classified broadly as alternative rock . Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles — including gothic rock and grunge , among others — unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream . 
 As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth , which had grown out of the no wave scene , and Boston 's Pixies started to gain larger audiences , major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years . In 1991 , Nirvana emerged from Washington State 's grunge scene , achieving huge commercial success with its second album , Nevermind . The band 's members cited punk rock as a key influence on their style . " Punk is musical freedom " , wrote singer Kurt Cobain . " It ’ s saying , doing , and playing what you want . " Nirvana 's success opened the door to mainstream popularity for a wide range of other " left @-@ of @-@ the @-@ dial " acts , such as Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers , and fueled the alternative rock boom of the early and mid @-@ 1990s .

 In its original , mid @-@ 1980s incarnation , emo was a less musically restrictive style of punk developed by participants in the Washington , D.C. area hardcore scene .

 In the beginning , the Heavy metal created by Judas Priest was music of slow tempos and little aggression , When punk rock exploded in ' 77 in the music scene mainstream , many bands like Motorhead ( pioneer NWOBHM ) combine the dense sound of heavy metal with dirt and speed of punk rock creating a new movement called New wave of British heavy metal where many bands were influenced by many punk bands like Sex Pistols , the Damned and Ramones , among other bands . From this new style of heavy metal , they grew others even more aggressive styles but always influenced by punk rock , like Speed metal ( much influenced by punk rock and NWOBHM ) , Thrash metal ( influenced by hardcore punk and speed metal ) , Death metal ( which combined the thrash metal and D @-@ beat ) and Black metal ( influenced by death metal and Horror punk ) .

 In the 1990s , the queercore movement developed around a number of punk bands with gay , lesbian , bisexual , or genderqueer members such as Against Me ! , God Is My Co @-@ Pilot , Pansy Division , Team Dresch , and Sister George . Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County , <unk> , and Randy Turner , and bands like Nervous Gender , the Screamers , and Coil , queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles . <unk> lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice , sexual identity , gender identity , and individual rights . The movement has continued into the 21st century , supported by festivals such as <unk> . 
 = = = Riot grrrl = = = 
 The Riot Grrrl movement , a significant aspect in the formation of the Third Wave feminist movement , was organized by taking the values and rhetoric of punk and using it to convey feminist messages . In 1991 , a concert of female @-@ led bands at the International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia , Washington , heralded the emerging riot grrrl phenomenon . Billed as " Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now " , the concert 's lineup included Bikini Kill , <unk> , Heavens to Betsy , L7 , and Mecca Normal . The riot grrrl movement foregrounded feminist concerns and progressive politics in general ; the DIY ethic and fanzines were also central elements of the scene . This movement relied on media and technology to spread their ideas and messages , creating a cultural @-@ technological space for feminism to voice their concerns . They embodied the punk perspective , taking the anger and emotions and creating a separate culture from it . With riot grrrl , they were grounded in girl punk past , but also rooted in modern feminism . Singer @-@ guitarists Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17 , bands active in both the queercore and riot grrrl scenes , cofounded the indie / punk band Sleater @-@ Kinney in 1994 . Bikini Kill 's lead singer , Kathleen Hanna , the iconic figure of riot grrrl , moved on to form the art punk group Le Tigre in 1998 . 
 = = Revival = = 
 By the 1990s , punk rock was sufficiently ingrained in Western culture that punk trappings were often used to market highly commercial bands as " rebels " . Marketers capitalized on the style and hipness of punk rock to such an extent that a 1993 ad campaign for an automobile , the Subaru Impreza , claimed that the car was " like punk rock " . Along with Nirvana , many of the leading alternative rock artists of the early 1990s acknowledged the influence of earlier punk rock acts . With Nirvana 's success , the major record companies once again saw punk bands as potentially profitable . 
 In 1993 , California 's Green Day and Bad Religion were both signed to major labels . The next year , Green Day put out Dookie , which became a huge hit , selling nine million albums in the United States in just over two years . Bad Religion 's Stranger Than Fiction was certified gold . Other California punk bands on the independent label Epitaph , run by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz , also began achieving mainstream popularity . In 1994 , Epitaph released Let 's Go by Rancid , Punk in Drublic by NOFX , and Smash by the Offspring , each eventually certified gold or better . That June , Green Day 's " Longview " reached number one on Billboard 's Modern Rock Tracks chart and became a top forty airplay hit , arguably the first ever American punk song to do so ; just one month later , the Offspring 's " Come Out and Play " followed suit . MTV and radio stations such as Los Angeles ' KROQ @-@ FM played a major role in these bands ' crossover success , though NOFX refused to let MTV air its videos . 
 Following the lead of Boston 's Mighty Mighty Bosstones and two California bands , Anaheim 's No Doubt and Long Beach 's Sublime , ska punk and ska @-@ core became widely popular in the mid @-@ 1990s . By 1996 , genre acts such as Reel Big Fish and Less Than Jake were being signed to major labels . The original 2 Tone bands had emerged amid punk rock 's second wave , but their music was much closer to its Jamaican roots — " ska at 78 rpm " . Ska punk bands in the third wave of ska created a true musical fusion between the genres . ... And Out Come the Wolves , the 1995 album by Rancid — which had evolved out of Operation Ivy — became the first record in this ska revival to be certified gold ; Sublime 's self @-@ titled 1996 album was certified platinum early in 1997 . In Australia , two popular groups , <unk> band <unk> <unk> and pop punk act <unk> , also established followings in Japan . 
 Green Day and Dookie 's enormous sales paved the way for a host of bankable North American pop punk bands in the following decade . With punk rock 's renewed visibility came concerns among some in the punk community that the music was being co @-@ opted by the mainstream . They argued that by signing to major labels and appearing on MTV , punk bands like Green Day were buying into a system that punk was created to challenge . Such controversies have been part of the punk culture since 1977 , when the Clash was widely accused of " selling out " for signing with CBS Records . The Vans Warped Tour and the mall chain store Hot Topic brought punk even further into the U.S. mainstream .

 By early 1998 , the punk revival had commercially stalled , but not for long . That November , the Offspring 's Americana on the major Columbia label debuted at number two on the album chart . A bootleg MP3 of its first single , " Pretty Fly ( for a White Guy ) " , made it onto the Internet and was downloaded a record 22 million times — illegally . The following year , Enema of the State , the first major @-@ label release by pop punk band Blink @-@ 182 , reached the top ten and sold four million copies in under twelve months . In January 2000 , the album 's second single , " All the Small Things " , hit the sixth spot on the Billboard Hot 100 . While they were viewed as Green Day " acolytes " , critics also found teen pop acts such as Britney Spears , the Backstreet Boys , and ' N Sync suitable points of comparison for Blink @-@ 182 's sound and market niche . The band 's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket ( 2001 ) and Blink @-@ 182 ( 2003 ) respectively rose to numbers one and three on the album chart . In November 2003 , The New Yorker described how the " giddily puerile " act had " become massively popular with the mainstream audience , a demographic formerly considered untouchable by punk @-@ rock purists .

 Other new North American pop punk bands , though often critically dismissed , also achieved major sales in the first decade of the 2000s . Ontario 's Sum 41 reached the Canadian top ten with its 2001 debut album , All Killer , No Filler , which eventually went platinum in the United States . The record included the number one U.S. Alternative hit " Fat Lip " , which incorporated verses of what one critic called " brat rap . " 
 The effect of commercialization on the music became an increasingly contentious issue .

 The cutthroat trout ( Oncorhynchus clarkii ) is a fish species of the family Salmonidae native to cold @-@ water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean , Rocky Mountains , and Great Basin in North America . As a member of the genus Oncorhynchus , it is one of the Pacific trout , a group that includes the widely distributed rainbow trout . Cutthroat trout are popular gamefish , especially among anglers who enjoy fly fishing . The common name " cutthroat " refers to the distinctive red coloration on the underside of the lower jaw . The specific name clarkii was given to honor explorer William Clark , <unk> of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . 
 Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large , clear , well @-@ oxygenated , shallow rivers with gravel bottoms . They also reproduce in clear , cold , moderately deep lakes . They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the rivers of the Pacific basin , Great Basin and Rocky Mountains . Cutthroat trout spawn in the spring and may inadvertently but naturally hybridize with rainbow trout , producing fertile cutbows . Some populations of the coastal cutthroat trout ( O. c. clarkii ) are semi @-@ anadromous . 
 Several subspecies of cutthroat trout are currently listed as threatened in their native ranges due to habitat loss and the introduction of non @-@ native species . Two subspecies , O. c. <unk> and O. c. macdonaldi , are considered extinct . Cutthroat trout are raised in hatcheries to restore populations in their native range , as well as stock non @-@ native lake environments to support angling . The cutthroat trout type species and several subspecies are the official state fish of seven western U.S. states .

 The scientific name of the cutthroat trout is Oncorhynchus clarkii . Cutthroat trout were the first New World trout encountered by Europeans when in 1541 , Spanish explorer Francisco de Coronado recorded seeing trout in the Pecos River near Santa Fe , New Mexico . These were most likely Rio Grande cutthroat trout ( O. c. <unk> ) The species was first described in the journals of explorer William Clark from specimens obtained during the Lewis and Clark Expedition from the Missouri River near Great Falls , Montana , and these were most likely the westslope cutthroat trout ( O. c. lewisi ) . As one of Lewis and Clark 's many missions was to describe the flora and fauna encountered during their expedition , cutthroat trout were given the name Salmo clarkii in honor of William Clark . In 1836 , the type specimen of S. clarkii was described by naturalist John Richardson from a tributary of the lower Columbia River , identified as the " <unk> " , which was perhaps the Lewis River as there was a Multnomah village of similar name at the confluence . This type specimen was most likely the coastal cutthroat trout subspecies O. c. clarkii . Until the 1960s , populations of westslope cutthroat trout and Yellowstone cutthroat trout were lumped into one subspecies ; Salmo clarkii lewisii . Biologists later split the group into two subspecies , christening the name westslope cutthroat trout with the lewisii name which honors explorer Meriwether Lewis and renaming the Yellowstone cutthroat trout Salmo bouvierii , the first name given to the Yellowstone cutthroat trout by David Starr Jordan in 1883 honoring a U.S. Army Captain Bouvier . 
 In 1989 , morphological and genetic studies indicated trout of the Pacific basin were genetically closer to Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus species ) than to the <unk> – brown trout ( S. trutta ) or Atlantic salmon ( S. salar ) of the Atlantic basin . Thus , in 1989 , taxonomic authorities moved the rainbow , cutthroat and other Pacific basin trout into the genus Oncorhynchus . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Behnke in his salmon and trout handbook of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native to a separate geographic area . Not all of them were scientifically described , and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases . It has been suggested that the cutthroat trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3 @-@ 5 million years ago , in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs . These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations , eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today . The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups — Coastal , Westslope , Yellowstone and Lahontan . 
 = = Description = = 
 Throughout their native and introduced ranges , cutthroat trout vary widely in size , coloration and habitat selection . Their coloration can range from golden to gray to green on the back . Cutthroat trout can generally be distinguished from rainbow trout by the presence of basibranchial teeth at the base of tongue and a maxillary that extends beyond the posterior edge of the eye . Depending on subspecies , strain and habitat , most have distinctive red , pink , or orange linear marks along the underside of their mandibles in the lower folds of the gill plates . These markings are responsible for the common name " cutthroat " , first given to the trout by outdoor writer Charles Hallock in an 1884 article in The American Angler . These markings are not unique to the species , some coastal rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus ) and Columbia River redband trout ( O. m. gairdneri ) populations also display reddish or pink throat markings . 
 At maturity , different populations and subspecies of cutthroat trout can range from 6 to 40 inches ( 15 to 102 cm ) in length , depending on habitat and food availability . Sea @-@ run forms of coastal cutthroat trout average 2 to 5 pounds ( 0 @.@ 9 to 2 @.@ 3 kg ) . The length and weights of mature inland forms vary widely depending on their particular environment and availability of food . Stream @-@ resident fish are much smaller , 0 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 2 ounces ( 11 to 91 g ) , while lacustrine populations have attained weights ranging from 12 to 17 lb ( 5 @.@ 4 to 7 @.@ 7 kg ) in ideal conditions . The largest cutthroat trout subspecies is the Lahontan cutthroat trout ( O. c. henshawi ) . These fish average 8 to 9 in ( 20 to 23 cm ) in small streams and 8 to 22 in ( 20 to 56 cm ) in larger rivers and lakes . In ideal environments , the Lahontan cutthroat trout attains typical weights of 0 @.@ 25 to 8 lb ( 0 @.@ 11 to 3 @.@ 63 kg ) . The world record cutthroat trout is a Lahontan at 39 in ( 99 cm ) and 41 lb ( 19 kg ) .

 Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large , clear , well @-@ oxygenated , shallow rivers with gravel bottoms . They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams typical of tributaries of the Pacific Basin , Great Basin and Rocky Mountains . They spawn in the spring , as early as February in coastal rivers and as late as July in high mountain lakes and streams . Spawning begins when water temperatures reach 43 to 46 ° F ( 6 to 8 ° C ) . Cutthroat trout construct a redd in the stream gravel to lay eggs . The female selects the site for and excavates the redd . Females , depending on size , lay between 200 and 4 @,@ 400 eggs . Eggs are fertilized with milt ( sperm ) by an attending male . Eggs hatch into <unk> or sac fry in about a month and spend two weeks in the gravel while they absorb their yolk sack before emerging . After emergence , fry begin feeding on zooplankton . Juvenile cutthroat trout typically mature in three to five years . Lake @-@ resident cutthroat trout are usually found in moderately deep , cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation for good food production . Lake populations generally require access to gravel @-@ bottomed streams to be self @-@ sustaining , but occasionally spawn on shallow gravel beds with good water circulation . 
 Cutthroat trout naturally interbreed with the closely related rainbow trout , producing fertile hybrids commonly called " cutbows " . This hybrid generally bears similar coloration and overall appearance to the cutthroat trout , usually retaining the characteristic orange @-@ red slash . <unk> hybrids often pose a taxonomic difficulty when trying to distinguish any given specimen as a rainbow or cutthroat trout . In addition , cutthroat trout may hybridize with O. <unk> the Gila trout and O. apache the Apache trout in regions where their ranges overlap .

 Cutthroat trout are native to western North America and have evolved through geographic isolation into 14 subspecies , each native to a different major drainage basin . Native cutthroat trout species are found along the Pacific Northwest coast from Alaska through British Columbia into northern California , in the Cascade Range , the Great Basin and throughout the Rocky Mountains including southern Alberta . Some coastal populations of the coastal cutthroat trout ( O. c. clarkii ) are <unk> , spending a few months in marine environments to feed as adults and returning to fresh water from fall through early spring to feed on insects and spawn . Cutthroat trout have the second @-@ largest historic native range of North American trout ; the lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) having the largest . Ranges of some subspecies , particularly the westslope cutthroat trout ( O. c. lewisi ) have been reduced to less than 10 percent of their historic range due to habitat loss and introduction of non @-@ native species . 
 Although members of Oncorhynchus , the Pacific trout / salmon species , three subspecies — the westslope ( O. c. lewisi ) , the greenback ( O. c. stomias ) and Yellowstone cutthroat trout ( O. c. bouvierii ) — evolved populations east of the Continental Divide in the upper Missouri River basin , upper Arkansas and Platte River basins and upper Yellowstone River basin , each which drain into the Atlantic basin via the Mississippi River ( in 2005 , researchers published a report stating that a natural distribution of ( O. mykiss ) , the Conchos trout , is also located in an Atlantic basin drainage ) . Scientists believe that the climatic and geologic conditions 3 to 5 million years ago allowed cutthroat trout from the Snake River to migrate over the divide into the Yellowstone plateau via Two Ocean Pass . There is also evidence that Yellowstone Lake once drained south into the Snake River drainage . Evidence suggests that the westslope cutthroat trout was able to establish populations east of the divide via Summit Lake at Marias Pass which at one time connected the Flathead River drainage with the upper Missouri River drainage . Scientists speculate that there are several mountain passes associated with the headwaters of the Colorado River drainage and Arkansas / Platte River drainages that would have allowed migration of cutthroat trout east of the divide . 
 Cutthroat trout have been introduced into non @-@ native waters outside their historic native range , but not to the extent of the rainbow trout ( O. mykiss ) . Within the native range of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout , U.S. Fisheries Bureau and National Park Service authorities introduced Yellowstone cutthroat trout into many <unk> lakes in Yellowstone National Park . Cutthroat trout were introduced into Lake Michigan tributaries in the 1890s and sporadically in the early 20th century , but never established wild populations . A population of Yellowstone cutthroat trout purportedly has been established in Lake Huron . Although cutthroat trout are not native to Arizona , they are routinely introduced by the Arizona Game and Fish Department into high mountain lakes in the White Mountains in the northeastern region of that state .

 Cutthroat trout require cold , clear , well @-@ oxygenated , shallow rivers with gravel bottoms or cold , moderately deep lakes . Healthy stream @-@ side vegetation that reduces siltation is typical of healthy cutthroat trout habitat and beaver ponds may provide refuge during periods of drought and over winter . Most populations stay in fresh water throughout their lives and are known as <unk> , stream @-@ resident or riverine populations . The coastal cutthroat trout ( O. c. clarkii ) is the only cutthroat trout subspecies to <unk> through its entire range with the coastal rainbow trout ( O. m. irideus ) . Portions of the westslope cutthroat trout 's ( O. c. lewisi ) range overlap with the Columbia River redband trout ( O. m. gairdneri ) , but the majority of its native range is in headwater tributary streams above major waterfalls and other barriers to upstream migration . At least three subspecies are confined to isolated basins in the Great Basin and can tolerate saline or alkaline water . 
 Cutthroat trout are opportunistic feeders . Stream @-@ resident cutthroat trout primarily feed on larval , pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects ( typically caddisflies , stoneflies , mayflies and aquatic dipterans ) , and adult forms of terrestrial insects ( typically ants , beetles , grasshoppers and crickets ) that fall into the water , fish eggs , small fish , along with crayfish , shrimp and other crustaceans . As they grow the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations . In saltwater estuaries and along beaches , Coastal cutthroat trout feed on small fish such as sculpins , sand lance , salmon fry and herring . They also consume shrimp , small squid and krill . In fresh water they consume the same diet as stream resident trout — aquatic insects and crustaceans , amphibians , earthworms , small fish and fish eggs . Within the range of the bull trout ( Salvelinus <unk> ) the cutthroat trout is a forage fish for the piscivorous bull trout . 
 = = = Artificial propagation = = = 
 Various subspecies of cutthroat trout are raised in commercial , state and federal hatcheries for introduction into suitable native and non @-@ native riverine and lacustrine environments . In the early 20th century , several hatcheries were established in Yellowstone National Park by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries . These hatcheries not only produced stocks of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout ( O. c. bouvierii ) for the park , but also took advantage of the great spawning stock of cutthroat trout to supply eggs to hatcheries around the U.S. Between the years 1901 and 1953 a total of 818 million trout eggs were exported from the park to hatcheries throughout the U.S. The Lahontan National Fish Hatchery operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service exists to restore populations of the Lahontan cutthroat trout ( O. c. henshawi ) in Pyramid , Walker , Fallen Leaf , June , Marlette , and Gull Lakes and the Truckee River in California and Nevada . The hatchery produces about 300 @,@ 000 – 400 @,@ 000 Lahontan cutthroat trout fry annually . The Jackson National Fish Hatchery produces around 400 @,@ 000 Snake River fine @-@ spotted cutthroat trout ( O. c. <unk> ) annually to support fisheries in Idaho and Wyoming . The Leadville National Fish Hatchery produces 125 @,@ 000 – 200 @,@ 000 Snake River fine @-@ spotted , greenback cutthroat and rainbow trout annually to support fishing in the Fryingpan and Arkansas River drainages and other Colorado waters . The Bozeman Fish Technology Center , formerly a cutthroat trout fish hatchery in Bozeman , Montana , plays a major role in the restoration of the greenback ( O. c. stomias ) and westslope cutthroat trout ( O. c. lewisi ) subspecies . 
 = = Population threats = = 
 The historic native range of cutthroat trout has been reduced by overfishing , urbanization and habitat loss due to mining , livestock grazing and logging . Population densities have been reduced and in some cases populations have disappeared though competition with non @-@ native brook , brown , lake and rainbow trout , kokanee salmon , lake whitefish and mysis shrimp which were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Scientists believe the westslope cutthroat trout will eventually be extirpated from the large lakes in Western Montana due to the trophic cascades resulting from lake trout and mysis shrimp introductions . The most serious current threats to several subspecies are interspecific breeding with introduced rainbow trout creating hybrid cutbows and intraspecific breeding with other introduced cutthroat trout subspecies . In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , the presence of lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) in Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park has caused a serious decline in ( O. c. bouvierii ) . Outbreaks of whirling disease in major spawning tributaries within the native ranges have also caused declines . Most subspecies of cutthroat trout are highly susceptible to whirling disease , although the Snake River fine @-@ spotted cutthroat trout ( O. c. <unk> ) appears to be resistant to the parasite . 
 = = = Interspecific and intraspecific breeding = = = 
 The most serious impact on the genetic purity of most cutthroat trout subspecies results from interspecific and intraspecific breeding resulting in hybrids that carry the genes of both parents . In inland populations , the introduction of rainbow trout from hatchery stocks have resulted in <unk> hybrids that continue to diminish the genetic purity of many cutthroat trout subspecies . The introduction of hatchery @-@ raised Yellowstone cutthroat trout into native ranges of other cutthroat trout subspecies , particularly the westslope cutthroat trout , has resulted in intraspecific breeding and diminished genetic purity of the westslope subspecies . As such , populations of genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout are very rare and localized in streams above barriers to upstream migrations by introduced species . Fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke attributes the extinction of the yellowfin cutthroat trout ( O. c. macdonaldi ) and Alvord cutthroat trout ( O. c. <unk> ) subspecies to the introduction of non @-@ native rainbow trout . 
 = = = Decline of the Yellowstone subspecies = = = 
 The population at the core of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout 's native range , in Yellowstone Lake , declined significantly in the 1960s due to overharvest of mature cutthroat trout by anglers , as well as overharvesting of eggs by hatcheries in the early 20th century . Managers implemented catch and release , which required anglers to return their catches to the lake , and they terminated hatchery operations in the park which allowed the cutthroat trout to recover . Then , in 1994 , park officials discovered lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) in Yellowstone Lake . Although lake trout were established in Shoshone , Lewis and Heart lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. government stocking operations in 1890 , they were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage and their presence there is probably the result of accidental or illegal introductions . By 2000 , the cutthroat trout population had declined to less than 10 percent of its early 20th century abundance . However , aggressive lake trout eradication programs have killed over one million lake trout since 1996 , and the hope is that this will lead to a restoration of cutthroat numbers . Cutthroat trout co @-@ exist with lake trout in Heart Lake , an isolated back @-@ country lake at the head of the Heart River that gets little angling pressure .

 Cutthroat trout are prized as a gamefish , particularly by fly anglers . They are regulated as a gamefish in every state and province they occur in .

The all @-@ tackle world record is 41 lb ( 19 kg ) caught in Pyramid Lake in December 1925 .

 Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 . By the 1890s , the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in the Yellowstone River and Yellowstone Lake were well known and being promoted in national guidebooks . 
 Fishing Grounds . — In the river at the lake outlet are the fishing grounds , about a mile from the hotel , while at many places between the lake and canyon excellent fishing is had from shore . The best results in the outlet are had from row boats ; they can be rented from the steamboat company who have a supply , as well as competent and experienced oarsmen . Not more than two can successfully fish from one boat . When the grounds are reached , have the oarsman occupy the " stern , " as from this position he can manipulate the landing net to a better advantage , the anchor is attached to the " bow . " During the trout season ( July to September ) , no better fishing can be found . They average about one and one @-@ half pounds each and are of the salmon <unk> [ sic ] variety — a catch of 100 , three or four hours before sundown , is not <unk> . 
 In 1902 , anticipating the completion of the east entrance road from Cody , Wyoming , Captain Hiram M. Chittenden supervised the construction of the first " Fishing Bridge " across the outlet of Yellowstone Lake . Fishing Bridge was rebuilt in 1919 , and reconstructed in 1937 , primarily to accommodate vehicle traffic . Between 1916 and 1931 , a large development of campgrounds , cabins , stores and service facilities were built just east of the bridge to support anglers . This area is now known as the Fishing Bridge Historic District . The 1937 bridge boasted pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway to give more room to anglers . Angling in the river , at Fishing Bridge and in the lake , boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and over harvest caused a significant decline in the fishery . Consequently , in 1973 , fishing was no longer permitted from Fishing Bridge .

In the 1970s , Pyramid Lake was stocked with Lahontan cutthroat trout strains still surviving in some nearby lakes , but they were not the large Pyramid Lake strain . Although the Paiute tribe had been successful in reestablishing a cutthroat trout fishery on the reservation in Pyramid Lake , the cutthroat trout were not the large fish of the late 19th and early 20th century . In the late 1970 , biologists discovered a surviving population of a pure Pyramid Lake strain in a small headwaters stream on the Nevada @-@ Utah border that had at some point around 1900 been introduced into the stream . In 1995 , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began rearing these fish in the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery in <unk> , Nevada . In 2006 , the Pyramid Lake strain of Lahontan cutthroat trout were reintroduced into the lake . As Pyramid Lake has a very shallow shoreline , anglers use ladders to stand comfortably in 3 to 4 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 to 1 @.@ 2 m ) of water and cast to trout cruising along shoreline breaks .

 = Longtown Castle = 
 Longtown Castle , also termed Ewias Lacey in early accounts , is a ruined Norman motte @-@ and @-@ bailey fortification in Longtown , Herefordshire . Built around 1175 by Hugh de Lacy , possibly reusing former Roman earthworks , the castle had an unusual design with three baileys and two large enclosures to protect the neighbouring town . Early in the next century the castle was rebuilt in stone , with a circular keep erected on the motte and a gatehouse constructed between the inner and outer western baileys . By the 14th century , Longtown Castle had fallen into decline . Despite being pressed back into use during the Owain Glyndŵr rising in 1403 , it became ruined . In the 21st century the castle is maintained by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction .

 It is uncertain when the first fortification at Longtown was built . The first defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or Roman , or Anglo @-@ Saxon periods , but this remains uncertain . If Roman defences were constructed at the site , it was probably because of a Roman road that may have run nearby , and the defences may well have then been reused in the building of the current castle , parts of whose earthworks have square , angular corners , similar to those of Roman forts but otherwise unusual in 12th century English castles . 
 = = = Initial construction = = = 
 After the Norman invasion of England and Wales in the late 11th century , a small castle was built at Pont <unk> , close to the site of the current castle , by either Roger de Lacy or Pain fitzJohn in order to protect the river crossing there . Longtown was then probably built to replace this older castle , probably around 1175 , by Hugh de Lacy , a successful favourite of Henry II and an administrator in newly conquered Ireland . Hugh had acquired the local lands around Ewias Lacey , an important Marcher Lord territory , in the 1160s and early 1170s . The early castle was occasionally also called Ewias Lacey , named after the wider lordship ; " Ewias " was a term meaning " sheep district " . 
 Longtown Castle was designed as a motte and bailey castle , on high ground alongside the River Monnow . More defensible sites on higher ground existed nearby , but this location was strategically well located close to the River , an important transport route . It had a 10 @-@ metre ( 33 ft ) high motte and an unusual rectangular bailey design around 125 metres ( 410 ft ) by 110 metres ( 360 ft ) , divided into three parts , two baileys in the west and one in the east , each capable of being defended independently and enclosing around 1 @.@ 21 hectares ( 3 @.@ 0 acres ) in total . The 12th @-@ century castle was built primarily of timber with at least some stone in its design , but this stone was then reused when the castle was rebuilt in the 13th century . Two circuits of earthworks to the north and south of the castle , possibly with wooden palisades , enclosed the early settlement of Longtown . The region was troubled for the rest of the century , with revolts by the local Welsh against Anglo @-@ Norman rule . 
 = = = Expansion and decline = = = 
 The castle was extensively rebuilt in stone during the early 13th century . The stone keep , dating from the 1220s or 1230s , was constructed in the form of a circular great tower , with walls 5 @-@ metre ( 16 ft ) thick and three turrets spaced evenly around the outside and a hall on the first floor . This circular design is particular to the Welsh Marches , and is also seen at Skenfrith and Caldicot . The reason for this choice is unclear , as it appears to have carried few military advantages . The stonework is made up of shale rubble with cut ashlar detailing ; the walls are around 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) thick , but the keep 's foundations are extremely shallow . An inner gate to the western baileys was built to a simple design with two small turrets , and seems to have been fitted with a portcullis , while a 3 @-@ metre ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) thick wall encircled the rest of the inner western bailey ; another stone wall seems to have protected the outer half of the bailey . Inside the inner western bailey appears to have been the castle 's great hall and other service buildings . The work on the castle cost the de <unk> around £ 37 , a large sum of money for the time . The settlement of Longtown was probably established at the same time as the castle , and initially prospered . 
 The de Lacy family controlled Longtown Castle until Walter de Lacy 's death in 1234 . John Fitzgeoffrey then acquired the castle , during a period of increased conflict and tension between the Welsh princes Llywelyn the Great and Dafydd ap Llywelyn and the English marcher lords . The castle then passed to John Verdon and his sons , who struggled with local lawlessness and the Welsh revolts which continued until the end of the century . Edward temporarily confiscated the castle and estates from John 's son , Theobald Verdon , and in 1316 the castle passed to Bartholomew de <unk> . The castle continued to be used as a fortification , and in 1317 orders were given to garrison it with 30 men . 
 The castle began to decline in importance , however , and in 1369 passed to the Despensers and then the Beauchamps , neither of whom used the castle . It was temporarily refortified by Henry IV in response to the Owain Glyndŵr uprising in North Wales in 1403 . The Nevilles acquired the property in the 15th century and it remained in the control of the Lords of Abergavenny until the 1970s . After the Black Death the town 's population fell away sharply as well , the protected area north of the castle was abandoned , and by the 16th century it was no longer a functioning trading centre . 
 It is unclear if the castle and town played any part in the English Civil War between 1642 – 45 , although cannon balls from the period have been discovered within the castle . Local oral tradition states that the castle was slighted , or deliberately destroyed , during the war . Stones from the castle were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards , and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the castle , along with a yard and garden . A gallows operated at the castle until 1790 . Buildings continued to encroach on the castle . By the end of the 19th century a school and a house , Castle Lodge , had been built in the castle grounds . Other buildings were built as lean @-@ to 's against the castle walls .

 Longtown Castle was acquired by the Ministry of Works in the 1970s . It was in a poor condition and extensive restoration work was carried out , including the removal of many of the buildings that had encroached on the walls . In the 21st century , the central parts of Longtown Castle , including the ruined keep , the internal gatehouse and fragments of the curtain wall , are maintained by English Heritage as a tourist attraction , although the wider earthworks lie on common land .

 The site of The St. James was formerly occupied by a group of historic 19th @-@ century buildings that lined Walnut Street in the Washington Square West neighborhood in Center City , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The most notable of these was the former headquarters of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society ( PSFS ) . Designed in 1868 by Addison Hutton , the granite @-@ faced Italianate @-@ style building was the second headquarters building that PSFS had built . Construction began on the building on June 13 , 1868 and it was opened for business on October 11 , 1869 . An addition designed by Hutton was added in 1885 , and another designed by Frank Furness in 1895 . The building served as the PSFS headquarters until 1932 when the company moved to the PSFS Building on Market Street . 
 The other buildings are a group of three brick three @-@ story rowhouses called York Row . Built in 1807 in the Federal style , they are an early example of speculative housing development . York Row was built at a time when Philadelphia 's population was shifting westward , away from the Delaware River . 
 The buildings were bought for US $ 4 @.@ 7 million in 1988 by real estate investor Samuel A. Rappaport . Rappaport , who made a fortune by buying , improving , and then selling run @-@ down properties , announced in 1989 that he planned to turn the building into his own personal headquarters and add a glass @-@ enclosed ballroom on its top . Rappaport also planned to have an apartment in one of the York Row houses . However , like many other Rappaport @-@ owned buildings , they ended up being left vacant and neglected , becoming a target for vandals and the homeless . 
 Rappaport died in 1994 , and in January 1995 developer P & A Associates announced its agreement to buy the properties from his estate . The developer also disclosed plans to build a luxury residential tower at the site . The plan called for dismantling part of Furness 's additions to the PSFS headquarters , which would serve as the tower 's lobby . The York Row houses would have been completely demolished . The plan was controversial as preservationists wanted the buildings to remain unchanged . P & A Associates met with representatives of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and in February 1995 advanced a new plan that would preserve most of the PSFS headquarters and the York Row facade . The new plan , which was approved by the Philadelphia Historical Commission , included renovating the PSFS headquarters and converting it into restaurant and office space . The York Row building interiors had been stripped of everything except for one fireplace mantle and could not be restored . P & A Associates would instead preserve the front facade of the houses , back to the roof ridge line .

 After its announcement in 1995 , the project stalled because P & A Associates was unable to find investors to finance the project . Investors were skeptical that luxury residential apartments outside the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in Center City could be successful . The delay allowed another developer to announce an agreement to acquire the property . In March 1999 , Chicago @-@ based developer the Barton Group announced its plan to build a 37 @-@ story , 322 @-@ unit luxury residential tower . The Barton Group 's plan would also incorporate the PSFS headquarters building and York Row into the tower . 
 At the end of the 1990s , Philadelphia was experiencing a condominium boom , with more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings being converted into rental and condominium apartments between 1998 and 2004 . With the residential market in Center City growing , P & A Associates found financing by going into a partnership with real estate firm Boston Financial to fund its planned residential tower . Around the same time , the Barton Group ended its intentions with the site and sold its interest in the property to P & A Associates and Boston Financial . The tower announced by P & A Associates and Boston Financial would be a 300 @-@ unit luxury rental tower called St. James Court , named after an adjacent street . The high @-@ rise would still incorporate the preservation efforts for the 19th @-@ century buildings it agreed to in 1995 . 
 P & A Associates received final approval from the city zoning board and the historical commission in August 1999 , but continued to seek more financing , which it was able to secure from Corus Bank of Chicago in September 2001 . To develop the tower , now called The St. James , P & A Associates formed the St. James Associates Joint Venture with Clark Realty Capital LLC and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments , which represented an undisclosed client . With financial backing from its partners and tax breaks for new residential construction passed in 2000 , construction began on November 28 , 2001 . <unk> Construction ( Philadelphia based ) was awarded the construction of the project . Philadelphia had not seen any residential high @-@ rise development since the 1980s , and The St. James was one of the first to begin construction in the city , preceded only by the 16 @-@ story Residences at the Dockside , which broke ground in 2000 . It became the largest residential building in the city . 
 By the beginning of March 2004 , 20 percent of the 306 units in The St. James had been leased . Construction was completed later that month , with finishing touches added later in the year . In March 2005 , a year after the building was completed , P & A Associates and Clark Realty Capital , under the name of 700 Walnut LP , announced The St. James was for sale . At the time , 45 percent of its units were being rented . P & A Associates sold off its interest in the building that same year .

 The St. James is a 45 @-@ story , high @-@ rise luxury residential skyscraper in Center City . At 498 feet ( 152 m ) tall , it is the 12th tallest building in Philadelphia . The US $ 80 million , Chicago @-@ style high @-@ rise was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz & Associates Inc. with assistance by architectural firm Bower Lewis Thrower . Located between 8th Street , Walnut Street , St. James Street , and Washington Square , The St. James stands two blocks from Independence Hall . The glass and concrete skyscraper 's east and west facade is split between a curved wall , a squared @-@ off wing , and a strip of blue glass that separates them . 
 The St. James contains 415 @,@ 790 square feet ( 39 @,@ 000 m2 ) of residential and commercial space . This includes 8 @,@ 290 square feet ( 770 m2 ) of office space , 14 @,@ 500 square feet ( 1 @,@ 300 m2 ) of retail space , and 393 @,@ 000 square feet ( 37 @,@ 000 m2 ) of residential space . The 306 residential units feature 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) ceilings and floor @-@ to @-@ ceiling windows . The building features a four @-@ pipe heating and air @-@ conditioning system , and every unit , except for the studio apartments , has a private balcony . Building amenities include an 11th @-@ floor health club and a 60 feet ( 18 m ) swimming pool . 
 The first nine floors of The St. James house private parking for building residents . The street @-@ level retail floor is occupied by a Starbucks and an <unk> seafood restaurant . Along Walnut Street , The St. James incorporated the front facades of the York Row houses , while the rest of the buildings were demolished . The main tower is set 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) from the York Row facades to preserve the Row 's original look . All but the rear wing of the PSFS headquarters building was incorporated into the tower . The demolished portion of the PSFS building was converted into a hidden courtyard for residents . 
 Preservationists were critical of how the York Row houses were preserved . Calling them " <unk> " , vice president of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia J. Randall Cotton felt that saving the facades did not preserve the essence of the buildings , but that it was better than nothing . Cotton said , " At the eyeball level , it will give something of the coherence of the Philadelphia cityscape , which is a human scale . The beauty of Philadelphia is that its lots were 20 to 25 feet , which allowed for a door and two windows . It 's a falsehood to put a big building behind them . But it 's preferable to demolition . " The Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron was critical of the parking garage on the lower floors , saying it " detracts from [ The St. James 's ] crisp , vertical lines and bumps clumsily against the historic buildings . The garage also makes the tower feel distant from the life of the city . " The St. James has won several awards , including the 2006 National Association of Home Builders awards for Best Luxury Rental Apartment Primary Market and Best High @-@ Rise Rental Apartment . 
 = Oxygen = 
 Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8 . It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds . By mass , oxygen is the third @-@ most abundant element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen , a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O 
 2 . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20 @.@ 8 % of the Earth 's atmosphere . Additionally , as oxides the element also makes up almost half of the Earth 's crust . 
 Oxygen is necessary to sustain most terrestrial life . Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells , teeth , and bone . Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water , the major constituent of lifeforms . Conversely , oxygen is continuously replenished by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide . Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms . Another form ( allotrope ) of oxygen , ozone ( O 
 3 ) , strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high @-@ altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation . But ozone is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by @-@ product of smog . At low earth orbit altitudes , sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause corrosion of spacecraft . 
 Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele , in Uppsala , in 1773 or earlier , and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire , in 1774 , but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first . The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier , whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then @-@ popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion . Its name derives from the Greek roots <unk> <unk> , " acid " , literally " sharp " , referring to the sour taste of acids and -γενής <unk> , " producer " , literally " begetter " , because at the time of naming , it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition . 
 Common use of oxygen includes residential heating , internal combustion engines , production of steel , plastics and textiles , brazing , welding and cutting of steels and other metals , rocket propellant , oxygen therapy , and life support systems in aircraft , submarines , spaceflight and diving .

 = = = Early experiments = = = 
 One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics , Philo of Byzantium . In his work <unk> , Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel 's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck . Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass . Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo 's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration . 
 In the late 17th century , Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion . English chemist John <unk> ( 1641 – 1679 ) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus . In one experiment , he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one @-@ fourteenth of the air 's volume before extinguishing the subjects . From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion . 
 <unk> observed that antimony increased in weight when heated , and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it . He also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body . Accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work Tractatus duo in the tract " De <unk> " . 
 = = = <unk> theory = = = 
 Robert Hooke , Ole Borch , Mikhail Lomonosov , and Pierre <unk> all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a chemical element . This may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and corrosion called the phlogiston theory , which was then the favored explanation of those processes . 
 Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J. Becher , and modified by the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl by 1731 , phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts . One part , called phlogiston , was given off when the substance containing it was burned , while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form , or <unk> . 
 Highly combustible materials that leave little residue , such as wood or coal , were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston ; non @-@ combustible substances that corrode , such as iron , contained very little . Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory , nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea ; instead , it was based on observations of what happens when something burns , that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process . The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products . Indeed , one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals gain weight in rusting ( when they were supposedly losing phlogiston ) . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Oxygen was first discovered by Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele . He had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide and various nitrates by about 1772 . Scheele called the gas " fire air " because it was the only known supporter of combustion , and wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript he titled Treatise on Air and Fire , which he sent to his publisher in 1775 . That document was published in 1777 . 
 In the meantime , on August 1 , 1774 , an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide ( <unk> ) inside a glass tube , which liberated a gas he named " dephlogisticated air " . He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it . After breathing the gas himself , he wrote : " The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air , but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards . " Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled " An Account of Further Discoveries in Air " which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air . Because he published his findings first , Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery . 
 The French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently . Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas . Scheele also posted a letter to Lavoisier on September 30 , 1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance , but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it ( a copy of the letter was found in Scheele 's belongings after his death ) . 
 = = = Lavoisier 's contribution = = = 
 What Lavoisier did ( although this was disputed at the time ) was to conduct the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation and give the first correct explanation of how combustion works . He used these and similar experiments , all started in 1774 , to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a chemical element . 
 In one experiment , Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container . He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container , which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed . He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in . This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général , which was published in 1777 . In that work , he proved that air is a mixture of two gases ; ' vital air ' , which is essential to combustion and respiration , and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> " lifeless " ) , which did not support either . <unk> later became nitrogen in English , although it has kept the name in French and several other European languages . 
 Lavoisier renamed ' vital air ' to <unk> in 1777 from the Greek roots <unk> ( <unk> ) ( acid , literally " sharp " , from the taste of acids ) and -γενής ( <unk> ) ( producer , literally begetter ) , because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids . Chemists ( such as Sir Humphry Davy in 1812 ) eventually determined that Lavoisier was wrong in this regard ( hydrogen forms the basis for acid chemistry ) , but by then the name was too well established . 
 Oxygen entered the English language despite opposition by English scientists and the fact that the Englishman Priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it . This is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled " Oxygen " in the popular book The Botanic Garden ( 1791 ) by Erasmus Darwin , grandfather of Charles Darwin . 
 = = = Later history = = = 
 John Dalton 's original atomic hypothesis presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another . For example , Dalton assumed that water 's formula was HO , giving the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen , instead of the modern value of about 16 . In 1805 , Joseph Louis Gay @-@ Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen ; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water 's composition , based on what is now called Avogadro 's law and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases . 
 By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it . Using a cascade method , Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre <unk> evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide , which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it . He sent a telegram on December 22 , 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen . Just two days later , French physicist Louis Paul <unk> announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen . Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted . Oxygen was liquified in a stable state for the first time on March 29 , 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University , Zygmunt <unk> and Karol Olszewski . 
 In 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study . The first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer Carl von Linde and British engineer William Hampson . Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them . Later , in 1901 , oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed O 
 2 . This method of welding and cutting metal later became common . 
 In 1923 , the American scientist Robert H. Goddard became the first person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel ; the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer . Goddard successfully flew a small liquid @-@ fueled rocket 56 m at 97 km / h on March 16 , 1926 in Auburn , Massachusetts , US . 
 Oxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally , possibly because of fossil @-@ fuel burning .

 At standard temperature and pressure , oxygen is a colorless , odorless , and tasteless gas with the molecular formula O 
 2 , referred to as dioxygen . 
 As dioxygen , two oxygen atoms are chemically bound to each other . The bond can be variously described based on level of theory , but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms , the filling of which results in a bond order of two . More specifically , the double bond is the result of sequential , low @-@ to @-@ high energy , or Aufbau , filling of orbitals , and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons , after sequential filling of the low σ and σ * orbitals ; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O @-@ O molecular axis and π overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O @-@ O molecular axis , and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest π and π * orbitals . 
 This combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in dioxygen 's double bond character and reactivity , and a triplet electronic ground state . An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons , as is found in dioxygen ( see the filled π * orbitals in the diagram ) orbitals that are of equal energy — i.e. , degenerate — is a configuration termed a spin triplet state . Hence , the ground state of the O 
 2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen . The highest energy , partially filled orbitals are antibonding , and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two . Because of its unpaired electrons , triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules , which have paired electron spins ; this prevents spontaneous combustion . 
 In the triplet form , O 
 2 molecules are paramagnetic . That is , they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field , because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule , and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O 
 2 molecules . Liquid oxygen is so magnetic that , in laboratory demonstrations , a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet . 
 <unk> oxygen is a name given to several higher @-@ energy species of molecular O 
 2 in which all the electron spins are paired . It is much more reactive with common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se . In nature , singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis , using the energy of sunlight . It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength , and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen . Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms ( and possibly animals ) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the <unk> ground state before it can cause harm to tissues .

 The common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen , O 
 2 , the major part of the Earth 's atmospheric oxygen ( see Occurrence ) . O2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kJ · mol − 1 , which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of O2 with any organic molecule . Due to its energy content , O2 is used by complex forms of life , such as animals , in cellular respiration ( see Biological role ) . Other aspects of O 
 2 are covered in the remainder of this article . 
 <unk> ( O 
 3 ) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue . Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O 
 2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O 
 2 by ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation . Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum , the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet . Near the Earth 's surface , it is a pollutant formed as a by @-@ product of automobile exhaust . The metastable molecule <unk> ( O 
 4 ) was discovered in 2001 , and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen . It was proven in 2006 that this phase , created by pressurizing O 
 2 to 20 GPa , is in fact a rhombohedral O 
 8 cluster . This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O 
 2 or O 
 3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel . A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures , this phase becomes superconducting .

 Oxygen dissolves more readily in water than nitrogen , and in freshwater more readily than seawater . Water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved O 
 2 for every 2 molecules of N 
 2 ( 1 : 2 ) , compared with an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1 : 4 . The solubility of oxygen in water is temperature @-@ dependent , and about twice as much ( 14 @.@ 6 mg · L − 1 ) dissolves at 0 ° C than at 20 ° C ( 7 @.@ 6 mg · L − 1 ) . At 25 ° C and 1 standard atmosphere ( 101 @.@ 3 kPa ) of air , freshwater contains about 6 @.@ 04 milliliters ( mL ) of oxygen per liter , and seawater contains about 4 @.@ 95 mL per liter . At 5 ° C the solubility increases to 9 @.@ 0 mL ( 50 % more than at 25 ° C ) per liter for water and 7 @.@ 2 mL ( 45 % more ) per liter for sea water . 
 Oxygen condenses at 90 @.@ 20 K ( − 182 @.@ 95 ° C , − 297 @.@ 31 ° F ) , and freezes at 54 @.@ 36 K ( − 218 @.@ 79 ° C , − 361 @.@ 82 ° F ) . Both liquid and solid O 
 2 are clear substances with a light sky @-@ blue color caused by absorption in the red ( in contrast with the blue color of the sky , which is due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light ) . High @-@ purity liquid O 
 2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air . Liquid oxygen may also be condensed from air using liquid nitrogen as a coolant . 
 Oxygen is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials . 
 The spectroscopy of molecular oxygen is associated with the atmospheric processes of aurora , airglow and <unk> . The absorption in the Herzberg continuum and Schumann – Runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere . Excited state singlet molecular oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution . 
 = = = Isotopes and stellar origin = = = 
 Naturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable isotopes , 16O , 17O , and 18O , with 16O being the most abundant ( 99 @.@ 762 % natural abundance ) . 
 Most 16O is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in massive stars but some is made in the neon burning process . 17O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle , making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars . Most 18O is produced when 14N ( made abundant from CNO burning ) captures a 4He nucleus , making 18O common in the helium @-@ rich zones of evolved , massive stars . 
 Fourteen radioisotopes have been characterized . The most stable are <unk> with a half @-@ life of 122 @.@ 24 seconds and <unk> with a half @-@ life of 70 @.@ 606 seconds . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives that are less than 27 s and the majority of these have half @-@ lives that are less than 83 milliseconds . The most common decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 16O is β + decay to yield nitrogen , and the most common mode for the isotopes heavier than 18O is beta decay to yield fluorine .

 Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth 's biosphere , air , sea and land . Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . About 0 @.@ 9 % of the Sun 's mass is oxygen . Oxygen constitutes 49 @.@ 2 % of the Earth 's crust by mass as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide and is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth 's crust . It is also the major component of the world 's oceans ( 88 @.@ 8 % by mass ) . Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth 's atmosphere , taking up 20 @.@ 8 % of its volume and 23 @.@ 1 % of its mass ( some 1015 tonnes ) . Earth is unusual among the planets of the Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere : Mars ( with 0 @.@ 1 % O 
 2 by volume ) and Venus have much less . The O 
 2 surrounding those planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation on oxygen @-@ containing molecules such as carbon dioxide . 
 The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle . This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth : the atmosphere , the biosphere , and the lithosphere . The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis , which is responsible for modern Earth 's atmosphere . Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere , while respiration , decay , and combustion remove it from the atmosphere . In the present equilibrium , production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1 / 2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year . 
 Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world 's water bodies . The increased solubility of O 
 2 at lower temperatures ( see Physical properties ) has important implications for ocean life , as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content . Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the O 
 2 content in eutrophic water bodies . Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water 's biochemical oxygen demand , or the amount of O 
 2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 <unk> measure the ratio of oxygen @-@ 18 and oxygen @-@ 16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago ( see oxygen isotope ratio cycle ) . Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope , oxygen @-@ 16 , evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12 % heavier oxygen @-@ 18 , and this disparity increases at lower temperatures . During periods of lower global temperatures , snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen @-@ 16 , and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen @-@ 18 . Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen @-@ 18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate . <unk> also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years . 
 Planetary geologists have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the Earth , the Moon , Mars , and meteorites , but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun , believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula . Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen @-@ 16 than does the Earth . The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen @-@ 16 from the Sun 's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth . 
 Oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 nm . Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform . This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation 's reflectance from its fluorescence , which is much weaker . The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal @-@ to @-@ noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation ; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale .

 In nature , free oxygen is produced by the light @-@ driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis . According to some estimates , green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70 % of the free oxygen produced on Earth , and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants . Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher , while some estimates are lower , suggesting oceans produce ~ 45 % of Earth 's atmospheric oxygen each year .

Many steps are involved , but the result is the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane , which is used to synthesize adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) via photophosphorylation . The O 
 2 remaining ( after production of the water molecule ) is released into the atmosphere . 
 Molecular dioxygen , O 
 2 , is essential for cellular respiration in all aerobic organisms . Oxygen is used in mitochondria to generate ATP during oxidative phosphorylation . The reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as : 
 C 
 6H 
 12O 
 6 + 6 O 
 2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H 
 2O + 2880 kJ · mol − 1 
 In vertebrates , O 
 2 diffuses through membranes in the lungs and into red blood cells . Hemoglobin binds O 
 2 , changing color from bluish red to bright red ( CO 
 2 is released from another part of hemoglobin through the Bohr effect ) . Other animals use hemocyanin ( molluscs and some arthropods ) or <unk> ( spiders and lobsters ) . A liter of blood can dissolve 200 cm3 of O 
 2 . 
 Until the discovery of anaerobic metazoa , oxygen was thought to be a requirement for all complex life . 
 Reactive oxygen species , such as superoxide ion ( O − 
 2 ) and hydrogen peroxide ( H 
 2O 
 2 ) , are dangerous by @-@ products of oxygen use in organisms . Parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide , superoxide , and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes . Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack . Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms , which were the dominant form of early life on Earth until O 
 2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2 @.@ 5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event , about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms . 
 An adult human at rest inhales 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 grams of oxygen per minute . This amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year .

 The free oxygen partial pressure in the body of a living vertebrate organism is highest in the respiratory system , and decreases along any arterial system , peripheral tissues , and venous system , respectively . Partial pressure is the pressure that oxygen would have if it alone occupied the volume .

 Free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in Earth 's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved , probably about 3 @.@ 5 billion years ago . Free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the <unk> eon ( between 3 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 3 billion years ago ) . For the first billion years , any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations . When such oxygen sinks became saturated , free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3 – 2 @.@ 7 billion years ago , reaching 10 % of its present level around 1 @.@ 7 billion years ago . 
 The presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most of the extant anaerobic organisms to extinction during the Great Oxygenation Event ( oxygen catastrophe ) about 2 @.@ 4 billion years ago . Cellular respiration using O 
 2 enables aerobic organisms to produce much more ATP than anaerobic organisms . Cellular respiration of O 
 2 occurs in all eukaryotes , including all complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals . 
 Since the beginning of the Cambrian period 540 million years ago , atmospheric O 
 2 levels have fluctuated between 15 % and 30 % by volume . Towards the end of the Carboniferous period ( about 300 million years ago ) atmospheric O 
 2 levels reached a maximum of 35 % by volume , which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at this time . 
 Variations of oxygen shaped the climates of the past . When oxygen declined , atmospheric density dropped and this in turn increased surface evaporation , and led to precipitation increases and warmer temperatures . 
 At the current rate of photosynthesis it would take about 2 @,@ 000 years to regenerate the entire O 
 2 in the present atmosphere .

 One hundred million tonnes of O 
 2 are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods . The most common method is fractional distillation of liquefied air , with N 
 2 distilling as a vapor while O 
 2 is left as a liquid . 
 The other primary method of producing O 
 2 is passing a stream of clean , dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves , which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90 % to 93 % O 
 2 . Simultaneously , nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen @-@ saturated zeolite bed , by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it , in the reverse direction of flow . After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged , thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline . This is known as pressure swing adsorption . Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non @-@ cryogenic technologies ( see also the related vacuum swing adsorption ) . 
 Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen . DC electricity must be used : if AC is used , the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2 : 1 . Contrary to popular belief , the 2 : 1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves . A similar method is the <unk> O 
 2 evolution from oxides and <unk> . Chemical catalysts can be used as well , such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life @-@ support equipment on submarines , and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies . Another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current , to produce nearly pure O 
 2 gas . 
 In large quantities , the price of liquid oxygen in 2001 was approximately $ 0 @.@ 21 / kg . Since the primary cost of production is the energy cost of liquefying the air , the production cost will change as energy cost varies . 
 = = Storage = = 
 Oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks , cryogenics and chemical compounds . For reasons of economy , oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers , since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) . Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers , which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas . Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers , which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building . Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas ; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy @-@ fuel welding and cutting .

 <unk> of O 
 2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration , so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine . Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient 's blood , but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs , easing work load on the heart . Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema , pneumonia , some heart disorders ( congestive heart failure ) , some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure , and any disease that impairs the body 's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen . 
 Treatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals , the patient 's home , or increasingly by portable devices . Oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation , but have since been replaced mostly by the use of oxygen masks or nasal <unk> . 
 Hyperbaric ( high @-@ pressure ) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O 
 2 around the patient and , when needed , the medical staff . Carbon monoxide poisoning , gas gangrene , and decompression sickness ( the ' bends ' ) are sometimes addressed with this therapy . Increased O 
 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin . Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene , so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them . Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive , resulting in bubbles of inert gas , mostly nitrogen and helium , forming in the blood . Increasing the pressure of O 
 2 as soon as possible helps to <unk> the bubbles back into the blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the lungs . 
 Oxygen is also used medically for patients who require mechanical ventilation , often at concentrations above the 21 % found in ambient air .

 An application of O 
 2 as a low @-@ pressure breathing gas is in modern space suits , which surround their occupant 's body with pressurized air . These devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one third normal pressure , resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of O 
 2 . This trade @-@ off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility . 
 Scuba divers and submariners also rely on artificially delivered O 
 2 , but most often use normal pressure , and / or mixtures of oxygen and air . Pure or nearly pure O
