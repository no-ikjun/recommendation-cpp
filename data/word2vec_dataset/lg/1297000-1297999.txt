 On 21 March 1942 IV . / <unk> was re @-@ designated as III . / JG 5 . It was re @-@ established on the same day in Werneuchen with elements of the previous IV . / JG 1 and training squadrons of fighter schools 1 and 4 . On 1 April 1943 , IV . / JG 1 was re @-@ designated as I. / JG 1 
 = = = Aircraft of Jagdgeschwader 1 = = = 
 When JG 1 was formed , it primarily used the Messerschmitt Bf 109E @-@ 1 . In mid @-@ 1942 , II . , III. and IV . / JG 1 started converting to the Fw 190 ; although I. / JG 1 continued to operate the Bf 109 ' E ' and ' F ' and later ' G ' models , including the specialized ' F @-@ 4 / Z ' and ' G @-@ 1 ' ( the latter also being pressurized ) high @-@ altitude fighter with GM @-@ 1 boost . By April 1943 , I. / JG 1 had largely transitioned to the FW 190A , while III . / JG 1 returned to the Bf 109G . In April 1944 , III . / JG 1 was one of the first Luftwaffe units to have been equipped with the Bf 109G @-@ 5 / AS with improved supercharger and methanol @-@ water MW @-@ 50 boost . 
 I. and II . JG 1 were the first units to equip with the Heinkel He <unk> @-@ 2 Spatz ( Sparrow , Heinkel 's name for the design ) , with deliveries of the He 162 in February 1945 to I. / JG 1 at Parchim . Around April 1945 , II . / JG 1 moved to Rostock @-@ Marienehe near the Heinkel factory to receive the deliveries of the new aircraft . 
 = = = Unit emblem and color schemes = = = 
 When JG 1 was initially formed as I. / JG 1 , its emblem was designed by Major Woldenga as a German Crusader 's cross on which a flight of three Bf 109s was transposed . 
 When I. / JG 1 was incorporated into JG 27 , I. / JG 1 's original emblem became that of III . / JG 27 . When JG 1 was reformed in 1940 , II . / JG 1 's emblem was the <unk> , a mythical Norse serpent with origins with JG 3 . 
 I. / JG 1 was the only group that displayed individual aircraft numerals on the engine cowling until it was re @-@ designated III . / JG 27 . Each of the <unk> also had its own emblems . For example , 2 . / JG 1 had a sword slicing Chamberlain 's umbrella in two . 
 The badge of 9 . / JG 1 depicted a flintlock pistol on a heart surrounded by the words , ( translated from German ) " Who Shoots first gets more out of life " . After his appointment as Geschwaderkommodore <unk> . Walter Oesau introduced a new emblem on 12 November 1943 and used by all of JG 1 ; a red – winged ‘ 1 ’ inside a white diamond surrounded by a black circle . There seem to have been some disputes over emblem details , with one version enclosing the white diamond with a red circle instead of a black one . 
 In spring 1943 I. / JG 1 briefly introduced high @-@ visibility geometric patterns of alternating black and white horizontal stripes on the engine cowling , with other units of JG 1 ( formerly IV . / JG 1 ) using checkerboard patterns on the cowling . I. / JG 1 was unique in using a variation of a more colorful identification scheme of checkerboard black @-@ and @-@ white @-@ striped engine cowlings . The <unk> were divided into black @-@ white , black @-@ red and black @-@ yellow for the 1 . , 2 @.@ and 3 . Staffeln respectively . 
 Following the general adoption of aft coloured fuselage bands identification by all <unk> , I. / JG 1 utilised black and white bands . I. / JG 1 started painting red aft fuselage bands to distinguish from JG 11 and the Sturmstaffel aircraft . Use of these colored fuselage bands was generally abandoned by mid @-@ 1944 . At one point , a color scheme of painting the tail rudder in white was trialled for units dedicated to Defence of Reich duties . 
 = = Wartime history = = 
 The original I. / JG 1 based in Jesau , played little part in the Invasion of Poland . Within Eastern Prussia , they were re @-@ deployed to three forward bases ; <unk> , <unk> and Arys @-@ <unk> . I. / JG 1 had negligible involvement and no enemy aircraft were downed . The only casualty was a pilot of 2 . / JG 1 injured by friendly flak . On 5 September 1939 , the group returned to Jesau . After a ten @-@ day stop in Lübeck @-@ Blankensee , the group arrived at <unk> . Although I. / JG 1 came under administrative control of JG 27 , I. / JG 1 was temporarily put under administrative control of JG 77 on 4 June 1940 . It came back under control of JG 27 few days later . 
 Upon arrival at <unk> the first aircraft credited to I. / JG 1 was a Bristol Blenheim of No. 110 Squadron RAF shot down on a reconnaissance mission . In February 1940 , Major Bernhard Woldenga was promoted to the position of Inspectorate of Fighters and was succeeded by Joachim <unk> . The unit went on to participate extensively in the Battle of France . I. / JG 1 claimed 82 air victories during the Battle of France , with Hauptmann Wilhelm Balthasar top scorer with 23 kills , and Leutnant Ludwig Frantisek with 9 . 
 After being re @-@ established in December 1940 , I. / JG 1 's primary responsibility was the air defence of Germany and its Northern occupied territories . In this role , the unit almost exclusively worked in the Netherlands prior to its transfer to central West Germany . Its main opponents through 1940 – 41 were therefore lone RAF reconnaissance aircraft , the anti @-@ shipping aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and the medium bombers of RAF Bomber Command 's 2 Group , although the group would see little action compared to other theaters during 1941 . During this time , this sector was considered relatively safe compared to other theaters . 
 = = = Defence of the Reich 1942 – 1943 = = = 
 Because RAF bombers and their escorts had insufficient range to reach German airspace , JG 1 was somewhat isolated from the RAF 's " Lean into Europe " fighter offensive of 1941 that involved JG 2 and JG 26 . Oberstleutnant Erich Mix , a veteran of World War I and over 40 years of age , claimed a Blenheim as his 13th kill in mid @-@ 1941 . 
 JG 1 did however take part in the famed Channel Dash , as part of the air cover plan ( Operation Donnerkeil ) for the German Kriegsmarine battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau , with cruiser Prinz Eugen on 13 February 1942 . By May II . / JG 1 was assigned to Woensdrecht and <unk> . Its first victory was scored by Unteroffizier Meisner of 6 . / JG 1 . By early 1942 , the group had started re @-@ equip from the earlier Bf 109F @-@ 4 to the Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 , completing by 12 May 1942 . One notable ace from early 1942 was Oberfeldwebel Gerhardt , leading scorer of JG 1 with a tally of 9 by 17 February 1942 . 
 From late 1942 onwards , the increasing USAAF bomber offensive now brought JG 1 to the forefront of the Defence of the Reich , operating at high altitudes against the American bomber streams of the 8th Air Force . Equipped with the Bf 109G " Gustav " with pressurized cabins , JG 1 experimented with several official and unofficial ways of downing the heavy bombers – with varying degrees of success . One of the unofficial methods Leutnant Heinz Knoke developed was " air bombing " the bombers from above using a delay @-@ fused 250 kg bomb with a 15 @-@ second fuse , although the loss of aircraft performance and vulnerability of the bomb @-@ carrying aircraft to fighters meant the method was not widely adopted . Knoke 's initial operation using air bombs was from 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) above the bomber formation on 22 March 1943 , and he reported breaking the wing off one of the bombers , although the only B @-@ 17 lost that day was to III . / JG 1 . 
 JG 1 also pioneered the use of underwing <unk> @-@ <unk> ( <unk> . <unk> or <unk> ) 21 rockets as a " stand @-@ off " anti @-@ bomber weapon in mid @-@ 1943 , although they proved too heavy for the fighter aircraft and were removed later in the year . 
 By the start of 1943 , JG 1 were mainly equipped with the Fw 190 @-@ A , excepting I. / JG 1 still using the Bf 109G @-@ 1 . The first large @-@ scale air battle between JG 1 and VIII Bomber Command occurred when the latter bombed the naval base at Wilhelmshaven on 27 January 1943 with a force of 64 B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress ( B @-@ 17 ) and 27 B @-@ 24 Liberators ( B @-@ 24 ) . Facing them were I. , II. and IV . / JG 1 . With their Jever base below the route I. / JG 1 attacked in full strength under Hauptmann Günther <unk> . In broken cloud cover , they intercepted at 25 @,@ 000 ft ( 7 @,@ 600 m ) . The lack of heavy armament on the Bf 109 and the lack of experience of I. / JG 1 meant had less than satisfactory results . The US crews noted the Bf 109s did not press home their attacks . Although most of the B @-@ 17s had some combat damage , only one failed to return , with first American casualty of " Defence of Reich " campaign Captain Vance Beckham 's 305th Bomber Group B @-@ 17F ( 41 @-@ <unk> ) . There were five claims ( one unconfirmed ) and the bomber was shot down by either Oberleutnant Hugo Frey of 2 . / JG 1 or by Feldwebel Siegfried <unk> of 2 . / JG 1 , as his second kill . Five of the Bf 109s went down with three pilots killed , although damage to the naval base was minimal . 
 Cloud cover over the target and bad radio communication meant the B @-@ 24 formation broke up . The smaller B @-@ 24 formation lost their way and crossed into the Netherlands near Woensdrecht . After wandering over North Netherlands they turned north towards the North Sea where they ditched their bombs . II. and IV . / JG 1 took off from Woensdrecht and München @-@ Gladbach to intercept while 5 @.@ and 6 . / JG 1 refuelled at Schiphol . 4 . / JG 1 made one pass at the bombers and two Liberators were claimed but not confirmed . 12 . / JG 1 intercepted over Terschelling , downing two Liberators . Of these , one was the result of a collision with a downed Fw @-@ 190 that cut the bomber 's tail , 12 . / JG 1 's only loss . 
 On 4 February 1943 the night @-@ fighter wing Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 ( NJG 1 ) , equipped with Bf 110 twin @-@ engined night fighters , joined the fray along with I. / JG 1 , II . / JG 1 and IV . / JG 1 . Due to poor weather conditions only 3 . / JG 1 was able to find the formation at first , claiming one B @-@ 17 . II . / JG 1 and IV . / JG 1 claimed six B @-@ 17 downed at the cost of two fighters . 
 I. / JG 1 claimed four B @-@ 17s and four B @-@ 24s on 26 February 1943 during an attack on the Wilhelmshaven U @-@ boat yards and two Liberators were confirmed lost . One was claimed by Oberleutnant Heinz Knoke , and the other claimed by Unteroffizier Leo <unk> of 3 . / JG 1 . Thirteen B @-@ 17s were claimed downed by JG 1 in total . 
 On 18 March 1943 , 76 B @-@ 17s and 27 B @-@ 24s were sent to bomb Vegesack U @-@ Boat Yards near Bremen . I. / JG 1 , IV . / JG 1 and parts of III . / JG 1 along with Nachtjagdgeschwader formations intercepted the bombers southwest of Heligoland . Knoke and his wingman Dieter Gerhardt each attacked one B @-@ 24 bomber head on . Knoke 's target exploded but was also claimed by Oberleutnant Walter <unk> of 8 . / Nachtjagdgeschwader 3 ( NJG 3 ) . Gerhardt 's target B @-@ 24 limped back to England while he was shot down over the North Sea by another bomber return fire . The fight lasted for two hours , and four B @-@ 17s and five B @-@ 24s were claimed shot down for the loss of two pilots and three aircraft . Only one B @-@ 24 and one B @-@ 17 was actually lost . 
 On 1 April 1943 , Oberfeldwebel Fritz Timm of 3 . / JG 1 shot down a Lancaster . On 17 April 1943 , Hauptmann Fritz Losigkeit , Gruppenkommandeur of I. / JG 1 shot down his first B @-@ 17 , and his unit claimed a total of three of which two were confirmed for the loss of one pilot and two Fw 190s . 17 other B @-@ 17s were claimed shot down by JG 1 and JG 11 . 
 On 11 June 1943 , Leesmann 's III . / JG 11 saw action for the first time . The group intercepted a formation of B @-@ 17s approaching Wilhelmshaven . Leutnant Eugen <unk> , Staffelkapitän of 9 . / JG 1 claimed one B @-@ 17 for his twenty @-@ first victory . 
 VIII Bomber Command organized its first large attack on the Ruhr Area on 22 June 1943 . The main objective involving bombing the synthetic rubber plant in <unk> by ten B @-@ 17 groups . JG 1 intercepted and was credited with fifteen bombers . 
 On 25 June 1943 , another B @-@ 17 formation headed into Germany . However , both primary and secondary targets were covered with cloud and the bombers attacked two convoys off the Frisian Islands . Some eight assorted groups of fighters intercepted , among them III . / JG 1 , who claimed seven bombers , Leesmann responsible for one of them . III . / JG 1 lost two pilots including Adjutant Oberleutnant Friedrich Hardt , and three pilots were injured . 
 The weather on 25 July was so poor that two bomber formations of VIII Bomber Command selected their secondary target and a third abandoned its mission . III . / JG 1 downed three bombers , but lost Leesmann , who crashed into the North Sea along with his 37th victim . 
 Next day , the bombers went after rubber factories in Hannover , along with Hamburg U @-@ Boat Yards . Feldwebel Alfred <unk> of 8 . / JG 1 and Hauptmann Robert Olejnik of III . / JG 1 each claimed one bomber . 
 30 July 1943 was the last day of what was dubbed " Blitz Week " . Mission No. 80 targeted the Fieseler factory in Kassel . III . / JG 1 did scrambled until the bombers had bombed and were returning , and , along with III . / JG 11 , intercepted the bombers near the Dutch border over Emmerich am Rhein . They were unexpectedly confronted by one hundred USAAF P @-@ 47 Thunderbolts and III . / JG 1 had three Bf 109G aircraft damaged , of which two were beyond repair . Leutnant <unk> of 9 . / JG 1 shot down one P @-@ 47 , the first P @-@ 47 lost in the " Defence of Reich " campaign . The 56th Fighter Group and 78th Fighter Group recorded the loss of one fighter each . Two bombers were also shot down . 
 On 12 August 1943 , 330 B @-@ 17s bombed targets in Western Germany , escorted for the first time by P @-@ 47s with drop tanks . II . / JG 1 had six Fw 190s force @-@ land and another six suffered heavy damage , losing one pilot . 
 On 8 October 1943 , JG 1 lost high scoring ace Oberstleutnant Hans Philipp , killed by the P @-@ 47 fighters of the 56th Fighter Group . The <unk> heard Philipp announce a victory over a Thunderbolt , and his last transmission was to wingman Oberfeldwebel Reinhardt , stating " Reinhardt , attack ! " . . Reinhardt last saw Philipp 's aircraft disappear into a cloud . Reinhardt was wounded after colliding with an enemy aircraft , but made a successful forced landing . 
 II . / JG 1 were reinforced with several <unk> at this time , including Hauptmann Karl @-@ Heinz Weber ( 136 kills in 500 + missions with 7 . / JG 51 ) <unk> Friedrich <unk> ( 23 kills by June 1944 ) and <unk> . Günther Heckmann ( 12 kills ) . It was during late 1943 that Walter Oesau was appointed Kommodore of JG 1 . 
 On 28 December 1943 , 6 . / JG 1 lost Unteroffizier Gerhard Hartwig and Rudolf <unk> over <unk> and Oberfeldwebel Werner <unk> bailing out over <unk> . Hauptmann Hans @-@ Georg Hackbarth , who had joined JG 1 on 15 November was promoted to replace Hans Ehlers in I. / JG 1 , killed on 22 December 1943 . 
 = = = D @-@ Day and beyond 1944 = = = 
 Major Hans @-@ Günther von <unk> had formed an experimental unit to evaluate new methods of bomber attack . Sturmstaffel 1 consisted entirely of volunteers trained to engage the enemy bombers in extremely close quarters , utilising specially armed and up @-@ armored Fw 190 's ( so @-@ called <unk> ) or Battering Rams ) . These were intended to attack the bombers from the rear in tight arrowhead formations , closing to extreme close range , as replacements for the formerly @-@ dedicated Zerstörer twin @-@ engined heavy fighters , which themselves were being shot down in ever @-@ increasing numbers by Allied escort fighters . In January 1944 , the 18 Staffel unit was transferred to Dortmund where they were subordinated to Major Rudolf @-@ Emil Schnoor and his I. / JG 1 . 
 By January 1944 , II . / JG 1 was based in Northern Germany as a " Defence of the Reich " ( Reichsverteidigung ) unit under Hauptmann Walter <unk> ( 62 kills ) . Over the following few months II . / JG 1 now had three noted experts transferred in ; Hauptmann Hermann Segatz ( 33 kills ) , Oberleutnant Georg @-@ Peter Eder ( 33 kills ) and Major Heinz Bär ( 179 kills ) . Oberleutnant Georg @-@ Peter Eder was assigned as Staffelkapitän of 6 . / JG 1 on 15 March 1944 , after recovering from wounds suffered while serving with JG 2 . 
 On 4 February 1944 Hauptmann Hermann Segatz replaced Hauptmann Walter <unk> as commander of II . / JG 1 . Although Major Bär had led I. / JG 77 , his out spoken criticism of the Luftwaffe leadership led Reichsmarschall Göring to demote him to Staffelkapitän leading an operation training group . He was transferred on 21 January 1944 to 6 . / JG 1 as an ordinary pilot . Walter Oesau welcomed him with assurances to High Command that Bär would not have command responsibilities . Oesau however managed to utilize Bär 's skills as formation leader after the death of Segatz on 8 March 1944 , and Bär was appointed as acting commander of II . / JG 1 . 
 On 24 February 1944 , the Eighth Air Force attempted to repeat the success of 20 February . 1st and 2nd Divisions flew due east towards Germany and the 3rd Division east @-@ northeast without escort . After crossing into Schleswig @-@ Holstein they attacked targets along the Baltic sea coast . The 1st and 2nd Divisions were considered to be the main thrust of the attack and the 3rd Division went unmolested . The B @-@ 24 bombers of the 2nd Division were scheduled to bomb Gotha and JG 1 were directed to attack these B @-@ 24s . Due to strong tailwinds and flying at lower altitude , the bombers were separated from their escorting fighters and JG 1 reached Gotha before the bombers . Major Heinz Bär led II . / JG 1 in a diving attack and claimed four B @-@ 24s while I. / JG 1 attacked head @-@ on and claimed five B @-@ 24s downed . 
 At the time an " assembly directive " in place dictated that the senior pilot landing at any fighter airfield would assume command of all other fighter pilots ( irrespective of unit ) landing on that airfield with a serviceable aircraft . This enabled large ad @-@ hoc formations of fighters to be quickly thrown back into the battle . JG 1 's Walter Oesau led one such attack with improvised command . 
 On 6 March 1944 , Jimmy Doolittle ordered 730 bombers to bomb Berlin for the first time . They were escorted by 644 fighters from 8th Air Force , 9th Air Force and the RAF . The Commander of I. Jagdkorps requested and received reinforcements from II . Jagdkorps and 7 Jagd @-@ Division . Oesau led Stab . / JG 1 and I. / JG 1 , Major Bär led II . / JG 1 , and accompanied by I. / JG 11 and III . / JG 54 they initially intercepted sixteen B @-@ 17s of 100th Bomb Group who were escorted by P @-@ 47s of the 78th Group . Ten B @-@ 17s went down in the first wave , and in several waves of attacks on the bombers from multiple directions most of the pilots ended up exhausting their ammunition , resulting in twenty bombers being shot down in the 25 minutes before the escorting P @-@ 47s arrived . 
 During the first half of 1944 , Allied attacks on railway networks had thoroughly frustrated Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring . Göring was not at all happy with the inability to stop the bombing , and he questioned the commitment of several fighter wing leaders who were not flying and personally leading their units on a regular basis . On 11 May 1944 , 1 @,@ 000 B @-@ 17 and B @-@ 24 bombers of the 8th Air Force attacked vital railway networks in north east Belgium and eastern France , escorted by an even greater number of fighters . Oesau was sick and in bed at the time but , angered by Göring 's insinuations , took off with two other fighters of the Headquarters Flight in his " Green 12 " Bf 109 . 
 There are various versions regarding his death . One version suggested that his wingman reported damage and was asked to break off . Alone over the Ardennes , he was engaged by at least four escorting P @-@ 38s or possibly by P @-@ 51s . In the ensuing 20 minute dogfight , he was killed crashing near St. Vith . In his memory , Jagdgeschwader 1 was granted the " Oesau " suffix . 
 Bär was transferred to JG 3 on 21 May 1944 , having claimed 23 victories in four months with II . / JG 1 , replaced by Oberleutnant Georg @-@ Peter Eder . Hauptmann Weber was appointed to command III . / JG 1 on 7 June 1944 . 
 The wing had served almost exclusively in North Germany and the Netherlands until now , when it was transferred to Central and Western Germany before moving to France , providing air cover over the Army ( Wehrmacht ) during the Battle of Normandy . On D @-@ Day , II . / JG 1 received orders to transfer west from their base near Störmede . 32 Fw 190A @-@ 8s took off under the command of Oberleutnant Eder , and headed for Essay . By late afternoon all the aircraft landed at Montdidier . News that their original destination had been bombed meant a diversion to Le Mans . The newly added Staffel 7 . / JG 51 ( later 8 . / JG 1 ) was attacked by Mustangs near Le Mans , Lt. Johann <unk> being shot down and killed . I. / JG 1 and II . / JG 1 , along with II . / JG 53 , were based at Le Mans with a complement of 100 Fw 190s and Bf 109s . 
 The next day saw the notable loss of Hauptmann Karl @-@ Heinz Weber , commander of III . / JG 1 who was shot down and killed by Mustangs . It was from Le Mans that JG 1 started to perform fighter @-@ bomber ( <unk> or Jabo ) missions , even though I. nor II . / JG 1 had any specialised training . On 8 June 1944 both <unk> were sent off on ground @-@ attack missions . 25 Fw 190s of II . / JG 1 attacked Allied shipping off the Normandy coast unmolested . RAF aircraft bombed Le Mans airfield on the night of 9 June , resulting in II . / JG 1 losing seven aircraft and five damaged . Oberleutnant Rüdiger von Kirchmayr flew back to 4 . / JG 1 after hospitalization on 12 June in Störmede , and en route he was attacked by Spitfires over Flers , claiming an unconfirmed kill as a result . There was a follow @-@ up bombing attack on 15 June resulting in a loss of two more Fw 190s . 
 On 15 June 1944 , Feldwebel Günther Henschel of 8 . / JG 1 downed a Mustang north of Caen . One Fw 190 was downed without human loss . On 16 June 1944 , II . / JG 1 moved its complement of 25 Fw 190s to Essay and was tasked with defending the skies over the beaches of Normandy . During the transfer , 8 . / JG 1 , was probably attacked by the P @-@ 51s of the 354th Fighter Wing , near Alençon . JG 1 lost three pilots and one mechanic riding passenger , and also lost were two other aircraft without human loss with a claiming of two P @-@ 51s downed credited to Lt. Friedrich <unk> ( 24th kill ) and Oberfeldwebel Günther Heckmann ( 13th kill ) . The base at Essay was bombed the same day by B @-@ 24 Liberators , making the airfield unsuitable for missions . 
 This prompted a transfer to a landing ground at <unk> , south @-@ east of Alençon . As the unit was establishing itself here , they came under fresh attack from Mustangs , which shot up the airfield , destroying 15 Fw 190s and putting II . / JG 1 out of the battle . Around 11 non @-@ operational Fw 190s were also destroyed – resulting in the final losses of II . / JG 1 in Normandy . In ten weeks in Normandy , II . / JG 1 had lost 27 pilots , 3 captured and 2 wounded . A total of 106 aircraft were lost for various reasons . 
 On 17 August 1944 , II . / JG 1 transferred back to <unk> , Germany , for training and re @-@ equipping with the new Heinkel He 162 Spatz lightweight jet fighters . 
 On 21 November , 1 @,@ 149 bombers and 858 fighters of the 8th Air Force attacked the Merseburg oil yard . In poor flying conditions , many of the new inexperienced pilots of I. / JG 1 were lost , some 20 aircraft being shot down . I. / JG 1 was then assigned to support preparations for the Ardennes counter @-@ offensive , which would restart the Battle of the Bulge 
 Providing air support to the army in the Bastogne area was as hard for II . / JG 1 , losing several experienced pilots . On 26 December 1944 , Leutnant Horst <unk> , Oberfeldwebel Georg Hutter and Oberfeldwebel Reinhard <unk> of 5 . / JG 11 and 6 . / JG 11 were all lost . Other pilots lost included Unteroffizier Ferdinand <unk> and Johann <unk> and Leutnant Heinz Fresia , Oberführer Paul Brühl and Oberführer Helmut <unk> 8 . / JG 1 . 
 = = = Operation Bodenplatte = = = 
 In late 1944 , the Luftwaffe Operation Bodenplatte with the aim of crippling Allied tactical air forces based in the Low Countries , and thus reviving the bogged @-@ down progress of the Wehrmacht during the Battle of the Bulge . The operation was launched on New Year 's Day , 1945 . JG 1 participated in this action with orders to destroy as many enemy aircraft on the ground as possible . Although a large number of allied aircraft were destroyed , the Luftwaffe lost a large number of pilots that were irreplaceable . 
 JG 1 's targets included : 
 131 Polish Fighter Wing RAF ( 302 " Poznański " Squadron , No. 308 " Krakowski " Squadron ( Krakowski ) and 317 " <unk> " Squadron ) located near Ghent / Sint @-@ Denijs in Belgium . 
 485 ( NZ ) Squadron located near Maldegem in Belgium . 
 Other Spitfire squadrons near Ursel in Belgium . 
 JG 1 lost ten pilots killed , seven missing and eight captured . 
 During a fight with No. 308 Squadron Spitfires , by Flight Sergeant Józef Stanowski engaged Hauptmann Georg Hackbarth ( 30 kills ) and his Fw 190A @-@ 8 crashed near St. Pieters railway station , his body being thrown clear of the wreckage . Fw . Karl Hahn was also shot down by Stanowski , as was Feldwebel Harry <unk> ' I. / JG 1 Fw 190 " Green 5 " which crashed near <unk> . Flying Officer Tadeusz <unk> also claimed the Fw 190 piloted by <unk> . <unk> in turn was attacked and crash @-@ landed . 
 However , Stanowski had to crash @-@ land due to lack of fuel . As No. 308 Squadron returned to base they shot down four more of the I. / JG 1 fighters . 
 It was then that II . / JG 1 arrived . Fw . <unk> <unk> of 5 . / JG 1 was engaged by two Spitfires and shot down , bailing out and taken prisoner . No. 317 Squadron then joined the mêlée upon arrival . Warrant Officer Stanisław <unk> shot down another Fw 190 . 
 One eye witness account suggested some of the downed JG 1 pilots faced the wrath of Belgium civilians , citing that the body of one of the pilots was stripped and attacked by an angry mob . Another pilot , Unteroffizier Fritz Hoffman , barely escaped by surrendering to Allied forces after being shot down by Flight Lieutenant Czesław <unk> of 317 Squadron . Feldwebel Paul Mayr and Leutnant Ernst Von <unk> were also shot down by No. 317 Squadron . In turn , Flight Lieutenant Tadeusz <unk> was shot down and killed . Another Allied pilot crash @-@ landed after downing a German aircraft . 
 Pilot Officer Andrzej <unk> was credited for downing another German aircraft and Flight Lieutenant Mach shot down another German aircraft after a chase at ground level . Another German Fw 190 was shot down by his wing man , Warrant Officer Stanisław <unk> . 
 The remaining pilots of I. / JG 1 and II . / JG 1 started their homeward journey , some of whom , like Fw . Paul Wunderlich , were downed by enemy flak . They also came under fire from friendly flak , downing even more pilots . 
 In all , JG 1 claimed 32 Spitfires , one B @-@ 17 and one Short Stirling on the ground . However , RAF records state only 13 Spitfires were destroyed , with 8 shot down in aerial combat . Just 4 were listed as lost in aerial engagements with JG 1 . 
 = = = Defence of the Reich 1945 = = = 
 After the disastrous losses of Operation Bodenplatte , and failing to maintain air superiority over the Ardennes area , a severely weakened II . / JG 1 transferred to Insterburg in East Prussia ( modern Chernyakhovsk in Russia ) . I. / JG 1 faced British fighters over <unk> @-@ Twente on 14 January 1945 . JG 1 lost 12 pilots with 7 being killed , 3 wounded and 2 missing . Spitfires shot down the entire 1 @.@ and 2 @.@ <unk> of JG 1 at Twente airport as they took off ( for the loss of two ) . Ihlefeld threatened to court martial Major G. Capito , the new leader of I. / JG 1 , for such a disastrous loss but was unable to during the transferring to the Eastern Front . In Poland JG 1 were briefly assigned to Luftflotte Reich ( the Air Fleet assigned to defend what was left of Germany from the final Allied offensives ) . 
 It was during this time that the unit began converting to the new jet @-@ propelled Heinkel He <unk> " <unk> " . I. / JG 1 started training on the new jet aircraft in March 1945 . Some 12 pilots were killed in accidents flying the new unfamiliar fighter . I. / JG 1 had moved back to Parchim , performing " Defence of the Reich " duties , and one of the bases of the pioneering German jet fighter wing , JG 7 . Since this was not far from Rostock @-@ Marienehe ( today 's Rostock @-@ <unk> neighborhood ) , where the Heinkel factory was located , it was easier for the pilots of I. / JG 1 to pick up the new jets . However , with Germany on the brink of collapse , transportation and fuel supply was getting difficult with the increased Allied air attacks . 
 On 7 April 1945 , 134 B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses bombed the field at Parchim . In two days , I. / JG 1 relocated to a nearby airfield at <unk> . They moved again a week later to Leck . Around this time , II . / JG 1 had moved to airfield at Marienehe and also started taking delivery of the He 162 . These new jet aircraft would never see widespread combat with JG 1 due to their late introduction and a shortage of pilots , aircraft and fuel . JG 1 could no longer field their full complement or effectively fly operations as required . 
 The new He 162 had about 30 minutes worth of fuel . This endurance was simply not enough , and at least two JG 1 pilots were killed making Deadstick landing after exhausting their fuel . By April , I. / JG 1 had scored a number of kills , but at the cost of 13 He 162s and 10 pilots . The losses were mostly attributed to issues with the He 162 such as engine flame @-@ outs or occasional structural failures , which can most probably be attributed to poor design and insufficient development time . On 24 April 1945 , III . / JG 1 was disbanded . 
 On 19 April at least one He 162 of 3 . / JG 1 fell victim to a Hawker Tempest of 222 Squadron . Leutnant Gerhard Steimer wrote : 
 We took off from the concrete runway in Leck , Kirchner ( <unk> Günther Kirchner ) stayed 30 metres behind me on my right side as usual ; ... We climbed up to about 200 metres , when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner 's plane . I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy . I was very lucky that the Thunderbolts did not press on with another attack . 
 The combat matches an account by Flight Lieutenant G. <unk> of 222 Squadron who reported shooting down an unusual looking German aircraft while on armed reconnaissance in the area . This was the first loss of an He 162 in combat .

 On 30 April 1945 , II . / JG 1 was combined with I. / JG 1 at Leck to form two new groups ( Gruppen ) : I. ( Einsatz ) / JG 1 and II . ( <unk> ) / JG 1 ; a combined total of about 50 pilots and aircraft . On 4 May 1945 , all of JG 1 's surviving He @-@ 162s were formed into a special consolidated Intervention groups ( Einsatzgruppen ) . However , on 5 May 1945 , the war ended and there was a ceasefire which , effectively grounded the He 162s . Surviving JG 1 crews collectively turned their He 162s over to the Allies . 
 " Throughout the entire war , our JG 1 had the thankless task of defending the north @-@ west flank of the Reich , which , until the Americans entered the air war , merited little attention . The Geschwader came to the fore with the start of the " Defence of the Reich " , which was to be a harsh baptism of fire . " 
 = = Notable successes and losses = = 
 One of the most famous group commanders ( Gruppenkommandeure ) of JG 1 was Major Heinz " <unk> " Bär , before he was promoted as wing commander of JG 3 . Credited with 220 kills , Bär was the 8th ranking aerial " Ace " of all time . Other notable aces were Oberstleutnant Georg @-@ Peter Eder , the highest @-@ scoring Luftwaffe ace against the USAAF , who would go on to become a " jet ace " , scoring at least 12 and possibly 24 victories in an Me 262 while serving with Kommando Nowotny and JG 7 . 
 The Gruppe 's 700th victory occurred on 29 April 1944 , credited to <unk> von Kirchmayr as his 15th kill . There were several high @-@ scoring pilots associated with JG 1 . For example , Alfred Grislawski had a score of 134 to his name , Georg @-@ Peter Eder had 78 , and Walter Oesau had 127 confirmed prior to his death . 
 However , losses were also high . Five of the fourteen Group commanders ( Gruppenkommandeure ) of II . / JG 1 were killed in action while serving with II . / JG 1 . The notable losses were Oberleutnant Rohwer , and <unk> Kijewski , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . During early 1944 , prior to D @-@ Day , II . / JG 1 was led by one of its four experienced formation commanders . These were Hauptmann Segatz , Major Bär , and <unk> von Kirchmayr and Eder . Yet the unit suffered heavy losses ( along with most other wings in the West ) of 48 pilots killed , 23 wounded , and 158 aircraft destroyed for 164 confirmed victories . Of these , 119 were USAAF four @-@ engined bombers . 
 Significantly , the highly experienced and irreplaceable experts were among the losses . The most notable loss of II . / JG 1 was its Kommandeur , Hauptmann <unk> ( KIA 8 March 1944 , 40 kills ) . The Group also lost seven experienced team leaders ( Rottenführer ) and flight leaders ( Schwarmführer ) . 
 Unteroffizier Erich <unk> ( KIA 11 February 1944 , 3 Kills ) , 
 Feldwebel Heinz Fuchs ( KIA 24 February 1944 , 11 Kills ) , 
 Unteroffizier Hans @-@ Joachim <unk> ( KIA 3 March 1944 , 4 Kills ) , 
 Feldwebel Heinz Kahl ( KIA 12 May 1944 , 9 Kills ) , 
 Unteroffizier Helmut Stiegler ( KIA 12 May 1944 , 6 Kills ) , 
 Unteroffizier Heinrich Weber ( KIA 16 May 1944 , 3 Kills ) , 
 Leutnant Gunther Buchholz ( KIA 31 May 1944 , 5 Kills ) . 
 When 8 . / JG 1 ( originally 7 . / JG 51 ) was transferred from Eastern front , it had 15 pilots in May 1944 . By August , twelve pilots had been killed , one captured and another severely wounded ; only Lieutenant Günther Heckmann was the sole pilot remaining . 
 The Luftwaffe units committed to battle after the D @-@ Day landings suffered further catastrophic losses against the overwhelming numbers of allied fighters present . In the ten weeks of action following D @-@ Day , II . / JG 1 lost 106 aircraft ( 41 in air combat ) and 30 pilots , for just 32 air claims . Many experienced and irreplaceable <unk> were killed during this time . Hauptmann Karl @-@ Heinz Weber , Gruppenkommandeur of III . / JG 1 ( 136 claims ) was killed in action against Polish Wing Mustangs on 7 June 1944 , north of Paris , while on 17 June 1944 , Leutnant ' Toni ' <unk> ( 35 claims ) was shot down and killed in aerial combat with USAAF fighters over La <unk> . 
 On 16 June 1944 , while 8 . / JG 1 was moving from Le Mans to Essay , France came under attack by the P @-@ 51s of 354th Fighter Wing , near Alençon . In the ensuing dogfight , 8 . / JG 1 lost three pilots and one mechanic riding passenger . Those were Uffz . Günther Henschel , Uffz . Franz <unk> , and Feldwebel Helmuth Heidemann . The mechanic was Uffz . Herbert Redlich . Also lost were two other aircraft without loss of life . 
 Total pilot losses in World War II were 464 killed in action , 174 wounded , 94 killed in accidents , and 16 POW .

 Gaza ( / <unk> / ; Arabic : <unk> <unk> , IPA : [ <unk> ] ; Hebrew : <unk> ' <unk> ) , also referred to as Gaza City , is a Palestinian city in the Gaza Strip , with a population of 515 @,@ 556 , making it the largest city in the State of Palestine . <unk> since at least the 15th century BC , Gaza has been dominated by several different peoples and empires throughout its history . The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the Ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years . 
 Under the Romans and later the Byzantines , Gaza experienced relative peace and its port flourished . In 635 AD , it became the first city in Palestine to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a center of Islamic law . However , by the time the Crusaders invaded the city in the late 11th century , it was in ruins . In later centuries , Gaza experienced several hardships — from Mongol raids to floods and locusts , reducing it to a village by the 16th century , when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire . During the first half of Ottoman rule , the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza and under them the city went through an age of great commerce and peace . The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893 . 
 Gaza fell to British forces during World War I , becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine . As a result of the 1948 Arab – Israeli War , Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city . Gaza was captured by Israel in the Six @-@ Day War in 1967 , but in 1993 , the city was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority . In the months following the 2006 election , an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas , resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza . Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip . Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010 , and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians . 
 The primary economic activities of Gaza are small @-@ scale industries and agriculture . However , the blockade and recurring conflicts has put the economy under severe pressure . The majority of Gaza 's inhabitants are Muslim , although there is also a Christian minority . Gaza has a very young population with roughly 75 % under the age of 25 . The city is currently administered by a 14 @-@ member municipal council . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name " Gaza " is first known from military records of Thutmose III of Egypt in the 15th century BC . According to Shahin , the Ancient Egyptians called it " <unk> " ( " prized city " ) , and the ancient Muslims often referred to it as " <unk> Hashem " , in honor of Hashim , the great @-@ grandfather of Muhammad , who is buried in the city , according to Islamic tradition . In Semitic languages , the meaning of the city name is " fierce , strong " . 
 Other proper Arabic transliterations for the Arabic name are Ghazzah or <unk> ( DIN <unk> ) . Accordingly , " Gaza " might be spelled in English as " Gazza . " Although the " z " is double in Arabic , it was transliterated into Greek as a single zeta , and the voiced velar or uvular fricative at the beginning was transliterated with a gamma . 
 = = History = = 
 Gaza 's history of habitation dates back 5 @,@ 000 years , making it one of the oldest cities in the world . Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant , for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of the southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea . 
 = = = Bronze Age = = = 
 Settlement in the region of Gaza dates back to Tell es @-@ Sakan , an Ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory to the south of present @-@ day Gaza . The site went into decline throughout the Early Bronze Age II as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased . Another urban center known as Tell al @-@ Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed . During the Middle Bronze Age , a revived Tell es @-@ Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine , serving as a fort . In 1650 BCE , when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt , a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as @-@ Sakan . However , it was abandoned by the 14th century BCE , at the end of the Bronze Age . 
 = = = Ancient period = = = 
 Gaza later served as Egypt ’ s administrative capital in Canaan . During the reign of Tuthmosis III , the city became a stop on the Syrian @-@ Egyptian caravan route and was mentioned in the Amarna letters as " <unk> " . Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC , becoming a part of their " pentapolis " . According to the Book of Judges , Gaza was the place where Samson was imprisoned by the Philistines and met his death . 
 After being ruled by the Israelites , Assyrians , and then the Egyptians , Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire . Alexander the Great besieged Gaza , the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt , for five months before finally capturing it 332 BCE ; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive . Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a polis ( or " city @-@ state " ) . Greek culture consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenic learning and philosophy . During the Third War of the Diadochi , Ptolemy I Soter defeated Demetrius I of Macedon in a battle near Gaza in 312 BCE . 
 Gaza experienced another siege in 96 BCE by the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus who " utterly overthrew " the city , killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of Apollo for safety . Josephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Herod Antipas , who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans , <unk> and neighboring Arabs after being appointed governor of Idumea by Jannaeus . Rebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BCE under the command of Pompey Magnus , Gaza then became a part of the Roman province of Judaea . It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed . It nevertheless remained an important city , even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem . 
 Throughout the Roman period , Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors . A 500 @-@ member senate governed Gaza , and a diverse variety of Philistines , Greeks , Romans , Canaanites , Phoenicians , Jews , Egyptians , Persians , and Bedouin populated the city . Gaza 's mint issued coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors . During his visit in 130 CE , Emperor Hadrian personally inaugurated wrestling , boxing , and oratorical competitions in Gaza 's new stadium , which became known from Alexandria to Damascus . The city was adorned with many pagan temples ; the main cult being that of Marnas . Other temples were dedicated to Zeus , Helios , Aphrodite , Apollo , Athena and the local Tyche . Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 CE , including in the port of Maiuma . A large synagogue existed in Gaza in the 6th century , according to excavations . Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420 . In 402 , Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city 's pagan temples destroyed , and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas . It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza , his hometown , " the Athens of Asia . " Following the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century CE , Gaza remained under control of the Eastern Roman Empire that in turn became the Byzantine Empire . The city prospered and was an important center for the southern Palestine .

 In 634 CE Gaza was besieged by the Rashidun army under general ' Amr ibn al- ' As following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine . It was captured by Amr 's forces about three years later . Believed to be the site where Muhammad 's great grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried , Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by ' Amr 's army despite the city 's stiff and lengthy resistance , although its Byzantine garrison was massacred . The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza ; at first some of its churches were transformed into mosques , including the present Great Mosque of Gaza ( the oldest in the city ) , which was later rebuilt by Sultan Baibars , who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20 @,@ 000 manuscripts in the 13th century , a large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam , Arabic became the official language . In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash @-@ Shafi 'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there ; he founded the Shafi 'i religious code , one of the four major Sunni Muslim schools of law ( fiqh ) . Security , which was well @-@ maintained during early Muslim rule , was the key to Gaza 's prosperity . Although alcohol was banned in Islam , the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain wine production , and grapes , a major cash crop of the city , were exported mainly to Egypt . 
 Because it bordered the desert , Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups . In 796 it was destroyed during a civil war between the Arab tribes of the area . However , by the 10th century , the city had been rebuilt by the Abbasids ; during Abbasid rule , the Jerusalemite geographer al @-@ Muqaddasi described Gaza as " a large town lying on the <unk> to Egypt on the border of the desert . " In 977 , the Fatimids established an agreement with their rivals , the Seljuk Turks , whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it , including Egypt and the Seljuks controlled the region north of the city . 
 The Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149 . He also had the Great Mosque converted into the Cathedral of Saint John . In 1154 , Arab traveller al @-@ Idrisi wrote Gaza " is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders . " In 1187 the Ayyubids , led by Sultan Saladin , captured Gaza and later destroyed the city 's fortifications in 1191 . Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192 , but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla agreed upon months later in 1193 . Ayyubid rule ended in 1260 , after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza , which became his southernmost conquest . 
 Following Gaza 's destruction by the Mongols , Muslim slave @-@ soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area . In 1277 , the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name , Mamlakat Ghazzah ( Governorship of Gaza ) . This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea , and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills . Other major towns in the province included Qaqun , Ludd , and Ramla . Gaza , which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks , was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290 . In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza , and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks . Syrian geographer al @-@ Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a " city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land . " Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al @-@ Jawli , Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk @-@ era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311 @-@ 1320 and again in 1342 . In 1348 the Bubonic Plague spread to the city , killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352 , Gaza suffered from a destructive flood , which was rare in that arid part of Palestine . However , when Arab traveler and writer Ibn Batutta visited the city in 1355 , he noted that it was " large and populous , and has many mosques . " 
 The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques , Islamic colleges , hospitals , caravansaries , and public baths . They also allowed Jews to return to the city , after being expelled by the Crusaders , and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule . Towards the end of the Mamluk period , the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine , after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem . In 1481 , an Italian Jewish traveller <unk> of Volterra wrote : 
 Gazza is called by the Moslems Gaza . It is a fine and renowned place , and its fruits are very renowned and good . Bread and good wine is to be found there , but only Jews make wine . Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls . It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill . It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea , and there are about fifty ( sixty ) Jewish householders , artisans . They have a small but pretty Synagogue , and vineyards and fields and houses . They had already begun to make the new wine . ... The Jews live at the top of the hill . May God exalt them . There are also four Samaritan householders who live on the hillside .

 In 1516 Gaza — at the time , a small town with an inactive port , ruined buildings and reduced trade — was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire . The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small @-@ scale uprising , and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims . The city was then made the capital of Sanjak Gaza , part of the larger Province of Damascus . The Ridwan family , named after governor Ridwan Pasha , was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century . Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan , the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al @-@ Din al @-@ Ramli , who was based in the nearby town of al @-@ Ramla . 
 During the rule of Husayn Pasha , strife between the settled population and the nearby Bedouin tribes was dramatically reduced , allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper . The Ridwan period is described as a golden age for Gaza , a time when it served as the virtual " capital of Palestine . " The Great Mosque was restored , and six other mosques constructed , while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated . After the death of Musa Pasha , Husayn 's successor , Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans . The Ridwan period was Gaza 's last golden age during Ottoman rule . After the family was removed from office , the city gradually declined . 
 Starting in the early 19th century , Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt ; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered Gaza in 1832 . American scholar Edward Robinson visited the city in 1838 , describing it as a " thickly populated " town larger than Jerusalem , with its Old City lying upon a hilltop , while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain . The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government , local Arab tribes , and the Bedouin of Wadi Arabah and Ma 'an . The bazaars of Gaza were well @-@ supplied and were noted by Robinson as " far better " than those of Jerusalem . Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza 's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation . By the mid @-@ 19th century , Gaza 's port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and Haifa , but it retained its fishing fleet . 
 The Bubonic Plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city , lacking political and economic stability , went into a state of stagnation . In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza . The Ottomans won control of the territory , effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine . However , the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza whilst the city was still recovering from the effects of the plague .

 While leading the Allied Forces during World War I , the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917 . After the war , Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine . In the 1930s and 1940s , Gaza underwent major expansion . New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains . International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction . In the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan , Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab – Israeli War . Gaza 's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees fleeing nearby cities , towns and villages that were captured by Israel . In 1957 , Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza , which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services , providing housing , and establishing local security forces . 
 Gaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six @-@ Day War following the defeat of the Egyptian Army . Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s . The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987 . Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising , and economic conditions in the city worsened . 
 = = = = Palestinian control = = = = 
 In September 1993 , leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) signed the Oslo Accords . The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho , which was implemented in May 1994 . Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza , leaving a new Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) to administer and police the city . The PNA , led by Yasser Arafat , chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters . The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996 . 
 In 2005 , Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory . See Israel 's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004 . Since the Israeli withdrawal , Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah . On January 25 , 2006 , Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council , the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority . In 2007 , Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response . Currently , Hamas , recognized as a terror organization by most western countries , has de facto control of the city and Strip . 
 In March 2008 , a coalition of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six @-@ Day War , and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well . In 2008 , Israel commenced an assault against Gaza . Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005 , while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel 's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip . In January 2009 , at least 1 @,@ 300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict . 
 In November 2012 , after a week of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups , a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on November 21 . UN OCHA says 2 @,@ 205 Palestinians ( including at least 1 @,@ 483 civilians ) and 71 Israelis ( including 66 soldiers ) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel – Gaza conflict . According to an analysis by the New York Times , men ages 20 – 29 , who are most likely to be militants , are most overrepresented in the death toll . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Central Gaza is situated on a low @-@ lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres ( 46 ft ) above sea level . Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill , especially to the north and east , forming Gaza 's suburbs . The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) west of the city 's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low @-@ lying hills . 
 The municipal jurisdiction of the city today constitutes about 45 square kilometres ( 17 sq mi ) . Gaza is 78 kilometres ( 48 mi ) southwest of Jerusalem , 71 kilometres ( 44 mi ) south of Tel Aviv , and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) north of Rafah . Surrounding localities include Beit <unk> , Beit Hanoun , and <unk> to the north , and the village of Abu <unk> , the refugee camp of Bureij , and the city of Deir al @-@ Balah to the south . 
 The population of Gaza depends on groundwater as the only source for drinking , agricultural use , and domestic supply . The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south , sourced from Abu <unk> along the coastline . It bears a small amount of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer . Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel . The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones . Like most of the Gaza Strip , Gaza is covered by quaternary soil ; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination . 
 A prominent hill southeast of Gaza , known as Tell al @-@ Muntar , has an elevation of 270 feet ( 82 m ) above sea level . For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which Samson brought the city gates of the Philistines . The hill is crowned by a Muslim shrine ( maqam ) dedicated to Ali al @-@ Muntar ( " Ali of the Watchtower " ) . There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees , and the lintel of the doorway of the maqam has two medieval Arabic scriptures . 
 = = = Old City = = = 
 The Old City forms the main part of Gaza 's nucleus . It is roughly divided into two quarters ; the northern Daraj Quarter ( also known as the Muslim Quarter ) and the southern Zaytun Quarter ( which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters . ) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras , and some were built on top of earlier structures . The ancient part of the Old City is about 1 @.@ 6 square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 62 sq mi ) . 
 There are seven historic gates to the Old City : Bab <unk> ( Gate of Ashkelon ) , Bab al @-@ Darum ( Gate of Deir al @-@ Balah ) , Bab al @-@ Bahr ( Gate of the Sea ) , Bab Marnas ( Gate of Marnas ) , Bab al @-@ <unk> ( Gate of the Town ) , Bab al @-@ Khalil ( Gate of Hebron ) , and Bab al @-@ Muntar ( Gate of Tell al @-@ Muntar ) . Some of the older buildings use the ablaq style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry , prevalent in the Mamluk era . Daraj contains the Gold ( <unk> ) Market as well as the Great Mosque of Gaza ( oldest mosque in Gaza ) and the Sayed al @-@ Hashim Mosque . In Zaytun lies the Saint <unk> Church , the Katib al @-@ Wilaya Mosque , and Hamam as @-@ <unk> ( " the Samaritan 's Bathhouse . " ) 
 = = = Districts = = = 
 Gaza is composed of thirteen districts ( <unk> ) outside of the Old City . The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja 'iyya , built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period . In the northeast is the Mamluk @-@ era district of Tuffah , which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City 's walls . 
 During the 1930s and 1940s , a new residential district , Rimal ( currently divided into the districts of Northern Rimal and Southern Rimal ) , was constructed on the sand dunes west of the city center , and the district of Zeitoun was built along Gaza 's southern and southwestern borders , while the <unk> ( " the New " ) and <unk> neighborhoods of Shuja 'iyya expanded into separate districts in the northeast and southeast , respectively . <unk> ( also known Shuja <unk> al @-@ Akrad ) was named after the Kurdish military units who settled there during the Mamluk era , while <unk> was named after the Turkmen military units who settled there . 
 The areas between Rimal and the Old City became the districts of Sabra and Daraj . In the northwest is the district of Nasser , built in the early 1950s and named in honor of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser . The district of Sheikh Radwan , developed in the 1970s , is 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the north of the Old City and is named after Sheikh Radwan — the tomb of whom is located within the district . Gaza has absorbed the village of al @-@ <unk> near the border with Israel , as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of al @-@ Shati along the coast , although the latter is not under the city 's municipal jurisdiction . In the late 1990s , the PNA built the more affluent neighborhood of Tel al @-@ Hawa along the southern edge of Rimal . Along the southern coast of the city is the neighborhood of Sheikh <unk> .

 According to Ottoman tax records in 1557 , Gaza had 2 @,@ 477 male tax payers . The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza 's Muslim population consisted of 456 households , 115 bachelors , 59 religious persons , and 19 disabled persons . In addition to the Muslim figure , there were 141 <unk> or " soldiers " in the Ottoman army . Of the Christians , there were 294 households and seven bachelors , while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households . In total , an estimated 6 @,@ 000 people lived in Gaza , making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad . 
 In 1838 , there were roughly 4 @,@ 000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers , implying a population of about 15 @,@ 000 or 16 @,@ 000 — making it larger than Jerusalem at the time . The total number of Christian families was 57 . Before the outbreak of World War I , the population of Gaza had reached 42 @,@ 000 ; however , the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease . 
 According to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics ( PCBS ) , Gaza and the adjacent al @-@ Shati camp had a population of 353 @,@ 115 , of which 50 @.@ 9 % were males and 49 @.@ 1 % females . Gaza had an overwhelmingly young population with more than half being between the ages of infancy to 19 ( 60 @.@ 8 % ) . About 28 @.@ 8 % were between the ages of 20 to 44 , 7 @.@ 7 % between 45 and 64 , and 3 @.@ 9 % were over the age of 64 . 
 A massive influx of Palestinian refugees swelled Gaza 's population after the 1948 Arab – Israeli War . By 1967 , the population had grown to about six times its 1948 size . In 1997 , 51 @.@ 8 % of Gaza 's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants . The city 's population has continued to increase since that time to 515 @,@ 556 in 2012 , making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories . Gaza City has one of the highest overall growth rates in the world . Its population density is 9 @,@ 982 @.@ 69 / km ² ( 26 @,@ 424 @.@ 76 / sq mi ) comparable to New York City ( 10 @,@ 725 @.@ 4 / km ² - 27 @,@ 778 @.@ 7 / sq mi ) , half of Paris density ( 21 @,@ 000 / km ² - 55 @,@ 000 / sq mi ) . In 2007 poverty , unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims , who mostly follow Sunni Islam . During the Fatimid period , Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza , but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187 , he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy , which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers . 
 Gaza is home to a small Palestinian Christian minority of about 3 @,@ 500 people . The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek Orthodox , Roman Catholic , and Baptist denominations . In 1906 there were about 750 Christians , of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic . 
 Gaza 's Jewish community was roughly 3 @,@ 000 years old , and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households . Most of them fled from Gaza after the 1929 Palestine riots , when they consisted of fifty families . In Sami Hadawi 's land and population survey , Gaza had a population of 34 @,@ 250 , including 80 Jews in 1945 . Most of them left the city after the 1948 War , due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority . Today , there are no Jews living in Gaza . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The major agricultural products are strawberries , citrus , dates , olives , flowers , and various vegetables . Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip . Small @-@ scale industries include the production of plastics , construction materials , textiles , furniture , pottery , tiles , copperware , and carpets . Since the Oslo Accords , thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services , UNRWA and international organizations . Minor industries include textiles and food processing . A variety of wares are sold in Gaza 's street bazaars , including carpets , pottery , wicker furniture , and cotton clothing . The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010 . 
 Many Gazans worked in the Israeli service industry when the border was open , but after Israel 's 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip , this source of jobs disappeared . 
 A report by human rights and development groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators , the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades . The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point : In 2008 , 95 % of Gaza 's industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems . In 2009 , unemployment in Gaza was close to 40 % . The private sector which generates 53 % of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt . In June 2005 , 3 @,@ 900 factories in Gaza employed 35 @,@ 000 people , by December 2007 , only 1 @,@ 700 were still employed . The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work . The agriculture sector was hard hit , affecting nearly 40 @,@ 000 workers dependent on cash crops . 
 Gaza 's food prices rose during the blockade , with wheat flour going up 34 % , rice up 21 % , and baby powder up 30 % . In 2007 , households spent an average of 62 % of their total income on food , compared to 37 % in 2004 . In less than a decade , the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold . In 2008 , 80 % of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63 % in 2006 . According to a report by <unk> in 2009 , Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing , educational facilities , health facilities and infrastructure , along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems . 
 Following a significant easing of the closure policy in 2010 , the economy of Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels during the height of the blockade . The economy of Gaza grew by 8 % in the first 11 months of 2010 . Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations . There are a number of hotels in Gaza , including the Palestine , Grand Palace , Adam , al @-@ Amal , al @-@ Quds , Cliff , al @-@ Deira and <unk> House . All , except the Palestine Hotel , are located along in the coastal Rimal district . The United Nations ( UN ) has a beach club on the same street . Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists , and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists , aid workers , UN and Red Cross personnel . <unk> hotels include the al @-@ Quds and the al @-@ Deira Hotel . 
 In 2012 , unemployment dropped to 25 percent . 
 In November 2012 , a report by the Palestinian Chamber of Commerce called for the Gaza Strip to be recognized as an economic disaster area after it concluded that the Israeli Operation Pillar of Defense caused approximately $ 300 million in economic damage .

 The Rashad Shawa Cultural Center , located in Rimal , was completed in 1988 and named after its founder , former mayor Rashad al @-@ Shawa . A two @-@ story building with a triangular plan , the cultural centers performs three main functions : a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals , a place to stage exhibitions , and a library . The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza . It holds art exhibits , concerts , film screenings , and other activities . Whenever possible , French artists are invited to display their artwork , and more frequently , Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions . 
 Established in 1998 , the Arts and Crafts Village is a children 's cultural center with the objectives of promoting comprehensive , regular and periodic documentation of creative art in all of its forms . It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art , ceramics , graphics , carvings and others . Nearly 10 @,@ 000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village . 
 The Gaza Theater , financed by contributions from Norway , opened in 2004 . The theater does not receive much funding from the PNA , depending mostly on donations from foreign aid agencies . The <unk> Foundation , a Palestinian arts charity , runs several workshops in Gaza to develop young artistic talent and impart drama skills to teachers . The Gaza Theater Festival was inaugurated in 2005 . 
 The Gaza Museum of Archaeology , founded by Jawdat N. <unk> , opened in the summer of 2008 . The museum collection features thousands of items , including a statue of a full @-@ breasted Aphrodite in a diaphanous gown , images of other ancient deities and oil lamps featuring menorahs . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Gaza 's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies . Other major flavors and ingredients include dill , chard , garlic , cumin , lentils , chickpeas , pomegranates , sour plums and tamarind . Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking , which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork @-@ tender meat . Traditionally , most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages . Poverty has also played an important role in determining many of the city 's simple meatless dishes and stews , such as <unk> wa <unk> ( " chard and lentils " ) and <unk> ( skinless fava beans mashed with dried <unk> leaves and chilies ) . 
 Seafood is a key aspect of Gaza life and a local staple , Some well @-@ known seafood dishes include <unk> <unk> , literally , " shrimps in a clay pot " , and <unk> which are crabs stuffed with red hot chili pepper dip , then baked in the oven . Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro , garlic , chillies and cumin , and marinated with various spices . It is also a key ingredient in <unk> , rice cooked with caramelized onions , a generous amount of whole garlic cloves , large chunks of well @-@ marinated fried fish , and spices such as turmeric , cinnamon , and cumin . Many of the 1948 @-@ era refugees were fellahin ( " peasants " ) who ate seasonal foods . <unk> , popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round , is a mixture of sumac , tahina and water combined with chard , chunks of beef and chickpeas . The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds , chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls . <unk> is a wheat @-@ based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup . 
 Most Gaza restaurants are located in the Rimal district . Al @-@ Andalus , which specializes in fish and seafood , is popular with tourists , as are al @-@ <unk> and the upscale Roots Club . <unk> is a stylish restaurant near Gaza port run and staffed by deaf people with the goal of building a society that is more accepting of people with disabilities . 
 Throughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans , hummus , roasted sweet potatoes , falafel , and kebabs . <unk> ( <unk> ) serve Arabic coffee and tea . Gaza 's well @-@ known sweet shops , <unk> and Arafat , sell common Arab sweet products and are located off Wehda Street . Alcohol is a rarity , found only in the United Nations Beach Club . 
 = = = Costumes and embroidery = = = 
 <unk> is reputed to have originated in Gaza . Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal ( Ascalon ) . Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s . <unk> here had narrow , tight , straight sleeves . Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron . The most popular motifs included : scissors ( <unk> ) , combs ( <unk> ) and triangles ( hijab ) often arranged in clusters of fives , sevens and threes , as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye . 
 In recent decades , Hamas and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the hijab ( " headscarf " ) among Gazan women , especially urban and educated women , and the hijab styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity .

 = = Governance = = 
 Today , Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate . It contains the Palestinian Legislative Council building , as well as the headquarters of most of the Palestinian Authority ministries . 
 The first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa . Modern mayorship , however , began in 1906 with his son Said al @-@ Shawa , who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities . Al @-@ Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza 's first hospital , several new mosques and schools , the restoration of the Great Mosque , and the introduction of the modern plow to the city . In 1922 , British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine . However , it was rejected by the Palestinians . 
 On July 24 , 1994 , the PNA proclaimed Gaza the first city council in the Palestinian territories . The 2005 Palestinian municipal elections were not held in Gaza , nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah . Instead , Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities , towns , and villages to hold elections , assuming they would fare better in less urban areas . The rival Hamas party , however , won the majority of seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80 % . 2007 saw violent clashes between the two parties that left over 100 dead , ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city . 
 Normally , Palestinian municipalities with populations over 20 @,@ 000 and that serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members , including the mayor . The current municipal council of Gaza , however , consists of fourteen members , including the mayor , Rafiq Makki . Makki resigned in November 2013 , but was kept on as interim mayor until April 2014 . He was replaced by deputy mayor Nizar Hijazi . 
 = = Education = = 
 According to the PCBS , in 1997 , approximately over 90 % of Gaza 's population over the age of 10 was literate .

About 11 @,@ 134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas . 
 In 2006 , there were 210 schools in Gaza ; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority , 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , and 13 were private schools . A total of 154 @,@ 251 students were enrolled and 5 @,@ 877 teachers were employed . The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely . In September 2007 , a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed that there was a nearly 80 % failure rate in schools grades four to nine , with up to 90 % failure rates in mathematics . In January 2008 , the United Nations Children 's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption , such as information technology , science labs and extra curricular activities .

The library 's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries , provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources , and organizing various cultural programs such as , cultural events , seminars , lectures , film presentations , videos , art and book exhibitions . 
 = = Landmarks = = 
 Landmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City . Originally a pagan temple , it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines , then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs . The Crusaders transformed it into a church , but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza 's reconquest by the Muslims . It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip . 
 Other mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk @-@ era Sayed Hashem Mosque that believed to house the tomb of Hashem ibn Abd al @-@ Manaf in its dome . There is also the nearby Kateb al @-@ <unk> Mosque that dates back to 1334 . In Shuja 'iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque , which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402 , and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo <unk> al @-@ <unk> in 1455 . In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque , which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan , a holy man . 
 The Unknown Soldier 's Square , located in Rimal , is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War . In 1967 , the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand , until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway . Qasr al @-@ Basha , originally a Mamluk @-@ era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza , is located in the Old City and is today a girl 's school . The Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery , often referred to as the British War Cemetery , that contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I is 1 @.@ 5 km ( 1 mi ) northeast of the city center in the Tuffah district near Salah al @-@ Din Road .

 According to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics , 98 @.@ 1 % of Gaza 's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system . About 87 @.@ 6 % were connected to a public sewage system and 11 @.@ 8 % used a cesspit . The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city 's water supply . The six main wells for drinking water did not function , and roughly 50 % of the population had no water on a regular basis . The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through " salty wells " because of the unavailability of electricity . About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea , and untreated sewage bred insects and mice . As a " water @-@ poor " country , Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza . The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza 's main resource for obtaining quality water . However , the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem .

 In 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron . However , the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006 . Prior to power plant 's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation . The plant was rebuilt by December 2007 . In Jerusalem , electricity continued to be sold to Gaza according to news sources . Presently , Egypt is in talks to combine Gaza 's energy grid with its own . 
 = = = Solid waste management = = = 
 Solid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today . These challenges are attributed to several factors ; the lack of investment in environmental systems , less attention was given to environmental projects , and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management . One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments . 
 For instance , The scale of damage resulting from the Operation Protective Edge is unprecedented . All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment , naval shelling and artillery fire , resulting in a considerable amount of rubble . According to recent statistics , more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated . Approximately 10000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13 @-@ story residential buildings . A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza . Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge . More importantly , and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war , the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , dioxins , and furan compounds . 
 = = Health care = = 
 Al @-@ Shifa Hospital ( " the Cure " ) was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s . Housed in an army barracks , it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases . When Egypt administered Gaza , this original department was relocated and al @-@ Shifa became the city 's central hospital . When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis , Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al @-@ Shifa hospital expanded and improved . He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name . In 1957 , the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital . Today , al @-@ Shifa remains Gaza 's largest medical complex . 
 Throughout the late 1950s , a new health administration , Bandar Gaza ( " Gaza Region " ) , was established and headed by Haidar Abdel @-@ Shafi . Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential curative care . 
 The Ahli Arab Hospital , founded in 1907 by the Church Missionary Society ( CMS ) , was destroyed in World War I. It was rebuilt as the Southern Baptist Hospital in the 1950s . In 1982 , the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem took leadership and the original name was restored . Al @-@ Quds Hospital , located in the Tel al @-@ Hawa neighborhood and managed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society , is the second largest hospital in Gaza . 
 In 2007 , hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8 – 12 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply . According to the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89 @.@ 3 % in January 2007 to 64 @.@ 3 % in December 2007 . 
 In 2010 , a team of doctors from Al @-@ Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem . Upon their return to Gaza , a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al @-@ Durrah , although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah .

Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip , there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank . Except for private cars , Gaza City is served by taxis and buses . 
 The Yasser Arafat International Airport near Rafah opened in 1998 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) south of Gaza . Its runways and facilities were damaged by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2001 and 2002 , rendering the airport unusable . In August 2010 , the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials .

The sorority was founded on January 15 , 1908 , at Howard University in Washington , D.C. , by a group of twenty students , led by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle . Forming a sorority broke barriers for African @-@ American women in areas where little power or authority existed due to a lack of opportunities for minorities and women in the early 20th century . Alpha Kappa Alpha was incorporated on January 29 , 1913 . 
 Consisting of college @-@ educated women of many diverse backgrounds from around the world , including African , Caucasian , Asian , Native American , Hispanic and Indian descent , the sorority serves through a membership of more than 283 @,@ 000 women in 992 chapters in the United States and several other countries . Women may join through undergraduate chapters at a college or university or they may also join through a graduate chapter after acquiring an undergraduate or advanced college degree . 
 After the organization 's establishment , Alpha Kappa Alpha has helped to improve social and economic conditions through community service programs . Members have improved education through independent initiatives , contributed to community @-@ building by creating programs and associations , such as the Mississippi Health Clinic , and influenced federal legislation by Congressional lobbying through the National Non @-@ Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights . The sorority works with communities through service initiatives and progressive programs relating to education , family , health , and business . 
 Alpha Kappa Alpha is part of the National Pan @-@ Hellenic Council ( NPHC ) . The current International President is Dorothy <unk> Wilson , and the sorority 's document and pictorial archives are located at Moorland @-@ Spingarn Research Center .

 In spring 1907 , Ethel Hedgeman led efforts to create a sisterhood at Howard University . Howard faculty member <unk> Robinson encouraged Hedgeman by relating her own observances of sorority life at the Women 's College at Brown University , even though she was not a member of any sorority while a student at Brown . Hedgeman was also inspired by her mentors at Howard . To implement her idea , Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907 . 
 Eventually , nine women including Hedgeman were instrumental in organizing Alpha Kappa Alpha in the fall of 1907 . With Hedgeman serving as the temporary chairperson , the women wrote the sorority 's constitution , devised the motto , chose the favorite colors , and named the sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha . Later in 1908 , seven sophomore honor students expressed interest in joining and were accepted without initiation . The first initiation was held in a wing of Miner Hall on Howard University on February 11 , 1909 . On May 25 , 1909 , Alpha Kappa Alpha held its first " Ivy Week , " a celebration that included planting ivy at Miner Hall .

 Alpha Kappa Alpha continued to grow at Howard . By the end of the 1911 – 12 school year , there were more than twenty members of the sorority and the organization had become an influential part of student life at Howard . Following the annual celebration " Ivy Day " on Howard campus in Spring 1912 , founder and former Basileus Nellie Quander learned that several other newly initiated members of the sorority planned to change the colors , letters , and constitution of the sorority , and to make it more active outside Howard University . On January 13 , 1913 , the entire twenty @-@ two @-@ member undergraduate chapter voted to transform the original Alpha Kappa Alpha into Delta Sigma Theta . Quander actively worked to maintain the integrity and tenets of Alpha Kappa Alpha . She , along with the women who had become <unk> during the four years of the sorority 's existence who had since graduated , elected to remain Alpha Kappa Alpha . Quander set up a three @-@ person committee that successfully petitioned to incorporate ΑΚΑ as a perpetual entity . Alpha Kappa Alpha was nationally incorporated on January 29 , 1913 . 
 = = = Expansion and implementation of programs : 1913 – 1940 = = = 
 Alpha Kappa Alpha continued to grow nationally . A second chapter at the University of Chicago was chartered in fall 1913 . The sorority played an active role in voicing concerns of the day . The women , former members who started Delta Sigma Theta , participated in the 1913 Women 's Suffrage March . In addition , Alpha Kappa Alpha helped to support members by providing scholarship funds for school and foreign studies . Alpha Kappa Alpha began to unite members at the annual Boulé , the sorority 's governing body . The sorority 's pledge was written by Grace Edwards and was adopted by the 1920 Boulé . In addition , the sorority 's crest was designed by Phyllis Wheatley Waters and accepted in the same Boulé . A year later , at the 1921 Boulé , the Ivy Leaf was designated as " the official organ of Alpha Kappa Alpha , " and Founders ' Week , paying honor to <unk> 's founders was established . Pearls were first introduced to the sorority in the same year . The sorority membership pin was accepted in the following Boulé in Kansas City , Missouri . At the 1947 Boulé , pins for honorary members were designed and approved . 
 On May 10 , 1930 , Alpha Kappa Alpha , along with the fraternities Kappa Alpha Psi and Omega Psi Phi and sororities Delta Sigma Theta and Zeta Phi Beta , formed the National Pan @-@ Hellenic Council ( NPHC ) at Howard University . Currently consisting of nine predominately black fraternities and sororities , NPHC promotes interaction through forums , meetings , and other mediums for the exchange of information , and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various activities and functions . 
 Throughout the Great Migration , members assisted the Travelers Aid Society , to help thousands of Southern Blacks adjust to Northern society , find housing and navigate around the city . They also volunteered at the Freedman 's Hospital . 
 In April 1933 , during the Great Depression , International President Ida Jackson visited All Saints Industrial School in Lexington , Mississippi . She found difficult conditions in the Mississippi Delta . Some of the teachers did not have an education past the seventh grade . African Americans were trying to make a living sharecropping on plantation land as agricultural prices continued to fall . In summer 1934 , Ida Jackson initiated the Summer School for Rural Teachers to train future teachers . She worked with a total of 22 student teachers and 243 school children . In addition , she held night classes for 48 adults . By obtaining 2600 books for the school 's library , Jackson made it " the largest library owned by white or colored in all Holmes County . " 
 In summer 1938 , Ida Jackson focused on poverty and established a regional health clinic . She had acquired $ 1 @,@ 000 from the Boulé to fund the project in December 1935 . The clinic evolved into the Mississippi Health Project , with Dr. Dorothy Boulding Ferebee appointed as the director . 
 The Mississippi Health Project brought primary medical care to the rural Black population across the state for six summers . The program has been recognized as the first mobile health clinic in the United States , assisting approximately 15 @,@ 000 people in the Mississippi Delta . The project was noted for helping to decrease cases diphtheria and smallpox in the region and to improve nutritional and dental practices throughout rural Mississippi . 
 Led by incorporator Norma Elizabeth Boyd , the sorority created the National Non @-@ Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights ( NPC ) in 1938 , later renamed the National Non @-@ Partisan Council on Public Affairs . It was the first full @-@ time congressional lobby for minority group civil rights . Throughout the organization 's life , the Non @-@ Partisan Council worked with the NAACP , National Urban League , The United Office and Professional Workers of America , The National Association of Graduate Nurses , the American Federation of Churches , the Colored Women 's Club , the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Auxiliary , and the New York Voter 's League . The NPC was dissolved on July 15 , 1948 , by twelfth Supreme Basileus Edna Over Gray @-@ Campbell . A year later , Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first sorority to apply for life membership in the NAACP . 
 To replace the NPC , in August 1945 , Alpha Kappa Alpha established the American Council on Human Rights ( ACHR ) . The council made recommendations to the government concerning civil rights legislation . The ACHR was proposed at the 1946 Boulé . In October 1946 , Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first sorority to obtain observer status at the United Nations . On January 25 , 1948 , Delta Sigma Theta , Zeta Phi Beta , Sigma Gamma Rho sororities and Alpha Phi Alpha and Phi Beta Sigma fraternities were charter members of the ACHR . Kappa Alpha Psi later was included in March 1949 . 
 On September 1 , 1945 , Alpha Kappa Alpha established The National Health Office in New York City . The National Health Office coordinated activities with local chapters and worked with the <unk> to promote health initiatives before Congress , increase the number of student nurses , and improve the state of health programs at historically Black Colleges and Universities . The National Health Office was dissolved in 1951 , as its goals were incorporated into the sorority 's international program . 
 = = = Civil rights and educational training : 1950 – 1970 = = = 
 Throughout the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s , members helped to sponsor job training , reading enrichment , heritage and youth programs . By encouraging youth to improve math , science , and reading skills , the sorority continued a legacy of community service and pledged to enrich the lives of others . Financially , Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and trademark of a fashion show called <unk> . Politically , ACHR continued lobbying for equality concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s . According to Collier @-@ Thomas , the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education , transportation , employment , and improving equality in the armed forces and public places . The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954 's Brown v. Board of Education . However , as a whole , ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963 . 
 Alpha Kappa Alpha contributed programs for inner city youth by capitalizing on political gains in the White House . On August 20 , 1964 , President Lyndon Johnson signed the Economic Opportunity Act , which allowed the creation of the Job Corps . The sorority wanted to operate a job training center for students . Led by president Julia Purnell , <unk> negotiated with the Office of Economic Opportunity to operate a women 's center from October 1964 to January 1965 . Alpha Kappa Alpha was awarded a US $ 4 million grant to operate the Cleveland Job Corps on February 12 , 1965 , becoming the first sorority to operate a federal job training center . Beginning in 1965 , the Cleveland Job Corps trained female high school dropouts , aged 16 to 21 , with job and educational skills . In 1976 , the Cleveland Job Corps accepted males . The sorority operated the Cleveland Job Corps until 1995 . 
 The sorority educated the community through highlighting the accomplishments of notable individuals by publishing The Heritage Series between 1968 and 1972 . These pamphlets were a series of biographies of top African @-@ American women . Altogether , the entire collection contained " Women in the Judiciary , " " Women in Politics , " " Women in Medicine , " " Women in Business , " and " Women in Dentistry . " Alpha Kappa Alpha also donated $ 20 @,@ 000 for preserving Martin Luther King , Jr . ' s birthplace in Atlanta , Georgia , in the early 1970s . In 1978 , during the sorority 's seventieth anniversary , the Memorial Window at Howard University was dedicated to the founders of Alpha Kappa Alpha . Surviving founders Lavinia Norman and Norma Boyd attended the celebration of unveiling the Memorial Window , designed by Lois <unk> Jones .

 Soon after the sorority 's 75th anniversary , Alpha Kappa Alpha contributed funds to decrease Africa 's poverty with the establishment of African Village Development Program ( <unk> ) . As a conjoint program with <unk> , the sorority sought to decrease poverty in African villages . In collaboration with the International Foundation for Education and Self @-@ Help ( <unk> ) , the sorority built ten schools in South Africa after apartheid ended , and it donated computer technology to the region . 
 Throughout the 1990s , the sorority continued to provide after @-@ school mentoring programs , such as ON TRACK . ON TRACK , an acronym which stands for " Organizing , <unk> , Team building , Respecting , Achieving , Counseling and Knowing , " was designed to help the progress of 20 @,@ 000 third graders who were at @-@ risk of failing their education . Sponsored by Daimler Chrysler , ON TRACK was designated to " improve communication , academics , physical and emotional health , peer leadership , etiquette , and interpersonal relationships . " In addition , programs such as the Ivy Reading AKAdemy and Young Authors Program improved elementary reading comprehension skills , while <unk> highlighted programs in math and science . 
 The sorority responded to the call for help in fall 2005 after Hurricane Katrina , by raising money for a disaster relief fund . In July 2007 , through Habitat for Humanity , the sorority helped build a house in New Orleans for a family that survived Hurricane Katrina . 
 In addition to educational programs , Alpha Kappa Alpha contributed to drawing awareness to health @-@ related issues , such as AIDS , sickle cell anemia , breast cancer , and the importance of staying in shape . Recently , the sorority has supported the efforts of justice for the Jena Six . Also , the sorority connects to the past by partnering with African Ancestry . Sorority members may use African Ancestry 's DNA testing to find genealogical data for themselves and their families . The purpose of the partnership is to help members trace family connections through the world as well as in Africa , to embrace African @-@ American culture and the larger community . 
 = = = Centennial celebration : 2008 = = = 
 Alpha Kappa Alpha celebrated its centenary with a year @-@ long commemoration in 2008 . The celebration coincided with the sorority 's biennial Boulé . Internationally , some Alpha Kappa Alpha members began marking the festivities by making a pilgrimage to Howard University from January 12 to January 15 , 2008 . The activities included sorority members financially donating $ 1 million in scholarship funds to Howard University , contributing libraries for Middle School for Mathematics and Science and Asbury Dwelling for Senior Citizens , and unveiling a digital version of the entire Ivy Leaf publication . In addition , sorority undergraduate and graduate members who were not available to attend ceremonies in Washington , D.C. , held celebrations in local cities . On July 11 to July 18 , 2008 , Alpha Kappa Alpha held their 63rd Boulé .

 On June 20 , 2009 , eight Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority members filed a complaint in D.C. Superior Court demanding that International President Barbara McKinzie be fired for improper use of sorority funds and the money be returned to the sorority . The lawsuit claimed that Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority , Incorporated 's Executive Board approved the spending of substantial amounts on McKinzie 's costs of living , including commissioning an expensive wax model of McKinzie . In response , McKinzie denied the allegations , describing them as " without merit . " The memberships of the eight <unk> who filed the complaint were revoked by the sorority but later forced to be reinstated by a judge . 
 In February 2010 , the Superior Court of the District of Columbia dismissed the lawsuit . On August 18 , 2011 , the District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed the previous decision . 
 On March 22 , 2012 , a forensic audit of Alpha Kappa Alpha 's 2010 financial records revealed troubling concerns with past president , Barbara McKinzie 's development and access to a " secret " bank account . The audit of the sorority led to findings that supported the claims in the previous lawsuit . The audit also found two former officials continued to use sorority credit cards after their service ended , failing to appropriately document charges . Another lawsuit against the organization , the former president McKinzie and other officials contained similar allegations . The audit found that McKinzie and the other officials secretly created a second set of financial books to get around the sorority 's accounting policies . According to the audit , " ( n ) early $ 1 @.@ 7 million in payments were made to the former president , Barbara McKinzie , without authorization . Approximately $ 282 @,@ 000 in credit card charges on a second set of books appear to be fraudulent , including personal charges the sorority wasn 't reimbursed for . " 
 Also the sorority 's tax returns were audited by the Internal Revenue Service . The audit was expected to be concluded sometime in January 2012 .

 On September 9 , 2002 , pledges Kristin High ( 22 years old mother of one ) and <unk> <unk> ( 24 years old ) from California State University – Los Angeles ( <unk> ) , were pronounced dead as a result of an illegal pledging ritual . The women were instructed by members of Alpha Kappa Alpha to perform a series of activities blindfolded on Dockweiler State Beach when a high tide came and eventually drowned both of them . The next day when sorority members brought Kristin 's car and cellphone to her mother , she noticed Kristin 's pledge journal suddenly missing and numbers deleted from her cellphone . Prior to Kristin 's death , Kristin 's mother encouraged her to fully disassociate herself from the sorority after Kristin discussed the <unk> behaviors displayed by members of AKA such as disrespecting pledges and forcing them to run late night errands for AKA members . A year after the tragic incident , the families of the deceased settled with Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated after filing a $ 100 million wrongful death lawsuit . The sorority initially denied having an active chapter at <unk> in an effort to deny responsibility for the deaths but the court dismissed their claim and held the whole sorority accountable .

 Two Howard University seniors filed a lawsuit against Alpha Kappa Alpha Incorporated in 2013 . The women accused the sorority of barring them from membership through the most prestigious chapter of the sorority , Alpha Chapter , despite being " legacies " ( their mothers were members of the sorority ) and in retaliation for reporting illegal hazing . The mothers eventually had their AKA membership revoked for supporting their daughters in the litigation process against the sorority . In the lawsuit , the women stated that as prospective members of the Alpha Chapter they were verbally abused by women of the sorority , could not wear sorority colors or any colors that could be blended into pink or green , they could not wear pearls , they were forced to run errands and buy items for sorority members , they could not socialize with their non @-@ AKA friends , they were often humiliated in front of other students , they could not eat at a popular lunch spot on campus , they could not use the same doors as sorority members , and at one point they had to call their " big sisters " daily or suffer some type of consequence .

 Pombo Musical is a children 's album produced by Colombian recording artist Carlos Vives , as a musical tribute to the Colombian writer and poet Rafael Pombo . It was released on August 13 , 2008 , under Vives ' label <unk> Música Local . The album came into fruition when Rafael Pombo Foundation president Juanita Santos asked Vives to craft a musical that uses Pombo 's most iconic poems and fables he created . Its music incorporates a variety of Colombian folk genres and mixes in contemporary genres like Latin pop and pop rock . Among the 14 tracks present in the album , only one was released as a single , " El Modelo Alfabético " ( English : The Model Alphabetical ) . All the lyrics were written originally by Rafael Pombo , and produced by Vives . Pombo Musical was well @-@ received , and was certified platinum in Columbia by the Asociación Colombiana de Productores de Fonogramas ( <unk> ) . It also won some accolades , including a Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Children 's Album , and a Premio Shock for Best Compilation .

 After finishing the promotion of his previous studio album El Rock de Mi Pueblo ( 2004 ) , Vives ended his music contract with EMI Latin and took a hiatus , for concentrating on supporting local artists as a producer and songwriter . He then met Juanita Santos , the president of Rafael Pombo Foundation , who asked them to present a proposal for a musical that uses the most iconic poems and fables created by Pombo . Motivated by this , they began to study many books about Pombo and his works . The creation of Pombo Musical began as a studio project in house between old friends , Carlos Ivan Medina , Carlos Huertas and Ernesto " <unk> " Ocampo . He stated : " Before we worked musically on some of Rafael Pombo 's works , without thinking about making a record , but because somebody had done a melody of Rin Rin " .

 = Hurricane Anna ( 1961 ) = 
 Hurricane Anna impacted Central America and the Windward Islands in July 1961 . The first tropical cyclone and first hurricane of the hurricane season , Anna developed on July 20 from an easterly wave located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) over the Windward Islands . Initially a tropical storm , it moved westward across the Caribbean Sea . Favorable environmental conditions allowed Anna to reach hurricane intensity late on July 20 . Early on the following day , the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Intensification continued , and later on July 21 , Anna became a major hurricane , upon reaching Category 3 intensity . After attaining peak intensity on July 22 , the hurricane slightly weakened while brushing the northern coast of Honduras . Further weakening occurred ; when Anna made landfall in landfall in Belize ( then known as British Honduras ) on July 24 , winds decreased to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Anna rapidly weakened over land and dissipated later that day . 
 As a developing tropical cyclone over the Leeward Islands , Anna produced strong winds over Grenada , though damage was limited to some crops , trees , and telephone poles . Other islands experienced gusty winds , but no damage . Passing just north of Venezuela , the hurricane produced strong winds over the country , peaking as high as 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) . Strong winds caused widespread damage in northern Honduras . Throughout the country , at least 36 homes were destroyed and 228 were damaged . Severe damage in the Gracias a Dios Department left hundreds of people homeless . Additionally , high winds toppled approximately 5 @,@ 000 coconut trees . Overall , Anna caused a fatality and $ 300 @,@ 000 in damage ( 1961 USD ) , primarily in Central America . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Anna were likely from an easterly wave located over Africa . On July 16 , Television Infrared Observation Satellite ( TIROS ) imagery showed a cloud mass situated about 1 @,@ 020 miles ( 1 @,@ 640 km ) west @-@ southwest of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde . The existence of an easterly wave was not confirmed by United States Navy reconnaissance aircraft and ship reports until the following day , at which time the system was located over 445 miles ( 715 km ) east of Antigua . Although no circulation existed while the wave approached the Windward Islands , significant amounts of deep convection was associated with the system and located near the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) . Early on July 20 , ship reports indicated a developing circulation between Grenada and Trinidad ; squalls on the former island produced wind gusts as strong as 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . According to HURDAT – the North Atlantic hurricane database – the system developed into Tropical Storm Anna at 0000 UTC on July 20 , as confirmed by a reconnaissance aircraft flight . 
 Situated about 25 miles ( 40 km ) east @-@ northeast of Tobago with an initial wind speed of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , Anna immediately began to strengthen while moving slightly north of due west . The first advisory on Anna , issued at 1330 UTC on July 20 , reported sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Later that day , the storm was upgraded to a hurricane after a reconnaissance aircraft reported hurricane @-@ force winds . Anna then deepened more steadily , becoming a Category 2 hurricane early on July 21 . Later that day , the storm became a major hurricane by 1800 UTC , after reaching Category 3 hurricane intensity . At 1200 UTC on July 22 , Anna attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 976 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) . Early on July 23 , Anna weakened to a Category 2 hurricane while beginning to brush the northern coast of Honduras . Weakening continued , and by early on July 24 , the storm deteriorated to a Category 1 hurricane . Around 1200 UTC , Anna made landfall in a rural area of Stann Creek District , Belize with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Late on July 24 , the system weakened to a tropical storm and then dissipated . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The United States Weather Bureau issued tropical cyclone watches and warnings for Venezuela , Curaçao , Bonaire and Aruba . In Jamaica , meteorologists forecast that the storm would bypass the island to the south without causing any effects . As Anna continued westward , it was predicted to make landfall in either northern Nicaragua or southeastern Honduras . Residents in those countries were advised to take precautions ahead of the storm . Central Americans residing along Gulf of Honduras were also warned about 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) tides and strong winds . As the storm neared Honduras , small boats and other water craft were advised to remain in port . Additionally , a hurricane watch was posted for the Swan Islands . In Belize , the threat of the storm forced 100 residents to evacuate their homes , while numerous businesses were closed down . At Belize Harbor , many ships and boats were moved upstream inland . The hurricane was also forecast to bring heavy rainfall to the mountainous areas of Belize , causing a concern for flash flooding . Additionally , Belize 's Church Welfare Service began to ship clothing and other materials in anticipation of the hurricane .

 In Grenada , Anna produced wind gusts of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Damage from the storm 's impact on Grenada was limited to banana crops , trees , and telephone poles . Winds were light on Barbados and Saint Lucia , reaching only 29 mph ( 47 km / h ) on both islands . Damage on Trinidad was minor . In northern Venezuela and the ABC Islands , the storm produced winds of 50 – 70 mph ( 80 – 113 km / h ) in Curaçao , Los Hermanos and La <unk> ; A weather station in Aruba reported winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . 
 In Honduras , damage from Anna was moderate and limited to the Atlantic coast . A weather station in Tela recorded rainfall of 0 @.@ 29 – 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 7 @.@ 3 – 25 @.@ 4 mm ) over a two @-@ day period , and another station in Puerto Cortés measured 2 inches ( 51 mm ) .

Serious damage also occurred in Gracias a Dios Department , where hundreds of people were left homeless . On the Bay Islands , nine houses were demolished and thirteen suffered damage . High winds toppled about 5 @,@ 000 coconut trees on Útila . Damage from Anna in Honduras amounted to $ 300 @,@ 000 . The hurricane killed one person and injured 12 others , and victims required food and medical aid in Anna 's wake . In Belize , Anna produced waves 7 – 10 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 – 3 m ) and gusty winds . Though unspecific , there were reports of considerable damage in the country .

 " Flashes Before Your Eyes " is the 8th episode of the third season of the American drama television series Lost , and the show 's 57th episode overall . The episode was written by the series co @-@ creator , show runner and executive producer Damon Lindelof and supervising producer Drew Goddard , and directed by Jack Bender . It first aired in the United States on February 14 , 2007 , on the American Broadcasting Company . The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . Lindelof and Goddard were nominated for the Writers Guild of America ( WGA ) Award for Best Episodic Drama at the February 2008 ceremony for writing the episode . 
 In this episode , Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) and Charlie Pace ( Dominic Monaghan ) conclude that Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) can see into the future after he saves Claire Littleton ( Emilie de Ravin ) from drowning . It is revealed that after the hatch imploded , Desmond traveled back to London and relived his past before coming back to the island . Desmond also reveals to Charlie that Charlie is destined to die . 
 = = Plot = = 
 While in the middle of a conversation with several other castaways , Desmond , without warning , sprints toward and dives into the ocean . No one on the beach understands what Desmond is doing , until he returns with a nearly drowned Claire . Charlie and Hurley conclude that Desmond must be able to see into the future , and they hatch a plan to get Desmond to get drunk and confess . After several drinks , Charlie asks Desmond about his future @-@ seeing abilities . Instead of answering , Desmond gets up to leave , but after Charlie calls him a " coward " , a drunken Desmond tackles and chokes Charlie , shouting that Charlie does not know what he has been through . 
 Desmond flashbacks : the hatch is shown imploding again , and then Desmond ( who was inside ) suddenly wakes up in a London apartment with his girlfriend Penelope Widmore ( Sonya Walger ) . Desmond is clearly puzzled , but is relieved to finally be with Penny again . Desmond later goes to Penny 's billionaire father , Charles Widmore ( Alan Dale ) and asks for his permission to marry his daughter . Widmore rejects Desmond , who is crushed and humiliated . Walking out of the building , Desmond sees Charlie singing and playing his guitar for money on the sidewalk . Desmond asks him if he remembers him but Charlie does not . Frustrated , Desmond rants about his time on the island and predicts it will rain , which it suddenly does . At a pub , Desmond meets with his friend , a physicist , and after retelling the events on the island asks him if time travel is possible . Desmond tries to predict more events but they do not happen and his friend assures him time travel is impossible . While shopping for a ring for Penny , Desmond runs into the shopkeeper , Eloise Hawking ( Fionnula Flanagan ) . Hawking takes Desmond on a walk where they see a man crushed to death by falling scaffolding . She explains that although she knew the man would die , she did not help because the universe has a way of " course correcting " , and he would die anyway . Desmond and Penny go on a walk together and take a picture , where he breaks up with her after realizing that he does not have enough money to support her . He returns to the pub , where one of his predictions before about the bartender being attacked finally comes true ( proving that he really knew about the future , but that his timing was off ) , but he ends up being accidentally hit himself and is knocked out . Desmond wakes up back on the Island , completely naked , as seen in " Further Instructions " . 
 The flashback ends , and Desmond is pulled off Charlie by Hurley . They help Desmond to his tent . Charlie tries to get an answer from him one last time . Desmond reveals that both times he rescued Claire , he was really saving Charlie ; Charlie would have been electrocuted , and Charlie would have drowned attempting to save Claire from the ocean . Desmond tells Charlie that although he has prevented his death twice , Charlie is destined to die .

 " Flashes Before Your Eyes " was the 15th episode of the series directed by Jack Bender . The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Drew Goddard ; the pair had never before collaborated on an episode . 
 This episode is the first to deal with the concept of time travel , the next being " The Constant " in the fourth season . Unlike other flashback sequences to this point , this is positioned as actual time travel for Desmond . However , in this episode ground rules are established to prevent paradoxes in the story line as a result of time travel . Had these rules not been established , the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened . In an interview , Henry Ian Cusick , who plays Desmond , said shooting the episode was both " fun " and " tiring " . Cusick said that when shooting the episode " you 're finishing late and starting early " , but he enjoyed working with director Jack Bender because " he pushes you to , to try and go a little bit further than you think you can " . The London scenes were shot in Honolulu . This led to several continuity errors , such as a British Army recruitment poster for a Scottish regiment ( which would not recruit in England ) featuring the word " Honour " being incorrectly spelled in the American English " Honor " and a photograph of a British soldier using an American M4 carbine and urging people to join the " military " ( instead of the " army " , as a British poster would say ) .

 = Adi Da = 
 Adi Da Samraj , born Franklin Albert Jones ( November 3 , 1939 – November 27 , 2008 ) , was an American spiritual teacher , writer and artist . He was the founder of a new religious movement known as Adidam . He changed his name numerous times throughout his life ; these names included Bubba Free John , Da Free John , Da Love @-@ Ananda , Da Kalki , Da <unk> and Da <unk> , among others . From 1991 until his death , he was known as Adi Da Love @-@ Ananda Samraj or Adi Da . 
 Adi Da initially became known in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks , and for the activities of his religious community . His philosophy was essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life . Distinguishing his from other religious traditions , Adi Da declared that he was a uniquely historic avatar ( incarnation of a god or divinity in human form ) . As such , Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else . 
 Adi Da wrote many books about his spiritual philosophy and related matters , founding a publishing house to print them . He gained praise from authorities in spirituality and philosophy , but was also criticized for what were perceived as his isolation , controversial behavior , claims toward exclusive realization , and cult @-@ like community . 
 In the mid @-@ 1980s , allegations by former followers of false imprisonment , brainwashing , sexual abuse , assault and involuntary servitude received international media attention . These allegations resulted in lawsuits or threatened suits on both sides 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Youth ( 1939 – 70 ) = = = 
 Adi Da was born Franklin Albert Jones on November 3 , 1939 , in Queens , New York and raised on Long Island . His father was a salesman and his mother a housewife . A sister , Joanne , was born when he was eight years old . He served as an acolyte in the Lutheran church during his adolescence and aspired to be a minister , though after leaving for college in the autumn of 1957 he expressed doubts about the religion to his Lutheran pastor . He graduated in 1961 with a bachelor 's degree in philosophy from Columbia University and went on to complete a master 's degree in English literature at Stanford University in 1963 . 
 After graduating from Columbia , Adi Da began using a variety of hallucinogenic and other drugs , sometimes heavily . In 1963 , after finishing at Stanford , for 6 weeks he was a paid test subject in drug trials of mescaline , LSD , and psilocybin that were conducted at a Veterans Administration hospital in California . He wrote later that he found these experiences " self @-@ validating " in that they mimicked ecstatic states of consciousness from his childhood , but problematic as they often resulted in paranoia , anxiety , or disassociation . For over a year , Adi Da lived with his girlfriend Nina Davis in the hills of Palo Alto . While she worked to support them , he wrote , took drugs , meditated informally , and studied books on hermeticism in order to make sense of his experiences . 
 Responding to an intuitive impulse , they left California in June 1964 in search of a spiritual teacher in New York City . Settling in Greenwich Village , Adi Da became a student of Albert Rudolph , also known as " Rudi " , an oriental art dealer and self @-@ styled spiritual guru . Having studied a number of spiritual traditions , including " The Work " of G.I. Gurdjieff and Subud , Rudolph was then a follower of Siddha Yoga founder Swami Muktananda , who gave Rudi the name " Swami <unk> " . Rudi taught an eclectic blend of techniques he called " kundalini yoga " ( having no literal relationship to the Indian tradition by that name . ) 
 Adi Da 's father told Rudi of his son 's onetime aspiration to become a Lutheran minister . Feeling that he needed better grounding , in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina , find steady employment , lose weight , end his drug use , and begin preparatory studies to enter the seminary . As a student at Philadelphia 's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967 , Adi Da described undergoing a terrifying breakdown . Taken to a hospital emergency room , a psychiatrist diagnosed it as an anxiety attack . It was the first in a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life , each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights . Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience , Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir 's Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tuckahoe , New York . Disillusioned , he moved back to New York City and got a job working for Pan American Airlines , in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda 's ashram in India . He did so for four days in April 1968 . Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly . 
 Back in New York , Adi Da and wife Nina became members and then employees of the Church of Scientology . Following Scientology protocol , he wrote Rudi a letter severing all contact . After a little more than a year of involvement , Adi Da left Scientology . He then returned to India for a month @-@ long visit in early 1969 , during which Swami Muktananda authorized him to initiate others into Siddha Yoga . 
 In May 1970 , Adi Da , Nina , and a friend from Scientology named Pat Morley gave away their belongings and traveled to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda 's ashram . However , Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there , especially by the numbers of other Americans who had arrived since his previous visit . Three weeks after arriving , Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary ( that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power , or shakti ) directed him to make a pilgrimage to Christian holy sites . After two weeks in Europe and the middle east , all three returned to New York before moving to Los Angeles in August .

 In September 1970 , Adi Da said that while sitting in the Vedanta Society Temple in Hollywood , he permanently realized " The Bright " , his term for a state of complete spiritual enlightenment . He wrote an autobiography titled The Knee of Listening , which was published in 1972 . In it , Adi Da wrote that he had uniquely been born with full awareness of " the Bright , " but this knowledge became obscured in childhood . His subsequent spiritual journey was a quest to recapture this awareness , and share it with others . 
 In October 1970 , Swami Muktananda stopped in California on a worldwide tour largely underwritten by Rudi . Adi Da visited him and related his experience the previous month of " The Bright . " Adi Da felt that the swami did not understand or properly acknowledge the full importance of his experience . During the visit Adi Da reconciled with Rudi . 
 With fellow former Scientology employee Sal Lucania as financier , Adi Da opened Ashram Books ( later Dawn Horse Books ) , a spirituality bookshop in Los Angeles . He began giving lectures there based on his autobiography , soon attracting a small following due in part to his charismatic speaking style . He taught in a traditional Indian style , lecturing from a raised dais surrounded by flowers and oriental carpets , with listeners seated on the floor . He incorporated many ideas from the Kashmir Shaivite and Advaita Vedanta schools of Hinduism , but also expressed original insights and opinions about both spirituality and secular culture . He was one of the first westerners to become well known as a teacher of meditation and eastern esoteric traditions at a time when these were of growing interest . Some early participants stated that Adi Da demonstrated an ability to produce alterations in their consciousness , likening the effect to <unk> of Indian yoga traditions . 
 With an increasing number of followers , Adi Da founded a new religious movement called " The Dawn Horse Communion " . In 1973 , he traveled to India to meet a final time with Swami Muktananda in hopes of being recognized as a " <unk> " , or fully enlightened sage . They disagreed on a series of questions Adi Da had prepared . This effectively ended their relationship , and they went on to later disparage each other 's relative level of spiritual accomplishment . Adi Da nevertheless stated that he continued to appreciate and respect Muktananda as his onetime teacher . 
 Upon returning to Los Angeles , Adi Da ( then Franklin Jones ) directed his students that he should now be addressed as " Bubba Free John , " based on a nickname meaning " friend " combined with a rendering of " Franklin Jones " . He divorced Nina , although she remained a follower . In January 1974 , Adi Da told his followers that he was " the divine lord in human form " . Later that year , the church obtained an aging hot springs resort in Lake County , California , renaming it " Persimmon " ( it is now known as " The Mountain of Attention " ) . Adi Da and a group of selected followers moved there and experimented in communal living . Most followers relocated from Los Angeles to San Francisco , where Dawn Horse Books also moved . 
 Adi Da often changed his name , saying it reflected differences or changes in the nature of his message and relationship to followers . In 1979 , he changed his name from " Bubba Free John " to " Da Free John " . Subsequent names included Da Love @-@ Ananda , Dau <unk> , Da Kalki , <unk> @-@ Samartha Sat @-@ Guru Da , <unk> Da , Da <unk> , Da <unk> , and from 1994 , Adi Da Love @-@ Ananda Samraj , or Adi Da . Adi Da translated the Sanskrit syllable Da as " giver . " 
 = = = " Crazy Wisdom " ( 1973 – 84 ) = = = 
 In 1973 , Adi Da began to use more unconventional means of instruction he called " crazy wisdom " , likening his methods to a tradition of yogic adepts who employed seemingly un @-@ spiritual methods to awaken observer 's consciousness . Some followers reported having profound metaphysical experiences in Adi Da 's presence , attributing these phenomena to his spiritual power . Others present remained skeptical , witnessing nothing supernatural . 
 Adi Da initiated a period of teachings and activities that came to be known as the " Garbage and the Goddess " . He directed his followers in " sexual theater " , a form of psychodrama that often involved public and group sex , the making of pornographic movies , and other intensified sexual practices . Drug and alcohol use were often encouraged , and earlier proscriptions against meat and " junk food " were no longer adhered to . 
 Adi Da said that this behavior was part of a radical overturning of all conventional moral values and social contracts in order to help shock students into insights regarding habitual patterns and emotional attachments so that they could more completely surrender to him and the community . Conventional marriage received Adi Da 's particular criticism , and many couples were forced to split up or switch partners . Adi Da himself had nine or more polygamous partners during this time that he called his " wives " , including Playboy centerfold Julie Anderson , aka " Whitney Kaine " who had entered the community as a follower 's girlfriend . He likewise recommended polygamy or polyamory to some followers . 
 Adi Da published his fourth book , titled " Garbage and the Goddess : The Last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John . " It documented the relatively unexpurgated lectures and activities of this period . It quickly sold out its first print run , and a second was sent to bookstores . However , due to the controversial nature of its contents , all available copies were quickly retrieved and ritually burned at Adi Da 's behest . 
 In 1983 , Adi Da moved with a group of about 40 followers to the Fijian island of <unk> , purchased by a wealthy follower from the actor Raymond Burr . It was his primary residence until the end of his life . 
 = = = Public controversy ( 1985 – 86 ) = = = 
 Accusations of Adi Da abusing his power as a spiritual leader attracted international attention in 1985 . Adi Da and Adidam ( then known as Da Free John and The Johannine <unk> Communion ) were subjects of almost daily coverage in the San Francisco Chronicle , San Francisco Examiner , Mill Valley Record , other newspapers , and regional television news and talk shows over several weeks early in the year . The story gained national attention with a two @-@ part exposé on The Today Show that aired May 9 and 10 . 
 In investigative reports and dozens of interviews , both named and anonymous ex @-@ members made numerous specific allegations of Adi Da forcing members to engage in psychologically , sexually , and physically abusive and humiliating behavior , as well as accusing the church of committing tax fraud . Others stated that they never witnessed or were involved in any such activities . 
 Adi Da and his organization were sued by Beverly O 'Mahoney , then wife of the Adidam president , for fraud , intentional infliction of emotional distress , false imprisonment , and assault and battery ( among other things ) ; the suit sought $ 5 million in damages . To a local reporter , Adidam threatened to file its own lawsuit against O 'Mahoney , as well as five others who had been named in stories and interviews making allegations of abuse ( no suit was ever filed ) . Adidam charged that allegations against the church were part of an extortion plot . 
 The church issued conflicting statements in response to the coverage . A lawyer for the church said that controversial sexual activities had only occurred during the " Garbage and Goddess " period years earlier . Shortly after , an official church spokesman said that " tantra @-@ style encounters " of the kind described in allegations were still occurring , but were mostly confined to an inner circle . This confirmed the stories by former members that such activities had continued up to the time of the lawsuits and interviews , but had been kept hidden . The church said that no illegal acts had taken place and that the movement had a right to continue experiments in lifestyles . 
 Two lawsuits were filed against Adi Da and the church in California in 1985 . The O 'Mahoney suit was dismissed the next year . The other lawsuit and several threatened suits in subsequent years were settled with payments and confidentiality agreements , negatively impacting member morale and bleeding the organization financially . 
 = = = " Divine Emergence " and final years ( 1986 – 2008 ) = = = 
 On January 11 , 1986 , distressed by what he felt was the futility of his work , Adi Da experienced a physical and psychological crisis . Doctors diagnosed exhaustion and stress , but he afterward described it as a death and resurrection . As in previous and subsequent similar episodes , Adi Da attributed special significance to it , calling it his " Divine Emergence " . From this point on , he said that one needed only to meditate on his image or body in order to " participate in his enlightened state " . 
 Adi Da had predicted that by the year 2000 he would be recognized by the entire world for his unique spiritual realization . When this failed to occur , he experienced another breakdown . This was said to initiate another period , where Adi Da would shift from " active teaching " to silent “ spiritual blessing " to counteract negative forces in the world . He nonetheless continued to write books , make art , and give talks to his followers , but with an increased emphasis on what he called " silent darshan " . 
 In 2000 , some followers of spiritual teacher Frederick Lenz joined Adidam , reportedly upsetting long @-@ time followers who felt the new members were undeservedly privileged ( Lenz , also known as " Zen Master Rama " , had committed suicide in 1998 ) . Adi Da claimed to have been Swami Vivekananda in a past life , and said that in a previous incarnation Lenz was then a disciple . 
 Adi Da later began exhibiting his digital art and photography . Followers reported that he died of cardiac arrest on November 27 , 2008 at his home in Fiji , while working on his art . 
 Adi Da had four children : three biological daughters with three different women , and one adopted daughter . These include actress Shawnee Free Jones . 
 = = Philosophy = = 
 Fundamental to Adi Da 's religious philosophy is the essentially " eastern " religious concept that the purpose of human life is spiritual enlightenment , an awakening to ultimate reality that is the natural state of all human beings ( though seemingly obscured . ) 
 = = = " Self @-@ contraction " = = = 
 Adi Da said that what keeps human beings from experiencing this ultimate , enlightened reality is the activity of ego , which he stated is the source of all emotional , psychological , and spiritual dissatisfaction . He called this activity " self @-@ contraction , " and defined it as a psychological mechanism lying somewhere beneath the normal level of conscious awareness , leading people to believe they are limited , suffering individuals . He said that fundamentally , all efforts to unite with the divine from the point of view of a separate self were futile , since that separate self itself is illusory . 
 = = = " Seventh stage realization " = = = 
 Adi Da developed a map of potential human and spiritual evolution that he called " the seven stages of life " . 
 First Stage — " individuation / physical development " 
 Second Stage — " socialization " 
 Third Stage — " integration / mental development " 
 Fourth Stage — " <unk> / Divine Communion " 
 Fifth Stage — " spiritual ascent " 
 Sixth Stage — " abiding in consciousness " 
 Seventh Stage — " Divine Enlightenment : awakening from all <unk> limitations " 
 The first six stages account for all permutations of religion and culture throughout history , as well as levels of personal development . Adi Da categorized the fourth , fifth , and sixth stages of life as the highest respective stages of human development . He characterized those who have reached these stages as " saints " , " yogis " , and " sages " , including other religious figures such as Gautama Buddha and Jesus Christ . 
 Relative to this spectrum , Adi Da stated that while some " yogis , saints , and sages " had occasionally indicated some awareness of a " seventh stage " , only he as a unique avatar had ever been born fully invested with the capability to fully embody it ; furthermore , as the first " Seventh Stage Adept " only he would ever need to ( or be capable of ) doing so . He stated that the seventh stage has nothing to do with development and does not come after the sixth stage in a sequential manner . The culminating awareness of this seventh stage is a permanent , natural state of “ open @-@ eyed ecstasy " , for which Adi Da employed the Sanskrit term <unk> Nirvikalpa Samadhi . 
 Adi Da insisted that since he solely embodied seventh stage realization , devotional worship of him would henceforth be the exclusive means for others to free themselves from " self @-@ contraction " , thereby allowing them to " participate in his enlightened state " ( i.e. attain awareness themselves of the seventh stage , or " realize " it . ) 
 = = Adidam = = 
 Adidam refers to both the organization of Adi Da 's devotees and the religion he taught . The organization , or church , founded initially in 1972 , went by many earlier names , including the Dawn Horse Communion , the Free Communion Church , the Laughing Man Institute , the Crazy Wisdom Fellowship , the Way of Divine Ignorance , and the Johannine <unk> Communion . 
 Adidam presupposes an eastern view of divinity and accepts the concepts of karma , reincarnation , chakras , etc . It also employs many Sanskrit terms and concepts . God , or the divine , is seen as a principle and energy , a consciousness that predates creation but is not a willful creator itself . 
 Though earlier manifestations were more eclectic and experimental , over time Adidam increasingly came to resemble the Hindu tradition of bhakti yoga . The practice of Adidam is now defined by its emphasis on a devotional relationship to Adi Da , whom followers see as an enlightened source of power serving as the sole gateway to the divine . Adi Da 's followers often refer to him simply as " Beloved " . Through devotion and service , it is believed that the follower ’ s consciousness is gradually transformed in the image of Adi Da ’ s . While devotion to Adi Da and the study of his teachings are the primary features of Adidam , other specified practices are also prescribed , including the study of other religious texts , physical exercises , regulation of sexuality , and a raw vegan diet . 
 Adi Da said that after his death there would not be any further teachings or " revelations " , and that his message was complete . His artwork , writings , and the religious hermitages and sanctuaries " empowered " by his presence are to remain as expressions of his teaching and being . He was emphatic that no individual assert themselves as his representative or heir . 
 While the church is based on <unk> Island , Fiji , there are five officially designated ashrams , or " sanctuaries " , belonging to Adidam . Three are located in North America , with another in Hawaii . Followers of Adidam have been ambitious and prolific in their dissemination of Adi Da 's books and teachings ; however , the church is estimated to have remained more or less constant at approximately 1 @,@ 000 members worldwide since 1974 , with a high rate of turnover among membership .

 Adi Da wrote prolifically about his spiritual philosophy , creating the Dawn Horse Press in 1973 to publish his books . It continues to print many Adi Da @-@ authored titles . Best known among these is his autobiography , The Knee of Listening . First published in 1972 , it has been reissued in a number of editions , undergoing extensive revisions and additions . The first edition was 271 pages long ; the latest is 840 .

 In the last decade of his life , Adi Da created visual art . These works were primarily photographic and digitally produced . He labeled his style " Transcendental Realism . " In 2007 Adi Da 's works were included in an exhibition collateral to the Venice Biennale in Italy curated by Italian art historian Achille Bonito Oliva ; the exhibit then moved to Florence . His work has been shown by galleries in New York City and Amsterdam .

Wilber also recommended Adi Da as a spiritual teacher to those interested in his own writings . 
 Later , Wilber alternated between praise and pointed criticism . In his last public statement concerning Adi Da he wrote : " I affirm all of the extremes of my statements about Da : he is one of the greatest spiritual <unk> of all time , in my opinion , and yet other aspects of his personality lag far behind those extraordinary heights . By all means look to him for utterly profound revelations , unequaled in many ways ; yet step into his community at your own risk . "

 In 1982 , yoga and religion scholar Georg Feuerstein formally became a follower of Adi Da , and wrote a number of introductions to Adi Da books . He later renounced this affiliation , becoming publicly critical of Adi Da and the community surrounding him in Fiji . Feuerstein devoted a chapter to Adi Da in his 1991 book Holy Madness : Spirituality , Crazy @-@ Wise Teachers , and Enlightenment . In the introduction to the 2006 edition , Feuerstein describes having edited the sections devoted to Adi Da to reflect these changes in opinion . 
 Asian religions scholar Scott Lowe was an early follower of Adi Da and lived in the community in 1974 . In an essay later analyzing what he had witnessed as well as Adi Da 's subsequent career , he perceives a pattern of " abusive , manipulative , and self @-@ centered " behavior , saying " does it necessarily follow that the individual who is ' liberated ' is free to indulge in what appear to be egocentric , hurtful , and damaging actions in the name of spiritual freedom ? I personally think not , while acknowledging the subtlety and complexity of the ongoing debate " . 
 Lowe and others have also criticized Adi Da 's claims toward the exclusivity of his realization . In part , critics point to his earlier message strongly rejecting the necessity for any religious authority or belief , due to " enlightenment " being every individual 's natural condition . 
 Adi Da heavily edited subsequent editions of his books , for which they have been criticized as auto @-@ hagiography and self @-@ mythology . 
 University of Southern California religion professor Robert Ellwood wrote , " Accounts of life with [ Adi Da ] in his close @-@ knit spiritual community [ describe ] extremes of asceticism and indulgence , of authoritarianism and antinomianism ...

 = Inland Customs Line = 
 The Inland Customs Line which incorporated the Great Hedge of India ( or Indian Salt Hedge ) was a customs barrier built by the British across India primarily to collect the salt tax . The customs line was begun while India was under the control of the East India Company but continued into the period of direct British rule . The line had its beginnings in a series of customs houses that were established in Bengal in 1803 to prevent the smuggling of salt to avoid the tax . These customs houses were eventually formed into a continuous barrier that was brought under the control of the Inland Customs Department in 1843 . 
 The line was gradually expanded as more territory was brought under British control until it covered a distance of more than 2 @,@ 500 miles ( 4 @,@ 000 km ) , often running alongside rivers and other natural barriers . At its greatest extent it ran from the Punjab in the northwest until it reached the princely state of Orissa , near the Bay of Bengal , in the southeast . The line was initially made of dead , thorny material such as the Indian Plum but eventually evolved into a living hedge that grew up to 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) high and was compared to the Great Wall of China . The Inland Customs Department employed customs officers , <unk> and men to patrol the line and apprehend smugglers , reaching a peak of more than 14 @,@ 000 staff in 1872 . The line and hedge were considered to be an infringement on the freedom of Indians and in opposition to free trade policies and were eventually abandoned in 1879 when the tax was applied at point of manufacture . The salt tax itself would remain in place until 1946 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 When the Inland Customs Line was first conceived , British India was governed by the East India Company . This situation lasted until 1858 when the responsibility for government of the colony was transferred to the Crown following the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . By 1780 Warren Hastings , the Company 's Governor @-@ General of India , had brought all salt manufacture in the Bengal Presidency under Company control . This allowed him to increase the ancient salt tax in Bengal from 0 @.@ 3 rupees per maund ( 37 kg ) to 3 @.@ 25 rupees per maund by 1788 , a rate that it remained at until 1879 . This brought in a huge amount of revenue for the company , amounting to 6 @,@ 257 @,@ 470 rupees for the 1784 – 85 financial year , at the cost of the Indian consumer , who would have to expend around 2 rupees per year ( 2 months ' income for a labourer ) to provide salt for his family . There were taxes on salt in the other British India territories but the tax in Bengal was the highest , with the other taxes at less than a third of the Bengal tax rate . 
 It was possible to avoid paying the salt tax by making it illegally in salt pans , stealing it from warehouses or smuggling salt from the princely states which remained outside of direct British rule . The latter was the greatest threat to the company 's salt revenues . Much of the smuggled salt came into Bengal from the west and the company decided to act to prevent this trade . In 1803 a series of customs houses and barriers were constructed across major roads and rivers in Bengal to collect the tax on traded salt as well as duties on tobacco and other imports . These customs houses were backed up by " preventative customs houses " located near salt works and the coast in Bengal to collect the tax at source . 
 These customs houses alone did little to prevent the mass avoidance of the salt tax . This was due to the lack of a continuous barrier , corruption within the customs staff and the westward expansion of Bengal towards salt @-@ rich states . In 1823 the Commissioner of Customs for Agra , George Saunders , installed a line of customs posts along the Ganges and Yamuna rivers from Mirzapur to Allahabad that would eventually evolve into the Inland Customs Line . The main aim was to prevent salt from being smuggled from the south and west but there was also a secondary line running from Allahabad to Nepal to prevent smuggling from the Northwest frontier . The annexation of Sindh and the Punjab allowed the line to be extended north @-@ west by G. H. Smith , who had become Commissioner of Customs in 1834 . Smith exempted items such as tobacco and iron from taxation to concentrate on salt and was responsible for expanding and improving the line , increasing its budget to 790 @,@ 000 rupees per year and the staff to 6 @,@ 600 men . Under Smith 's leadership the line saw many reforms and was officially named the Inland Customs Line in 1843 . 
 = = Inland Customs Line = = 
 Smith 's new Inland Customs Line was first concentrated between Agra and Delhi and consisted of a series of customs posts at one mile intervals , linked by a raised path with gateways ( known as " <unk> " ) to allow people to cross the line every four miles . Policing of the barrier and surrounding land , to a distance of 10 to 15 miles ( 16 to 24 km ) , was the responsibility of the Inland Customs Department , headed by a Commissioner of Inland Customs . The department staffed each post with an Indian <unk> ( approximately equivalent to a British Warrant Officer ) and ten men , backed up by patrols operating 2 – 3 miles behind the line . The line was mainly concerned with the collection of the salt tax but also collected tax on sugar exported from Bengal and functioned as a deterrent against opium , <unk> and cannabis smuggling . 
 The end of company rule in 1858 allowed the British government to expand Bengal through territorial acquisitions , updating the line as needed . In 1869 the government in Calcutta ordered the connection of sections of the line into a continuous customs barrier stretching 2 @,@ 504 miles ( 4 @,@ 030 km ) from the Himalayas to Orissa , near the Bay of Bengal . This distance was said to be the equivalent of London to Constantinople . The north section from Tarbela to Multan was lightly guarded with posts spread further apart as the wide Indus River was judged to provide a sufficient barrier to smuggling . The more heavily guarded section was around 1 @,@ 429 miles ( 2 @,@ 300 km ) long and began at Multan , running along the rivers Sutlej and Yamuna before terminating south of Burhanpur . The final 794 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 278 km ) section reverted to longer distances between customs posts and ran east to <unk> . 
 In the 1869 – 70 financial year the line collected 12 @.@ 5 million rupees in salt tax and 1 million rupees in sugar duties at a cost of 1 @.@ 62 million rupees in maintenance . In this period the line employed around 12 @,@ 000 men and maintained 1 @,@ 727 customs posts . By 1877 the salt tax was worth £ 6 @.@ 3 million ( approx 29 @.@ 1 million rupees ) to the British government in India , with the majority being collected in the Madras and Bengal provinces , lying on either side of the customs line . 
 = = Great Hedge = = 
 It is not known when an actual live hedge was first grown along the customs line but it is likely that it began in the 1840s when thorn bushes , cut and laid along the line as a barrier ( known as the " dry hedge " , see also dead hedge ) , took root . By 1868 it had become 180 miles ( 290 km ) of " thoroughly impenetrable " hedge . The original dry hedge consisted mainly of samples of the dwarf Indian Plum fixed to the line with stakes . This hedge was at risk of attack by white ants , rats , fire , storms , locusts , parasitic creepers , natural decay and strong winds which could destroy furlongs at a time and necessitated constant maintenance . Allan Octavian Hume , Commissioner of Inland Customs from 1867 – 70 , estimated that each mile of dry hedge required 250 tons of material to construct and that this material had to be carried to the line from between 0 @.@ 25 and 6 miles ( 0 @.@ 40 and 9 @.@ 66 km ) away . The amount of labour involved in such a task was one of the reasons that a live hedge was encouraged , particularly as damage required the replacement of around half of the dry hedge each year . 
 In 1869 Hume , in preparation for a rapid expansion of the live hedge , began trials of various indigenous thorny shrubs to see which would be suited to different soil and rainfall conditions . The result was that the main body of the hedge was composed of Indian plum , babool , <unk> and several species of Euphorbia . The prickly pear was used where conditions meant that nothing else could grow , as was found in parts of the Hisar district , and in other places bamboo was planted . Where the soil was poor it was dug out and replaced or overlain with better soil and in flood plains the hedge was planted on a raised bank to protect it . The hedge was watered from nearby wells or rainwater collected in large , purpose built trenches and a " well made " road was constructed along its entire length . 
 Hume was responsible for transforming the hedge from " a mere line of persistently dwarf seedlings , or of irregularly scattered , disconnected bushes " into a formidable barrier that , by the end of his tenure as commissioner , contained 448 @.@ 75 miles ( 722 @.@ 19 km ) of " perfect " hedge and 233 @.@ 5 miles ( 375 @.@ 8 km ) of " strong and good " , but not impenetrable hedge . The hedge was nowhere less than 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) high and 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) thick and in some places was 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) high and 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) thick . Hume himself remarked that his barrier was " in its most perfect form , ... utterly impassable to man or beast " . 
 Hume also substantially realigned the Inland Customs Line , joining together separate sections and removing some of the spurs that were no longer necessary . Where this happened , whole runs of hedge were abandoned , and the men would have to construct a hedge from scratch on the new alignment . The living hedge was terminated at Burhanpur in the south , beyond which it could not grow , and at <unk> in the north where it met the River Indus , whose strong current was judged sufficient to deter smugglers . Historian Henry Francis Pelham compared the use of the Indus in this way to that of the River Main , in modern Germany , for the Roman Limes Germanicus fortifications . 
 Hume was replaced as Commissioner of Customs in 1870 by G. H. M. Batten who would hold the post for the next six years . His administration saw little realignment of the hedge but extensive strengthening of the existing run , including the building of stone walls and ditch and bank systems where the hedge could not be grown . By the end of Batten 's first year he had increased the length of " perfect " hedge by 111 @.@ 25 miles ( 179 @.@ 04 km ) , and by 1873 the central portion between Agra and Delhi was said to be almost impregnable . The line was altered slightly in 1875 @-@ 6 to run alongside the newly built Agra Canal , which was judged a sufficient obstacle to allow the distance between guard posts to be increased to 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) . 
 Batten 's replacement as Commissioner was W. S. Halsey who would be the last to be in charge of the Great Hedge . Under Halsey 's control the hedge grew to its greatest extent , reaching a peak of 411 @.@ 5 miles ( 662 @.@ 2 km ) of " perfect " and " good " live hedge by 1878 with a further 1 @,@ 109 @.@ 5 miles ( 1 @,@ 785 @.@ 6 km ) of inferior hedge , dry hedge or stone wall . The live hedge extended to at least 800 miles ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) and in places was backed up with an additional dry hedge barrier . All maintenance work was halted on the hedge in 1878 after a decision was made to abandon the line in 1879 . 
 = = Staff = = 
 The customs line and hedge required a large number of staff to patrol and maintain it . The majority of the staff were Indian , with their officers coming mainly from the British . In 1869 the Inland Customs Department employed 136 officers , 2 @,@ 499 petty officers and 11 @,@ 288 men on the line , reaching a peak of 14 @,@ 188 men of all ranks in 1872 , after which staff numbers declined to around 10 @,@ 000 as expansion slowed and the hedge matured . The Indian staff were recruited disproportionately from the Muslim population , who constituted 42 percent of the customs men . The men were intentionally stationed in areas away from their home towns which , together with their removal of local wood for the hedge , made them unpopular among local people . To encourage co @-@ operation , those Indians who lived in villages near the line were allowed to carry up to 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 9 kg ) of salt across for free . 
 The job of customs man was highly desirable due to its high pay of five rupees per month ( agricultural wages were around three rupees a month ) , which could be topped up with the proceeds from the sale of seized salt . However the men were forced to live away from their families in order to minimise distractions and were not provided with houses , being expected to build their own from mud or wood . In 1868 the Inland Customs department allowed the men 's families to join them on the line , as the previous order had led to customs men straying from their posts and associating too closely with local women . The men worked twelve @-@ hour days consisting of two equal day and night shifts . The principal tasks were patrolling and maintaining the hedge ; in 1869 alone the customs men carried out 18 million miles ( 29 million km ) of patrols , dug 2 million cubic feet ( 57 @,@ 000 cubic metres ) of earth and carried over 150 @,@ 000 tons of thorny material for the hedge . There was a fairly high level of turnover in the staff ; for example , in 1876 @-@ 7 more than 800 men left the service . This included 115 customs men who died on the line , 276 dismissed , 30 deserted on duty , 360 failing to rejoin after leave and 23 removed for being unfit . 
 The officer corps was almost entirely British ; attempts to attract Indian men to the post proved unsuccessful , as the officers were required to be fluent in English , and such men could easily find better paid work in other fields . The job was tough , with each officer responsible for 100 men on 10 to 30 miles ( 16 to 48 km ) of the line , and working through Sundays and holidays . The officers undertook at least one customs excursion per day on average , weighing and applying tax to almost 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) of goods , in addition to personally patrolling around 9 miles ( 14 km ) of the line . The only other British men they would meet while on the line would typically be officers of adjacent beats and senior officers who visited about three times a year . 
 = = Abandonment = = 
 Several British viceroys considered dismantling the line , as it was a major obstacle to free travel and trade across the subcontinent . This was partly due to the use of the line for the collection of taxes on sugar ( which made up 10 percent of the revenues ) as well as salt , meaning that traffic had to be stopped and searched in both directions . In addition the line had created a confusing number of different customs jurisdictions in the area surrounding it . The viceroys were also displeased with the corruption and bribery which was present in the Inland Customs system , and the way the line came to serve as a symbol of unjust taxes ( parts were set on fire during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 ) . However , the government could not afford to lose the revenue generated by the line and hence , before they could abolish it , needed to take control of all salt production in India , so that tax could be applied at the point of manufacture . 
 The Viceroy from 1869 to 1872 , Lord Mayo , took the first steps towards abolition of the line , instructing British officials to negotiate agreements with the rulers of princely states to take control of salt production . The process was speeded up by Mayo 's successor , Lord Northbrook , and by the loss of revenue caused by the Great Famine of 1876 – 78 that reduced the land tax and killed 6 @.@ 5 million people . Having secured salt production , British India 's Finance Minister , Sir John Strachey , led a review of the tax system and his recommendations , implemented by Viceroy Lord Lytton , resulted in the increase of the salt tax in Madras , Bombay and northern India to 2 @.@ 5 rupees per maund and a reduction in Bengal to 2 @.@ 9 rupees . This reduced difference in tax between neighbouring territories made smuggling uneconomical and allowed for the abandonment of the Inland Customs Line on 1 April 1879 . The tax on sugar and 29 other commodities had been abolished a year earlier . Strachey 's tax reforms continued , and he brought an end to import duties and almost complete free trade to India by 1880 . In 1882 Viceroy Lord Ripon finally standardised the salt tax across most of India at a rate of two rupees per maund . However the trans @-@ Indus districts of India continued to be taxed at eight annas ( ½ rupee ) per maund until 23 July 1896 and Burma maintained its reduced rate of just three annas . The equalisation of tax cost the government 1 @.@ 2 million rupees of lost revenue . The potential for salt to be smuggled from the Kohat ( trans @-@ Indus ) region meant that the north @-@ western section of the line , some 325 miles long from <unk> to <unk> , continued to be policed by the Department of Salt Revenue in Northern India until at least 1895 . 
 = = Impact on smuggling = = 
 The principal function of the line was to prevent smuggling , often the only way to procure affordable salt , and in this respect it was fairly successful . Smugglers who were caught by customs men were arrested and fined around 8 rupees , those that could not pay being imprisoned for around 6 weeks . The number of smugglers caught increased as the line was lengthened and improved . In 1868 2 @,@ 340 people were convicted of smuggling after being caught on the line , this rose to 3 @,@ 271 smugglers in 1873 – 74 and to 6 @,@ 077 convicted in 1877 – 78 . 
 Several methods of smuggling were employed . Early on , when patrols were patchy , large scale smuggling was common , with armed gangs breaking through the line with herds of salt @-@ laden camels or cattle . As the line was strengthened , smugglers changed tactics and would try to disguise salt and bring it through the line or throw it over the hedge . <unk> were also attempted with salt being hidden within the jurisdiction of the customs department to collect the 50 percent finders fee . 
 Clashes between smugglers and customs men were often violent , with the deaths of customs men in the line of duty not being uncommon . A large incident occurred in September 1877 when two customs men attempted to apprehend 112 smugglers and were both killed . More than half of the gang were later caught and either imprisoned or transported . Another customs man lost his life near Sohar when he attempted , with seven colleagues , to capture a gang of 30 smugglers . Fourteen of the gang were later captured and , again , imprisoned or transported . Many of the smugglers also died , with examples including one killed by his fellow smugglers in a fight with customs men and another drowning while trying to escape by swimming an irrigation tank .

 Writers have described the line as infringement of the principles of free trade and the freedom of the people of India . Sir John Strachey , the minister whose tax review led to the abolition of the line , was quoted in 1893 describing the line as " a monstrous system , to which it would be almost impossible to find a parallel in any tolerably civilised country " . This has been echoed by modern writers such as journalist Madeleine Bunting , who wrote in The Guardian in February 2001 that the line was " one of the most grotesque and least well known achievements of the British in India " . 
 The massive scale of the undertaking has also been commented upon , with both Hume , the customs commissioner , and M. E. Grant Duff , who was Under @-@ Secretary of State for India from 1868 to 1874 , comparing the hedge to the Great Wall of China . The abolition of the line and equalisation of tax has generally been viewed as a good move , with one writer of 1901 stating that it " relieved the people and the trade along a broad belt of country , 2 @,@ 000 miles long , from much harassment " . Sir Richard Temple , governor of the Bengal and Bombay Presidencies , wrote in 1882 that " the inland customs line for levying the salt @-@ duties has been at length swept away " and that care must be taken to ensure that the " evils of the obsolete transit @-@ duties " did not return . 
 The use of the customs line to maintain the higher salt tax in Bengal is likely to have had a detrimental effect on the health of Indians through salt deprivation . The higher prices within the area enclosed by the line meant that the average annual salt consumption was just 8 pounds ( 3 @.@ 6 kg ) compared with up to 16 pounds ( 7 @.@ 3 kg ) outside the line . Indeed , the British government 's own figures showed that the barrier directly affected salt consumption , reducing it to below the level that regulations prescribed for English soldiers serving in India and that supplied to prisoners in British jails . The consumption of salt was further lowered during the periods of famine that affected India in the 19th century . 
 It is impossible to know how many died from salt deprivation in India as a result of the salt tax as salt deficiency was not often recorded as a cause of death and was instead more likely to worsen the effects of other diseases and hinder recoveries . It is known that the equalisation of tax made salt cheaper on the whole , decreasing the tax imposed on 130 million people and increasing it on just 47 million , leading to an increase in the use of the mineral . Consumption grew by 50 percent between 1868 and 1888 and doubled by 1911 , by which time salt had become cheaper ( relatively ) than at any earlier stage of Indian history . 
 The rate of salt tax was increased to 2 @.@ 5 rupees per maund in 1888 to compensate for the loss of revenue from falling silver prices , but this had no adverse effect on salt consumption . The salt tax remained a controversial means of collecting revenue and became the subject of the 1930 Salt Satyagraha , a civil disobedience movement led by Mohandas Gandhi against British rule . During the Satyagraha Gandhi and others marched to the salt producing area of Dandi and defied the salt laws , leading to the imprisonment of 80 @,@ 000 Indians . The march drew significant publicity to the Indian independence movement but failed to get the tax repealed . The salt tax would finally be abolished by the Interim Government of India , led by Jawaharlal Nehru , in October 1946 . The government of Indira Gandhi overlaid much of the old route with roads .

 Despite its scale , the customs line and associated hedge were not widely known in either Britain or India , the standard histories of the period neglecting to mention them . Roy Moxham , a conservator at the University of London library , wrote a book on the customs line and his search for its remains that was published in 2001 . This followed his finding , in 1995 , of a passing mention of the hedge in Major @-@ General Sir W.H. <unk> 's 1893 work Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official . Moxham looked up the hedge in the India Office Records of the British Library and determined to locate its remnants . 
 Moxham conducted extensive research in London before making three trips to India to look for any remains of the line . In 1998 he located a small raised embankment in the Etawah district in Uttar Pradesh which may be all that remains of the Great Hedge of India . Moxham 's book , which he claims to be the first on the subject , details the history of the line and his attempts to locate its modern remains . The book was translated into the Marathi language by Anand Abhyankar and published in 2007 . Cyril Alex translated into Tamil and was published in 2015 , personally attended by Roy Moxham himself . 
 = Surface diffusion = 
 Surface diffusion is a general process involving the motion of adatoms , molecules , and atomic clusters ( adparticles ) at solid material surfaces . The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface , as in figure 1 . Just as in bulk diffusion , this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature . Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest @-@ neighbor jumps . Tunneling diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen has been shown to diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect . 
 Various analytical tools may be used to elucidate surface diffusion mechanisms and rates , the most important of which are field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy . While in principle the process can occur on a variety of materials , most experiments are performed on crystalline metal surfaces . Due to experimental constraints most studies of surface diffusion are limited to well below the melting point of the substrate , and much has yet to be discovered regarding how these processes take place at higher temperatures . 
 Surface diffusion rates and mechanisms are affected by a variety of factors including the strength of the surface @-@ adparticle bond , orientation of the surface lattice , attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients . It is an important concept in surface phase formation , epitaxial growth , heterogeneous catalysis , and other topics in surface science . As such , the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries . Real @-@ world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters , integrated circuits used in electronic devices , and silver halide salts used in photographic film . 
 = = Kinetics = = 
 Surface diffusion kinetics can be thought of in terms of adatoms residing at adsorption sites on a 2D lattice , moving between adjacent ( nearest @-@ neighbor ) adsorption sites by a jumping process . The jump rate is characterized by an attempt frequency and a thermodynamic factor that dictates the probability of an attempt resulting in a successful jump . The attempt frequency ν is typically taken to be simply the vibrational frequency of the adatom , while the thermodynamic factor is a Boltzmann factor dependent on temperature and Ediff , the potential energy barrier to diffusion . Equation 1 describes the relationship : 
 <formula> 
 Where ν and Ediff are as described above , Γ is the jump or hopping rate , T is temperature , and kB is the Boltzmann constant . Ediff must be smaller than the energy of desorption for diffusion to occur , otherwise desorption processes would dominate . Importantly , equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature . The manner in which diffusion takes place is dependent on the relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor : when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion . This case , known as mobile diffusion , is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems . For the phenomena described throughout this article , it is assumed that Ediff > > kBT and therefore Γ < < ν . In the case of <unk> diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient , D , versus 1 / T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present ( see below ) , there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature . 
 Random walk statistics describe the mean squared displacement of diffusing species in terms of the number of jumps N and the distance per jump a . The number of successful jumps is simply Γ multiplied by the time allowed for diffusion , t . In the most basic model only nearest @-@ neighbor jumps are considered and a corresponds to the spacing between nearest @-@ neighbor adsorption sites . The root mean squared displacement goes as <formula> ( eq . 2 ) . The diffusion coefficient is given as D 
 = <unk> / z ( eq . 3 ) , where z = 
 2 for 1D diffusion as would be the case for in @-@ channel diffusion , z 
 = 4 for 2D diffusion , and z = 
 6 for 3D diffusion . 
 = = Regimes = = 
 There are four different general schemes in which diffusion may take place . Tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion differ in the level of <unk> coverage at the surface , while intrinsic diffusion and mass transfer diffusion differ in the nature of the diffusion environment . Tracer diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogeneous environment , whereas in chemical and mass transfer diffusion adparticles are more strongly affected by their surroundings . 
 Tracer diffusion describes the motion of individual adparticles on a surface at relatively low coverage levels . At these low levels ( < 0 @.@ 01 monolayer ) , particle interaction is low and each particle can be considered to move independently of the others . The single atom diffusing in figure 1 is a nice example of tracer diffusion . 
 Chemical diffusion describes the process at higher level of coverage where the effects of attraction or repulsion between adatoms becomes important . These interactions serve to alter the mobility of adatoms . In a crude way , figure 3 serves to show how adatoms may interact at higher coverage levels . The adatoms have no " choice " but to move to the right at first , and adjacent adatoms may block adsorption sites from one another . 
 Intrinsic diffusion occurs on a uniform surface ( e.g. lacking steps or vacancies ) such as a single terrace , where no adatom traps or sources are present . This regime is often studied using field ion microscopy , wherein the terrace is a sharp sample tip on which an adparticle diffuses . Even in the case of a clean terrace the process may be influenced by non @-@ uniformity near the edges of the terrace . 
 Mass transfer diffusion takes place in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as <unk> , steps , and vacancies are present . Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff , diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles . The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate , since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model . 
 = = Anisotropy = = 
 <unk> anisotropy takes the form of a difference in both diffusion rates and mechanisms at the various surface orientations of a given material . For a given crystalline material each Miller Index plane may display unique diffusion phenomena . Close packed surfaces such as the fcc ( 111 ) tend to have higher diffusion rates than the correspondingly more " open " faces of the same material such as fcc ( 100 ) . 
 Directional anisotropy refers to a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane . These differences may be a result of either anisotropy in the surface lattice ( e.g. a rectangular lattice ) or the presence of steps on a surface . One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc ( 110 ) , where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel . 
 = = Mechanisms = = 
 = = = <unk> diffusion = = = 
 Diffusion of adatoms may occur by a variety of mechanisms . The manner in which they diffuse is important as it may dictate the kinetics of movement , temperature dependence , and overall mobility of surface species , among other parameters . The following is a summary of the most important of these processes : 
 Hopping or jumping is conceptually the most basic mechanism for diffusion of adatoms . In this model , the adatoms reside on adsorption sites on the surface lattice . Motion occurs through successive jumps to adjacent sites , the number of which depends on the nature of the surface lattice . Figures 1 and 3 both display adatoms undergoing diffusion via the hopping process . Studies have shown the presence of metastable transition states between adsorption sites wherein it may be possible for adatoms to temporarily reside . 
 Atomic exchange involves exchange between an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice . As shown in figure 4 , after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken the place of a surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom . This process may take place in both <unk> ( e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni ) and self @-@ diffusion ( e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt ) . It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others . Current theory points towards multiple possibilities , including tensile surface stresses , surface relaxation about the adatom , and increased stability of the intermediate due to the fact that both atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process . 
 Tunneling diffusion is a physical manifestation of the quantum tunneling effect involving particles tunneling across diffusion barriers . It can occur in the case of low diffusing particle mass and low Ediff , and has been observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces . The phenomenon is unique in that in the regime where the tunneling mechanism dominates , the diffusion rate is nearly temperature @-@ independent . 
 Vacancy diffusion can occur as the predominant method of surface diffusion at high coverage levels approaching complete coverage . This process is akin to the manner in which pieces slide around in a " sliding puzzle " . It is very difficult to directly observe vacancy diffusion due to the typically high diffusion rates and low vacancy concentration . Figure 5 shows the basic theme of this mechanism in an albeit oversimplified manner . 
 Recent theoretical work as well as experimental work performed since the late 1970s has brought to light a remarkable variety of surface diffusion phenomena both with regard to kinetics as well as to mechanisms . Following is a summary of some of the more notable phenomena : 
 Long jumps consist of adatom displacement to a non @-@ nearest @-@ neighbor adsorption site . They may include double , triple , and longer jumps in the same direction as a nearest @-@ neighbor jump would travel , or they may be in entirely different directions as shown in figure 6 . They have been predicted by theory to exist in many different systems , and have been shown by experiment to take place at temperatures as low as 0 @.@ 1 Tm ( melting temperature ) . In some cases data indicate long jumps dominating the diffusion process over single jumps at elevated temperatures ; the phenomena of variable jump lengths is expressed in different characteristic distributions of atomic displacement over time ( see figure 7 ) . 
 Rebound jumps have been shown by both experiment and simulations to take place in certain systems . Since the motion does not result in a net displacement of the adatom involved , experimental evidence for rebound jumps again comes from statistical interpretation of atomic distributions . A rebound jump is shown in figure 6 . The figure is slightly misleading , however , as rebound jumps have only been shown experimentally to take place in the case of 1D diffusion on a channeled surface ( in particular , the bcc ( 211 ) face of tungsten ) . 
 Cross @-@ channel diffusion can occur in the case of channeled surfaces . Typically in @-@ channel diffusion dominates due to the lower energy barrier for diffusion of this process . In certain cases cross @-@ channel has been shown to occur , taking place in a manner similar to that shown in figure 8 . The intermediate " dumbbell " position may lead to a variety of final adatom and surface atom displacements . 
 Long @-@ range atomic exchange is a process involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism , but instead of a nearest @-@ neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges . Shown in figure 9 , this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations and has yet to be confirmed experimentally . In spite of this long range atomic exchange , as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms , are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation . 
 = = = Cluster diffusion = = = 
 Cluster diffusion involves motion of atomic clusters ranging in size from dimers to islands containing hundreds of atoms . Motion of the cluster may occur via the displacement of individual atoms , sections of the cluster , or the entire cluster moving at once . All of these processes involve a change in the cluster ’ s center of mass . 
 Individual mechanisms are those that involve movement of one atom at a <unk> diffusion involves movement of adatoms or vacancies at edge or kink sites . As shown in figure 10 , the mobile atom maintains its proximity to the cluster throughout the process . 
 Evaporation @-@ condensation involves atoms “ evaporating ” from the cluster onto a terrace accompanied by “ condensation ” of terrace adatoms onto the cluster leading to a change in the cluster ’ s center of mass . While figure 10 appears to indicate the same atom evaporating from and condensing on the cluster , it may in fact be a different atom condensing from the 2D gas . 
 Leapfrog diffusion is similar to edge diffusion , but where the diffusing atom actually moves atop the cluster before settling in a different location from its starting position . 
 Sequential displacement refers to the process involving motion one atom at a time , moving to free nearest @-@ neighbor sites . 
 Concerted mechanisms are those that involve movement of either sections of the cluster or the entire cluster all at <unk> diffusion occurs when adjacent sub @-@ units of a cluster move in a row @-@ by @-@ row fashion through displacement of a dislocation . As shown in figure 11 ( a ) the process begins with nucleation of the dislocation followed by what is essentially sequential displacement on a concerted basis . 
 Glide diffusion refers to the concerted motion of an entire cluster all at once ( see figure 11 ( b ) ) . 
 <unk> is a snake @-@ like movement ( hence the name ) involving sequential motion of cluster sub @-@ units ( see figure 11 ( c ) ) . 
 Shearing is a concerted displacement of a sub @-@ unit of atoms within a cluster ( see figure 11 ( d ) ) . 
 Size @-@ dependence : the rate of cluster diffusion has a strong dependence on the size of the cluster , with larger cluster size generally corresponding to slower diffusion . This is not , however , a universal trend and it has been shown in some systems that the diffusion rate takes on a periodic tendency wherein some larger clusters diffuse faster than those smaller than them . 
 = = Surface diffusion and heterogeneous catalysis = = 
 Surface diffusion is a critically important concept in heterogeneous catalysis , as reaction rates are often dictated by the ability of reactants to " find " each other at a catalyst surface . With increased temperature adsorbed molecules , molecular fragments , atoms , and clusters tend to have much greater mobility ( see equation 1 ) . However , with increased temperature the lifetime of adsorption decreases as the factor kBT becomes large enough for the adsorbed species to overcome the barrier to desorption , Q ( see figure 2 ) . Reaction thermodynamics aside because of the interplay between increased rates of diffusion and decreased lifetime of adsorption , increased temperature may in some cases decrease the overall rate of the reaction . 
 = = Experimental = = 
 Surface diffusion may be studied by a variety of techniques , including both direct and indirect observations . Two experimental techniques that have proved very useful in this area of study are field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy . By visualizing the displacement of atoms or clusters over time , it is possible to extract useful information regarding the manner in which the relevant species diffuse @-@ both mechanistic and rate @-@ related information . In order to study surface diffusion on the atomistic scale it is unfortunately necessary to perform studies on rigorously clean surfaces and in ultra high vacuum ( UHV ) conditions or in the presence of small amounts of inert gas , as is the case when using He or Ne as imaging gas in field @-@ ion microscopy experiments .

 = Nelson Mandela = 
 Nelson <unk> Mandela ( / <unk> / ; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013 ) was a South African anti @-@ apartheid revolutionary , politician , and philanthropist , who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 . He was the country 's first black chief executive , and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election . His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation . Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist , he served as President of the African National Congress ( ANC ) party from 1991 to 1997 . 
 A Xhosa born to the Thembu royal family , Mandela attended the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand , where he studied law . Living in Johannesburg , he became involved in anti @-@ colonial politics , joining the ANC and becoming a founding member of its Youth League . After the Afrikaner minority government of the National Party established apartheid – a system of racial segregation that privileged whites – in 1948 he rose to prominence in the ANC 's 1952 anti @-@ apartheid Defiance Campaign , was appointed President of the organisation 's Transvaal branch , and co @-@ organised the 1955 Congress of the People . Working as a lawyer , he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and , with the ANC leadership , was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the Treason Trial from 1956 to 1961 . Influenced by Marxism , he secretly joined the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) . Although initially committed to non @-@ violent protest , in association with the SACP he co @-@ founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 , leading a sabotage campaign against the government . In 1962 , he was arrested , convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the state , and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial . 
 Mandela served 27 years in prison , initially on Robben Island , and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison . Amid international pressure and growing fear of a racial civil war , President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990 . Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial elections , in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president . Leading a broad coalition government , which promulgated a new constitution , Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country 's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses . While continuing with the former government 's economic liberalism , his administration introduced measures to encourage land reform , combat poverty , and expand healthcare services . Internationally , he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary @-@ General of the Non @-@ Aligned Movement from 1998 – 99 . Declining a second presidential term , he was succeeded by his deputy , Thabo Mbeki . Mandela became an elder statesman , focusing on charitable work in combating poverty and HIV / AIDS through the Nelson Mandela Foundation . 
 Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life . Critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist , while those on the radical left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid 's supporters . Conversely , he gained international acclaim for his activism , having received more than 250 honours , including the Nobel Peace Prize , the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom , and the Soviet Lenin Peace Prize . He is held in deep respect within South Africa , where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name , Madiba , or as Tata ( " Father " ) , and described as the " Father of the Nation " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Childhood : 1918 – 34 = = = 
 Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of <unk> in <unk> , then a part of South Africa 's Cape Province . Given the forename <unk> , a Xhosa term colloquially meaning " troublemaker " , in later years he became known by his clan name , Madiba . His patrilineal great @-@ grandfather , <unk> , was king of the Thembu people in the <unk> Territories of South Africa 's modern Eastern Cape province . One of <unk> 's sons , named Mandela , became Nelson 's grandfather and the source of his surname . Because Mandela was only the king 's child by a wife of the <unk> clan , a so @-@ called " Left @-@ Hand House " , the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic , ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors . His father , Gadla Henry <unk> , was a local chief and councillor to the monarch ; he was appointed to the position in 1915 , after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate . In 1926 , Gadla was also sacked for corruption , but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate 's unreasonable demands . A devotee of the god <unk> , Gadla was a polygamist , having four wives , four sons and nine daughters , who lived in different villages . Nelson 's mother was Gadla 's third wife , <unk> Fanny , who was daughter of <unk> of the Right Hand House and a member of the <unk> clan of Xhosa . 
 Later stating that his early life was dominated by traditional Thembu custom and taboo , Mandela grew up with two sisters in his mother 's kraal in the village of Qunu , where he tended herds as a cattle @-@ boy , spending much time outside with other boys . Both his parents were illiterate , but being a devout Christian , his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when he was about seven . Baptised a Methodist , Mandela was given the English forename of " Nelson " by his teacher . When Mandela was about nine , his father came to stay at Qunu , where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease . Feeling " cut adrift " , he later said that he inherited his father 's " proud rebelliousness " and " stubborn sense of fairness " . 
 Mandela 's mother took him to the " Great Place " palace at <unk> , where he was entrusted under the guardianship of Thembu regent , Chief Jongintaba <unk> . Although he did not see his mother again for many years , Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife <unk> treated him as their own child , raising him alongside their son , Justice , and daughter , <unk> . As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with his guardians , Christianity became a significant part of his life . He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace , studying English , Xhosa , history and geography . He developed a love of African history , listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace , and became influenced by the anti @-@ imperialist rhetoric of the visiting Chief <unk> . At the time he nevertheless considered the European colonialists not as oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to southern Africa . Aged 16 , he , Justice and several other boys travelled to <unk> to undergo the circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men ; the rite over , he was given the name <unk> . 
 = = = <unk> , <unk> , and Fort Hare : 1934 – 40 = = = 
 Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house , Mandela began his secondary education at <unk> Methodist High School , <unk> , a Western @-@ style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland . Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis , he claimed that he lost his " stuck up " attitude , becoming best friends with a girl for the first time ; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening . Completing his Junior Certificate in two years , in 1937 he moved to <unk> , the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty , including Justice . The headmaster emphasised the superiority of English culture and government , but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture , making his first non @-@ Xhosa friend , a Sotho language @-@ speaker , and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers , a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho . Spending much of his spare time long @-@ distance running and boxing , in his second year Mandela became a prefect . 
 With Jongintaba 's backing , Mandela began work on a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) degree at the University of Fort Hare , an elite black institution in Alice , Eastern Cape , with around 150 students . There he studied English , anthropology , politics , native administration , and Roman Dutch law in his first year , desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department . Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory , befriending his own kinsman , K. D. <unk> , as well as Oliver Tambo , who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come . Continuing his interest in sport , Mandela took up ballroom dancing , performed in a drama society play about Abraham Lincoln , and gave Bible classes in the local community as part of the Student Christian Association . Although having friends connected to the African National Congress ( ANC ) and the anti @-@ imperialist movement who wanted South Africa to be independent of the British Empire , Mandela avoided any involvement , and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out . Helping found a first @-@ year students ' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second @-@ years , at the end of his first year he became involved in a Students ' Representative Council ( SRC ) boycott against the quality of food , for which he was temporarily suspended from the university ; he left without receiving a degree . 
 = = = Arriving in Johannesburg : 1941 – 43 = = = 
 Returning to <unk> in December 1940 , Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice ; dismayed , they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown , arriving in April 1941 . Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines , his " first sight of South African capitalism in action " , but was fired when the <unk> ( headman ) discovered that he was a runaway . Staying with a cousin in George Goch Township , Mandela was introduced to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu , who secured him a job as an articled clerk at law firm Witkin , Sidelsky and Eidelman . The company was run by a liberal Jew , Lazar Sidelsky , who was sympathetic to the ANC 's cause . At the firm , Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe , a Xhosa member of the ANC and Communist Party , as well as Nat Bregman , a Jewish communist who became his first white friend . Attending communist talks and parties , Mandela was impressed that Europeans , Africans , Indians and Coloureds were mixing as equals . He later stated that he did not join the Party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith , and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially @-@ based rather than class warfare . Continuing his higher education , Mandela signed up to a University of South Africa correspondence course , working on his bachelor 's degree at night . 
 Earning a small wage , Mandela rented a room in the house of the <unk> family in the Alexandra township ; despite being rife with poverty , crime and pollution , Alexandra always remained a special place for him . Although embarrassed by his poverty , he briefly courted a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord 's daughter . In order to save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg , Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association , living among miners of various tribes ; as the compound was visited by various chiefs , he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland . In late 1941 , Jongintaba visited , forgiving Mandela for running away . On returning to Thembuland , the regent died in winter 1942 ; Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral . After passing his BA exams in early 1943 , Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland . He later stated that he experienced no epiphany , but that he " simply found [ himself ] doing so , and could not do otherwise . "

 Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand , where he was the only black African student in the faculty . Although facing racism from some , he befriended liberal and communist European , Jewish , and Indian students , among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First . Becoming increasingly politicised , in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises . Joining the ANC , he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu , spending much time with other activists at Sisulu 's Orlando house , including old friend Oliver Tambo . In 1943 , Mandela met Anton Lembede , an ANC member affiliated with the Africanist branch of African nationalism , which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists . Despite his friendships with non @-@ blacks and communists , Mandela embraced Lembede 's views , believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self @-@ determination . Deciding on the need for a youth wing to mass @-@ mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjugation , Mandela was among a delegation that approached ANC President Alfred <unk> Xuma on the subject at his home in Sophiatown ; the African National Congress Youth League ( ANCYL ) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men 's Social Centre , with Lembede as President and Mandela as a member of its executive committee . 
 At Sisulu 's house , Mandela met Evelyn Mase , a trainee nurse and ANC activist from <unk> , Transkei . Entering a relationship and marrying in October 1944 , they initially lived with her relatives until moving in to a rented house in the township of Orlando in early 1946 . Their first child , Madiba " Thembi " <unk> , was born in February 1945 ; a daughter , Makaziwe , was born in 1947 but died of meningitis nine months later . Mandela enjoyed home life , welcoming his mother and his sister , <unk> , to stay with him . In early 1947 , his three years of articles ended at Witkin , Sidelsky and Eidelman , and he decided to become a full @-@ time student , subsisting on loans from the Bantu Welfare Trust . 
 In July 1947 , Mandela rushed Lembede , who was ill , to hospital , where he died ; he was succeeded as ANCYL president by the more moderate Peter Mda , who agreed to co @-@ operate with communists and non @-@ blacks , appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary . Mandela disagreed with Mda 's approach , in December 1947 supporting an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL , considering their ideology un @-@ African . In 1947 , Mandela was elected to the executive committee of the ANC 's Transvaal Province branch , serving under regional president C. S. <unk> . When <unk> acted against the wishes of the committee by co @-@ operating with Indians and communists , Mandela was one of those who forced his resignation . 
 In the South African general election , 1948 , in which only whites were permitted to vote , the Afrikaner @-@ dominated <unk> <unk> Party under Daniel François Malan took power , soon uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party . Openly racialist , the party codified and expanded racial segregation with the new apartheid legislation . Gaining increasing influence in the ANC , Mandela and his cadres began advocating direct action against apartheid , such as boycotts and strikes , influenced by the tactics already employed by South Africa 's Indian community . Xuma did not support these measures and was removed from the presidency in a vote of no confidence , replaced by James Moroka and a more militant executive containing Sisulu , Mda , Tambo , and Godfrey <unk> . Mandela later related that " [ he and his colleagues ] had [ ... ] guided the ANC to a more radical and revolutionary path . " Having devoted his time to politics , Mandela failed his final year at Witwatersrand three times ; he was ultimately denied his degree in December 1949 . 
 = = = Defiance Campaign and Transvaal ANC Presidency : 1950 – 54 = = = 
 Mandela took Xuma 's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950 , and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL . In March , the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg , bringing together African , Indian , and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule . Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi @-@ racial and not ANC @-@ led , but a majority of black workers took part , resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the Suppression of Communism Act , 1950 , affecting the actions of all protest groups . At the ANC national conference of December 1951 , he continued arguing against a racially united front , but was outvoted . 
 Thenceforth , Mandela rejected Lembede 's Africanist beliefs and embraced the idea of a multi @-@ racial front against apartheid . Influenced by friends like Moses <unk> and by the Soviet Union 's support for wars of independence , his mistrust of communism broke down and he began reading literature by Marxists like Karl Marx , Vladimir Lenin , and Mao Zedong , eventually embracing the Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism . Commenting on communism , he later stated that he " found [ himself ] strongly drawn to the idea of a classless society which , to [ his ] mind , was similar to traditional African culture where life was shared and communal . " In April 1952 , Mandela began work at the H.M. <unk> law firm , which was owned by a communist , although his increasing commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with his family . 
 In 1952 , the ANC began preparation for a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid with Indian and communist groups , founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers . The campaign was designed to follow the path of nonviolent resistance influenced by Mahatma Gandhi ; some supported this for ethical reasons , but Mandela instead considered it pragmatic . At a Durban rally on 22 June , Mandela addressed an assembled crowd of 10 @,@ 000 , initiating the campaign protests , for which he was arrested and briefly interned in Marshall Square prison . The events of the campaign resulted in Mandela establishing himself as one of the best @-@ known black political figures in South Africa . With further protests , the ANC 's membership grew from 20 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 ; the government responded with mass arrests and introduced the Public Safety Act , 1953 to permit martial law . In May , authorities banned Transvaal ANC President J. B. Marks from making public appearances ; unable to maintain his position , he recommended Mandela as his successor . Although <unk> opposed his candidacy , Mandela was elected regional president in October . 
 In July 1952 , Mandela was arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act and stood trial as one of the 21 accused – among them Moroka , Sisulu , and Yusuf <unk> – in Johannesburg . Found guilty of " statutory communism " , a term that the government used to describe most opposition to apartheid , their sentence of nine months ' hard labour was suspended for two years . In December , Mandela was given a six @-@ month ban from attending meetings or talking to more than one individual at a time , making his Transvaal ANC presidency impractical , and during this period the Defiance Campaign petered out . In September 1953 , Andrew Kunene read out Mandela 's " No Easy Walk to Freedom " speech at a Transvaal ANC meeting ; the title was taken from a quote by Indian independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru , a seminal influence on Mandela 's thought . The speech laid out a contingency plan for a scenario in which the ANC was banned . This Mandela Plan , or M @-@ Plan , involved dividing the organisation into a cell structure with a more centralised leadership . 
 Mandela obtained work as an attorney for the firm Terblanche and <unk> , before moving to the liberal @-@ run Helman and Michel , passing qualification exams to become a full @-@ fledged attorney . In August 1953 , Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm , Mandela and Tambo , operating in downtown Johannesburg . The only African @-@ run law firm in the country , it was popular with aggrieved blacks , often dealing with cases of police brutality . Disliked by the authorities , the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act ; as a result , their custom dwindled . As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage , Mandela was part of Johannesburg 's elite black middle @-@ class , and accorded much respect as a result from the black community . Although a second daughter , Makaziwe <unk> , was born in May 1954 , Mandela 's relationship with Evelyn became strained , and she accused him of adultery . Claims have emerged that he was having affairs with ANC member Lillian <unk> and secretary Ruth <unk> ; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child . Disgusted by her son 's behaviour , <unk> returned to Transkei , while Evelyn embraced the Jehovah 's Witnesses and rejected Mandela 's preoccupation with politics . 
 = = = Congress of the People and the Treason Trial : 1955 – 61 = = = 
 After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955 , Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule . He advised Sisulu to request weaponry from the People 's Republic of China , but though the Chinese government supported the anti @-@ apartheid struggle , they believed the movement insufficiently prepared for guerilla warfare . With the involvement of the South African Indian Congress , the Coloured People 's Congress , the South African Congress of Trade Unions and the Congress of Democrats , the ANC planned a Congress of the People , calling on all South Africans to send in proposals for a post @-@ apartheid era . Based on the responses , a Freedom Charter was drafted by Rusty Bernstein , calling for the creation of a democratic , non @-@ racialist state with the nationalisation of major industry . When the charter was adopted at a June 1955 conference in <unk> , attended by 3 @,@ 000 delegates , police cracked down on the event , but it remained a key part of Mandela 's ideology . 
 Following the end of a second ban in September 1955 , Mandela went on a working holiday to Transkei to discuss the implications of the Bantu Authorities Act , 1951 with local tribal leaders , also visiting his mother and <unk> before proceeding to Cape Town . In March 1956 he received his third ban on public appearances , restricting him to Johannesburg for five years , but he often defied it . Mandela 's marriage broke down as Evelyn left him , taking their children to live with her brother . Initiating divorce proceedings in May 1956 , she claimed that Mandela had physically abused her ; he denied the allegations , and fought for custody of their children . She withdrew her petition of separation in November , but Mandela filed for divorce in January 1958 ; the divorce was finalised in March , with the children placed in Evelyn 's care . During the divorce proceedings , he began courting and politicising a social worker , Winnie Madikizela , whom he married in <unk> in June 1958 . She later became involved in ANC activities , spending several weeks in prison . Together they had two children : Zenani , born in February 1959 , and <unk> , born in December 1960 . 
 In December 1956 , Mandela was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive , accused of " high treason " against the state . Held in Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests , they underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail . The defence 's refutation began in January 1957 , overseen by defence lawyer Vernon <unk> , and continued until adjourning in September . In January 1958 , Oswald <unk> was appointed to prosecute the case , and in February the judge ruled that there was " sufficient reason " for the defendants to go on trial in the Transvaal Supreme Court . The formal Treason Trial began in Pretoria in August 1958 , with the defendants successfully applying to have the three judges – all linked to the governing National Party – replaced . In August , one charge was dropped , and in October the prosecution withdrew its indictment , submitting a reformulated version in November which argued that the ANC leadership committed high treason by advocating violent revolution , a charge the defendants denied . 
 In April 1959 , <unk> dissatisfied with the ANC 's united front approach founded the Pan @-@ Africanist Congress ( PAC ) ; Mandela disagreed with the group 's racially exclusionary views , describing them as " immature " and " naïve " . Both parties took part in an anti @-@ pass campaign in early 1960 , in which Africans burned the passes that they were legally obliged to carry . One of the PAC @-@ organised demonstrations was fired upon by police , resulting in the deaths of 69 protesters in the Sharpeville massacre . The incident brought international condemnation of the government and resulted in rioting throughout South Africa , with Mandela publicly burning his pass in solidarity . 
 Responding to the unrest , the government implemented state of emergency measures , declaring martial law and banning the ANC and PAC , while in March they arrested Mandela and other activists , imprisoning them for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison . Imprisonment caused problems for Mandela and his co @-@ defendants in the Treason Trial ; their lawyers could not reach them , and so it was decided that the lawyers would withdraw in protest until the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August 1960 . Over the following months , Mandela used his free time to organise an All @-@ In African Conference near Pietermaritzburg , Natal , in March 1961 , at which 1 @,@ 400 anti @-@ apartheid delegates met , agreeing on a stay @-@ at @-@ home strike to mark 31 May , the day South Africa became a republic . On 29 March 1961 , six years after the Treason Trial began , the judges produced a verdict of not guilty , claiming that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of " high treason " , for they had advocated neither communism nor violent revolution ; the outcome embarrassed the government . 
 = = = MK , the SACP , and African tour : 1961 – 62 = = = 
 Disguised as a chauffeur , Mandela travelled the country incognito , organising the ANC 's new cell structure and the planned mass stay @-@ at @-@ home strike . Referred to as the " Black Pimpernel " in the press – a reference to Emma <unk> 's 1905 novel The Scarlet Pimpernel – a warrant for his arrest was put out by the police . Mandela held secret meetings with reporters , and after the government failed to prevent the strike , he warned them that many anti @-@ apartheid activists would soon resort to violence through groups like the PAC 's <unk> . He believed that the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of this violence in a controlled direction , convincing both ANC leader Albert Luthuli – who was morally opposed to violence – and allied activist groups of its necessity . 
 Inspired by the actions of Fidel Castro 's 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution , in 1961 Mandela , Sisulu , and Slovo co @-@ founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ( " Spear of the Nation " , abbreviated MK ) . Becoming chairman of the militant group , Mandela gained ideas from Marxist literature on guerilla warfare by Mao and Che Guevara as well as from the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz . Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the latter 's reputation , it later became widely recognised that MK was the party 's armed wing . Most early MK members were white communists who were able to hide Mandela in their homes ; after hiding in communist <unk> Kodesh 's flat in Berea , Mandela moved to the communist @-@ owned <unk> Farm in Rivonia , there joined by Raymond Mhlaba , Slovo , and Bernstein , who put together the MK constitution . Although in later life Mandela denied ever being a member of the Communist Party , historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s . This was confirmed by both the SACP and the ANC after Mandela 's death . According to the SACP , he was not only a member of the party , but also served on its Central Committee , but later denied it for political reasons . 
 Operating through a cell structure , MK planned to carry out acts of sabotage that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties ; they sought to bomb military installations , power plants , telephone lines , and transport links at night , when civilians were not present . Mandela stated that they chose sabotage because it was the least harmful action , did not involve killing , and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterwards ; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary . Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on Dingane 's Day ( 16 December ) 1961 , followed by further attacks on New Year 's Eve . 
 The ANC decided to send Mandela as a delegate to the February 1962 Pan @-@ African Freedom Movement for East , Central and Southern Africa ( <unk> ) meeting in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia . Leaving South Africa in secret via Bechuanaland , on his way Mandela visited Tanganyika and met with its president , Julius Nyerere . Arriving in Ethiopia , Mandela met with Emperor Haile Selassie I , and gave his speech after Selassie 's at the conference . After the symposium , he travelled to Cairo , Egypt , admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser , and then went to Tunis , Tunisia , where President Habib <unk> gave him £ 5 @,@ 000 for weaponry . He proceeded to Morocco , Mali , Guinea , Sierra Leone , Liberia , and Senegal , receiving funds from Liberian President William Tubman and Guinean President Ahmed Sékou Touré . Leaving Africa for London , England , he met anti @-@ apartheid activists , reporters , and prominent politicians . Returning to Ethiopia , he began a six @-@ month course in guerrilla warfare , but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa .

 On 5 August 1962 , police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick . Various rumours have circulated suggesting that the authorities were tipped off with regard to Mandela 's whereabouts , although Mandela himself gave these little credence . One idea was that his location had been revealed to South African police by the United States ' Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which feared that Mandela was a communist ; this claim later received support from an ex @-@ U.S. diplomat who claimed involvement in the operation . Jailed in Johannesburg 's Marshall Square prison , Mandela was charged with inciting workers ' strikes and leaving the country without permission . Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor , Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase " the ANC 's moral opposition to racism " while supporters demonstrated outside the court . Moved to Pretoria , where Winnie could visit him , in his cell he began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws ( LLB ) degree from the University of London . His hearing began in October , but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional <unk> , refusing to call any witnesses , and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech . Found guilty , he was sentenced to five years ' imprisonment ; as he left the courtroom , supporters sang " Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika " . 
 In July 1963 , police raided <unk> Farm , arresting those they found there and uncovering paperwork documenting MK 's activities , some of which mentioned Mandela . The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October , with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government ; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar . Judge <unk> de Wet soon threw out the prosecution 's case for insufficient evidence , but Yutar reformulated the charges , presenting his new case from December until February 1964 , calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial . 
 Although four of the accused denied involvement with MK , Mandela and the five other accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the government . They used the trial to highlight their political cause ; at the opening of the defence 's proceedings , Mandela gave his three @-@ hour " I Am Prepared to Die " speech . That speech – which was inspired by Castro 's " History Will Absolve Me " – was widely reported in the press despite official censorship . The trial gained international attention ; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace Council , while the University of London Union voted Mandela to its presidency . On 12 June 1964 , justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co @-@ accused guilty on all four charges ; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied , the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment . 
 = = = Robben Island : 1964 – 82 = = = 
 Mandela and his co @-@ accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island , remaining there for the next 18 years . Isolated from non @-@ political prisoners in Section B , Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) by 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) , with a straw mat on which to sleep . <unk> and physically harassed by several white prison wardens , the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel , until being reassigned in January 1965 to work in a lime quarry . Mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses , and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight . At night , he worked on his LLB degree , but newspapers were forbidden , and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for possessing smuggled news clippings . Initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner , Class D , he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months , although all mail was heavily censored . 
 The political prisoners took part in work and hunger strikes – the latter considered largely ineffective by Mandela – to improve prison conditions , viewing this as a microcosm of the anti @-@ apartheid struggle . ANC prisoners elected him to their four @-@ man " High Organ " along with Sisulu , Govan Mbeki , and Raymond Mhlaba , and he involved himself in a group representing all political prisoners on the island , Ulundi , through which he forged links with PAC and Yu Chi Chan Club members . Initiating the " University of Robben Island " , whereby prisoners lectured on their own areas of expertise , he debated socio @-@ political topics with his comrades . 
 Though attending Christian Sunday services , Mandela studied Islam . He also studied Afrikaans , hoping to build a mutual respect with the warders and convert them to his cause . Various official visitors met with Mandela , most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative Helen <unk> of the Progressive Party , who championed Mandela 's cause outside of prison . In September 1970 , he met British Labour Party MP Dennis Healey . South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974 , but he and Mandela did not get on . His mother visited in 1968 , dying shortly after , and his firstborn son Thembi died in a car accident the following year ; Mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral . His wife was rarely able to visit , being regularly imprisoned for political activity , and his daughters first visited in December 1975 ; Winnie got out of prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in <unk> , still unable to visit him . 
 From 1967 , prison conditions improved ; black prisoners were given trousers rather than shorts , games were permitted , and the standard of their food was raised . In 1969 , an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce , but it was abandoned after the conspiracy was infiltrated by an agent of the South African Bureau of State Security ( BOSS ) , who hoped to see Mandela shot during the escape . In 1970 , Commander Piet Badenhorst became commanding officer . Mandela , seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners , complained to visiting judges , who had Badenhorst reassigned . He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse , who developed a co @-@ operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards . 
 By 1975 , Mandela had become a Class A prisoner , allowing greater numbers of visits and letters ; he corresponded with anti @-@ apartheid activists like Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Desmond Tutu . That year , he began his autobiography , which was smuggled to London , but remained unpublished at the time ; prison authorities discovered several pages , and his study privileges were revoked for four years . Instead , he devoted his spare time to gardening and reading until he resumed his LLB degree studies in 1980 . 
 By the late 1960s , Mandela 's fame had been eclipsed by Steve Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement ( BCM ) . Seeing the ANC as ineffectual , the BCM called for militant action , but following the Soweto uprising of 1976 , many BCM activists were imprisoned on Robben Island . Mandela tried to build a relationship with these young radicals , although he was critical of their racialism and contempt for white anti @-@ apartheid activists . Renewed international interest in his plight came in July 1978 , when he celebrated his 60th birthday . He was awarded an honorary doctorate in Lesotho , the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in India in 1979 , and the Freedom of the City of Glasgow , Scotland in 1981 . In March 1980 , the slogan " Free Mandela ! " was developed by journalist Percy <unk> , sparking an international campaign that led the UN Security Council to call for his release . Despite increasing foreign pressure , the government refused , relying on its Cold War allies US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ; both considered Mandela 's ANC a terrorist organisation sympathetic to communism and supported its suppression . 
 = = = Pollsmoor Prison : 1982 – 88 = = = 
 In April 1982 , Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai , Cape Town along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu , Andrew <unk> , Ahmed <unk> , and Raymond Mhlaba ; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island . Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island , although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island . Getting on well with Pollsmoor 's commanding officer , Brigadier Munro , Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden , and also read voraciously and corresponded widely , now permitted 52 letters a year . He was appointed patron of the multi @-@ racial United Democratic Front ( UDF ) , founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha . Botha 's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments , which had control over education , health , and housing , but black Africans were excluded from the system ; like Mandela , the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti @-@ apartheid movement on racial lines . 
 Violence across the country escalated , with many fearing civil war . Under pressure from an international lobby , multinational banks stopped investing in South Africa , resulting in economic stagnation . Numerous banks and Thatcher asked Botha to release Mandela – then at the height of his international fame – to defuse the volatile situation . Although considering Mandela a dangerous " arch @-@ Marxist " , in February 1985 Botha offered him a release from prison on condition that he " unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon " . Mandela spurned the offer , releasing a statement through his daughter <unk> stating , " What freedom am I being offered while the organisation of the people [ ANC ] remains banned ? Only free men can negotiate . A prisoner cannot enter into contracts . " 
 In 1985 , Mandela underwent surgery on an enlarged prostate gland , before being given new solitary quarters on the ground floor . He was met by " seven eminent persons " , an international delegation sent to negotiate a settlement , but Botha 's government refused to co @-@ operate , in June calling a state of emergency and initiating a police crackdown on unrest . The anti @-@ apartheid resistance fought back , with the ANC committing 231 attacks in 1986 and 235 in 1987 . The violence escalated as the government used the army and police to combat the resistance , and provided covert support for vigilante groups and the Zulu nationalist movement Inkatha , which was involved in an increasingly violent struggle with the ANC . Mandela requested talks with Botha but was denied , instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice <unk> <unk> in 1987 , having a further 11 meetings over the next three years . <unk> organised negotiations between Mandela and a team of four government figures starting in May 1988 ; the team agreed to the release of political prisoners and the legalisation of the ANC on the condition that they permanently renounce violence , break links with the Communist Party , and not insist on majority rule . Mandela rejected these conditions , insisting that the ANC would only end its armed activities when the government renounced violence . 
 Mandela 's 70th birthday in July 1988 attracted international attention , notably with a tribute concert at London 's Wembley Stadium that was televised and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers . Although presented globally as a heroic figure , he faced personal problems when ANC leaders informed him that Winnie had set herself up as head of a criminal gang , the " Mandela United Football Club " , who had been responsible for torturing and killing opponents – including children – in Soweto . Though some encouraged him to divorce her , he decided to remain loyal until she was found guilty by trial . 
 = = = Victor Verster Prison and release : 1988 – 90 = = = 
 Recovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the dank conditions in his cell , in December 1988 Mandela was moved to Victor Verster Prison near Paarl . He was housed in the relative comfort of a warder 's house with a personal cook , and used the time to complete his LLB degree . While there , he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo . 
 In 1989 , Botha suffered a stroke , retaining the state presidency but stepping down as leader of the National Party , to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk . In a surprise move , Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989 , an invitation Mandela considered genial . Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later ; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners . Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 , de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela . Although some were deeply opposed to his plans , de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation , a meeting both men considered friendly , before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela 's unconditional release . Shortly thereafter , for the first time in 20 years , photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa . 
 Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February , Mandela held Winnie 's hand in front of amassed crowds and press ; the event was broadcast live across the world . Driven to Cape Town 's City Hall through crowds , he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority , but made it clear that the ANC 's armed struggle was not over , and would continue as " a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid " . He expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations , so that " there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle " , and insisted that his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right to vote in national and local elections . Staying at the home of Desmond Tutu , in the following days Mandela met with friends , activists , and press , giving a speech to an estimated 100 @,@ 000 people at Johannesburg 's Soccer City .

 Mandela proceeded on an African tour , meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia , Zimbabwe , Namibia , Libya and Algeria , continuing to Sweden , where he was reunited with Tambo , and then London , where he appeared at the Nelson Mandela : An International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley Stadium . Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government , in France he was welcomed by President François Mitterrand , in Vatican City by Pope John Paul II , and in the United Kingdom by Thatcher . In the United States , he met President George H.W. Bush , addressed both Houses of Congress and visited eight cities , being particularly popular among the African @-@ American community . In Cuba , he met President Castro , whom he had long admired , with the two becoming friends . He met President R. Venkataraman in India , President Suharto in Indonesia , Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia , Prime Minister Bob Hawke in Australia , and visited Japan ; he did not visit the Soviet Union , a longtime ANC supporter . 
 In May 1990 , Mandela led a multiracial ANC delegation into preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men . Mandela impressed them with his discussions of Afrikaner history , and the negotiations led to the Groot Schuur Minute , in which the government lifted the state of emergency . In August , Mandela – recognising the ANC 's severe military disadvantage – offered a ceasefire , the Pretoria Minute , for which he was widely criticised by MK activists . He spent much time trying to unify and build the ANC , appearing at a Johannesburg conference in December attended by 1600 delegates , many of whom found him more moderate than expected . At the ANC 's July 1991 national conference in Durban , Mandela admitted the party 's faults and announced his aim to build a " strong and well @-@ oiled task force " for securing majority rule . At the conference , he was elected ANC President , replacing the ailing Tambo , and a 50 @-@ strong multiracial , mixed gendered national executive was elected . 
 Mandela was given an office in the newly purchased ANC headquarters at Shell House , Johannesburg , and moved into Winnie 's large Soweto home . Their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her affair with Dali <unk> , but he supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault . He gained funding for her defence from the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison , reduced to two on appeal . On 13 April 1992 , Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie . The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds ; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton . Mandela 's prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in " black @-@ on @-@ black " violence , particularly between ANC and Inkatha supporters in KwaZulu @-@ Natal , which resulted in thousands of deaths . Mandela met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi , but the ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue . Mandela argued that there was a " third force " within the state intelligence services fuelling the " slaughter of the people " and openly blamed de Klerk – whom he increasingly distrusted – for the Sebokeng massacre . In September 1991 , a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg at which Mandela , Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord , though the violence continued . 
 = = = CODESA talks : 1991 – 92 = = = 
 The Convention for a Democratic South Africa ( CODESA ) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Center , attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties . Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC 's delegation , Mandela remained a key figure , and after de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the ANC 's violence , he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the " head of an illegitimate , discredited minority regime " . Dominated by the National Party and ANC , little negotiation was achieved . CODESA 2 was held in May 1992 , at which de Klerk insisted that post @-@ apartheid South Africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities ; Mandela opposed this , demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule . Following the <unk> massacre of ANC activists by government @-@ aided Inkatha militants , Mandela called off the negotiations , before attending a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Senegal , at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South Africa to prevent " state terrorism " . Calling for domestic mass action , in August the ANC organised the largest @-@ ever strike in South African history , and supporters marched on Pretoria . 
 Following the <unk> massacre , in which 28 ANC supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the <unk> Defence Force during a protest march , Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September . He agreed to do so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released , that Zulu traditional weapons be banned , and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off , the latter two measures intended to prevent further Inkatha attacks ; de Klerk reluctantly agreed . The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held , resulting in a five @-@ year coalition government of national unity and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence . The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants ; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism . The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model , guaranteeing separation of powers , creating a constitutional court , and including a <unk> bill of rights ; it also divided the country into nine provinces , each with its own premier and civil service , a concession between de Klerk 's desire for federalism and Mandela 's for unitary government . 
 The democratic process was threatened by the Concerned South Africans Group ( <unk> ) , an alliance of far @-@ right Afrikaner parties and black ethnic @-@ secessionist groups like Inkatha ; in June 1993 , the white supremacist Afrikaner <unk> ( AWB ) attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre . Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani , Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting , soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo , who had died of a stroke . In July 1993 , both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US , independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal . Soon after , Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway . Influenced by Thabo Mbeki , Mandela began meeting with big business figures , and played down his support for nationalisation , fearing that he would scare away much @-@ needed foreign investment . Although criticised by socialist ANC members , he was encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland . 
 = = = General election : 1994 = = = 
 With the election set for 27 April 1994 , the ANC began campaigning , opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People 's Forums across the country , at which Mandela could appear , as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans . The ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and Development Programme ( RDP ) to build a million houses in five years , introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity . The party 's slogan was " a better life for all " , although it was not explained how this development would be funded . With the exception of the Weekly Mail and the New Nation , South Africa 's press opposed Mandela 's election , fearing continued ethnic strife , instead supporting the National or Democratic Party . Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC , touring North America , Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors , including former supporters of the apartheid regime . He also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14 ; rejected by the ANC , this policy became the subject of ridicule . 
 Concerned that <unk> would undermine the election , particularly in the wake of the conflict in <unk> and the Shell House Massacre – incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha , respectively – Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals , including P. W. Botha , Pik Botha and <unk> Viljoen , persuading many to work within the democratic system , and with de Klerk convinced Inkatha 's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession . As leaders of the two major parties , de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate ; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event , Mandela 's offer to shake his hand surprised him , leading some commentators to consider it a victory for Mandela . The election went ahead with little violence , although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs . As widely expected , the ANC won a sweeping victory , taking 63 % of the vote , just short of the two @-@ thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution . The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces , with Inkatha and the National Party each taking another . Mandela voted at the <unk> High School in Durban , and though the ANC 's victory assured his election as President , he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage . 
 = = Presidency of South Africa : 1994 – 99 = = 
 The newly elected National Assembly 's first act was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa 's first black chief executive . His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994 , televised to a billion viewers globally . The event was attended by 4 @,@ 000 guests , including world leaders from disparate backgrounds . Mandela headed a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC – which alone had no experience of governance – but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha . Under the Interim Constitution , Inkatha and the National Party were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats . In keeping with earlier agreements , both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were given the position of Deputy President . Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job , Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency , allowing him to organise policy details . Moving into the presidential office at <unk> in Cape Town , Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate , instead settling into the nearby <unk> manor , which he renamed " <unk> " , meaning " Valley of Mercy " in Afrikaans . Retaining his Houghton home , he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu , which he visited regularly , walking around the area , meeting with locals , and judging tribal disputes . 
 Aged 76 , he faced various ailments , and although exhibiting continued energy , he felt isolated and lonely . He often entertained celebrities , such as Michael Jackson , Whoopi Goldberg , and the Spice Girls , and befriended ultra @-@ rich businessmen , like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo @-@ American as well as Queen Elizabeth II on her March 1995 state visit to South Africa , resulting in strong criticism from ANC anti @-@ capitalists . Despite his opulent surroundings , Mandela lived simply , donating a third of his R 552 @,@ 000 annual income to the Nelson Mandela Children 's Fund , which he had founded in 1995 . Although dismantling press censorship , speaking out in favour of freedom of the press , and befriending many journalists , Mandela was critical of much of the country 's media , noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle @-@ class whites and believing that it focused too much on scaremongering around crime . Mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day and after assuming the presidency he became so associated with Batik shirts that they came to be known as " Madiba shirts " . 
 In December 1994 , Mandela published Long Walk to Freedom , an autobiography based around a manuscript he had written in prison , augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel . In late 1994 , he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in Bloemfontein , at which a more militant national executive was elected , among them Winnie Mandela ; although she expressed an interest in reconciling , Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995 . By 1995 , he had entered into a relationship with Graça Machel , a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel . They had first met in July 1990 when she was still in mourning , but their friendship grew into a partnership , with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits . She turned down Mandela 's first marriage proposal , wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg . 
 = = = National reconciliation = = = 
 Presiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy , Mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency . Having seen other post @-@ colonial African economies damaged by the departure of white elites , Mandela worked to reassure South Africa 's white population that they were protected and represented in " the Rainbow Nation " . Although his Government of National Unity would be dominated by the ANC , he attempted to create a broad coalition by appointing de Klerk as Deputy President and appointing other National Party officials as ministers for Agriculture , Energy , Environment , and Minerals and Energy , as well as naming Buthelezi as Minister for Home Affairs . The other cabinet positions were taken by ANC members , many of whom – like Joe <unk> , Alfred <unk> , Joe Slovo , Mac Maharaj and Dullah Omar – had long been comrades , although others , such as Tito <unk> and Jeff Radebe , were much younger . Mandela 's relationship with de Klerk was strained ; Mandela thought that de Klerk was intentionally provocative , and de Klerk felt that he was being intentionally humiliated by the president . In January 1995 , Mandela heavily chastised him for awarding amnesty to 3 @,@ 500 police officers just before the election , and later criticised him for defending former Minister of Defence Magnus Malan when the latter was charged with murder . 
 Mandela personally met with senior figures of the apartheid regime , including Hendrik Verwoerd 's widow , Betsie <unk> , and lawyer Percy Yutar , also laying a wreath by the statue of Afrikaner hero Daniel Theron . Emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation , he announced that " courageous people do not fear forgiving , for the sake of peace . " He encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team , the Springboks , as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup . After the Springboks won a celebrated final against New Zealand , Mandela presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar , an Afrikaner , wearing a Springbok shirt with Pienaar 's own number 6 on the back . This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans ; as de Klerk later put it , " Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans . " Mandela 's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites , but also drew criticism from more militant blacks . Among the latter was his estranged wife , Winnie , who accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing the white community than in helping the black majority . 
 Mandela oversaw the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC , appointing Desmond Tutu as its chair . To prevent the creation of martyrs , the Commission granted individual amnesties in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid era . Dedicated in February 1996 , it held two years of hearings detailing rapes , torture , bombings , and assassinations , before issuing its final report in October 1998 . Both de Klerk and Mbeki appealed to have parts of the report suppressed , though only de Klerk 's appeal was successful . Mandela praised the Commission 's work , stating that it " had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future " .
