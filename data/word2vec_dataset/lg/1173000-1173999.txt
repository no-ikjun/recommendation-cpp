 = = Recognition and awards = = 
 In 2001 Jansch received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards , and on 5 June 2006 , he received the MOJO Merit Award at the Mojo Honours List ceremony , based on " an expanded career that still continues to be inspirational " . The award was presented by Beth Orton and Roy Harper . Rolling Stone ranked Jansch as No. 94 on its list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time in 2003 . 
 In January 2007 , the five original members of Pentangle ( including Jansch ) were given a Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards . The award was presented by Sir David Attenborough . Producer John Leonard said " Pentangle were one of the most influential groups of the late 20th century and it would be wrong for the awards not to recognise what an impact they had on the music scene . " Pentangle played together for the event , for the first time in more than two decades , and their performance was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on Wednesday , 7 February 2007 . In 2007 , Jansch was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music by Edinburgh Napier University , " in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the UK music industry " . 
 = = Music = = 
 Bert Jansch 's musical influences included Big Bill Broonzy and Brownie McGhee , whom Jansch first saw playing at The Howff in 1960 and , much later , claimed that he 'd " still be a gardener " if he hadn 't encountered McGhee and his music . Jansch was also strongly influenced by the British folk music tradition , particularly by Anne Briggs and , to a lesser extent , A.L. Lloyd . Other influences included jazz ( notably Charles Mingus ) , early music ( John Renbourn and Julian Bream ) and other contemporary singer @-@ songwriters – especially Clive Palmer . The other major influence was Davey Graham who , himself , brought together an eclectic mixture of musical styles . Also , in his formative years , Jansch had busked his way through Europe to Morocco , picking up musical ideas and rhythms from many sources . From these influences , he distilled his own individual guitar style . 
 Some of his songs feature a basic <unk> style of right @-@ hand playing but these are often distinguished by unusual chord voicings or by chords with added notes . An example of this is his song " Needle of Death " , which features a simple picking style but several of the chords are decorated with added ninths . Characteristically , the ninths are not the highest note of the chord , but appear in the middle of the arpeggiated finger @-@ picking , creating a " <unk> " to the sound . 
 Another characteristic feature was his ability to hold a chord in the lower strings whilst bending an upper string — often bending up from a semitone below a chord note . These can be heard clearly on songs such as " Reynardine " where the bends are from the diminished fifth to the perfect fifth . Jansch often fitted the accompaniment to the natural rhythm of the words of his songs , rather than playing a consistent rhythm throughout . This can lead to occasional bars appearing in unusual time signatures . For example , his version of the Ewan MacColl song " The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face " , unlike most other covers of that song , switches from 4 / 4 time to 3 / 4 and 5 / 4 . A similar disregard for conventional time signatures is found in several of his collaborative compositions with Pentangle : for instance , " Light Flight " from the Basket of Light album includes sections in 5 / 8 , 7 / 8 and 6 / 4 time . 
 = = Instruments = = 
 Through the development of Pentangle , Jansch played a number of instruments : banjo , Appalachian dulcimer , recorder and concertina — on rare occasions he has even been known to play electric guitar . However , it is his acoustic guitar playing that was most notable . 
 Jansch 's first guitar was home @-@ made from a kit but when he left school and started work , he bought a Höfner cello @-@ style guitar . Soon he traded this in for a Zenith which was marketed as the " Lonnie Donegan guitar " and which Jansch played in the folk clubs in the early 1960s . His first album was reputedly recorded using a Martin 00028 borrowed from Martin Carthy . Pictures of Jansch in the middle 1960s show him playing a variety of models , including Martin and Epiphone guitars . He had a guitar hand @-@ built by John Bailey , which was used for most of the Pentangle recordings but was eventually stolen . 
 Jansch later played two six @-@ string guitars built by the Coventry @-@ based luthier , Rob Armstrong , one of which appears on the front and back covers of the 1980 <unk> release , Best of Bert Jansch . He then had a contract with Yamaha , who provided him with an <unk> which he played , along with a Yamaha <unk> 1970s jumbo guitar . Jansch 's relationship with Yamaha continued and they presented him with an acoustic guitar with gold trim and abalone inlay for his 60th birthday although , valued at about £ 3000 , Jansch was quoted as saying that it is too good for stage use . Jansch was a well @-@ known Fylde guitar player . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Jansch 's music , and particularly his acoustic guitar playing , have influenced a range of well @-@ known musicians . His first album ( Bert Jansch , 1965 ) was much admired , with Jimmy Page saying " At one point , I was absolutely obsessed with Bert Jansch . When I first heard that LP , I couldn 't believe it . It was so far ahead of what everyone else was doing . No one in America could touch that . " The same debut album included Jansch 's version of the Davy Graham instrumental " Angie " . This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield , who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child , and was then heavily influenced by Jansch 's style . The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band ( with sister Sally ) The <unk> . 
 Jansch 's version of " Angie " inspired Paul Simon 's recording of the piece , which was retitled " Anji " and appeared on the Simon & Garfunkel album Sounds of Silence . From the same era , Neil Young is quoted as saying , " As much of a great guitar player as Jimi [ Hendrix ] was , Bert Jansch is the same thing for acoustic guitar ... and my favourite . " Nick Drake and Donovan were both admirers of Jansch : both recorded covers of his songs and Donovan went on to dedicate two of his own songs to Jansch ; " Bert 's Blues " appeared on his Sunshine Superman LP , and " House of Jansch " on his fourth album Mellow Yellow . Other tributes included Gordon <unk> 's album <unk> ( 2000 ) which has two tunes by Jansch , plus two others that show his influence . Further afield , the Japanese acoustic guitar player Tsuneo <unk> is known to have been heavily influenced by Jansch .

 = Franklin Center ( Chicago ) = 
 The Franklin Center is a 60 @-@ story supertall skyscraper completed in 1989 as the AT & T Corporate Center to consolidate the central region headquarters of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company ( AT & T ) . It stands at a height of 1 @,@ 007 ft ( 307 m ) and contains 1 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 160 @,@ 000 m2 ) in the Loop neighborhood of downtown Chicago . It is located two blocks east of the Chicago River and northeast of the Willis Tower with a main address of 227 West Monroe Street and an alternate address of 100 South Franklin Street. in the Loop community area of downtown Chicago . 
 The supertall building is the tallest constructed in Chicago in the last quarter of the 20th century . It is the 5th tallest building in Chicago and the 13th tallest in the United States . It contains office and retail space and a 350 @-@ space garage . 
 Tishman Speyer acquired the property in 2004 and renamed the adjacent USG Building as Franklin Center in 2007 after USG relocated its offices . The name was later applied to the entire complex . 
 = = History = = 
 A 1982 consent decree split the American Telephone & Telegraph Company monopoly into several entities with local service providers becoming part of a Regional Bell Operating Company . In the decade that followed , AT & T erected new buildings across the country including the AT & T Building in New York City . April 5 , 1985 , AT & T issued a request for proposals that produced eleven respondents . Stein and Co . , the winning realtor , sought Skidmore , Owings and Merrill as designers for the purpose of distinguishing a proposal from the nearby Willis Tower . AT & T employees began to occupy the office space April 3 , 1989 . 
 The building was built under a self @-@ imposed comprehensive minority contracting and affirmative action package that met the city 's 1985 30 % hiring rule for public sector projects . Chicago mayor Harold Washington 's administration had passed an edict that 30 % of the work for public sector projects be set aside for minority and women @-@ owned businesses . In a show of support for this rule , Stein & Co. and AT & T adopted the rule for their private development .

 Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore , Owings & Merrill , the Franklin Center , is one of the most famous and recognized buildings in Chicago . The building 's form features setbacks at the 15th , 30th and 45th floors . Designed in the postmodern architectural style , it is a granite @-@ clad steel @-@ framed building resting on pile foundations . The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines , spiked roof pinnacles , granite cladding and setbacks . The granite is a deep red color at the base , but changes shade to rose @-@ beige at the top . Above the 5th floor , the lighter rose @-@ beige granite is protected by silk @-@ screened aluminum panels . The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality . The building 's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings , and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building . In addition to its design , the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart .

 Born in Eugene , Oregon in 1968 , Applegate attended Amherst College as an undergraduate , where she began a two @-@ decade fascination with famous alumnus Henry Ward Beecher , a 19th @-@ century abolitionist minister who was later the subject of a widely publicized sex scandal . She made Beecher the subject of her dissertation in American Studies at Yale , where she received a Ph.D. in 1998 . After several more years of research , Applegate published The Most Famous Man in America , which was praised by critics and awarded the Pulitzer Prize . She has announced that her second book will be a biography of New York City brothel @-@ keeper Polly Adler .

 Born in Eugene , Oregon , Applegate grew up in Clackamas , Oregon , graduating from Clackamas High School in 1985 . She was raised in what she described as an " unusual religious environment " : her mother , from a Mormon family , became a New Thought minister , while her father was an Irish Catholic . She graduated summa cum laude from Amherst College in 1989 and was a Sterling Fellow at Yale University , where she earned a Ph.D. in American Studies in 1998 . 
 Applegate has taught at Yale , Wesleyan University , and Marymount Manhattan College . Her contributions have appeared in The Journal of American History and The New York Times .

 = = The Most Famous Man in America = = 
 As an undergraduate student worker at Amherst College , Applegate was assigned to assemble an exhibit on a famous alumnus and selected Henry Ward Beecher , a 19th @-@ century minister known for his abolitionist preaching and widely publicized sex scandal . Applegate described him as " unlike any religious figure I ’ d ever seen . I loved his very modern sense of humor , his irreverence , and his joyful , ecumenical approach to religion and life in general . " She later made him the subject of her undergraduate senior thesis and her PhD dissertation at Yale University . After graduation , Applegate signed a publishing contract to write a biography of Beecher . 
 Applegate 's initial chapters were written in what she considered an overly academic voice , so to write a biography with popular appeal , she studied fiction writing , including techniques for suspense and pornographic writing . She structured the resulting book as a psychological thriller . 
 Though she had originally hoped to publish the book during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal , in which US President Bill Clinton was discovered to have had a sexual relationship with a White House intern , the research took several years longer than she had initially planned . The book was finally released in 2006 by Doubleday .

 The Most Famous Man in America was sold well and was generally praised by critics . NPR selected it as one of the year 's best nonfiction books , stating that the book " convinces readers of the truth of that swaggering title " . Kirkus Reviews called it a " beautifully written biography of America 's one best @-@ known preacher ... An exceptionally thorough and thoughtful account of a spectacular career that helped shape and reflect national preoccupations before , during and after the Civil War . " Publishers Weekly wrote that " this assessment of Beecher is judicious and critical . Applegate gives an insightful account . " In a review for The Boston Globe , Katherine A. Powers called the book a " fantastic story with novelistic flair and penetration into the ever @-@ changing motives and expediencies of its many actors . " Michael Kazin , reviewing the book for The New York Times , stated that Applegate 's writing occasionally " loses its force in a thicket of personal details " , but concluded that the book is " a biography worthy of its subject " . 
 On April 16 , 2007 , the book was announced as the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography . Applegate said of her win , " Half of it is just good luck ... Had it come out four years ago , I don 't think the climate was ready for it . The religious right intersection with politics is very important now . "

Applegate 's book is to be titled Madam : The Notorious Life and Times of Polly Adler and will be published by Doubleday . 
 = Lawrence Kohlberg 's stages of moral development = 
 Lawrence Kohlberg 's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget . Kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago in 1958 , and expanded and developed this theory throughout his life . 
 The theory holds that moral reasoning , the basis for ethical behavior , has six identifiable developmental stages , each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor . Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget , who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages . Expanding on Piaget 's work , Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice , and that it continued throughout the individual 's lifetime , a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research . 
 The six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels : pre @-@ conventional morality , conventional morality , and post @-@ conventional morality . 
 For his studies , Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma , and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas . He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed , rather than its conclusion , and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages . 
 There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives . Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values , such as caring ; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains ; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations ( by both decision makers and psychologists studying them ) of essentially intuitive decisions . 
 Nevertheless , an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg 's theory , and according to <unk> et al . ' s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century , Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century , as well as the 30th most eminent overall . 
 Kohlberg 's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone 's behavior is . There should , however , be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave , and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible , consistent and predictable from people at higher levels . 
 = = Stages = = 
 Kohlberg 's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each : pre @-@ conventional , conventional and post @-@ conventional . Following Piaget 's constructivist requirements for a stage model , as described in his theory of cognitive development , it is extremely rare to regress in stages — to lose the use of higher stage abilities . Stages cannot be skipped ; each provides a new and necessary perspective , more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them . 
 Level 1 ( Pre @-@ Conventional ) 
 1 . Obedience and punishment orientation 
 ( How can I avoid punishment ? ) 
 2 . Self @-@ interest orientation 
 ( What 's in it for me ? ) 
 ( Paying for a benefit ) 
 Level 2 ( Conventional ) 
 3 . Interpersonal accord and conformity 
 ( Social norms ) 
 ( The good boy / girl attitude ) 
 4 . Authority and social @-@ order maintaining orientation 
 ( Law and order morality ) 
 Level 3 ( Post @-@ Conventional ) 
 5 . Social contract orientation 
 6 . Universal ethical principles 
 ( <unk> conscience ) 
 The understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages , but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic , lacking in sufficient attention to detail . 
 = = = Pre @-@ conventional = = = 
 The pre @-@ conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children , although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning . <unk> at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences . The pre @-@ conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner . A child with pre @-@ conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society 's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring . 
 In Stage one ( obedience and punishment driven ) , individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves . For example , an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished . " The last time I did that I got spanked , so I will not do it again . " The worse the punishment for the act is , the more " bad " the act is perceived to be . This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering . It is " egocentric , " lacking recognition that others ' points of view are different from one 's own . There is " deference to superior power or prestige . " 
 An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment . For example , a child 's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school . The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished . 
 Stage two ( self @-@ interest driven ) expresses the " what 's in it for me " position , in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one 's reputation or relationships to groups of people . Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others , but only to a point where it might further the individual 's own interests . As a result , concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect , but rather a " You scratch my back , and I 'll scratch yours " mentality . The lack of a societal perspective in the pre @-@ conventional level is quite different from the social contract ( stage five ) , as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual 's own needs or interests . For the stage two theorist , the world 's perspective is often seen as morally relative . 
 An example of self @-@ interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore . The child asks , " what 's in it for me ? " The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores . The child is motivated by self @-@ interest to do chores . 
 = = = Conventional = = = 
 The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults . To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society 's views and expectations . The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development . Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society 's conventions concerning right and wrong . At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society 's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience . Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid , however , and a rule 's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned . 
 In Stage three ( good intentions as determined by social consensus ) , the self enters society by conforming to social standards . Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society 's views . They try to be a " good boy " or " good girl " to live up to these expectations , having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self . Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person 's relationships , which now begin to include things like respect , gratitude , and the " golden rule " . " I want to be liked and thought well of ; apparently , not being naughty makes people like me . " Conforming to the rules for one 's social role is not yet fully understood . The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage ; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that " they mean well " . 
 In Stage four ( authority and social order obedience driven ) , it is important to obey laws , <unk> , and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society . Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three . A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong . If one person violates a law , perhaps everyone would — thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules . When someone does violate a law , it is morally wrong ; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones . Most active members of society remain at stage four , where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force . 
 = = = Post @-@ Conventional = = = 
 The post @-@ conventional level , also known as the principled level , is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society , and that the individual ’ s own perspective may take precedence over society ’ s view ; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles . Post @-@ conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles — principles that typically include such basic human rights as life , liberty , and justice . People who exhibit post @-@ conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms — ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights . Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question . Because post @-@ conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions , their behavior , especially at stage six , can be confused with that of those at the pre @-@ conventional level . 
 Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning . 
 In Stage five ( social contract driven ) , the world is viewed as holding different opinions , rights , and values . Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community . Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts . Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “ the greatest good for the greatest number of people " . This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise . Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning . 
 In Stage six ( universal ethical principles driven ) , moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles . Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice , and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws . Legal rights are unnecessary , as social contracts are not essential for <unk> moral action . Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way , as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant . This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another ’ s shoes , if they believed what that other person imagines to be true . The resulting consensus is the action taken . In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself ; the individual acts because it is right , and not because it avoids punishment , is in their best interest , expected , legal , or previously agreed upon . Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists , he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level . 
 = = = Further stages = = = 
 In Kohlberg 's empirical studies of individuals throughout their life Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression . This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory . Kohlberg chose the latter , postulating the existence of sub @-@ stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality . In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4 ½ or 4 + , a transition from stage four to stage five , that shared characteristics of both . In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning ; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable . This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two , as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong . Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college . 
 Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage — Transcendental Morality , or Morality of Cosmic Orientation — which linked religion with moral reasoning . Kohlberg 's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage , however , led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage . 
 = = Theoretical assumptions ( philosophy ) = = 
 Kohlberg 's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative , capable of reason , and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them . The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals , and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual 's actions or character . Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions , Kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments , a position he calls " formalism " . 
 Kohlberg 's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning . Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles . Despite being a justice @-@ centered theory of morality , Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of <unk> and <unk> . 
 Kohlberg 's theory understands values as a critical component of the right . Whatever the right is , for Kohlberg , it must be universally valid across societies ( a position known as " moral universalism " ) : there can be no relativism . Moreover , morals are not natural features of the world ; they are prescriptive . Nevertheless , moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity . 
 According to Kohlberg : someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages . For example , an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments ( stage three ) to being a proponent of social contracts ( stage five ) . On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory , however , an individual will look to the next level . Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development , as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last . The process is therefore considered to be constructive , as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual , and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual 's innate dispositions , or a result of past inductions . 
 = = = Formal elements = = = 
 Progress through Kohlberg 's stages happens as a result of the individual 's increasing competence , both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social @-@ value claims . The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called " justice operation . " Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations : " equality , " which involves an impartial regard for persons , and " reciprocity , " which means a regard for the role of personal merit . For Kohlberg , the most adequate result of both operations is " reversibility , " in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation ( also known colloquially as " moral musical chairs " ) . 
 Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development . Specifically important are the individual 's " view of persons " and their " social perspective level " , each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage . The " view of persons " can be understood as the individual 's grasp of the psychology of other persons ; it may be pictured as a spectrum , with stage one having no view of other persons at all , and stage six being entirely socio @-@ centric . Similarly , the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe , differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms . 
 = = Examples of applied moral dilemmas = = 
 Kohlberg established the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation . During the roughly 45 @-@ minute tape recorded semi @-@ structured interview , the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses . The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision . The participant is asked a systemic series of open @-@ ended questions , like what they think the right course of action is , as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong . The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content ; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived . 
 A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist 's dilemma : Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe . 
 = = Criticisms = = 
 One criticism of Kohlberg 's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values , and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions . Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg 's theory is overly androcentric . Kohlberg 's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants ; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women . Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3 , focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends . Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles , and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved . Consistent with this observation , Gilligan 's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice . She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring . Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers , however , argued that Gilligan 's research is ill @-@ founded , and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion . 
 Kohlberg 's stages are not culturally neutral , as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures . Although they progress through the stages in the same order , individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates . Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs , his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning , rather than to those beliefs . 
 Another criticism of Kohlberg ’ s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements . This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage , typically using more self @-@ interest driven reasoning ( i.e. , stage two ) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning ( i.e. , stage four ) . Kohlberg ’ s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning . <unk> has argued that Kohlberg ’ s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules . This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives . Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg ’ s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings , but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives . 
 Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning . Social <unk> such as Jonathan <unk> , for example , argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness , law , human rights , or abstract ethical values . Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions ; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg 's theory suggests . 
 = = Continued relevance = = 
 Kohlberg 's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field . One example is the Defining Issues Test ( DIT ) created in 1979 by James Rest , originally as a pencil @-@ and @-@ paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview . Heavily influenced by the six @-@ stage model , it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test , the Likert scale , to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg 's . It also used a large body of <unk> theory such as the idea of " post @-@ conventional thinking " . In 1999 the DIT was revised as the DIT @-@ 2 ; the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required , such as divinity , politics , and medicine . 
 = Fort Pasir Panjang = 
 Fort Pasir Panjang or Labrador Battery is located within the lush Labrador Park at the southern tip of Singapore island . It was one of the 11 coastal artillery forts built by the British in the 19th century to defend the western passageway into Keppel Harbour against piracy and foreign naval powers . During the 1942 Battle of Pasir Panjang , the fort played a supporting role but a limited one in defending the Malay Regiments against the Japanese invasion at Bukit Chandu . In 1995 , the site was gazetted by the National Heritage Board as one of the 11 World War II sites in Singapore . 
 = = History = = 
 Labrador was named after Labrador Bay which it overlooks the deep and calm water off its shores . The Long Ya Men or " Dragon 's Teeth Gate " , two craggy granite outcrops formerly stood on each side of the entrance to the New Harbour ( now Keppel Harbour ) as a navigation landmark to ancient mariners . The two rock outcrops were subsequently blown up by the Straits Settlement surveyor , John Thomson , in August 1848 to widen the entrance to the harbour . Labrador 's strategic value was recognised by the British as early as 1843 when plans were made to set up defences to protect Singapore , an important trading post founded by Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company in 1819 . 
 = = = Piracy = = = 
 The New Harbour was later renamed as Keppel Harbour in 1900 after Admiral Sir Henry Keppel of HMS Meander , who carried out an on @-@ site survey to build an anchorage in the harbour in the 1880s . He was also known for his successful campaigns against the pirates in 1842 that were boldly harassing merchant ships in close proximity to the harbour . Piracy became less of a danger to the trade of Singapore only from the 1850s . 
 The original , Western Harbour limit is marked by a white obelisk , near the former site of Long Ya Men . This obelisk still stands at Tanjong <unk> Point ( " Tanjong " means " land 's end " in Malay ) to indicate where the southernmost tip of the Asian Continent was . 
 = = = Defenses = = = 
 In 1878 , as part of the review of the defences of Singapore against threats from European powers in the region , it was decided that forts be built on either side of the entrance to New Harbour . Fort Pasir Panjang was built on Labrador and Fort Siloso on Pulau <unk> Mati ( now Sentosa ) . It was found that the steep cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding the two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders . 
 = = = = Underwater mines = = = = 
 To strengthen the defence further , by 1881 , mines were laid in the waters between the two forts and the eastern entrance of the harbour . The mines were tethered to the seabed but floated dangerously under the surface of the water unseen to any enemy marine vessels . To enable safe passage of ships , a ' friendly safe channel ' was created through the minefields . The work involved in the laying of minefields under the narrow channel ( just 240 m apart ) had actually led to rumours that tunnels running under the channels were constructed to link the two forts . There are , however , no archival records to prove that these tunnels were ever constructed . 
 = = = = Gun emplacements = = = = 
 The Fort came under the operation of the 7th Coast Artillery Regiment , which received orders from Faber Fire Command led by Brigadier A.D. Curtiss . A gun emplacement is a position or platform specially prepared to support large heavy guns and artillery . The first type of gun put on Fort Pasir Panjang was the 7 @-@ inch Rifled Muzzle @-@ Loading ( R.M.L. ) . Two of these guns were first installed in 1878 so as to provide a temporary defence for the fort . They were , however , removed soon after . 
 The defence reviews of 1885 , then proposed that these guns be reinstalled together with the 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch Rifled <unk> @-@ Loading ( <unk> ) guns . While the latter guns came into the Fort much later , the 7 @-@ inch R.M.L. were already in place by 1886 . 
 In 1896 , a proposal was forwarded to replace the 7 @-@ inch R.M.L. gun with two 6 @-@ inch Quick @-@ Firing ( Q.F. ) guns . This came out of the suggestion that the 7 @-@ inch R.M.L. has neither sufficient range accuracy nor rapidity of fire for effective defence . Even the engineer of the Fort , H.E. McCallum referred to these guns as being " the worst in the service " . 
 The emplacement was eventually modified to contain 2 × 6 in ( 152 mm ) Q.F. guns . This modern type of gun definitely better in terms of its accuracy and rapidity to counter the speedy motor torpedo boats that appeared in the 1880s . Each shell used by these 6 @-@ inch Q.F. weighed 45 kilograms .

 The Casemate was built in 1886 to serve as an ammunition store for the guns . It also acted as a shelter for gunners and infantry groups stationed at the Fort . It is situated at the highest point of the hill and served the 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch R.M.L. guns nearby . The casemate has four rooms , one of the rooms held the entrance to a tunnel that led to underground store rooms beneath the first emplacement . Lim Bo Seng , a war hero of Singapore , was a major brick supplier in the late 1930s , with his main client , the colonial government . Bricks supplied by Lim lay in certain sections of the casemates at the Fort . His other projects included the construction of Alexandra Hospital , the army barracks in Changi and many defence works in the 1930s . 
 = = = = Tunnels = = = = 
 The tunnels , constructed in 1886 , leads to underground storerooms constructed to serve gun emplacements located directly above it . To date , the tunnels serving Gun Emplacement III is the most extensive tunnel discovered at Labrador Park . 
 As one walked into the tunnel , there is an enlarged chamber allowing for two @-@ way human traffic . This was important since the walkways in the tunnel tend to be very narrow . The tunnel then splits into two . One leads to the cartridge storeroom and hoist area while the other leads to the shell storeroom and hoist area . A hoist is a mechanical pulley system to lift the shells and cartridges from the underground room to the emplacement above it . The allocation of separation hoists for the shells and the cartridges allows for convenience and a more systematic operation of the gun above it . 
 = = = = Uses of the underground rooms = = = = 
 The underground storerooms played important roles in the Fort . For one , they protected ammunition from being ignited by enemy fire . Secondly , the use of hoists facilitated easy movement and retrieval of ammunition . Thirdly , the tunnel provided protection for the gunners not involved in the actual manning of the gun . Lastly , they help to protect the gun and gunners above from any accidental explosions in the underground room itself . The underground tunnels lead to the following areas : 
 Lighting room — Given the inflammable nature of the store , no naked flames were allowed in any rooms with the exception of this room . 
 Cartridge room — For the storage of cartridges . 
 Cartridge lift area — Where the hoist raising the cartridges to the emplacement aboveground was found . 
 Filled shell store — For the storage of shells filled with gunpowder . 
 Shell lift area — Where the hoist raising the Filled Shells to the emplacement aboveground was found .

 Before the onset of World War II ( WWII ) , Fort Pasir Panjang was subsequently upgraded to Labrador Battery . Tank obstacles , land mines and beach defences were put in place around the Fort . Air bases and garrisons were quickly sited in Malaya to counter the Japanese invasion threat . In anticipation of a coastal attack , 11 forts and gun batteries protected the coastal south of Singapore : 
 Fort Pasir Panjang

 By the eve of the Japanese invasion , Singapore had become one of the most fortified countries in the world . 
 = = = Battle for Pasir Panjang = = = 
 By 13 February 1942 , the Japanese had already reached Pasir Panjang Ridge ( present Kent Ridge Park ) after destroying the Allied artillery force on Chwee Chian Hill ( where Poh Ern Shih Temple stands today ) . This location was near the Alexandra area where the main ammunition stores and a military hospital were situated . The men of the 1st Battalion , Charlie Company , Malay Regiment , led by Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi fought bravely to the last . Many Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded . The guns from Labrador assisted the Malay Regiment in their 48 @-@ hour struggle against the Japanese by firing high @-@ explosive shells at enemy troops . However , with Japanese reinforcements , the Malay Regiment were finally surrounded and massacred . Three lucky ones , together with Lieutenant Abbas Abdul @-@ Manan managed to escape and later rejoined 30 surviving soldiers of a British battalion in the nearby area . 
 After their conquest of Pasir Panjang Ridge , the Japanese proceeded to march towards the city of Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there . Perched on a hill ( near present Keppel Country Club ) along Pasir Panjang Road , the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city . Using mounted Bofors guns , they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover . The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy but they could not advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way . About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo @-@ Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese . 
 = = = Alexandra Hospital massacre = = = 
 On 14 February 1942 , seeking reprisal for their great loss and also retaliation against retreating soldiers from the 44th Indian Brigade who had fired from Alexandra Hospital , 3 groups of Japanese soldiers went on a blind rampage and entered the hospital from the rear bayoneting everyone they found , regardless of whether they were soldiers , patients and medical staff . They killed a British officer , Lieutenant <unk> Weston , who was carrying a white flag to meet them . Even a young patient , Corporal Holden , who was lying on an operating table was not spared . About 200 defenceless souls were massacred . Some managed to escape death by falling to the floor and pretending to be dead . 
 The following day , Lieutenant @-@ General <unk> <unk> , commander of the Japanese 18th Division toured the hospital and distributed tinned fruits , all the while apologising profusely for the brutality of his soldiers and assured the staff of their safety . He also ordered the execution of the Japanese soldiers responsible for the massacre , within the hospital grounds . 
 = = = <unk> guns = = = 
 A common misunderstanding is that the British only anticipated a seaward attack and that the guns of Singapore could only fire out to sea . On the eve of the Japanese attack on Singapore , with the exception of the 15 " guns at the Buona Vista Battery , all large guns in Singapore had 360 @-@ degree traverse . The guns of the Labrador Battery could and did fire inland as they did at advancing Japanese troops in February 1942 . 
 Nonetheless , the Labrador Battery guns had limited effect during the battle and the rounds allocated to it were more armour @-@ piercing cartridges rather than high explosive rounds which were more effective against the infantry . As a result , these guns were ineffective and saw little action during the Battle of Singapore . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Before the British surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 , they destroyed all remaining coastal artillery to prevent any possible usage by the invading Japanese forces . This is known as a scorched @-@ earth policy . 
 After WWII , there was a worldwide disbandment of British forts as advances in air defence systems caused them to become obsolete . Today , the ruins of coastal fortifications are still visible at Labrador Battery , Mount Faber , Fort Siloso and Fort Canning that serve as a lasting reminder of their wartime legacy in Fortress Singapore .

 Far Side Virtual is a 2011 album by James Ferraro , released digitally and on vinyl by the label Hippos in Tanks . The album marked Ferraro 's transition from his previous style of lo @-@ fi drone music toward a sharply produced electronic aesthetic . Far Side Virtual deliberately evokes the artificial style of corporate " elevator music " and obsolete computer sounds . Ferraro said he first conceived of the album for release as a series of ringtones , and that listeners using songs from the album as ringtones is the completion of the project . The album engages with concepts of hyperreality , simulacra , disposable consumer culture , 1990s retro @-@ futurism , advertising and branding , pop art , and musical kitsch . Critics have found Ferraro 's attitude toward his themes ambiguous , depicting the modern world as both bleak dystopia and uncanny utopia . 
 The album received generally favorable reviews , with many critics admiring its conceptual underpinnings as much as , or more than , the quality of the music itself . The album also had its vocal detractors ; particularly , its position as UK music magazine The Wire 's number one release of the year was met with contention from some readers . Far Side Virtual has been cited as one of the original catalysts of vaporwave , an underground electronic music movement that covers much of the same sonic and conceptual territory . 
 = = Release = = 
 Far Side Virtual was announced in May 2011 as Ferraro 's first LP for the label Hippos in Tanks . The label first released the digital EP Condo Pets , intended to preview the sound of the forthcoming LP . Karen Ka Ying Chan , writer for Dummy , identified the theme of the two releases as Ferraro 's " fascination of the surreal side of American living " . Amber Bravo of The Fader said Far Side Virtual had been " billed somewhat as a cultural critique as told through MIDI @-@ synths . " 
 Ferraro 's announcement of the album reads , in part : " all the proceeds from Far Side Virtual are going towards my facial reconstructive plastic surgery , my new face will be fashioned after CCTV 's satellite queen , Princess <unk> and you will be able to see it live in concert on the Far Side Virtual World Tour .. Always coca cola . " The tracks " Adventures in Green Foot Printing " and " Earth Minutes " were released in advance of the album . Far Side Virtual was released on October 25 , 2011 , as a digital download and a 1000 @-@ copy run of transparent vinyl records . 
 Ferraro later explained that his original idea had been to release the 16 compositions on the album as a set of downloadable ringtones , but wanted the songs to have the impact of a complete album but felt that few would want to purchase the music as a set of ringtones . Ferraro said , " Hopefully these songs [ will be ] made available for ringtone and the album will be condensed into ringtone format so the album won 't be the centerpiece , it will just dissipate into the infrastructure . The record is just the contained gallery space of these ringtone compositions . " Ferraro said that listeners using the songs from Far Side Virtual as ringtones is the realization of Far Side Virtual as a performance art installation . 
 = = Music and critical interpretation = = 
 The cover of the album displays iPads over a low resolution image of Google Street View . Explaining the title in an interview , Ferraro said : 
 Far Side Virtual mainly designates a space in society , or a mode of behaving . All of these things operating in synchronicity : like ringtones , flat @-@ screens , theater , cuisine , fashion , sushi . I don 't want to call it " virtual reality , " so I call it Far Side Virtual . If you really want to understand Far Side , first off , listen to [ Claude ] Debussy , and secondly , go into a frozen yogurt shop . Afterwards , go into an Apple store and just fool around , hang out in there . Afterwards , go to Starbucks and get a gift card . They have a book there on the history of Starbucks — buy this book and go home . If you do all these things you 'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already . 
 The sources of most of the album 's sounds were described as " perversely commonplace " by a music critic , and include the Skype log @-@ in sound , a Windows shut @-@ down melody and a synthesized voice . Ferraro created Far Side Virtual with the Apple audio software GarageBand , which brought out the " cheap digital sound " he desired , and called it a " [ r ] <unk> plastic symphony for global warming , dedicated to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch . This is ringtone music meant to be experienced on the post @-@ structuralist medium , the smartphone . " Ferraro frequently described it as a still life of the 21st century . Far Side Virtual was retrospectively tagged as one of the first , and most influential , releases in vaporwave , a genre mostly spread via the Internet and identified by its adoption of dated electronic " corporate mood music " and ambiguously ironic attitude . 
 Andy Battaglia compared the feeling of the music to online virtual world Second Life , city @-@ building game SimCity and the work of art filmmaker Ryan <unk> . Adam Harper of Dummy called it a " pastiche [ of ] a kind of music you never knew you knew existed : techno @-@ capitalist stock promotional music for the era of the personal computer ... Each track is bristling with the maximalist promise of a world of possibilities waiting behind the screen for your double @-@ click , and evokes a time when we were much less familiar with and cynical about the virtual world technology has brought us into . " Bomb writer Luke Degnan wrote , " This is what Far Side Virtual does for 45 minutes — it reminds the listener that these sounds were born digitally and will die digitally . This is a digital album for a digital age . " 
 Ferraro said , " When I made Far Side Virtual , I was really into grime . I lived in Leeds for a year and I used to hear to kids listening to instrumentals on their phones , rapping over the top . I love the way that sounds : the texture of super compressed digital beats coming out of a cellphone and just a voice over it . Far Side Virtual was inspired by hearing music like that . " Electronic musician Dan Deacon praised the album for its unaltered , standard MIDI sound . Commenting on the production style , Joseph Stannard of The Wire wrote , " In contrast to the audio soup of Ferraro 's earlier recordings , these tracks have a spacious , architectural feel that recalls Laurie Anderson , Philip Glass and Rush . " 
 Critics noted that the album abandons the veneer of noise that coats Ferraro 's previous releases while retaining — and reimagining — the form and ethos of noise music . Ferraro said " it 's still in the tradition of noise . " According to Bomb magazine writer Luke Degan , the album is unlike the " reverbed @-@ out , feedback @-@ laden noise music " of Ferraro 's earlier music , but instead represents the noise of the " digital age . " A Fact writer said , " there 's no distortion , no tape @-@ hiss , no obvious underground signifiers ... [ but ] this new cleanness and clarity to the Ferraro aesthetic hasn 't diminished the hallucinatory power of his music ... [ the songs ] will terrify you to the core even as they evoke the soundtrack of a third @-@ tier Melanie Griffith rom @-@ com or a forgotten Phil Collins B @-@ side . " Another critic said , " while Ferraro is interested in issues of distance and impermanence , there is no lo @-@ fi fuzz or warm nostalgic haze to temper how flat and ugly the music he 's referencing on Far Side Virtual is . " 
 Like Ferraro 's previous albums Night Dolls with Hairspray and Last American Hero , Far Side Virtual explores American culture of the present and recent past . A writer from French music blog The Drone described Far Side Virtual as a concept album inspired by the ideas of hyperreality and simulacra from the post @-@ modern cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard . Harper wrote , " Up until Far Side Virtual , many of James Ferraro 's albums were impressionistic lo @-@ fi portraits of bygone eras – perhaps on Far Side Virtual he decided to represent the present as is and then let nature take its course , over time , and do the aging for him . Returning to it in ten or twenty years time , we might discover that it was ironically a victim of its own futurist acceleration , and is now about as up @-@ to @-@ date as a ten @-@ year @-@ old carton of milk . " 
 English music critic Simon Reynolds said that while the album 's song titles allude to the 21st century , the album is sonically reminiscent of the 1990s and that Ferraro shares interest in that time period with contemporaries like Oneohtrix Point Never . Reynolds wrote , " Far Side Virtual seems to undertake an archaeology of the recent past , conjuring the onset of the internet revolution and 90s optimism about information technology . But that recent past could equally be a case of ' the long present ' in so far as the <unk> ideology of convenience / instant access / maximization of options now permeates everyday life and is arguably where faint residues of utopianism persist in an otherwise gloomy and anxious culture .

 Far Side Virtual was met with greater critical attention than Ferraro 's previous releases . Just over a year after its release , Marc Masters at Pitchfork wrote that " Far Side Virtual became Ferraro 's most discussed and divisive effort , landing on year @-@ end best @-@ of lists as often as it got dismissed as a joke . " At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 77 , which indicates " generally favorable reviews " , based on seven reviews . Critics tended to agree that Far Side Virtual takes the state of 21st @-@ century consumerism as its subject , but there was no consensus regarding whether Ferraro intended to satirize , criticize or embrace this condition . Brandon Soderberg said that the album 's concept " seemed critic @-@ proof , which was frustrating ... Negative reviews could be dismissed as the listener 's simply not getting the joke . " 
 The Wire published a favorable review by Joseph Stannard , in which he wrote " If it is an elaborate put @-@ on — and I suspect Ferraro isn 't averse to a chuckle at the expense of his audience — Far Side Virtual still feels like the culmination of numerous releases ' worth of research and development . ... Whether or not its creator is giggling through a bong smoke haze , Far Side Virtual is a convincing evocation of the digital dreamtime . " Stefan Wharton of Tiny Mix Tapes ' took the album as a statement about blurred boundaries between consumers and their technologies , citing the writing of Markus Giesler as a precedent . Wharton said , " Far Side Virtual succeeds in exciting the collective memory of that generation now so conjoined to its technological appendages . " In Pitchfork 's review , Soderberg wrote , " the songs here are exactly the same as what they 're ostensibly parodying , which is bold and maybe even the point . ... You suddenly realize you 're listening to 45 minutes of utilitarian music that doesn 't really have a purpose . Can something be utopian and dystopian at the same time ? Probably . Maybe even always . " 
 Steve Shaw of Fact called the album " an intense immersive listening experience that is both deeply comforting and unsettling at the same time " and said " arguably , it is more a piece of art than a collection of music . ... Compositionally , Far Side Virtual is truly frenetic , nothing safe from Ferraro ’ s meddling , all elements completely malleable and at the mercy of his eccentric imagination . " Spin gave the album a three @-@ star review , and the staff reviewer wrote that Ferraro " makes a glowing , glossy album out of everyday digital detritus . If you can wade through the excruciating sitar @-@ synths , bank @-@ lobby melodies , home @-@ fitness techno , and infomercial drum breaks , Ferraro 's playfulness blips into view . "

 Far Side Virtual appeared on several best of 2011 lists and features . In Tiny Mix Tapes 's end @-@ of @-@ year wrap @-@ up column on nostalgia in pop music , Jonathan Dean wrote , " You may want to throw Far Side Virtual against a wall upon hearing its relentlessly arch , kitschy blandness , but it manages to successfully turn pop against itself , which , like it or not , is a politically progressive project . Its pure , bold <unk> stood out in a year that was dominated by the ' febrile sterility ' of post @-@ internet <unk> and tail @-@ swallowing postmodernism . " Music critic Jonah Weiner cited Far Side Virtual for his end @-@ of @-@ year article on contemporary protest songs , and called it " <unk> , <unk> , wondrously bland . " Fact named Hippos in Tanks the best label of the year , listing the signing of Ferraro and subsequent release of Far Side Virtual as one of its finest accomplishments . 
 Tiny Mix Tapes included the album as its 21st @-@ best album of the year , and summarized the album as " hyperreal ... frivolous ... eerily familiar and scarily comfortable : pop structures moving one step closer toward the ' synthetic music box ' from Huxley 's Brave New World . " Fact ranked Far Side Virtual as its sixth @-@ best album of the year , and called it " [ t ] he finest , most accessible example yet of James Ferraro ’ s ability to turn the detritus and dreck of US pop / commercial culture into gold – or , at any rate , something stomach @-@ <unk> psychedelic , mentally disturbing yet oddly celebratory . " Dummy named the album one of its " 12 albums for 2011 , " and Ruth <unk> concluded that Ferraro " neither celebrates nor critiques the internet 's reign but simply observes it with deep fascination . Andy Warhol style , it reflects the ambiguity of consumer culture in the digital age back at us with a Pixar @-@ animated wink . " The album placed at 316 on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop poll , with votes from four critics . 
 Far Side Virtual topped The Wire 's top 50 releases of 2011 — a choice that proved to be polarizing among readers . Writing to elucidate the " low mandate " for the album , editor @-@ in @-@ chief Tony Herrington noted that only seven of 60 voters included Far Side Virtual on their lists , and no voters chose it as their personal favorite . Herrington said the choice was " entirely appropriate in a year in which the abundance of choice brought on by digital technology reached such a tipping point as to make genuine consensus impossible . ... you either swoon over the conceptual audacity of its deadpan appropriation of late capitalist @-@ era corporate mood Muzak , or you think it 's the worst record Dave <unk> never made . " Tiny Mix Tapes ' Dean wrote that after Far Side Virtual topped The Wire 's list , " discerning music nerds have felt the imperative to step to either side of a line , " and that Herrington 's column " amounted to a retraction . " While praising the magazine for its diverse taste , Seattle Weekly 's Eric Grandy jokingly commented that it was " no surprise " that the " willfully <unk> " magazine would top their list with a " winking Windows ' 97 soft @-@ rock hellscape " .

 = For Emma , Forever Ago = 
 For Emma , Forever Ago is the debut studio album by American indie folk band Bon Iver . It was first self @-@ released in July 2007 , and later saw wide release on the Jagjaguwar label in February 2008 . The album is principally the work of singer @-@ songwriter Justin Vernon , who had previously performed in the band <unk> Edison . After college , the group moved to Raleigh , North Carolina , but broke up in 2006 . Vernon fell ill with mononucleosis and a liver infection , and grew frustrated with his songwriting and life . He left Raleigh and drove an hour northwest of his hometown , Eau Claire , Wisconsin , hoping to be alone . 
 The album was recorded at Vernon 's father 's remote hunting cabin over late 2006 to early 2007 . He abandoned his old songwriting methods and instead focused on wordless melodies that he later set to words , which he felt evoked a more subconscious meaning . The record 's lyrical subjects include lost love and mediocrity . His folk @-@ infused songs include heavy choral arrangements , featuring Vernon 's falsetto , and horns . He hunted his own food and spent much of his time isolated . Though he did not intend to make an album , he received strong encouragements from friends and decided to self @-@ release For Emma , Forever Ago in July 2007 . After several performances and online exposure , he was signed to Jagjaguwar later that year . 
 For Emma , Forever Ago attracted wide acclaim from music critics , achieving a spot on dozens of end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year lists , as well as several awards . It became a major commercial success for Jagjaguwar , an independent label , and has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , for sales of over 500 @,@ 000 copies . " Skinny Love " became the album 's best @-@ performing single and also went gold . Vernon gathered together several musicians to form a band to tour with . The album 's touring cycle lasted two years , ending in late 2009 , and visited several countries and music festivals worldwide . 
 = = Background = = 
 Justin Vernon was born in Eau Claire , Wisconsin , and grew up pursuing music . He saw the folk duo the Indigo Girls in concert in middle school and it proved formative on his life . He attended the University of Wisconsin – Eau Claire ( UW – Eau Claire ) , where he played in a number of bands . One such group , Mount Vernon , consisted of ten members and contained saxophonist Sara Jensen , who became his first love . He and Jensen broke up in the middle of his college years , but would remain friends . He studied music theory for a time as well as jazz , but ended up with a degree in religious studies . <unk> Edison became his next musical project , as he graduated from college and relocated to Raleigh , North Carolina in August 2005 . The group chose Raleigh hoping for an adventure and a more vibrant musical scene . 
 Over the course of his time in Raleigh , he became frustrated with his songwriting as well as personal life . He worked at a local sandwich shop that he felt took too much time from him . He started to have health problems : he first contracted pneumonia , then mononucleosis , which developed into a liver infection that kept him bedridden for three months . Members of the band began to fight , and Vernon was kicked out of the group . Many of his bands had held similar members — some he had known since his adolescence — which amplified the pain of breaking apart . Afterwards , he spent time as a band member for the Rosebuds ; his contributions feature on their third album , Night of the Furies . Vernon also recorded a solo extended play , <unk> , which he distributed in 100 self @-@ made CD @-@ Rs . He lost his money playing online poker , which he viewed as a microcosm for his other problems . 
 Vernon , then 25 , felt his life had spiraled into mediocrity , as though he had lost the sense of purpose he had a half @-@ decade prior . He sensed he had compromised with bandmates and in his personal life . His depression was fueled by indifference , and he decided to get away from Raleigh and return to his hometown . He broke @-@ up with his then @-@ girlfriend , Christy Smith , and tossed his recording equipment into the trunk of his car . He drove home to Eau Claire over eighteen hours through the night . He first stopped at his parents home while they were out . He sat on their couch and felt " claustrophobic " and " super @-@ empty . " He returned to the road , in search of silence and hoping to be alone . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Vernon 's travels brought him to his father 's hunting cabin , roughly an hour northwest of his hometown and outside of Medford , Wisconsin . He and his father had often spent weekends at the 80 @-@ acre rural property — an area they dubbed " the land " — when he was growing up . In an interview , he described it as " a little alpine @-@ style , timber @-@ frame cabin . " The cabin was not necessarily ramshackle ; his father had replaced its dirt floor and installed plumbing years before . For roughly three weeks , Vernon sat alone in the shack , drinking beer and watching seasons of the television show Northern Exposure on DVD . He mulled over thoughts about his relationship with Jensen , a break @-@ up he had struggled to get over . He hunted his food , a practice that he had learned from his father . He killed two deer in his period at the property , which lasted the entire three months " and then some , " according to Vernon . At one point , he faced a wild bear that entered the cabin late one night , enticed by his stew . His father would drop by " every 10 days or so , " supplying his son with beer , eggs , and cheese . Vernon completed tasks for him , such as stripping wood , clearing brush , and stacking lumber . He did not intend to stay for long , viewing the excursion as " an opportunity to escape the trap of society , to not pay bills , to play music and live really cheaply . " Instead , he stayed for three months in the harsh Wisconsin winter . 
 After three weeks , Vernon grew tired of his " self @-@ indulgent , lazy behavior " and began forming song ideas . He had an idea for a song and brought inside his musical equipment , which consisted of several guitars , microphones , and an old @-@ model Macintosh with ProTools LE . Shortly before exiting Raleigh , he had developed song ideas but ceased working on them in his depression . He began recording songs and layering his vocals atop more vocals , imitating a choir . He sang in falsetto , which he had first tried with his previous band . He gained freedom in singing in a higher register , feeling he accessed " painful melodies " unattainable in his previous work . He further manipulated his recorded vocals using the software Auto @-@ Tune . Soon , he began developing more songs , which were worked on in 12 @-@ hour " bursts " of productivity . " I would work for 14 hours a day and start to feel a little insane , " he later commented . The work was " labor @-@ intensive , " as he often merged over a minimum of eight tracks of vocals on each song . He likened the singularity of the process to his teenage years , where he worked alone with an eight @-@ track . According to Vernon , days were hazy and began to run together for him . He would wake each morning at sunrise , due to the light reflecting from the snow . To help repair his 1964 Sears Silvertone guitar , he traded venison in the nearby town . By February , with winter drawing to a close , Vernon emerged from the cabin with nine songs . He left still feeling physically sick from the infection , nor did he feel " renewed " from his creative catharsis . He spent additional time in Raleigh recording brass in " re : stacks " , and he invited friends Randy <unk> and John <unk> over one day to play trumpet and trombone on the songs . 
 While stories of the " cabin " would become oft @-@ repeated and mythologized , Vernon never viewed it that way : " It 's sort of odd to look back and see it as magical , because it felt like a lonely few months at the cabin , where I plugged in the laptop and fucked around . " Rolling Stone 's Josh Eells later summarized its romanticized story as " part Into the Wild , part Basement Tapes , part Walden , part Unabomber . " Vernon later viewed the album a victory for his mental health , a metaphor for taking " personal steps " to improve his life . He characterized his growth as a " small internal dialogue between me and the microphone . " The album 's title comes from the middle name of Jensen , though he refrained from confirming that she was the central inspiration behind the album . He felt the titular " Emma " was evocative of " a statement , a sentiment and a closing of my own history . " He went more in @-@ depth in a later remark : " Emma isn 't a person . Emma is a place that you get stuck in . Emma 's a pain that you can ’ t erase . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 For Emma , Forever Ago is a summation of Vernon 's life events at the time , ranging from " lost love and longing " to mediocrity . His lyrics on the album aspire to tell stories , which was inspired by musician Bruce Springsteen , and the song structures are unorthodox . He discarded his old method of songwriting , both metaphorically and literally : on one occasion , an old PowerBook crashed , losing dozens of unfinished old songs . Vernon buried the laptop in the snow , later remarking , " They were taken from me but it was good that they were , as it really gave me a new face . " Music came first , after which he would create wordless vocal lines . He felt this process brought forth " weird , subconscious melodies and sounds . " He considered this method a " back @-@ door way , " as they fit more to his unintelligible syllables than words . He expanded upon this process in a 2008 interview : 
 Vernon listened to little music while creating the album , but was inspired by a myriad of sources . He had listened to Vienna Boys ' Choir recordings months prior , which inspired him to incorporate choral arrangements into his work . He also felt inspired by Appalachian folk singers who employed the falsetto register , which inspired him to use his . As a result , he felt more comfortable singing certain complicated phrases , as though he could express pain or joy more clearly . He suggested in one interview it could have been a reaction to his favorite black singers , such as the Staple Singers , Mahalia Jackson , and Sam Cooke . " Flume " was created at his girlfriend Christy Smith 's house in Raleigh , preceding his trip to the cabin . He later dubbed " Flume " as the " catalyst " for his move to the cabin and creation of Bon Iver : " that was the song that made me leave . " While " Skinny Love " has been considered a reference to his relationship with Smith , Vernon countered this as " not entirely accurate [ ... ] it 's about that time in a relationship that I was going through ; you 're in a relationship because you need help , but that 's not necessarily why you should be in a relationship . And that 's skinny . " " re : stacks " , meanwhile , references his gambling problem .

 After completing the recordings , Vernon returned to North Carolina to play guitar on tour with the Rosebuds , who toured through that spring . It took several months for him to have thoughts on his recordings . He viewed them as potential demos he would later re @-@ record , but Ivan Howard of the Rosebuds convinced him to leave it as is , commenting , " This is your record . " He consulted friends to listen first before deciding to self @-@ release it . He mixed his recordings himself , hoping to send them out to labels who would give him an advance to record a " real " album . While at the cabin , Vernon had written to Kelly Crisp of the Rosebuds , concluding his letter with " bon <unk> , " a misspelling of " bon <unk> , " which is French for " good winter . " Its origins lie in an episode of Northern Exposure , wherein two characters greet one another . Crisp encouraged him to name the project Bon Iver . While on tour with the Rosebuds , he asked to play a small solo set , his first , prior to a performance at that year 's South by Southwest ( SXSW ) . Encouraged , more performances followed in New York and in Wisconsin . 
 For Emma , Forever Ago was first self @-@ distributed on MySpace in June 2007 , and gradually became an independent hit throughout that year . My Old Kentucky Blog was the first to popularize the record . A release party was held at the House of Rock in Eau Claire on July 8 , 2007 , marking the album 's CD debut . It was a limited run of 500 copies , as Vernon had no idea who would be interested . He intended to send out 100 copies to press outlets . Positive reviews increased within weeks , from music blogs such as <unk> and Pitchfork . An appearance at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York increased Vernon 's popularity among music blogs , and he began to see offers to release the album from record labels . According to Vernon , major labels were " desperate " to sign him , offering contracts in which he chose the deal . He chose to sign with independent label Jagjaguwar in late October 2007 because he liked the label 's president , Chris Swanson , who had first opened communication in the summer , and its Midwest roots . 4AD would distribute the album in Europe .

 Upon its February 2008 release , For Emma , Forever Ago sold 4 @,@ 000 copies in its debut week . That placed it on several U.S. album sales charts , including at number 182 on the Billboard 200 and a number five entry on the Top Heatseekers chart . Sales for For Emma were " slow @-@ building , " according to music publication Billboard , but eventually became a " commercial smash " for Jagjaguwar . The album eventually peaked at number 64 on the Billboard 200 in the issue dated January 24 , 2009 . Prior to its official release on Jagjaguwar , the album was widely available online . The label offered sales incentives in response , including a free poster with pre @-@ ordered copies , a bonus track on the iTunes Store edition , as well as purchasing a copy required for in @-@ store performances . The album was mostly successful among triple @-@ A radio stations in the U.S. , including many public stations in the Midwest , where the label focused their marketing campaign . 
 In the United Kingdom , the album debuted at number 42 on the UK Albums Chart ; it was later certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) for sales of over 100 @,@ 000 copies . It achieved its largest international success in Ireland , where it debuted at number 16 ; it was also a top 40 hit album in Flanders , Portugal , Australia , and Denmark . In Australia , the album was eventually certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) , denoting shipments of 70 @,@ 000 copies , and it was also certified gold by IFPI Denmark , denoting shipments of 10 @,@ 000 copies . 
 For Emma , Forever Ago has been a top @-@ selling title on vinyl for many years during the format 's revival in the U.S. ; it sold over 102 @,@ 000 copies on vinyl in the first half of the 2010s . " If you ’ d told me when we put out For Emma , Forever Ago that we would sell almost 100 @,@ 000 copies on vinyl , I would think that was just absolutely insane , " said Nick Blandford , managing director of the Secretly Label Group . Its overall sales were last estimated at 335 @,@ 000 copies in the United States , according to Nielsen SoundScan , in June 2011 , but the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) in 2013 for shipments of 500 @,@ 000 copies .

 For Emma , Forever Ago received widespread acclaim from critics . It scored an 88 on review aggregate site Metacritic . One of the earliest reviews came from Pitchfork 's Stephen M. Deusner , who praised Vernon 's " soulful performance , " describing the record as " a ruminative collection of songs full of natural imagery and acoustic strums — the sound of a man left alone with his memories and a guitar . " Rob Sheffield for Rolling Stone christened it a " quiet marvel , " praising Vernon 's " light touch , with zero interest in narrative or confessional lyrics . " The Guardian 's Jude Rogers praised Vernon 's restraint , noting , " nothing is overplayed , but nothing feels throwaway either . " Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club characterized it as " quietly startling , " opining , " The power is in how these songs sound rather than what the opaque lyrics don 't quite spell out . " Tim Sendra of AllMusic wrote that " For Emma captures the sound of broken and quiet isolation , wraps it in a beautiful package , and delivers it to your door with a beating , bruised heart . It 's quite an achievement for a debut and the promise of greatness in the future is high . " 
 David Marchese , writing for Spin , suggested Vernon 's " sturdy folk chords , earthy melodies , and plainspoken , pastoral lyrics prevent the album from descending into self @-@ pity . " Uncut 's John Mulvey deemed the record " a hermetically sealed , complete and satisfying album " that " operates so securely and intensely in its own world that to listen sometimes seem like an intrusive act . " Darcie Stevens of the Austin Chronicle described the record as a " paradigm of uninhibited closure , a gentle touch on a sad day , " writing , " [ Vernon ] ' s pain is so visceral it provides warmth , the therapeutic definition of music . " The New York Times called the record " irresistible . " On the other hand , Robert Christgau , in his review for MSN Music , stated that the album ultimately had little to say about " shared aloneness " , comparing Vernon unfavorably to Robert <unk> and writing that Vernon 's " solitary meditations ... lose definition faster than an angel 's breath on a January morn " .

 Vernon first toured as Bon Iver along the East Coast , supporting Elvis Perkins , in late 2007 . One of the biggest concerts came in December 2007 , when the band performed at the Bowery Ballroom . For the major touring cycle after the album 's official release , he gathered together several musicians for the trek , including former guitar student Mike Noyce and drummer Sean Carey . Carey , a jazz drummer from UW – Eau Claire , was a fan of the album , and had approached Vernon at one of his first performances . Vernon felt comfortable performing the album live , though it was very personal : " It ’ s weird that I ’ m still behind these songs , " he told PopMatters . " It ’ s weird that I ’ m still able to float with them and be with them and find new and old pain in the song . The fact that they haven ’ t just run their course , that they ’ re not old hat after a year is really exciting . " The band toured with label @-@ mates Black Mountain , which allowed the two groups to attract a " diverse crowd , " according to Billboard . In summer 2009 , the band played various festivals , including Bonnaroo , Lollapalooza , and Austin City Limits . Some shows were performed with support from the Indigo Girls , one of Vernon 's favorite groups . He held one memorable show at Hollywood Forever Cemetery at six in the morning . The album 's main touring cycle was complete by late 2009 .

 = Simeon I of Bulgaria = 
 Simeon ( also Symeon ) I the Great ( Bulgarian : <unk> I <unk> , transliterated Simeon I Veliki [ <unk> <unk> ̞ <unk> <unk> ] ) ruled over Bulgaria from 893 to 927 , during the First Bulgarian Empire . Simeon 's successful campaigns against the Byzantines , Magyars and Serbs led Bulgaria to its greatest territorial expansion ever , making it the most powerful state in contemporary Eastern Europe . His reign was also a period of unmatched cultural prosperity and enlightenment later deemed the Golden Age of Bulgarian culture . 
 During Simeon 's rule , Bulgaria spread over a territory between the Aegean , the Adriatic and the Black Sea , and the new Bulgarian capital Preslav was said to rival Constantinople . The newly independent Bulgarian Orthodox Church became the first new patriarchate besides the <unk> , and Bulgarian Glagolitic and Cyrillic translations of Christian texts spread all over the Slavic world of the time . It was at the Preslav Literary School in the 890s that the Cyrillic alphabet was developed . Halfway through his reign , Simeon assumed the title of Emperor ( Tsar ) , having prior to that been styled Prince ( Knyaz ) . 
 = = Background and early life = = 
 Simeon was born in 864 or 865 , as the third son of Knyaz Boris I of Krum 's dynasty . As Boris was the ruler who Christianized Bulgaria in 865 , Simeon was a Christian all his life . Because his eldest brother Vladimir was designated heir to the Bulgarian throne , Boris intended Simeon to become a high @-@ ranking cleric , possibly Bulgarian archbishop , and sent him to the leading University of Constantinople to receive theological education when he was thirteen or fourteen . He took the name Simeon as a novice in a monastery in Constantinople . During the decade ( ca . 878 – 888 ) he spent in the Byzantine capital , he received excellent education and studied the rhetoric of Demosthenes and Aristotle . He also learned fluent Greek , to the extent that he was referred to as " the half @-@ Greek " in Byzantine chronicles . He is speculated to have been tutored by Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople , but this is not supported by any source . 
 Around 888 , Simeon returned to Bulgaria and settled at the newly established royal monastery of Preslav " at the mouth of the <unk> " , where , under the guidance of Naum of Preslav , he engaged in active translation of important religious works from Greek to Old Church Slavonic ( Old Bulgarian ) , aided by other students from Constantinople . Meanwhile , Vladimir had succeeded Boris , who had retreated to a monastery , as ruler of Bulgaria . Vladimir attempted to reintroduce paganism in the empire and possibly signed an anti @-@ Byzantine pact with Arnulf of Carinthia , forcing Boris to re @-@ enter political life . Boris had Vladimir imprisoned and blinded , and then appointed Simeon as the new ruler . This was done at an assembly in Preslav which also proclaimed Bulgarian as the only language of state and church and moved the Bulgarian capital from Pliska to Preslav , to better cement the recent conversion . It is not known why Boris did not place his second son , Gavril , on the throne , but instead preferred Simeon .

 = = = Trade War with Byzantium and Magyar invasions = = = 
 With Simeon on the throne , the long @-@ lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end . A conflict arose when Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise , allegedly acting under pressure from his mistress Zoe Zaoutzaina and her father Stylianos Zaoutzes , moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki , where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed . The Bulgarians sought protection by Simeon , who in turn complained to Leo . However , the Byzantine emperor ignored his embassy . 
 Forced to take action , in the autumn of 894 Simeon invaded the Byzantine Empire from the north , meeting with little opposition due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern Anatolia to counter Arab invasions . Informed of the Bulgarian offensive , the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon , but his troops were routed somewhere in the theme of Macedonia . The Bulgarians took most of the Khazar mercenary guardsmen prisoners and killed many archons , including the army 's commander . However , instead of continuing his advance to the Byzantine capital , Simeon quickly withdrew his troops to face a Magyar invasion from the north . These events were later called " the first trade war in medieval Europe " by Bulgarian historians . 
 Unable to effectively respond to the Bulgarian campaign due to the engagement of their forces against the Arabs , the Byzantines convinced the Magyars to attack Bulgaria , promising to transport them across the Danube using the Byzantine navy . Leo VI may have also concluded an agreement with Arnulf to make sure that the Franks did not support Simeon against the Magyars . In addition , the talented commander Nikephoros Phokas was called back from southern Italy to lead a separate army against Bulgaria in 895 with the mere intention to overawe the Bulgarians . Simeon , unaware of the threat from the north , rushed to meet Phokas ' forces , but the two armies did not engage in a fight . Instead , the Byzantines offered peace , informing him of both the Byzantine foot and maritime campaign , but intentionally did not notify him of the planned Magyar attack . Simeon did not trust the envoy and , after sending him to prison , ordered the Byzantine navy 's route into the Danube closed off with ropes and chains , intending to hold it until he had dealt with Phokas . 
 Despite the problems they encountered because of the fencing , the Byzantines ultimately managed to ferry the Magyar forces led by Árpád 's son Liüntika across the Danube , possibly near modern Galaţi , and assisted them in pillaging the nearby Bulgarian lands . Once notified of the surprise invasion , Simeon headed north to stop the Magyars , leaving some of his troops at the southern border to prevent a possible attack by Phokas . Simeon 's two encounters with the enemy in Northern Dobruja resulted in Magyar victories , forcing him to retreat to <unk> . After pillaging much of Bulgaria and reaching Preslav , the Magyars returned to their lands , but not before Simeon had concluded an armistice with Byzantium towards the summer of 895 . A complete peace was delayed , as Leo VI required the release of the Byzantine captives from the Trade War . 
 = = = Anti @-@ Magyar campaign and further wars with Byzantium = = = 
 Having dealt with the pressure from the Magyars and the Byzantines , Simeon was free to plan a campaign against the Magyars looking for retribution . He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars ' eastern neighbours , the Pechenegs , and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy Leo Choirosphaktes in order to delay the release of the captives until after the campaign against the Magyars . This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour . In an exchange of letters with the envoy , Simeon refused to release the captives and ridiculed Leo VI 's astrological abilities . 
 Using a Magyar invasion in the lands of the neighbouring Slavs in 896 as a casus belli , Simeon headed against the Magyars together with his Pecheneg allies , defeating them completely in the Battle of Southern Buh and making them leave Etelköz forever and settle in Pannonia . Following the defeat of the Magyars , Simeon finally released the Byzantine prisoners in exchange for Bulgarians captured in 895 . 
 Claiming that not all prisoners had been released , Simeon once again invaded Byzantium in the summer of 896 , heading directly to Constantinople . He was met in Thrace by a hastily assembled Byzantine army , but annihilated the Byzantine forces in the Battle of <unk> ( at modern <unk> , Turkey ) . Arming Arab captives and sending them to fight with the Bulgarians as a desperate measure , Leo VI managed to repel the Bulgarians from Constantinople , which they had besieged . The war ended with a peace treaty which formally lasted until around Leo VI 's death in 912 and under which Byzantium was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute . Under the treaty , the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and <unk> to the Bulgarian Empire . Meanwhile , Simeon had also imposed his authority over Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as their ruler . 
 Simeon often violated the peace treaty with Byzantium , attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions , such as in 904 , when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade Leo of Tripoli to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki . After the Arabs plundered the city , it was an easy target for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes . In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs , Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of Macedonia . With the treaty of 904 , all Slavic @-@ inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern Albania were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire , with the border line running some 20 kilometres north of Thessaloniki . 
 = = = Recognition as Emperor = = = 
 The death of Leo VI on 11 May 912 and the accession of his infant son Constantine VII under the guidance of Leo 's brother Alexander , who expelled Leo 's wife Zoe from the palace , constituted a great opportunity for Simeon to attempt another campaign against Constantinople , the conquest of which remained the dream of his life . In the spring of 913 , Simeon 's envoys , who had arrived in Constantinople to renew the peace of 896 , were sent away by Alexander , who refused to pay the annual tribute , urging Simeon to prepare for war . 
 Before Simeon could attack , Alexander died on 6 June 913 , leaving the empire in the hands of a regency council headed by Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos . Many residents of Constantinople did not recognize the young emperor and instead supported the pretender Constantine Doukas , which , exacerbated by revolts in southern Italy and the planned Arab invasion in eastern Anatolia , was all to Simeon 's advantage . Nicholas Mystikos tried to discourage Simeon from invading Byzantium in a long series of pleading letters , but the Bulgarian ruler nevertheless attacked in full force in late July or August 913 , reaching Constantinople without any serious resistance . 
 The anarchy in Constantinople had ceased after the murder of the pretender Constantine Doukas , however , and a government had promptly been formed with Patriarch Nicholas at the helm . This urged Simeon to raise his siege and enter peace negotiations , to the joy of the Byzantines . The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the arrears of Byzantine tribute , the promise that Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon 's daughters , and , most importantly , Simeon 's official recognition as Emperor of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas in the Blachernae Palace . 
 Shortly after Simeon visited Constantinople , Constantine 's mother Zoe returned to the palace on the insistence of the young emperor and immediately proceeded to eliminate the regents . Through a plot , she managed to assume power in February 914 , practically removing Patriarch Nicholas from the government , disowning and obscuring his recognition of Simeon 's imperial title , and rejecting the planned marriage of her son to one of Simeon 's daughters . Simeon had to resort to war to achieve his goals . He invaded Thrace in the summer of 914 and captured Adrianople . Zoe was quick to send Simeon numerous presents in order to conciliate him , and she managed to convince him to cede back Adrianople and withdraw his army . In the following years , Simeon 's forces were engaged in the northwestern Byzantine provinces , around <unk> ( Durrës ) and Thessaloniki , but did not make a move against Constantinople . 
 = = = Victories at Acheloos and Katasyrtai = = = 
 By 917 , Simeon was preparing for yet another war against Byzantium . He attempted to conclude an anti @-@ Byzantine union with the Pechenegs , but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines , who succeeded in outbidding them . The Byzantines hatched a large @-@ scale campaign against Bulgaria and also tried to persuade the Serbian Prince Petar Gojniković to attack the Bulgarians with Magyar support . 
 In 917 , a particularly strong Byzantine army led by Leo Phokas the Elder , son of Nikephoros Phokas , invaded Bulgaria accompanied by the Byzantine navy under the command of Romanos Lekapenos , which sailed to the Bulgarian Black Sea ports . En route to Mesembria ( Nesebǎr ) , where they were supposed to be reinforced by troops transported by the navy , Phokas ' forces stopped to rest near the river of Acheloos , not far from the port of Anchialos ( <unk> ) . Once informed of the invasion , Simeon rushed to intercept the Byzantines , and attacked them from the nearby hills while they were resting disorganized . In the Battle of Acheloos of 20 August 917 , one of the largest in medieval history , the Bulgarians completely routed the Byzantines and killed many of their commanders , although Phokas managed to escape to Mesembria . Decades later , Leo the Deacon would write that " piles of bones can still be seen today at the river Acheloos , where the fleeing army of the Byzantines was then infamously slain " . 
 The planned Pecheneg attack from the north also failed , as the Pechenegs quarrelled with admiral Lekapenos , who refused to transport them across the Danube to aid the main Byzantine army . The Byzantines were not aided by Serbs and Magyars either : the Magyars were engaged in Western Europe as Frankish allies , and the Serbs under Petar Gojniković were reluctant to attack Bulgaria because Michael of Zahumlje , an ally of Bulgaria , had notified Simeon of their plans . 
 Simeon 's army quickly followed up the victory of Acheloos with another success . The Bulgarians sent to pursuit the remnants of the Byzantine army approached Constantinople and encountered Byzantine forces under Leo Phokas , who had returned to the capital , at the village of Katasyrtai in the immediate proximity of Constantinople . The Bulgarian regiments attacked and again defeated the Byzantines , destroying some of their last units before returning to Bulgaria . 
 = = = Suppression of Serbian unrest and late campaigns against Byzantium = = = 
 Immediately after that campaign , Simeon sought to punish the Serbian ruler Petar Gojniković who had attempted to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines . Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders , Theodore <unk> and <unk> , to Serbia . The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting , during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria , where he died in a dungeon . Simeon put Pavle <unk> , prior to that an exile in Bulgaria , on the Serbian throne , thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while . 
 Meanwhile , the Byzantine military failures forced another change of government in Constantinople : the admiral Romanos Lekapenos replaced Zoe as regent of the young Constantine VII in 919 , forcing her back into a convent . Romanos betrothed his daughter Helena <unk> to Constantine and advanced to the rank of co @-@ emperor in December 920 , effectively assuming the government of the empire , which was largely what Simeon had planned to do . 
 No longer able to climb to the Byzantine throne by diplomatic means , the infuriated Simeon once again had to wage war to impose his will . Between 920 and 922 , Bulgaria increased its pressure on Byzantium , campaigning in the west through Thessaly reaching the Isthmus of Corinth and in the east in Thrace , reaching and crossing the Dardanelles to lay siege on the town of Lampsacus . Simeon 's forces appeared before Constantinople in 921 , when they demanded the deposition of Romanos and captured Adrianople , and 922 , when they were victorious at <unk> , burned much of the Golden Horn and seized Bizye . In the meantime , the Byzantines attempted to ignite Serbia against Simeon , but he substituted Pavle with Zaharije <unk> , a former refugee at Constantinople that he had captured . 
 Desperate to conquer Constantinople , Simeon planned a large campaign in 924 and sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al @-@ Mahdi Billah , who possessed a powerful navy which Simeon needed . The caliph agreed and sent his own representatives back with the Bulgarians to arrange the alliance . However , the envoys were captured by the Byzantines at Calabria . Romanos offered peace to the Arabs , supplementing this offer with generous gifts , and ruined their union with Bulgaria . 
 In Serbia , Zaharije was persuaded by the Byzantines to revolt against Simeon . Zaharije was supported by many Bulgarians exhausted from Simeon 's endless campaigns against Byzantium . The Bulgarian emperor sent his troops under <unk> and <unk> , but they were routed and the two commanders beheaded , which forced Simeon to conclude an armistice with Byzantium in order to concentrate on the suppression of the uprising . Simeon sent an army led by Časlav <unk> in 924 to depose Zaharije . He was successful , as Zaharije fled to Croatia . After this victory , the Serbian nobility was invited to come to Bulgaria and bow to the new Prince . However , he did not appear at the supposed meeting and all of them were beheaded . Bulgaria annexed Serbia directly . 
 In the summer of 924 , Simeon nevertheless arrived at Constantinople and demanded to see the patriarch and the emperor . He conversed with Romanos on the Golden Horn on 9 September 924 and arranged a truce , according to which Byzantium would pay Bulgaria an annual tax , but would be ceded back some cities on the Black Sea coast . During the interview of the two monarchs , two eagles are said to have met in the skies above and then to have parted , one of them flying over Constantinople and the other heading to Thrace , as a sign of the <unk> of the two rulers . In his description of this meeting , Theophanes Continuatus mentions that " the two emperors ... conversed " , which may indicate renewed Byzantine recognition of Simeon 's imperial claims . 
 = = = War with Croatia and death = = = 
 Most likely after ( or possibly at the time of ) Patriarch Nicholas ' death in 925 , Simeon raised the status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church to a patriarchate . This may be linked to Simeon 's diplomatic relations with the Papacy between 924 and 926 , during which he demanded and received Pope John X 's recognition of his title as " Emperor of the Romans " , truly equal to the Byzantine emperor , and possibly the confirmation of a patriarchal dignity for the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church . 
 In 926 , Simeon 's troops under <unk> invaded Croatia , at the time a Byzantine ally , but were completely defeated by the army of King Tomislav in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands . Fearing a Bulgarian retribution , Tomislav accepted to abandon his union with Byzantium and make peace on the basis of the status quo , negotiated by the papal legate <unk> . In the last months of his life , Simeon prepared for another conflict with Constantinople despite Romanos ' desperate pleas for peace . 
 On 27 May 927 , Simeon died of heart failure in his palace in Preslav . Byzantine chroniclers tie his death to a legend , according to which Romanos decapitated a statue which was Simeon 's inanimate double , and he died at that very hour . 
 He was succeeded by his son Peter I , with George <unk> , the new emperor 's maternal uncle , initially acting as a regent . As part of the peace treaty signed in October 927 and reinforced by Peter 's marriage to Maria ( Eirene ) , Romanos ' granddaughter , the existing borders were confirmed , as were the Bulgarian ruler 's imperial dignity and the head of the Bulgarian Church 's patriarchal status . 
 = = Culture and religion = = 
 During Simeon 's reign , Bulgaria reached its cultural apogee , becoming the literary and spiritual centre of Slavic Europe . In this respect , Simeon continued his father Boris ' policy of establishing and spreading Slavic culture and attracting noted scholars and writers within Bulgaria 's borders . It was in the Preslav Literary School and Ohrid Literary School , founded under Boris , that the main literary work in Bulgaria was concentrated during the reign of Simeon in the new Cyrillic alphabet which was developed there . 
 The late 9th and early 10th century constitute the earliest and most productive period of medieval Bulgarian literature . Having spent his early years in Constantinople , Simeon introduced Byzantine culture to the Bulgarian court , but eliminated its assimilative effect by means of military power and religious autonomy . The disciples of Cyril and Methodius , among whom Clement of Ohrid , Naum and Constantine of Preslav , continued their educational work in Bulgaria , actively translating Christian texts , such as the Bible and the works of John Chrysostom , Basil of Caesarea , Cyril of Alexandria , Gregory of Nazianzus , Athanasius of Alexandria , as well as historic chronicles such as these of John Malalas and George <unk> , to Bulgarian . The reign of Simeon also witnessed the production of a number of original theological and secular works , such as John Exarch 's Six Days ( <unk> ) , Constantine of Preslav 's Alphabetical Prayer and Proclamation of the Holy Gospels , and <unk> <unk> 's An Account of Letters . Simeon 's own contribution to this literary blossoming was praised by his contemporaries , for example in the Praise to Tsar Simeon preserved in the <unk> collection and Simeon 's Collection , to which the tsar personally wrote an addendum . 
 Simeon turned the new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a magnificent religious and cultural centre , intended more as a display of his realm 's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress . With its more than twenty cross @-@ domed churches and numerous monasteries , its impressive royal palace and the Golden ( or Round ) Church , Preslav was a true imperial capital . The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic icon of Theodore <unk> and the Preslav @-@ style illustrated ceramics . 
 = = Family = = 
 Simeon was married twice . By his first wife , whose identity is unknown , Simeon had a son called Michael , possibly because his mother was of inferior birth , he was excluded from the succession and sent to a monastery . 
 By his second wife , the sister of the influential noble George <unk> , he had three sons : Peter , who succeeded as Emperor of Bulgaria in 927 and ruled until 969 ; Ivan , who unsuccessfully conspired against Peter in 929 and then fled to Byzantium ; and Benjamin ( Bajan ) , who , according to Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona , " possessed the power to transform himself suddenly into a wolf or other strange animal " . 
 Simeon also had several daughters , including one who was arranged to marry Constantine VII in 913 . The marriage was annulled by Constantine 's mother Zoe once she had returned to the court .

 Tsar Simeon I has remained among the most highly valued Bulgarian historical figures , as indicated by popular vote in the <unk> <unk> ( a spin @-@ off of 100 Greatest Britons ) television programme , which in February 2007 placed him fourth among the greatest Bulgarians ever . Simeon the Great has been regularly featured in fiction . Bulgarian national writer Ivan Vazov dedicated a children 's patriotic poem to him , " Tsar Simeon " , and it was later arranged as a song , " Kray <unk> <unk> se <unk> " ( " A Clamour Rises by the Bosphorus " ) . An eleven @-@ episode drama series filmed in 1984 , <unk> vek ( The Golden Age ) , retells the story of Simeon 's reign . In the series , the tsar is played by Marius Donkin . A historical drama play called Tsar Simeon Veliki — <unk> vek produced by Stefan <unk> , director of the Silistra Theatre , premiered in December 2006 . Ivan <unk> stars in the part of Simeon .

 = Glacier National Park ( U.S. ) = 
 Glacier National Park is a national park located in the U.S. state of Montana , on the Canada – United States border with the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia . The park encompasses over 1 million acres ( 4 @,@ 000 km2 ) and includes parts of two mountain ranges ( sub @-@ ranges of the Rocky Mountains ) , over 130 named lakes , more than 1 @,@ 000 different species of plants , and hundreds of species of animals . This vast pristine ecosystem is the centerpiece of what has been referred to as the " Crown of the Continent Ecosystem " , a region of protected land encompassing 16 @,@ 000 square miles ( 41 @,@ 000 km2 ) . 
 The region that became Glacier National Park was first inhabited by Native Americans . Upon the arrival of European explorers , it was dominated by the Blackfeet in the east and the Flathead in the western regions . Under pressure the Blackfoot ceded the mountainous parts of their treaty lands in 1895 to the federal government ; it later became part of the park . Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11 , 1910 , a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the Great Northern Railway . These historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places . By 1932 work was completed on the Going @-@ to @-@ the @-@ Sun Road , later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark , which provided greater accessibility for automobiles into the heart of the park . 
 The mountains of Glacier National Park began forming 170 million years ago when ancient rocks were forced eastward up and over much younger rock strata . Known as the Lewis <unk> , these sedimentary rocks are considered to have some of the finest fossilized examples of extremely early life found anywhere on Earth . The current shapes of the Lewis and Livingston mountain ranges and positioning and size of the lakes show the telltale evidence of massive glacial action , which carved U @-@ shaped valleys and left behind moraines which impounded water , creating lakes . Of the estimated 150 glaciers which existed in the park in the mid @-@ 19th century , only 25 active glaciers remained by 2010 . Scientists studying the glaciers in the park have estimated that all the glaciers may disappear by 2030 if the current climate patterns persist . 
 Glacier National Park has almost all its original native plant and animal species . Large mammals such as the Grizzly bears , moose , and mountain goats , as well as rare or endangered species like the wolverines and Canadian lynxes , inhabit this park . Hundreds of species of birds , more than a dozen fish species , and a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented . The park has numerous ecosystems ranging from prairie to tundra . Notably , the easternmost forests of western redcedar and hemlock grow in the southwest portion of the park . Large forest fires are uncommon in the park . However , in 2003 over 13 % of the park burned . 
 Glacier National Park borders Waterton Lakes National Park in Canada — the two parks are known as the Waterton @-@ Glacier International Peace Park and were designated as the world 's first International Peace Park in 1932 . Both parks were designated by the United Nations as Biosphere Reserves in 1976 , and in 1995 as World Heritage sites . 
 = = History = = 
 According to archeological evidence , Native Americans first arrived in the Glacier area some 10 @,@ 000 years ago . The earliest occupants with lineage to current tribes were the Flathead ( Salish ) and Kootenai , Shoshone , and Cheyenne . The Blackfeet arrived around the beginning of the 18th century and soon dominated the eastern slopes of what later became the park , as well as the Great Plains immediately to the east . The park region provided the Blackfeet shelter from the harsh winter winds of the plains , allowing them to supplement their traditional bison hunts with other game meat . Today , the Blackfeet Indian Reservation borders the park in the east , while the Flathead Indian Reservation is located west and south of the park . When the Blackfeet Reservation was first established in 1855 by the Lame Bull Treaty , it included the eastern area of the current park up to the Continental Divide . To the Blackfeet , the mountains of this area , especially Chief Mountain and the region in the southeast at Two Medicine , were considered the " Backbone of the World " and were frequented during vision quests . In 1895 Chief White Calf of the Blackfeet authorized the sale of the mountain area , some 800 @,@ 000 acres ( 3 @,@ 200 km2 ) , to the U.S. government for $ 1 @.@ 5 million , with the understanding that they would maintain usage rights to the land for hunting as long as the ceded stripe will be public land of the United States . This established the current boundary between the park and the reservation . 
 While exploring the Marias River in 1806 , the Lewis and Clark Expedition came within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of the area that is now the park . A series of explorations after 1850 helped to shape the understanding of the area that later became the park . In 1885 George Bird Grinnell hired noted explorer ( and later well regarded author ) James Willard Schultz to guide him on a hunting expedition into what would later become the park . After several more trips to the region , Grinnell became so inspired by the scenery that he spent the next two decades working to establish a national park . In 1901 Grinnell wrote a description of the region in which he referred to it as the " Crown of the Continent " . His efforts to protect the land make him the premier contributor to this cause . A few years after Grinnell first visited , Henry L. Stimson and two companions , including a Blackfoot , climbed the steep east face of Chief Mountain in 1892 . 
 In 1891 the Great Northern Railway crossed the Continental Divide at Marias Pass 5 @,@ 213 feet ( 1 @,@ 589 m ) , which is along the southern boundary of the park . In an effort to stimulate use of the railroad , the Great Northern soon advertised the splendors of the region to the public . The company lobbied the United States Congress . In 1897 the park was designated as a forest preserve . Under the forest designation , mining was still allowed but was not commercially successful . Meanwhile , proponents of protecting the region kept up their efforts . In 1910 , under the influence of the Boone and Crockett Club , spearheaded by Club members George Bird Grinnell , Henry L. Stimson , and the railroad , a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress which redesignated the region from a forest reserve to a national park . This bill was signed into law by President William Howard Taft on May 11 , 1910 . In 1910 George Bird Grinnell wrote , " This Park , the country owes to the Boone and Crockett Club , whose members discovered the region , suggested it being set aside , caused the bill to be introduced into congress and awakened interest in it all over the country " . 
 From May until August 1910 , the forest reserve supervisor , Fremont Nathan Haines , managed the park 's resources as the first acting superintendent . In August 1910 , William Logan was appointed the park 's first superintendent . While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet , the enabling legislation of the national park does not mention the guarantees to the Native Americans . It is the position of the United States government that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi @-@ purpose public land status and the former rights ceased to exist as it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935 . Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist de jure . In the 1890s , armed standoffs were avoided narrowly several times . 
 The Great Northern Railway , under the supervision of president Louis W. Hill , built a number of hotels and chalets throughout the park in the 1910s to promote tourism . These buildings , constructed and operated by a Great Northern subsidiary called the Glacier Park Company , were modeled on Swiss architecture as part of Hill 's plan to portray Glacier as " America 's Switzerland " . Hill was especially interested in sponsoring artists to come to the park , building tourist lodges that displayed their work . His hotels in the park never made a profit but they attracted thousands of visitors who came via the Great Northern . 
 <unk> commonly took pack trips on horseback between the lodges or utilized the seasonal stagecoach routes to gain access to the Many Glacier area in the northeast . 
 The chalets , built between 1910 and 1913 , included Belton , St. Mary , Going @-@ to @-@ the @-@ Sun , Many Glacier , Two Medicine , Sperry , Granite Park , Cut Bank , and <unk> Lake . The railway also built Glacier Park Lodge , adjacent to the park on its east side , and the Many Glacier Hotel on the east shore of Swiftcurrent Lake . Louis Hill personally selected the sites for all of these buildings , choosing each for their dramatic scenic backdrops and views . Another developer , John Lewis , built the Lewis Glacier Hotel on Lake McDonald in 1913 – 1914 . The Great Northern Railway bought the hotel in 1930 and it was later renamed Lake McDonald Lodge . Some of the chalets were in remote backcountry locations accessible only by trail . Today , only Sperry , Granite Park , and Belton <unk> are still in operation , while a building formerly belonging to Two Medicine Chalet is now Two Medicine Store . The surviving chalet and hotel buildings within the park are now designated as National Historic Landmarks . In total , 350 buildings and structures within the park are listed on the National Register of Historic Places , including ranger stations , backcountry patrol cabins , fire lookouts , and concession facilities . 
 After the park was well established and visitors began to rely more on automobiles , work was begun on the 53 @-@ mile ( 85 km ) long Going @-@ to @-@ the @-@ Sun Road , completed in 1932 . Also known simply as the Sun Road , the road bisects the park and is the only route that ventures deep into the park , going over the Continental Divide at Logan Pass , 6 @,@ 646 feet ( 2 @,@ 026 m ) at the midway point . The Sun Road is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places and in 1985 was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark . Another route , along the southern boundary between the park and National Forests , is U.S. Route 2 , which crosses the Continental Divide at Marias Pass and connects the towns of West Glacier and East Glacier . 
 The Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , a New Deal relief agency for young men , played a major role between 1933 and 1942 in developing both Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park . CCC projects included reforestation , campground development , trail construction , fire hazard reduction , and fire @-@ fighting work . The increase in motor vehicle traffic through the park during the 1930s resulted in the construction of new concession facilities at Swiftcurrent and Rising Sun , both designed for automobile @-@ based tourism . These early auto camps are now also listed on the National Register . 
 In 2011 , Glacier National Park was depicted on the seventh quarter in the America the Beautiful Quarters series . 
 = = Park management = = 
 Glacier National Park is managed by the National Park Service , with the park 's headquarters in West Glacier , Montana . Visitation to Glacier National Park averages slightly less than 2 million visitors annually . However , a relative few venture far from main roadways and hotels . 
 Glacier National Park had an operating budget of $ 13 @,@ 190 @,@ 000 for the 2008 fiscal year . The 2008 budget increased from 2007 and was used to increase employee staffing levels , but monies for maintenance projects and road work were not forthcoming . In anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the park in 2010 , major reconstruction of the Going @-@ to @-@ the @-@ Sun Road was completed , creating temporary road closures . The Federal Highway Administration managed the reconstruction project in cooperation with the National Park Service . Some rehabilitation of major structures such as visitor centers and historic hotels , as well as improvements in wastewater treatment facilities and campgrounds , are expected to be completed by the anniversary date . Also planned are fishery studies for Lake McDonald , updates of the historical archives , and restoration of trails . 
 The mandate of the National Park Service is to " ... preserve and protect natural and cultural resources " . The Organic Act of August 25 , 1916 established the National Park Service as a federal agency . One major section of the Act has often been summarized as the " Mission " , " ... to promote and regulate the use of the ... national parks ... which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations . " In keeping with this mandate , hunting is illegal in the park , as are mining , logging , and the removal of natural or cultural resources . Additionally , oil and gas exploration and extraction are not permitted . These restrictions , however , caused a lot of conflict with the adjoining Blackfeet Indian Reservation . When they sold the land to the United States government , it was with the stipulation of being able to maintain their usage rights of the area , many of which ( such as hunting ) had come into conflict with these regulations . In 1974 , a wilderness study was submitted to Congress which identified 95 % of the area of the park as qualifying for wilderness designation . Unlike a few other parks , Glacier National Park has yet to be protected as wilderness , but National Park Service policy requires that identified areas listed in the report be managed as wilderness until Congress renders a full decision . Ninety @-@ three percent of Glacier National Park is managed as wilderness , even though it has not been officially designated . 
 = = Geography and geology = = 
 The park is bordered on the north by Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta , and the Flathead Provincial Forest and <unk> @-@ <unk> Provincial Park in British Columbia . To the west , the north fork of the Flathead River forms the western boundary , while its middle fork is part of the southern boundary . The Blackfeet Indian Reservation provides most of the eastern boundary . The Lewis and Clark and the Flathead National Forests form the southern and western boundary . The remote Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex is located in the two forests immediately to the south . 
 The park contains a dozen large lakes and 700 smaller ones , but only 131 lakes have been named . Lake McDonald on the western side of the park is the longest at 9 @.@ 4 miles ( 15 @.@ 1 km ) , the largest in area at 6 @,@ 823 acres ( 27 @.@ 61 km2 ) , and the deepest at 464 feet ( 141 m ) . Numerous smaller lakes , known as tarns , are located in cirques formed by glacial erosion . Some of these lakes , like Avalanche Lake and Cracker Lake , are colored an opaque turquoise by suspended glacial silt , which also causes a number of streams to run milky white . The lakes of Glacier National Park remain cold year round , with temperatures rarely above 50 ° F ( 10 ° C ) at their surface . Cold water lakes such as these support little plankton growth , ensuring that the lake waters are remarkably clear . The lack of plankton , however , lowers the rate of pollution filtration , so pollutants have a tendency to linger longer . Consequently , the lakes are considered environmental <unk> as they can be quickly affected by even minor increases in pollutants . 
 Two hundred waterfalls are scattered throughout the park . However , during drier times of the year , many of these are reduced to a trickle . The largest falls include those in the Two Medicine region , McDonald Falls in the McDonald Valley , and Swiftcurrent Falls in the Many Glacier area , which is easily observable and close to the Many Glacier Hotel . One of the tallest waterfalls is Bird Woman Falls , which drops 492 feet ( 150 m ) from a hanging valley beneath the north slope of Mount Oberlin . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 The rocks found in the park are primarily sedimentary rocks of the Belt Supergroup . They were deposited in shallow seas over 1 @.@ 6 billion to 800 million years ago . During the formation of the Rocky Mountains 170 million years ago , one region of rocks now known as the Lewis <unk> was forced eastward 50 miles ( 80 km ) . This <unk> was several miles ( kilometers ) thick and hundreds of miles ( kilometers ) long . This resulted in older rocks being displaced over newer ones , so the overlying Proterozoic rocks are between 1 @.@ 4 and 1 @.@ 5 billion years older than Cretaceous age rocks they now rest on . 
 One of the most dramatic evidences of this <unk> is visible in the form of Chief Mountain , an isolated peak on the edge of the eastern boundary of the park rising 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 800 m ) above the Great Plains . There are six mountains in the park over 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) in elevation , with Mount Cleveland at 10 @,@ 466 feet ( 3 @,@ 190 m ) being the tallest . Appropriately named Triple Divide Peak sends waters towards the Pacific Ocean , Hudson Bay , and Gulf of Mexico watersheds . This peak can effectively be considered to be the apex of the North American continent , although the mountain is only 8 @,@ 020 feet ( 2 @,@ 444 m ) above sea level . 
 The rocks in Glacier National Park are the best preserved Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world , with some of the world 's most fruitful sources for records of early life . Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes ; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe . The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter @-@ scale lamination , ripple marks , mud cracks , salt @-@ crystal casts , raindrop impressions , <unk> , and other sedimentary bedding characteristics . Six fossilized species of Stromatolites , early organisms consisting of primarily blue @-@ green algae , have been documented and dated at about 1 billion years . The discovery of the <unk> Formation , a well preserved rock stratum in the park , pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years . This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan ( animal ) life on Earth . 
 = = = Glaciers = = = 
 Glacier National Park is dominated by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age . These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12 @,@ 000 years . Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park in the form of U @-@ shaped valleys , glacial cirques , arêtes and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers from the base of the highest peaks . Since the end of the ice ages , various warming and cooling trends have occurred . The last recent cooling trend was during the Little Ice Age , which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850 . During the Little Ice Age , the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced , although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age . 
 During the middle of the 20th century , examination of the maps and photographs from the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated , and in many cases disappeared altogether . Repeat photography of the glaciers , such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown , help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat . 
 In the 1980s , the U.S. Geological Survey began a more systematic study of the remaining glaciers , which has continued to the present day . By 2010 , 37 glaciers remained , but only 25 of these were considered to be " active glaciers " of at least 25 acres ( 0 @.@ 10 km2 ) in area . If the current warming trend continues , all of the remaining glaciers in the park will be gone by 2030 . This glacier retreat follows a worldwide pattern that has accelerated even more since 1980 . Without a major climatic change in which cooler and moister weather returns and persists , the mass balance , which is the accumulation rate versus the ablation ( melting ) rate of glaciers , will continue to be negative and the glaciers have been projected to eventually disappear , leaving behind only barren rock . 
 After the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850 , the glaciers in the park retreated moderately until the 1910s . Between 1917 and 1941 , the retreat rate accelerated and was as high as 330 feet ( 100 m ) per year for some glaciers . A slight cooling trend from the 1940s until 1979 helped to slow the rate of retreat and , in a few cases , even advanced the glaciers over ten meters . However , during the 1980s , the glaciers in the park began a steady period of loss of glacial ice , which continues as of 2010 . In 1850 , the glaciers in the region near Blackfoot and Jackson Glaciers covered 5 @,@ 337 acres ( 21 @.@ 6 km2 ) , but by 1979 , the same region of the park had glacier ice covering only 1 @,@ 828 acres ( 7 @.@ 4 km2 ) . Between 1850 and 1979 , 73 % of the glacial ice had melted away . At the time the park was created , Jackson Glacier was part of Blackfoot Glacier , but the two have separated into two glaciers since . 
 The impact of glacier retreat on the park 's ecosystems is not fully known , but plant and animal species that are dependent on cold water could suffer due to a loss of habitat . Reduced seasonal melting of glacial ice may also affect stream flow during the dry summer and fall seasons , reducing water table levels and increasing the risk of forest fires . The loss of glaciers will also reduce the aesthetic visual appeal that glaciers provide to visitors . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 As the park spans the Continental Divide , and has more than 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) in elevation variance , many climates and microclimates are found in the park . As with other alpine systems , average temperature usually drops as elevation increases . The western side of the park , in the Pacific watershed , has a milder and wetter climate , due to its lower elevation . Precipitation is greatest during the winter and spring , averaging 2 to 3 inches ( 50 to 80 mm ) per month . Snowfall can occur at any time of the year , even in the summer , and especially at higher altitudes . The winter can bring prolonged cold waves , especially on the eastern side of the Continental Divide , which is has a higher elevation overall . Snowfalls are significant over the course of the winter , with the largest accumulation occurring in the west . During the tourist season , daytime high temperatures average 60 to 70 ° F ( 16 to 21 ° C ) , and nighttime lows usually drop into the 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) range . Temperatures in the high country may be much cooler . In the lower western valleys , daytime highs in the summer may reach 90 ° F ( 30 ° C ) . 
 Rapid temperature changes have been noted in the region . In Browning , Montana , just east of the park in the Blackfeet Reservation , a world record temperature drop of 100 ° F ( 56 ° C ) in only 24 hours occurred on the night of January 23 – 24 , 1916 , when thermometers plunged from 44 to − 56 ° F ( 7 to − 49 ° C ) . 
 Glacier National Park has a highly regarded global climate change research program . Based in West Glacier , with the main headquarters in Bozeman , Montana , the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992 . In addition to the study of the retreating glaciers , research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed . Additionally , changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented , watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations , and atmospheric research in which UV @-@ B radiation , ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time . The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park . The data collected , when compared to other facilities scattered around the world , help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale . 
 Glacier is considered to have excellent air and water quality . No major areas of dense human population exist anywhere near the region and industrial effects are minimized due to a scarcity of factories and other potential contributors of pollutants . However , the sterile and cold lakes found throughout the park are easily contaminated by airborne pollutants that fall whenever it rains or snows , and some evidence of these pollutants has been found in park waters . Wildfires could also impact the quality of water . However , the pollution level is currently viewed as negligible , and the park lakes and waterways have a water quality rating of A @-@ 1 , the highest rating given by the state of Montana .

 Glacier is part of a large preserved ecosystem collectively known as the " Crown of the Continent Ecosystem " , all of which is primarily untouched wilderness of a pristine quality . Virtually all the plants and animals which existed at the time European explorers first entered the region are present in the park today . 
 A total of over 1 @,@ 132 plant species have been identified <unk> . The predominantly coniferous forest is home to various species of trees such as the Engelmann spruce , Douglas fir , subalpine fir , limber pine and western larch , which is a deciduous conifer , producing cones but losing its needles each fall . Cottonwood and aspen are the more common deciduous trees and are found at lower elevations , usually along lakes and streams . The timberline on the eastern side of the park is almost 800 feet ( 244 m ) lower than on the western side of the Continental Divide , due to exposure to the colder winds and weather of the Great Plains . West of the Continental Divide , the forest receives more moisture and is more protected from the winter , resulting in a more densely populated forest with taller trees . Above the forested valleys and mountain slopes , alpine tundra conditions prevail , with grasses and small plants eking out an existence in a region that enjoys as little as three months without snow cover . Thirty species of plants are found only in the park and surrounding national forests . <unk> , a tall flowering plant , is commonly found near moisture sources , and is relatively widespread during July and August . Wildflowers such as monkeyflower , glacier lily , fireweed , <unk> and Indian paintbrush are also common . 
 The forested sections fall into three major climatic zones . The west and northwest are dominated by spruce and fir and the southwest by redcedar and hemlock ; the areas east of the Continental Divide are a combination of mixed pine , spruce , fir and prairie zones . The cedar @-@ hemlock groves along the Lake McDonald valley are the easternmost examples of this Pacific climatic ecosystem . 
 Whitebark pine communities have been heavily damaged due to the effects of blister rust , a non native fungus . In Glacier and the surrounding region , 30 % of the whitebark pine trees have died and over 70 % of the remaining trees are currently infected . The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed , commonly known as the pine nut , that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark 's nutcracker . Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts , one of the bears ' favorite foods . Between 1930 and 1970 , efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful , and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely , with attendant negative impacts on dependent species . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 Virtually all the historically known plant and animal species , with the exception of the bison and woodland caribou , are still present , providing biologists with an intact ecosystem for plant and animal research . Two threatened species of mammals , the grizzly bear and the Canadian lynx , are found in the park . Although their numbers remain at historical levels , both are listed as threatened because in nearly every other region of the U.S. outside of Alaska , they are either extremely rare or absent from their historical range . On average , one or two bear attacks on humans occur each year ; since the creation of the park in 1910 , there have been a total of 10 bear @-@ related deaths . The number of grizzlies and lynx in the park is not known for certain , but park biologists believed as of 2008 that there were just above 300 grizzlies in the park ; a study which commenced in 2001 hopes to determine the number of lynx . The exact population figures for grizzlies and the smaller black bear are not known but biologists are using a variety of methods to try to determine an accurate population range . Another study has indicated that the wolverine , another very rare mammal in the lower 48 states , also lives in the park . Other mammals such as the mountain goat ( the official park symbol ) , bighorn sheep , moose , elk , mule deer , skunk , white @-@ tailed deer , bobcat , coyote , and cougar are either plentiful or common . Unlike in Yellowstone National Park , which implemented a wolf reintroduction program in the 1990s , it is believed that wolves recolonized Glacier National Park naturally during the 1980s . Sixty @-@ two species of mammals have been documented including badger , river otter , porcupine , mink , marten , fisher , six species of bat and numerous other smaller mammals . 
 A total of 260 species of birds have been recorded , with raptors such as the bald eagle , golden eagle , peregrine falcon , osprey and several species of hawks residing year round . The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways . The great blue heron , tundra swan , Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park . Great horned owl , Clark 's nutcracker , Steller 's jay , pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides , and in the higher altitudes , the ptarmigan , timberline sparrow and rosy finch are the most likely to be seen . The Clark 's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the decline in the number of whitebark pines . 
 Because of the colder climate , ectothermic reptiles are all but absent , with two species of garter snake and the western painted turtle being the only three reptile species proven to exist . Similarly , only six species of amphibians are documented , although those species exist in large numbers . After a forest fire in 2001 , a few park roads were temporarily closed the following year to allow thousands of western toads to migrate to other areas . 
 A total of 23 species of fish reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope cutthroat trout , northern pike , mountain whitefish , kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling . Glacier is also home to the threatened bull trout , which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently . Introduction in previous decades of lake trout and other non @-@ native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations , especially the bull trout and west slope cutthroat trout . 
 = = = Fire ecology = = = 
 Forest fires were viewed for many decades as a threat to protected areas such as forests and parks . As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s , forest fires were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem . The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants , which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn . Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive . Glacier National Park has a fire management plan which ensures that human @-@ caused fires are generally suppressed . In the case of natural fires , the fire is monitored and suppression is dependent on the size and threat the fire may pose to human safety and structures . 
 Increased population and the growth of suburban areas near parklands , has led to the development of what is known as Wildland Urban Interface Fire Management , in which the park cooperates with adjacent property owners in improving safety and fire awareness . This approach is common to many other protected areas . As part of this program , houses and structures near the park are designed to be more fire resistant . Dead and fallen trees are removed from near places of human habitation , reducing the available fuel load and the risk of a catastrophic fire , and advance warning systems are developed to help alert property owners and visitors about forest fire potentials during a given period of the year . Glacier National Park has an average of 14 fires with 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 km2 ) burnt each year . In 2003 , 136 @,@ 000 acres ( 550 km2 ) burned in the park after a five @-@ year drought and a summer season of almost no precipitation . This was the most area transformed by fire since the creation of the park in 1910 . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 Glacier is distant from major cities . The closest airport is in Kalispell , Montana , southwest of the park . Amtrak trains stop at East and West Glacier , and Essex . A fleet of restored 1930s White Motor Company coaches , called Red Jammers , offer tours on all the main roads in the park . The drivers of the buses are called " Jammers " , due to the gear @-@ jamming that formerly occurred during the vehicles ' operation . The tour buses were rebuilt in 2001 by Ford Motor Company . The bodies were removed from their original chassis and built on modern Ford E @-@ Series van chassis . They were also converted to run on propane to lessen their environmental impact . 
 Historic wooden tour boats , some dating back to the 1920s , operate on some of the larger lakes . Several of these boats have been in continuous seasonal operation at Glacier National Park since 1927 and carry up to 80 passengers . 
 Hiking is popular in the park . Over half of the visitors to the park report taking a hike on the park 's nearly 700 miles ( 1 @,@ 127 km ) of trails . 110 miles ( 177 km ) of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail spans most of the distance of the park north to south , with a few alternative routes at lower elevations if high altitude passes are closed due to snow . The Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail crosses the park on 52 miles ( 84 km ) from east to west . 
 Dogs are not permitted on any trails in the park due to the presence of bears and other large mammals . Dogs are permitted at front country campsites that can be accessed by a vehicle and along paved roads . 
 Anyone entering the United States over land or waterway from Canada must have a passport with them . 
 Many day hikes can be taken in the park . Back @-@ country camping is allowed at campsites along the trails . A permit is required and can be obtained from certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance . Much of Glacier 's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snow pack and avalanche risk , and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July . Campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park , most of which are near one of the larger lakes . The campgrounds at St. Mary and at <unk> are open year round , but conditions are primitive in the off @-@ season , as the restroom facilities are closed and there is no running water . All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid @-@ June until mid @-@ September . Guide and shuttle services are also available . 
 Fishing is popular in the park . Some of the finest fly fishing in North America can be found in the streams that flow through Glacier National Park . Though the park requires that those fishing understand the regulations , no permit is required to fish the waters within the park boundary . The threatened bull trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught ; otherwise , the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal . 
 Winter recreation in Glacier is limited . <unk> is illegal throughout the park . Cross @-@ country skiing is permitted in the lower altitude valleys away from avalanche zones .

 = John , King of England = 
 John ( 24 December 1166 – 19 October 1216 ) , also known as John Lackland ( Norman French : Johan <unk> Terre ) , was King of England from 6 April 1199 until his death in 1216 . John lost the Duchy of Normandy to King Philip II of France , which resulted in the collapse of most of the Angevin Empire and contributed to the subsequent growth in power of the Capetian dynasty during the 13th century . The baronial revolt at the end of John 's reign led to the sealing of the Magna Carta , a document sometimes considered to be an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom . 
 John , the youngest of five sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine , was at first not expected to inherit significant lands . Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174 , however , John became Henry 's favourite child . He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent . John 's elder brothers William , Henry and Geoffrey died young ; by the time Richard I became king in 1189 , John was a potential heir to the throne . John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard 's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the Third Crusade . Despite this , after Richard died in 1199 , John was proclaimed King of England , and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John 's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200 . 
 When war with France broke out again in 1202 , John achieved early victories , but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman , Breton and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204 . John spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands , raising huge revenues , reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances . John 's judicial reforms had a lasting impact on the English common law system , as well as providing an additional source of revenue . An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John 's excommunication in 1209 , a dispute finally settled by the king in 1213 . John 's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John 's allies at the battle of Bouvines . When he returned to England , John faced a rebellion by many of his barons , who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England 's most powerful nobles . Although both John and the barons agreed to the Magna Carta peace treaty in 1215 , neither side complied with its conditions . Civil war broke out shortly afterwards , with the barons aided by Louis of France . It soon descended into a stalemate . John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216 ; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year . 
 Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John 's performance as king , and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards . Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the current historical opinion of John 's positive qualities , observing that John is today usually considered a " hard @-@ working administrator , an able man , an able general " . Nonetheless , modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king , including what historian Ralph Turner describes as " distasteful , even dangerous personality traits " , such as pettiness , spitefulness and cruelty . These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era , and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture , primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends . 
 = = Early life ( 1166 – 89 ) = = 
 = = = Childhood and the Angevin inheritance = = = 
 John was born to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166 . Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard — Anjou , Normandy and England — and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany . Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine , who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France , in addition to being the former wife of Louis VII of France . The result was the Angevin Empire , named after Henry 's paternal title as Count of Anjou and , more specifically , its seat in Angers . The Empire , however , was inherently fragile : although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry , the disparate parts each had their own histories , traditions and governance structures . As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine , the extent of Henry 's power in the provinces diminished considerably , scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all . Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time . It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry 's death . Although the custom of primogeniture , under which an eldest son would inherit all his father 's lands , was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe , it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England . Most believed that Henry would divide the empire , giving each son a substantial portion , and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death . To complicate matters , much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet . Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France , making the feudal relationship even more challenging . 
 Shortly after his birth , John was passed from Eleanor into the care of a wet nurse , a traditional practice for medieval noble families . Eleanor then left for Poitiers , the capital of Aquitaine , and sent John and his sister Joan north to Fontevrault Abbey . This may have been done with the aim of steering her youngest son , with no obvious inheritance , towards a future ecclesiastical career . Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John 's very early life . John was probably , like his brothers , assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault , a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household ; John was later taught by Ranulph Glanville , a leading English administrator . John spent some time as a member of the household of his eldest living brother Henry the Young King , where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills . 
 John grew up to be around 5 ft 5 in ( 1 @.@ 68 m ) tall , relatively short , with a " powerful , barrel @-@ chested body " and dark red hair ; he looked to contemporaries like an inhabitant of Poitou . John enjoyed reading and , unusually for the period , built up a travelling library of books . He enjoyed gambling , in particular at backgammon , and was an enthusiastic hunter , even by medieval standards . He liked music , although not songs . John would become a " connoisseur of jewels " , building up a large collection , and became famous for his opulent clothes and also , according to French chroniclers , for his fondness for bad wine . As John grew up , he became known for sometimes being " genial , witty , generous and hospitable " ; at other moments , he could be jealous , over @-@ sensitive and prone to fits of rage , " biting and gnawing his fingers " in anger . 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 During John 's early years , Henry attempted to resolve the question of his succession . Henry the Young King had been crowned King of England in 1170 , but was not given any formal powers by his father ; he was also promised Normandy and Anjou as part of his future inheritance . Richard was to be appointed the Count of Poitou with control of Aquitaine , whilst Geoffrey was to become the Duke of Brittany . At this time it seemed unlikely that John would ever inherit substantial lands , and he was jokingly nicknamed " Lackland " by his father . 
 Henry II wanted to secure the southern borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais , the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy . As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy , Piedmont , Maurienne , and the other possessions of Count Humbert . For his part in the potential marriage alliance , Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon , Loudun and Mirebeau into John 's name ; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes . Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this ; although he had yet to be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom , these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation . Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II 's court , but she died before marrying John , which left the prince once again without an inheritance . 
 In 1173 John 's elder brothers , backed by Eleanor , rose in revolt against Henry in the short @-@ lived rebellion of 1173 to 1174 . Growing irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense , Henry the Young King travelled to Paris and allied himself with Louis VII . Eleanor , irritated by her husband 's persistent interference in Aquitaine , encouraged Richard and Geoffrey to join their brother Henry in Paris . Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons , but was generous to them in the peace settlement agreed at Montlouis . Henry the Young King was allowed to travel widely in Europe with his own household of knights , Richard was given Aquitaine back , and Geoffrey was allowed to return to Brittany ; only Eleanor was imprisoned for her role in the revolt . 
 John had spent the conflict travelling alongside his father , and was given widespread possessions across the Angevin empire as part of the Montlouis settlement ; from then onwards , most observers regarded John as Henry II 's favourite child , although he was the furthest removed in terms of the royal succession . Henry II began to find more lands for John , mostly at various nobles ' expense . In 1175 he appropriated the estates of the late Earl of Cornwall and gave them to John . The following year , Henry disinherited the sisters of Isabelle of Gloucester , contrary to legal custom , and betrothed John to the now extremely wealthy Isabelle . In 1177 , at the Council of Oxford , Henry dismissed William <unk> as the Lord of Ireland and replaced him with the ten @-@ year @-@ old John . 
 Henry the Young King fought a short war with his brother Richard in 1183 over the status of England , Normandy and Aquitaine . Henry II moved in support of Richard , and Henry the Young King died from dysentery at the end of the campaign . With his primary heir dead , Henry rearranged the plans for the succession : Richard was to be made King of England , albeit without any actual power until the death of his father ; Geoffrey would retain Brittany ; and John would now become the Duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard . Richard refused to give up Aquitaine ; Henry II was furious and ordered John , with help from Geoffrey , to march south and retake the duchy by force . The two attacked the capital of Poitiers , and Richard responded by attacking Brittany . The war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation in England at the end of 1184 . 
 In 1185 John made his first visit to Ireland , accompanied by 300 knights and a team of administrators . Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland , but Pope Lucius III would not agree . John 's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success . Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo @-@ Norman forces , and tensions were still rife between Henry II , the new settlers and the existing inhabitants . John infamously offended the local Irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards , failed to make allies amongst the Anglo @-@ Norman settlers , began to lose ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England later in the year , blaming the viceroy , Hugh de Lacy , for the fiasco . 
 The problems amongst John 's wider family continued to grow . His elder brother Geoffrey died during a tournament in 1186 , leaving a posthumous son , Arthur , and an elder daughter , Eleanor . Geoffrey 's death brought John slightly closer to the throne of England . The uncertainty about what would happen after Henry 's death continued to grow ; Richard was keen to join a new crusade and remained concerned that whilst he was away Henry would appoint John his formal successor . 
 Richard began discussions about a potential alliance with Philip II in Paris during 1187 , and the next year Richard gave homage to Philip in exchange for support for a war against Henry . Richard and Philip fought a joint campaign against Henry , and by the summer of 1189 the king made peace , promising Richard the succession . John initially remained loyal to his father , but changed sides once it appeared that Richard would win . Henry died shortly afterwards . 
 = = Richard 's reign ( 1189 – 99 ) = = 
 When John 's elder brother Richard became king in September 1189 , he had already declared his intention of joining the Third Crusade . Richard set about raising the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands , titles and appointments , and attempted to ensure that he would not face a revolt while away from his empire . John was made Count of Mortain , was married to the wealthy Isabel of Gloucester , and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall , Derby , Devon , Dorset , Nottingham and Somerset , all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade . Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties , thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power , and , for the time being , the king named the four @-@ year @-@ old Arthur of Brittany as the heir to the throne . In return , John promised not to visit England for the next three years , thereby in theory giving Richard adequate time to conduct a successful crusade and return from the Levant without fear of John seizing power . Richard left political authority in England – the post of justiciar – jointly in the hands of Bishop Hugh de Puiset and William Mandeville , and made William Longchamp , the Bishop of Ely , his chancellor . Mandeville immediately died , and Longchamp took over as joint justiciar with Puiset , which would prove to be a less than satisfactory partnership . Eleanor , the queen mother , convinced Richard to allow John into England in his absence . 
 The political situation in England rapidly began to deteriorate . Longchamp refused to work with Puiset and became unpopular with the English nobility and clergy . John exploited this unpopularity to set himself up as an alternative ruler with his own royal court , complete with his own justiciar , chancellor and other royal posts , and was happy to be portrayed as an alternative regent , and possibly the next king . Armed conflict broke out between John and Longchamp , and by October 1191 Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London with John in control of the city of London , thanks to promises John had made to the citizens in return for recognition as Richard 's heir presumptive . At this point Walter of Coutances , the Archbishop of Rouen , returned to England , having been sent by Richard to restore order . John 's position was undermined by Walter 's relative popularity and by the news that Richard had married whilst in Cyprus , which presented the possibility that Richard would have legitimate children and heirs . 
 The political turmoil continued . John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II , freshly returned from the crusade . John hoped to acquire Normandy , Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip . John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother . Longchamp , who had left England after Walter 's intervention , now returned , and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar . John intervened , suppressing Longchamp 's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration , including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne . When Richard still did not return from the crusade , John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost . Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI , who held him for ransom . John seized the opportunity and went to Paris , where he formed an alliance with Philip . He agreed to set aside his wife , Isabella of Gloucester , and marry Philip 's sister , <unk> , in exchange for Philip 's support . Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John . John 's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce ; in early 1194 the king finally returned to England , and John 's remaining forces surrendered . John retreated to Normandy , where Richard finally found him later that year . Richard declared that his younger brother – despite being 27 years old – was merely " a child who has had evil counsellors " and forgave him , but removed his lands with the exception of Ireland . 
 For the remaining years of Richard 's reign , John supported his brother on the continent , apparently loyally . Richard 's policy on the continent was to attempt to regain through steady , limited campaigns the castles he had lost to Philip II whilst on crusade . He allied himself with the leaders of Flanders , Boulogne and the Holy Roman Empire to apply pressure on Philip from Germany . In 1195 John successfully conducted a sudden attack and siege of Évreux castle , and subsequently managed the defences of Normandy against Philip . The following year , John seized the town of <unk> and led a raiding party within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of Paris , capturing the Bishop of Beauvais . In return for this service , Richard withdrew his malevolentia ( ill @-@ will ) towards John , restored him to the county of Gloucestershire and made him again the Count of Mortain .

 = = = Accession to the throne , 1199 = = = 
 After Richard 's death on 6 April 1199 there were two potential claimants to the Angevin throne : John , whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of Henry II , and young Arthur I of Brittany , who held a claim as the son of John 's elder brother Geoffrey . Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death , but the matter was not clear @-@ cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided . With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry 's elder son , the matter rapidly became an open conflict . John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster , backed by his mother , Eleanor . Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton , Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II , who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent . With Arthur 's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip 's forces moving down the valley towards Tours , John 's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two . 
 Warfare in Normandy at the time was shaped by the defensive potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns . The Norman frontiers had limited natural defences but were heavily reinforced with castles , such as Château Gaillard , at strategic points , built and maintained at considerable expense . It was difficult for a commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications , which slowed the progress of any attack . Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces . Feudal levies could only be raised for a fixed length of time before they returned home , forcing an end to a campaign ; mercenary forces , often called <unk> after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe , could operate all year long and provide a commander with more strategic options to pursue a campaign , but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces . As a result , commanders of the period were increasingly drawing on larger numbers of mercenaries . 
 After his coronation , John moved south into France with military forces and adopted a defensive posture along the eastern and southern Normandy borders . Both sides paused for desultory negotiations before the war recommenced ; John 's position was now stronger , thanks to confirmation that the counts Baldwin IX of Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne had renewed the anti @-@ French alliances they had previously agreed to with Richard . The powerful Anjou nobleman William des Roches was persuaded to switch sides from Arthur to John ; suddenly the balance seemed to be tipping away from Philip and Arthur in favour of John . Neither side was keen to continue the conflict , and following a papal truce the two leaders met in January 1200 to negotiate possible terms for peace . From John 's perspective , what then followed represented an opportunity to stabilise control over his continental possessions and produce a lasting peace with Philip in Paris . John and Philip negotiated the May 1200 Treaty of Le Goulet ; by this treaty , Philip recognised John as the rightful heir to Richard in respect to his French possessions , temporarily abandoning the wider claims of his client , Arthur . John , in turn , abandoned Richard 's former policy of containing Philip through alliances with Flanders and Boulogne , and accepted Philip 's right as the legitimate feudal overlord of John 's lands in France . John 's policy earned him the disrespectful title of " John <unk> " from some English chroniclers , who contrasted his behaviour with his more aggressive brother , Richard . 
 = = = Le Goulet peace , 1200 – 02 = = = 
 The new peace would only last for two years ; war recommenced in the aftermath of John 's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoulême . In order to remarry , John first needed to abandon Isabel , Countess of Gloucester , his first wife ; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin , John could not have legally wed her without this . It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême . Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella , and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful , if rather young , girl . On the other hand , the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John : by marrying Isabella , John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony , which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine . 
 Unfortunately , Isabella was already engaged to Hugh of Lusignan , an important member of a key Poitou noble family and brother of Count Raoul of Eu , who possessed lands along the sensitive eastern Normandy border . Just as John stood to benefit strategically from marrying Isabella , so the marriage threatened the interests of the Lusignans , whose own lands currently provided the key route for royal goods and troops across Aquitaine . Rather than negotiating some form of compensation , John treated Hugh " with contempt " ; this resulted in a Lusignan uprising that was promptly crushed by John , who also intervened to suppress Raoul in Normandy . 
 Although John was the Count of Poitou and therefore the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans , they could legitimately appeal John 's actions in France to his own feudal lord , Philip . Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202 , citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case . John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way . He argued that he need not attend Philip 's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy , who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court . Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy , but as the Count of Poitou , which carried no such special status . When John still refused to come , Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities , reassigned all of John 's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – with the exception of Normandy , which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John . 
 = = = Loss of Normandy , 1202 – 04 = = = 
 John initially adopted a defensive posture similar to that of 1199 : avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles . John 's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed , and Philip began to make steady progress in the east . John became aware in July that Arthur 's forces were threatening his mother , Eleanor , at Mirebeau Castle . Accompanied by William de Roches , his seneschal in Anjou , he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her . His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau . With his southern flank weakening , Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John 's army . 
 John 's position in France was considerably strengthened by the victory at Mirebeau , but John 's treatment of his new prisoners and of his ally , William de Roches , quickly undermined these gains . De Roches was a powerful Anjou noble , but John largely ignored him , causing considerable offence , whilst the king kept the rebel leaders in such bad conditions that twenty @-@ two of them died . At this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship , and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable . William de Roches and other of John 's regional allies in Anjou and Brittany deserted him in favour of Philip , and Brittany rose in fresh revolt . John 's financial situation was tenuous : once factors such as the comparative military costs of materiel and soldiers were taken into account , Philip enjoyed a considerable , although not overwhelming , advantage of resources over John . 
 Further desertions of John 's local allies at the beginning of 1203 steadily reduced John 's freedom to manoeuvre in the region . He attempted to convince Pope Innocent III to intervene in the conflict , but Innocent 's efforts were unsuccessful . As the situation became worse for John , he appears to have decided to have Arthur killed , with the aim of removing his potential rival and of undermining the rebel movement in Brittany . Arthur had initially been imprisoned at Falaise and was then moved to Rouen . After this , Arthur 's fate remains uncertain , but modern historians believe he was murdered by John . The annals of Margam Abbey suggest that " John had captured Arthur and kept him alive in prison for some time in the castle of Rouen ... when John was drunk he slew Arthur with his own hand and tying a heavy stone to the body cast it into the Seine . " Rumours of the manner of Arthur 's death further reduced support for John across the region . Arthur 's sister , Eleanor , who had also been captured at Mirebeau , was kept imprisoned by John for many years , albeit in relatively good conditions . 
 In late 1203 , John attempted to relieve Château Gaillard , which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy . John attempted a synchronised operation involving land @-@ based and water @-@ borne forces , considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception , but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully . John 's relief operation was blocked by Philip 's forces , and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy . John successfully devastated much of Brittany , but did not deflect Philip 's main thrust into the east of Normandy . Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign , with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable , although not impressive . John 's situation began to deteriorate rapidly . The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years , whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard 's giving away of various key castles some years before . His use of <unk> mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too , which set the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power . John retreated back across the Channel in December , sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard . In March 1204 , Gaillard fell . John 's mother Eleanor died the following month . This was not just a personal blow for John , but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France . Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy , now facing little resistance . By August , Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well . John 's only remaining possession on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine . 
 = = John as king = = 
 = = = Kingship and royal administration = = = 
 The nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill @-@ defined and uncertain . John 's predecessors had ruled using the principle of vis et voluntas , or " force and will " , taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions , often justified on the basis that a king was above the law . Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of " divine majesty " ; John continued this trend and claimed an " almost imperial status " for himself as ruler . During the 12th century , there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship , and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law , and take counsel of the leading members of the realm . There was as yet no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so . Despite his claim to unique authority within England , John would sometimes justify his actions on the basis that he had taken council with the barons . Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of " royal schizophrenia " in his approach to government , or if his actions merely reflected the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century . 
 John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England , with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household : the Chancery kept written records and communications ; the Treasury and the Exchequer dealt with income and expenditure respectively ; and various judges were deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom . Thanks to the efforts of men like Hubert Walter , this trend towards improved record keeping continued into his reign . Like previous kings , John managed a peripatetic court that travelled around the kingdom , dealing with both local and national matters as he went . John was very active in the administration of England and was involved in every aspect of government . In part he was following in the tradition of Henry I and Henry II , but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased , which put much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style . John was in England for much longer periods than his predecessors , which made his rule more personal than that of previous kings , particularly in previously ignored areas such as the north . 
 The administration of justice was of particular importance to John . Several new processes had been introduced to English law under Henry II , including novel disseisin and mort d 'ancestor . These processes meant the royal courts had a more significant role in local law cases , which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local lords . John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs , and extended the system of coroners first introduced by Hubert Walter in 1194 , creating a new class of borough coroners . John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well , through judges he had appointed , by fostering legal specialists and expertise , and by intervening in cases himself . John continued to try relatively minor cases , even during military crises . Viewed positively , Lewis Warren considers that John discharged " his royal duty of providing justice ... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the English common law is greatly <unk> " . Seen more critically , John may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees , rather than a desire to deliver simple justice ; John 's legal system also only applied to free men , rather than to all of the population . Nonetheless , these changes were popular with many free tenants , who acquired a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons , against whom such cases were often brought . John 's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves , especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice . 
 = = = Economy = = = 
 One of John 's principal challenges was acquiring the large sums of money needed for his proposed campaigns to reclaim Normandy . The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them , namely revenue from their personal lands , or demesne ; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord ; and revenue from taxation . Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the Norman conquest . Matters were not helped by Richard 's sale of many royal properties in 1189 , and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries . English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income , including the scutage system , in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king . He derived income from fines , court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges . John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income , to the extent that he has been described as " avaricious , miserly , extortionate and <unk> " . John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons : debts owed to the crown by the king 's favoured supporters might be forgiven ; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced . 
 The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures . John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king , as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs . In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign , which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service . John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited , sometimes charging enormous sums , beyond barons ' abilities to pay . Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194 , John initiated a new round of appointments , with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties , particularly in the forests . Another innovation of Richard 's , increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single , was expanded under John . John continued to sell charters for new towns , including the planned town of Liverpool , and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony . The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones . The Jews , who held a vulnerable position in medieval England , protected only by the king , were subject to huge taxes ; £ 44 @,@ 000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210 ; much of it was passed on to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders . John created a new tax on income and movable goods in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £ 60 @,@ 000 ; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown . John found that these measures enabled him to raise further resources through the confiscation of the lands of barons who could not pay or refused to pay . 
 At the start of John 's reign there was a sudden change in prices , as bad harvests and high demand for food resulted in much higher prices for grain and animals . This inflationary pressure was to continue for the rest of the 13th century and had long @-@ term economic consequences for England . The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John 's military campaigns . It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver , which was then re @-@ minted into new coins ; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country , to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs . At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy , for example , huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months , which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by , commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy . The result was political unrest across the country . John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage , improving its quality and consistency . 
 = = = Royal household and ira et malevolentia = = = 
 John 's royal household was based around several groups of followers . One group was the familiares regis , John 's immediate friends and knights who travelled around the country with him . They also played an important role in organising and leading military campaigns . Another section of royal followers were the curia regis ; these <unk> were the senior officials and agents of the king and were essential to his day @-@ to @-@ day rule . Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages , as it was easier to gain favours from the king , file lawsuits , marry a wealthy heiress or have one 's debts remitted . By the time of Henry II , these posts were increasingly being filled by " new men " from outside the normal ranks of the barons . This intensified under John 's rule , with many lesser nobles arriving from the continent to take up positions at court ; many were mercenary leaders from Poitou . These men included soldiers who would become infamous in England for their uncivilised behaviour , including Falkes de Breauté , <unk> d <unk> , <unk> de <unk> and Philip Marc . Many barons perceived the king 's household as what Ralph Turner has characterised as a " narrow clique enjoying royal favour at barons ' expense " staffed by men of lesser status . 
 This trend for the king to rely on his own men at the expense of the barons was exacerbated by the tradition of Angevin royal ira et malevolentia – " anger and ill @-@ will " – and John 's own personality . From Henry II onwards , ira et malevolentia had come to describe the right of the king to express his anger and displeasure at particular barons or clergy , building on the Norman concept of <unk> – royal ill @-@ will . In the Norman period , suffering the king 's ill @-@ will meant difficulties in obtaining grants , honours or petitions ; Henry II had infamously expressed his fury and ill @-@ will towards Thomas Becket ; this ultimately resulted in Becket 's death . John now had the additional ability to " cripple his vassals " on a significant scale using his new economic and judicial measures , which made the threat of royal anger all the more serious . 
 John was deeply suspicious of the barons , particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king . Numerous barons were subjected to John 's malevolentia , even including William Marshal , a famous knight and baron normally held up as a model of utter loyalty . The most infamous case , which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time , proved to be that of William de Braose , a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland . De Braose was subjected to punitive demands for money , and when he refused to pay a huge sum of 40 @,@ 000 marks ( equivalent to £ 26 @,@ 666 at the time ) , his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned by John , which resulted in their deaths . De Braose died in exile in 1211 , and his grandsons remained in prison until 1218 . John 's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 John 's personal life greatly affected his reign . Contemporary chroniclers state that John was <unk> lustful and lacking in piety . It was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses , but chroniclers complained that John 's mistresses were married noblewomen , which was considered unacceptable . John had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester , and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen . John 's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella of Angoulême is less clear , however . None of John 's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried , and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point , although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period . The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt ; nonetheless , most of John 's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour . 
 The character of John 's relationship with his second wife , Isabella of Angoulême , is unclear . John married Isabella whilst she was relatively young – her exact date of birth is uncertain , and estimates place her between at most 15 and more probably towards nine years old at the time of her marriage . Even by the standards of the time , Isabella was married whilst very young . John did not provide a great deal of money for his wife 's household and did not pass on much of the revenue from her lands , to the extent that historian Nicholas Vincent has described him as being " downright mean " towards Isabella . Vincent concluded that the marriage was not a particularly " amicable " one . Other aspects of their marriage suggest a closer , more positive relationship . Chroniclers recorded that John had a " mad infatuation " with Isabella , and certainly John had conjugal relationships with Isabella between at least 1207 and 1215 ; they had five children . In contrast to Vincent , historian William Chester Jordan concludes that the pair were a " companionable couple " who had a successful marriage by the standards of the day . 
 John 's lack of religious conviction has been noted by contemporary chroniclers and later historians , with some suspecting that John was at best impious , or even atheistic , a very serious issue at the time . Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti @-@ religious habits at length , including his failure to take communion , his blasphemous remarks , and his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine , including jokes about the implausibility of the Resurrection . They commented on the paucity of John 's charitable donations to the church . Historian Frank McLynn argues that John 's early years at Fontevrault , combined with his relatively advanced education , may have turned him against the church . Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material , noting that chroniclers also reported John 's personal interest in the life of St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendships with several senior clerics , most especially with Hugh of Lincoln , who was later declared a saint . Financial records show a normal royal household engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances – albeit with many records showing John 's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance . The historian Lewis Warren has argued that the chronicler accounts were subject to considerable bias and the King was " at least conventionally devout , " citing his pilgrimages and interest in religious scripture and commentaries . 
 = = Later reign ( 1204 – 14 ) = = 
 = = = Continental policy = = = 
 During the remainder of his reign , John focused on trying to retake Normandy . The available evidence suggests that John did not regard the loss of the Duchy as a permanent shift in Capetian power . Strategically , John faced several challenges : England itself had to be secured against possible French invasion , the sea @-@ routes to Bordeaux needed to be secured following the loss of the land route to Aquitaine , and his remaining possessions in Aquitaine needed to be secured following the death of his mother , Eleanor , in April 1204 . John 's preferred plan was to use Poitou as a base of operations , advance up the Loire valley to threaten Paris , pin down the French forces and break Philip 's internal lines of communication before landing a maritime force in the Duchy itself . Ideally , this plan would benefit from the opening of a second front on Philip 's eastern frontiers with Flanders and Boulogne – effectively a re @-@ creation of Richard 's old strategy of applying pressure from Germany . All of this would require a great deal of money and soldiers . 
 John spent much of 1205 securing England against a potential French invasion . As an emergency measure , John recreated a version of Henry II 's Assize of Arms of 1181 , with each shire creating a structure to mobilise local levies . When the threat of invasion faded , John formed a large military force in England intended for Poitou , and a large fleet with soldiers under his own command intended for Normandy . To achieve this , John reformed the English feudal contribution to his campaigns , creating a more flexible system under which only one knight in ten would actually be mobilised , but would be financially supported by the other nine ; knights would serve for an indefinite period . John built up a strong team of engineers for siege warfare and a substantial force of professional crossbowmen . The king was supported by a team of leading barons with military expertise , including William Longespée , William the Marshal , Roger de Lacy and , until he fell from favour , the marcher lord William de Braose . 
 John had already begun to improve his Channel forces before the loss of Normandy and he rapidly built up further maritime capabilities after its collapse . Most of these ships were placed along the Cinque Ports , but Portsmouth was also enlarged . By the end of 1204 he had around 50 large galleys available ; another 54 vessels were built between 1209 and 1212 . William of Wrotham was appointed " keeper of the galleys " , effectively John 's chief admiral . Wrotham was responsible for fusing John 's galleys , the ships of the Cinque Ports and pressed merchant vessels into a single operational fleet . John adopted recent improvements in ship design , including new large transport ships called <unk> and removable forecastles for use in combat . 
 Baronial unrest in England prevented the departure of the planned 1205 expedition , and only a smaller force under William Longespée deployed to Poitou . In 1206 John departed for Poitou himself , but was forced to divert south to counter a threat to Gascony from Alfonso VIII of Castile . After a successful campaign against Alfonso , John headed north again , taking the city of Angers . Philip moved south to meet John ; the year 's campaigning ended in stalemate and a two @-@ year truce was made between the two rulers . 
 During the truce of 1206 – 1208 , John focused on building up his financial and military resources in preparation for another attempt to recapture Normandy . John used some of this money to pay for new alliances on Philip 's eastern frontiers , where the growth in Capetian power was beginning to concern France 's neighbours . By 1212 John had successfully concluded alliances with his nephew Otto IV , a contender for the crown of Holy Roman Emperor in Germany , as well as with the counts Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders . The invasion plans for 1212 were postponed because of fresh English baronial unrest about service in Poitou . Philip seized the initiative in 1213 , sending his elder son , Louis , to invade Flanders with the intention of next launching an invasion of England . John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to counter this threat . He launched his new fleet to attack the French at the harbour of Damme . The attack was a success , destroying Philip 's vessels and any chances of an invasion of England that year . John hoped to exploit this advantage by invading himself late in 1213 , but baronial discontent again delayed his invasion plans until early 1214 , in what would prove to be his final Continental campaign . 
 = = = Scotland , Ireland and Wales = = = 
 In the late 12th and early 13th centuries the border and political relationship between England and Scotland was disputed , with the kings of Scotland claiming parts of what is now northern England . John 's father , Henry II , had forced William the Lion to swear fealty to him at the Treaty of Falaise in 1174 . This had been rescinded by Richard I in exchange for financial compensation in 1189 , but the relationship remained uneasy . John began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties . He refused William 's request for the earldom of Northumbria , but did not intervene in Scotland itself and focused on his continental problems . The two kings maintained a friendly relationship , meeting in 1206 and 1207 , until it was rumoured in 1209 that William was intending to ally himself with Philip II of France . John invaded Scotland and forced William to sign the Treaty of Norham , which gave John control of William 's daughters and required a payment of £ 10 @,@ 000 . This effectively crippled William 's power north of the border , and by 1212 John had to intervene militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal rivals . John made no efforts to reinvigorate the Treaty of Falaise , though , and both William and Alexander in turn remained independent kings , supported by , but not owing fealty to , John . 
 John remained Lord of Ireland throughout his reign . He drew on the country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent . Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo @-@ Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains , with John manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country . During Richard 's rule , John had successfully increased the size of his lands in Ireland , and he continued this policy as king . In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo @-@ Norman lords ; he reasserted his control of the country and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland . John stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms , but historian David Carpenter suspects that he might have done so , had the baronial conflict in England not intervened . <unk> tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after John left for England . 
 Royal power in Wales was unevenly applied , with the country divided between the marcher lords along the borders , royal territories in Pembrokeshire and the more independent native Welsh lords of North Wales . John took a close interest in Wales and knew the country well , visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter , Joan , to the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great . The king used the marcher lords and the native Welsh to increase his own territory and power , striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the Welsh rulers . A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in 1211 , after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose , through the Welsh uprising of 1211 . John 's invasion , striking into the Welsh heartlands , was a military success . Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John 's power across much of Wales , albeit only temporarily . 
 = = = Dispute with the Pope = = = 
 When the Archbishop of Canterbury , Hubert Walter , died on 13 July 1205 , John became involved in a dispute with Pope Innocent III that would lead to the king 's excommunication . The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories . From the 1040s onwards , however , successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the church being " governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre " and established " its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction , separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler " , in the words of historian Richard Huscroft . After the 1140s , these principles had been largely accepted within the English church , albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome . These changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question . Pope Innocent was , according to historian Ralph Turner , an " ambitious and aggressive " religious leader , insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church . 
 John wanted John de Gray , the Bishop of Norwich and one of his own supporters , to be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury after the death of Walter , but the cathedral chapter for Canterbury Cathedral claimed the exclusive right to elect Walter 's successor . They favoured Reginald , the chapter 's sub @-@ prior . To complicate matters , the bishops of the province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop . The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed ; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent . John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support to John de Gray , and a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the papacy of the new decision . Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de Gray , and instead appointed his own candidate , Stephen Langton . John refused Innocent 's request that he consent to Langton 's appointment , but the pope consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207 . 
 John was incensed about what he perceived as an abrogation of his customary right as monarch to influence the election . He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual , as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris , and about the process as a whole . He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions . Innocent set a commission in place to try to convince John to change his mind , but to no avail . Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208 , prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services , with the exception of baptisms for the young , and confessions and <unk> for the dying . 
 John treated the interdict as " the equivalent of a papal declaration of war " . He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome . John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services , as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself ; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period , only releasing them after the payment of fines ; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England , and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him . In many cases , individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates . By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution , and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton 's appointment . When this threat failed , Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209 . Although theoretically a significant blow to John 's legitimacy , this did not appear to greatly worry the king . Two of John 's close allies , Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse , had already suffered the same punishment themselves , and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued . John simply tightened his existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys : one 1213 estimate , for example , suggested the church had lost an estimated 100 @,@ 000 marks ( equivalent to £ 66 @,@ 666 at the time ) to John . Official figures suggest that around 14 % of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year . 
 Innocent gave some dispensations as the crisis progressed . Monastic communities were allowed to celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards , and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised . The rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have been steadily circumvented , at least unofficially . Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population , it did not result in rebellion against John . By 1213 , though , John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion . Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy , although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England . 
 Under mounting political pressure , John finally negotiated terms for a reconciliation , and the papal terms for submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover . As part of the deal , John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1 @,@ 000 marks ( equivalent to £ 666 at the time ) annually : 700 marks ( £ 466 ) for England and 300 marks ( £ 200 ) for Ireland , as well as <unk> the church for revenue lost during the crisis . The agreement was formalised in the Bulla Aurea , or Golden Bull . This resolution produced mixed responses . Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events , there was little public reaction . Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long @-@ standing English problem , but John probably gained more , as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign , backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues . Innocent immediately turned against Philip , calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace . John paid some of the compensation money he had promised the church , but he ceased making payments in late 1214 , leaving two @-@ thirds of the sum unpaid ; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship .

 = = = Tensions and discontent = = = 
 Tensions between John and the barons had been growing for several years , as demonstrated by the 1212 plot against the king . Many of the disaffected barons came from the north of England ; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as " the Northerners " . The northern barons rarely had any personal stake in the conflict in France , and many of them owed large sums of money to John ; the revolt has been characterised as " a rebellion of the king 's debtors " . Many of John 's military household joined the rebels , particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England ; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to John . Tension also grew across North Wales , where opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning into open conflict . For some the appointment of Peter des Roches as justiciar was an important factor , as he was considered an " abrasive foreigner " by many of the barons . The failure of John 's French military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John 's final years as king ; James Holt describes the path to civil war as " direct , short and unavoidable " following the defeat at Bouvines . 
 = = = Failure of the 1214 French campaign = = = 
 In 1214 John began his final campaign to reclaim Normandy from Philip . John was optimistic , as he had successfully built up alliances with the Emperor Otto , Renaud of Boulogne and Count Ferdinand of Flanders ; he was enjoying papal favour ; and he had successfully built up substantial funds to pay for the deployment of his experienced army . Nonetheless , when John left for Poitou in February 1214 , many barons refused to provide military service ; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps . John 's plan was to split Philip 's forces by pushing north @-@ east from Poitou towards Paris , whilst Otto , Renaud and Ferdinand , supported by William Longespée , marched south @-@ west from Flanders . 
 The first part of the campaign went well , with John outmanoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince Louis and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June . John besieged the castle of Roche @-@ au @-@ Moine , a key stronghold , forcing Louis to give battle against John 's larger army . The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with the king ; left at something of a disadvantage , John retreated back to La Rochelle . Shortly afterwards , Philip won the hard @-@ fought battle of Bouvines in the north against Otto and John 's other allies , bringing an end to John 's hopes of retaking Normandy . A peace agreement was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid the French king compensation ; the truce was intended to last for six years . John arrived back in England in October . 
 = = = Pre @-@ war tensions and Magna Carta = = = 
 Within a few months of John 's return , rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule . John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms and sponsored discussions in Oxford between his agents and the rebels during the spring . John appears to have been playing for time until Pope Innocent III could send letters giving him explicit papal support . This was particularly important for John , as a way of pressuring the barons but also as a way of controlling Stephen Langton , the Archbishop of Canterbury . In the meantime , John began to recruit fresh mercenary forces from Poitou , although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the king was escalating the conflict . John announced his intent to become a crusader , a move which gave him additional political protection under church law . 
 Letters of support from the pope arrived in April but by then the rebel barons had organised . They congregated at Northampton in May and renounced their feudal ties to John , appointing Robert fitz Walter as their military leader . This self @-@ proclaimed " Army of God " marched on London , taking the capital as well as Lincoln and Exeter . John 's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful , but once the rebels held London they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from John 's royalist faction . John instructed Langton to organise peace talks with the rebel barons . 
 John met the rebel leaders at Runnymede , near Windsor Castle , on 15 June 1215 . Langton 's efforts at mediation created a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement ; it was later renamed Magna Carta , or " Great Charter " . The charter went beyond simply addressing specific baronial complaints , and formed a wider proposal for political reform , albeit one focusing on the rights of free men , not serfs and unfree labour . It promised the protection of church rights , protection from illegal imprisonment , access to swift justice , new taxation only with baronial consent and limitations on scutage and other feudal payments . A council of twenty @-@ five barons would be created to monitor and ensure John 's future adherence to the charter , whilst the rebel army would stand down and London would be surrendered to the king . 
 Neither John nor the rebel barons seriously attempted to implement the peace accord . The rebel barons suspected that the proposed baronial council would be unacceptable to John and that he would challenge the legality of the charter ; they packed the baronial council with their own hardliners and refused to demobilise their forces or surrender London as agreed . Despite his promises to the contrary , John appealed to Innocent for help , observing that the charter compromised the pope 's rights under the 1213 agreement that had appointed him John 's feudal lord . Innocent obliged ; he declared the charter " not only shameful and demeaning , but illegal and unjust " and excommunicated the rebel barons . The failure of the agreement led rapidly to the First Barons ' War . 
 = = = War with the barons = = = 
 The rebels made the first move in the war , seizing the strategic Rochester Castle , owned by Langton but left almost unguarded by the archbishop . John was well prepared for a conflict . He had stockpiled money to pay for mercenaries and ensured the support of the powerful marcher lords with their own feudal forces , such as William Marshal and Ranulf of Chester . The rebels lacked the engineering expertise or heavy equipment necessary to assault the network of royal castles that cut off the northern rebel barons from those in the south . John 's strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London , protect his own supply lines to his key source of mercenaries in Flanders , prevent the French from landing in the south @-@ east , and then win the war through slow attrition . John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales , where Llywelyn the Great was leading a rebellion against the 1211 settlement . 
 John 's campaign started well . In November John retook Rochester Castle from rebel baron William d 'Aubigny in a sophisticated assault . One chronicler had not seen " a siege so hard pressed or so strongly resisted " , whilst historian Reginald Brown describes it as " one of the greatest [ siege ] operations in England up to that time " . Having regained the south @-@ east John split his forces , sending William Longespée to retake the north side of London and East Anglia , whilst John himself headed north via Nottingham to attack the estates of the northern barons . Both operations were successful and the majority of the remaining rebels were pinned down in London . In January 1216 John marched against Alexander II of Scotland , who had allied himself with the rebel cause . John took back Alexander 's possessions in northern England in a rapid campaign and pushed up towards Edinburgh over a ten @-@ day period . 
 The rebel barons responded by inviting the French prince Louis to lead them : Louis had a claim to the English throne by virtue of his marriage to Blanche of Castile , a granddaughter of Henry II . Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis , who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John . Louis ' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John , as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause . Once John contained Alexander in Scotland , he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion . 
 Prince Louis intended to land in the south of England in May 1216 , and John assembled a naval force to intercept him . Unfortunately for John , his fleet was dispersed by bad storms and Louis landed unopposed in Kent . John hesitated and decided not to attack Louis immediately , either due to the risks of open battle or over concerns about the loyalty of his own men . Louis and the rebel barons advanced west and John retreated , spending the summer reorganising his defences across the rest of the kingdom . John saw several of his military household desert to the rebels , including his half @-@ brother , William Longespée . By the end of the summer the rebels had regained the south @-@ east of England and parts of the north . 
 = = Death = = 
 In September 1216 John began a fresh , vigorous attack . He marched from the Cotswolds , feigned an offensive to relieve the besieged Windsor Castle , and attacked eastwards around London to Cambridge to separate the rebel @-@ held areas of Lincolnshire and East Anglia . From there he travelled north to relieve the rebel siege at Lincoln and back east to King 's Lynn , probably to order further supplies from the continent . In King 's Lynn , John contracted dysentery , which would ultimately prove fatal . Meanwhile , Alexander II invaded northern England again , taking Carlisle in August and then marching south to give homage to Prince Louis for his English possessions ; John narrowly missed intercepting Alexander along the way . Tensions between Louis and the English barons began to increase , prompting a wave of desertions , including William Marshal 's son William and William Longespée , who both returned to John 's faction . 
 The king returned west but is said to have lost a significant part of his baggage train along the way . Roger of Wendover provides the most graphic account of this , suggesting that the king 's belongings , including the Crown Jewels , were lost as he crossed one of the tidal estuaries which empties into the Wash , being sucked in by quicksand and whirlpools . Accounts of the incident vary considerably between the various chroniclers and the exact location of the incident has never been confirmed ; the losses may have involved only a few of his pack @-@ horses . Modern historians assert that by October 1216 John faced a " stalemate " , " a military situation uncompromised by defeat " . 
 John 's illness grew worse and by the time he reached Newark Castle he was unable to travel any farther ; John died on the night of 18 October . Numerous – probably fictitious – accounts circulated soon after his death that he had been killed by poisoned ale , poisoned plums or a " surfeit of peaches " . His body was escorted south by a company of mercenaries and he was buried in Worcester Cathedral in front of the altar of St Wulfstan . A new sarcophagus with an effigy was made for him in 1232 , in which his remains now rest . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In the aftermath of John 's death William Marshal was declared the protector of the nine @-@ year @-@ old Henry III . The civil war continued until royalist victories at the battles of Lincoln and Dover in 1217 . Louis gave up his claim to the English throne and signed the Treaty of Lambeth . The failed Magna Carta agreement was resuscitated by Marshal 's administration and reissued in an edited form in 1217 as a basis for future government . Henry III continued his attempts to reclaim Normandy and Anjou until 1259 , but John 's continental losses and the consequent growth of Capetian power in the 13th century proved to mark a " turning point in European history " . 
 John 's first wife , Isabel , Countess of Gloucester , was released from imprisonment in 1214 ; she remarried twice , and died in 1217 . John 's second wife , Isabella of Angoulême , left England for Angoulême soon after the king 's death ; she became a powerful regional leader , but largely abandoned the children she had had by John . John had five legitimate children , all by Isabella . His eldest son , Henry III , ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century . Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire . Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his queen consort . Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II . His youngest daughter , Eleanor , married William Marshal 's son , also called William , and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort . John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses , including nine sons – Richard , Oliver , John , Geoffrey , Henry , Osbert Gifford , Eudes , Bartholomew and probably Philip – and three daughters – Joan , Maud and probably Isabel . Of these , Joan became the most famous , marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales . 
 = = = Historiography = = = 
 Historical interpretations of John have been subject to considerable change over the years . Medieval chroniclers provided the first contemporary , or near contemporary , histories of John 's reign . One group of chroniclers wrote early in John 's life , or around the time of his accession , including Richard of Devizes , William of Newburgh , Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto . These historians were generally unsympathetic to John 's behaviour under Richard 's rule , but slightly more positive towards the very earliest years of John 's reign . Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John 's reign are more limited , with Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall writing the main accounts ; neither of them were positive about John 's performance as king . Much of John 's later , negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king 's death , Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris , the latter claiming that John attempted conversion to Islam in exchange for military aid from the Almohad ruler Muhammad al @-@ Nasir - a story which is considered to be untrue by modern historians . 
 In the 16th century political and religious changes altered the attitude of historians towards John . Tudor historians were generally favourably inclined towards the king , focusing on John 's opposition to the Papacy and his promotion of the special rights and prerogatives of a king . Revisionist histories written by John Foxe , William Tyndale and Robert Barnes portrayed John as an early Protestant hero , and John Foxe included the king in his Book of Martyrs . John Speed 's Historie of Great Britaine in 1632 praised John 's " great renown " as a king ; he blamed the bias of medieval chroniclers for the king 's poor reputation . 
 By the Victorian period in the 19th century historians were more inclined to draw on the judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John 's moral personality . Kate Norgate , for example , argued that John 's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy , but due to his " almost superhuman wickedness " , whilst James Ramsay blamed John 's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall . Historians in the " Whiggish " tradition , focusing on documents such as the Domesday Book and Magna Carta , trace a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period . These historians were often inclined to see John 's reign , and his signing of Magna Carta in particular , as a positive step in the constitutional development of England , despite the flaws of the king himself . Winston Churchill , for example , argued that " [ w ] hen the long tally is added , it will be seen that the British nation and the English @-@ speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns " . 
 In the 1940s , new interpretations of John 's reign began to emerge , based on research into the record evidence of his reign , such as pipe rolls , charters , court documents and similar primary records . Notably , an essay by Vivian Galbraith in 1945 proposed a " new approach " to understanding the ruler . The use of recorded evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John 's reign , Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris . In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers , both writing after John 's death , was challenged by modern historians . Interpretations of Magna Carta and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised : although the charter 's symbolic , constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable , in the context of John 's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between " partisan " factions . There has been increasing debate about the nature of John 's Irish policies . Specialists in Irish medieval history , such as Sean Duffy , have challenged the conventional narrative established by Lewis Warren , suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed . 
 Most historians today , including John 's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren , argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch , but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th @-@ century chroniclers . Jim Bradbury notes the current consensus that John was a " hard @-@ working administrator , an able man , an able general " , albeit , as Turner suggests , with " distasteful , even dangerous personality traits " , including pettiness , spitefulness and cruelty . John Gillingham , author of a major biography of Richard I , follows this line too , although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren , and describes him " one of the worst kings ever to rule England " . Bradbury takes a moderate line , but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John 's numerous faults . Popular historian Frank McLynn maintains a counter @-@ revisionist perspective on John , arguing that the king 's modern reputation amongst historians is " bizarre " , and that as a monarch John " fails almost all those [ tests ] that can be legitimately set " . 
 = = = Popular representations = = = 
 Popular representations of John first began to emerge during the Tudor period , mirroring the revisionist histories of the time . The anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John portrayed the king as a " proto @-@ Protestant martyr " , similar to that shown in John Bale 's morality play Kynge Johan , in which John attempts to save England from the " evil agents of the Roman Church " . By contrast , Shakespeare 's King John , a relatively anti @-@ Catholic play that draws on The Troublesome Reign for its source material , offers a more " balanced , dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto @-@ Protestant victim of Rome 's machinations and as a weak , selfishly motivated ruler " . Anthony Munday 's play The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington portrays many of John 's negative traits , but adopts a positive interpretation of the king 's stand against the Roman Catholic Church , in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs . By the middle of the 17th century , plays such as Robert Davenport 's King John and Matilda , although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works , were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John 's behaviour . 
 Nineteenth @-@ century fictional depictions of John were heavily influenced by Sir Walter Scott 's historical romance , Ivanhoe , which presented " an almost totally unfavourable picture " of the king ; the work drew on Victorian histories of the period and on Shakespeare 's play . Scott 's work influenced the late 19th @-@ century children 's writer Howard Pyle 's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood , which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional Robin Hood narrative . During the 20th century , John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood . Sam De Grasse 's role as John in the black @-@ and @-@ white 1922 film version shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture . Claude Rains played John in the 1938 colour version alongside Errol Flynn , starting a trend for films to depict John as an " effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay @-@ at @-@ home " . The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard , or contrasts with the Sheriff of Nottingham , who is usually the " swashbuckling villain " opposing Robin . An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the Disney cartoon version , for example , which depicts John , voiced by Peter Ustinov , as a " cowardly , <unk> lion " . Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends , such as James Goldman 's play and later film , The Lion in Winter , set in 1183 , commonly present him as an " effete weakling " , in this instance contrasted with the more masculine Henry II , or as a tyrant , as in A. A. Milne 's poem for children , " King John 's Christmas " .

 = Sale , Greater Manchester = 
 Sale is a town in Trafford , Greater Manchester , England . Historically in Cheshire , it is on the south bank of the River Mersey , 1 @.@ 9 miles ( 3 @.@ 1 km ) south of Stretford , 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) northeast of Altrincham , and 5 @.@ 2 miles ( 8 @.@ 4 km ) southwest of Manchester . In 2011 , it had a population of 134 @,@ 122 . 
 Evidence of Stone Age , Roman , and Anglo @-@ Saxon activity has been discovered locally . In the Middle Ages , Sale was a rural township , linked ecclesiastically with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey , whose fields and meadows were used for crop and cattle farming . By the 17th century , Sale had a cottage industry manufacturing <unk> , the woven material from which horses ' saddle girths were made . 
 The Bridgewater Canal reached the town in 1765 , stimulating Sale 's urbanisation . The arrival of the railway in 1849 triggered Sale 's growth as a commuter town for Manchester , leading to an influx of middle class residents ; by the end of the 19th century the town 's population had more than tripled . Agriculture gradually declined as service industries boomed . 
 Sale 's urban growth resulted in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey , following the Local Government Act 1929 . The increase in population led to the granting of a charter in 1935 , giving Sale honorific borough status . Since then , Sale has continued to thrive as a commuter town , supported by its proximity to the M60 motorway and the Manchester Metrolink network . Sale Water Park contains an artificial lake used for water sports . Sale FC and Sale Sharks rugby union clubs and Sale Harriers athletics club were founded in Sale , although only the first now remains in the town at their Heywood Road ground . 
 = = History = = 
 A flint arrowhead discovered in Sale suggests a prehistoric human presence at the location , but there is no further evidence of activity in the area until the Roman period . A 4th @-@ century hoard of 46 Roman coins was discovered in Ashton upon Mersey , one of four known hoards dating from that period discovered within the Mersey basin . Sale lies along the line of the Roman road which runs between the fortresses at Chester ( Deva Victrix ) and York ( Eboracum ) , via the fort at Manchester ( Mamucium ) ; the present @-@ day A56 follows the route of the road through the town . After the Roman departure from Britain in the early @-@ 5th century , Britain was invaded by the Anglo @-@ Saxons . 
 Some local field and road names , and the name of Sale itself , are Anglo @-@ Saxon in origin , which indicates the town was founded in the 7th or 8th centuries . The Old English <unk> , from which " Sale " is derived , means " at the sallow tree " , and Ashton upon Mersey means " village or farm near the ash trees " . Although the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey were not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 , that may be because only a partial survey was taken . The first recorded occurrences of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey are in 1199 – 1216 and 1260 respectively . The settlements were referred to as townships rather than manors , which suggests further evidence of Anglo @-@ Saxon origins as townships were developed by the Saxons . 
 The manor of Sale was one of 30 held by William FitzNigel , a powerful 12th century baron in north Cheshire . He divided it between Thomas de Sale and Adam de Carrington , who acted as Lords of the Manor on FitzNigel 's behalf . On de Sale 's death , his land passed to his son @-@ in @-@ law , John Holt ; de Carrington 's land passed into the ownership of Richard de Massey , a member of the Masseys who were Barons of Dunham . Sale descended through the Holt and Massey families until the 17th century , when their respective lands were sold . Sale Old Hall was built in about 1603 for James Massey , probably to replace a medieval manor house , and was one of the first buildings in northwest England to be made of brick . It was rebuilt in 1840 and demolished in 1920 , but two buildings in its grounds have survived : its dovecote , now in Walkden Gardens , and its lodge , the latter now occupied by Sale Golf Club . 
 In 1745 , Crossford Bridge – which dated back to at least 1367 – was torn down . It was one of a series of bridges crossing the River Mersey destroyed by order of the government , to slow the advance of Jacobite forces during the Jacobite rising . The Jacobites repaired the bridge upon reaching Manchester , and used it to send a small force into Sale and Altrincham . Their intention was to deceive the authorities into believing that the Jacobites were heading for Chester . The feint was successful and the main Jacobite army later marched south through Cheadle and Stockport instead . 
 The extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn was completed as far as Sale by 1765 , and transformed the town 's economy by providing a quick and cheap route into Manchester for fresh produce . Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back night soil to fertilise the fields . Not everyone benefited from the canal however ; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct . A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street , on the site of the road now of the same name , divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey . The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time . The map also shows that Sale was spread out , mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road , Fairy Lane , and Old Hall Road . Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded . 
 About 300 acres ( 120 ha ) of " wasteland " known as Sale Moor was enclosed in 1807 , to be divided between the landowners in Sale . This was part of a nationwide initiative to begin cultivation of common land to lessen the food shortage caused by the Napoleonic Wars . Records of poor relief in the town start in 1808 , a time when the region was in the grip of an economic depression . <unk> , where paupers could stay rent @-@ free , were built in the early @-@ 19th century , reflecting the poor state of the local economy . In 1829 , Samuel Brooks acquired 515 acres ( 208 ha ) of land in Sale – about a quarter of the township – from George Grey , 6th Earl of Stamford . The area later became known as Brooklands after the land owner . 
 The Manchester , South Junction and Altrincham Railway opened in 1849 , and led to the middle classes using Sale as a commuter town , a residence away from their place of work . This resulted in Sale 's population more than tripling by the end of the 19th century . The land in Sale Moor was the cheapest in the town because the soil was poor and difficult to cultivate , which was part of the reason the area was common land until the early 19th century . However , when the railway opened , Sale Moor was close to the station and became the most expensive area in Sale . Villas were built in Sale Moor , and a few in Ashton upon Mersey as the demand for land increased . They were often decorated with stained glass or different coloured bricks in an attempt to make them " mansions in miniature " for the aspiring middle class . 
 Pressure from an increasing population led to the town being supplied with amenities such as sewers , which were built in 1875 – 1880 ; and Sale was connected to the telephone network in 1888 . As in the late @-@ 19th century , the early @-@ 20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale . The town 's first swimming baths were built in 1914 , and its first cinema , the Palace , was opened during the First World War . The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush of marriages , which highlighted a shortage of housing . The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing , and rented it to the local population at below market rates . By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 , Sale had 594 council houses . The building programme was interrupted by the start of the <unk> additional private housing development brought the total of inter @-@ war houses built in Sale to around 900 , including large housing estates like <unk> Hall estate in Ashton . 
 Sale was never officially evacuated during the war , and even received families from evacuated areas , although it was not considered far enough from likely targets to be an official destination for evacuees . The town 's proximity to Manchester , an industrial centre directed towards the war effort , did result in a number of bombing raids . <unk> dropped on Sale in September 1940 caused no casualties , but did damage a house . In a bombing incident the following November , four people were injured and a school was damaged ; on 22 December 1940 , twelve people were injured by bombs . On the night of 23 December , much of Manchester suffered heavy bombing in what became known as the Manchester Blitz . Six hundred incendiary bombs were dropped on Sale in three hours . There were no injuries , but Sale Town Hall was severely damaged . On 3 August 1943 , at 11 : 50 pm , a Wellington Bomber on a training exercise crashed in Walton Park in the south @-@ west of the town . Of the six @-@ man crew , consisting of five members of the Royal Australian Air Force and one member of the Royal Air Force , the pilot and the bomb @-@ aimer were killed . 
 Sale 's shopping centre was redeveloped during the 1960s , as part of the town 's post @-@ war regeneration . In 1973 , the shopping precinct in the town centre , which had grown up in the mid @-@ 19th century , was also redeveloped and pedestrianised in an attempt to increase trade . The construction of the <unk> motorway ( subsequently renamed the M60 ) in 1972 led to the creation of Sale Water Park . To minimise the risk of flooding , the new road was built on an embankment , for which the necessary gravel was extracted from what is today an artificial lake and water @-@ sports centre . Opportunities for leisure were increased when the old swimming baths , demolished in 1971 , were replaced in 1973 by a new complex built on the same site . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Historically , Sale was a township in the ancient parish of Ashton upon Mersey in the hundred of Bucklow and county of Cheshire . Throughout the Middle Ages it was governed by the Lord of the Manor . Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 , Sale was joined with the Altrincham Poor Law Union , an inter @-@ parish unit established to provide social security . The unit changed its name to Bucklow Poor Law Union in 1895 . Sale adopted the Local Government Act 1858 in November 1866 , and Sale Local Board was formed to govern the township at the beginning of 1867 . Members were elected to the local board by the town 's ratepayers . A household had one vote for every £ 10 ( £ 800 as of 2016 ) of rateable value . Under the Local Government Act 1888 Sale became an urban district of the administrative county of Cheshire . The local board was replaced by Sale Urban District Council in 1894 . The parish of Ashton upon Mersey became an urban district in 1895 . In 1930 , the Ashton upon Mersey UD was merged into Sale UD under a county review order . 
 In December 1933 , Sale Urban District submitted a petition to the Privy Council in an attempt to gain a charter of incorporation . At the time , Sale UD had the largest population and highest rateable value of any urban district in the country . The petition was successful and on 21 September 1935 Sale UD was granted borough status , and became the Municipal Borough of Sale . Following the Local Government Act 1972 , on 1 April 1974 the Municipal Borough of Sale was abolished . Sale became an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford , a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester . The town 's education , town planning , waste collection , health , social care and other services are administered by Trafford Council . 
 For national elections , Sale was in the parliamentary constituency of Altrincham and Sale from 1945 until 1997 , when it was split between Altrincham and Sale West and Wythenshawe and Sale East . The Altrincham and Sale West constituency is one of the Conservative Party 's two seats in Greater Manchester . The Sale area consists of five electoral wards , which between them have 15 of the 63 seats on the council . The wards are Ashton upon Mersey , Brooklands , Priory , Sale Moor , and St. Mary 's . As of the 2012 local elections , the Conservative Party held nine of the seats and the Labour Party held six . 
 = = Geography = = 
 At 53 ° 25 ′ 29 ″ N 2 ° 19 ′ 19 ″ W ( 53 @.@ <unk> , − 2 @.@ 322 ) , Sale lies respectively to the north and south of the neighbouring towns of Altrincham and Stretford , and 5 miles ( 8 km ) south @-@ west of Manchester city centre . The district of Wythenshawe is to the southeast . Sale is in the Mersey Valley , about 100 feet ( 30 m ) above sea level on generally flat ground . The River Mersey , which runs just north of the town , is prone to flooding during heavy rains , so the Sale Water Park , close to the town 's northern boundary , acts as an emergency flood basin . The man @-@ made , and thus more controllable , Bridgewater Canal runs through the centre of the town . 
 Sale 's local drift geology consists of sand and gravel deposited about 10 @,@ 000 years ago , during the last ice age . The bedrock is Bunter sandstone in the west and Triassic <unk> in the east . United Utilities obtains the town 's drinking water from the Lake District . Sale 's climate is generally temperate , like the rest of Greater Manchester . The mean highest and lowest temperatures ( 13 @.@ 2 ° C ( 55 @.@ 8 ° F ) and 6 @.@ 4 ° C ( 43 @.@ 5 ° F ) ) are slightly above the national average , while the annual rainfall ( 806 @.@ 6 millimetres ( 31 @.@ 76 in ) ) and average hours of sunshine ( 1394 @.@ 5 hours ) are respectively above and below the national averages . 
 The town 's main districts are Ashton upon Mersey in the northwest , Sale Moor in the southeast , and Brooklands in the southwest . The main commercial area is Sale town centre , in the central northern area of the town , but smaller commercial centres are also found in Ashton upon Mersey and Sale Moor . Brooklands is the most densely populated area . Most of the parks , including Worthington and Walton , are in the central and southern areas , leaving Ashton upon Mersey and Sale Moor with a shortage of accessible green space . 
 Sale 's built environment is varied , with a mixture of modern and old buildings . Some terraces , semi @-@ detached houses and villas , survive from the Victorian period , although many of the larger houses have been converted into flats . Many semi @-@ detached houses survive from the 1930s , when there was a need for new housing in the town as a result of a growing population and an increasingly wealthy middle class . Interspersed with these older structures are newer housing developments , such as the estates built in Ashton upon Mersey and the east of Sale during the 1970s .

Sale had a much higher percentage of adults with a diploma or degree than Greater Manchester as a whole . Of Sale residents aged 16 – 74 , 26 @.@ 7 % had an educational qualification such as first degree , higher degree , qualified teacher status , qualified medical doctor , qualified dentist , qualified nurse , midwife , or health visitor , compared to 20 % nationwide . 
 Originally a working class town , there was an influx of middle class people in the mid @-@ 19th century when businessmen began using Sale as a commuter town . Since then , Sale has had a greater proportion of middle class residents than the national average . In 1931 , 22 @.@ 7 % of Sale 's population was middle class compared with 14 % in England and Wales , and by 1971 , this had increased to 36 @.@ 3 % compared with 24 % nationally . Parallel to this increase in the middle classes of Sale was the decline of the working class population . In 1931 , 20 @.@ 3 % were working class compared with 36 % in England and Wales ; by 1971 , this had decreased to 15 @.@ 4 % in Sale and 26 % nationwide . The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers . The change in social structure in the town was at a similar rate to that of the rest of the nation but was biased towards the middle classes , transforming Sale into the middle class town it is today . 
 = = = Population change = = = 
 According to the hearth tax returns of 1664 , the township of Sale had a population of about 365 . Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries , more so during the latter half of the 19th century ( due to the Industrial Revolution ) . This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham , Bowdon or Stretford . The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway , indicative of Sale 's growth as a commuter town . A huge increase in population in 1921 – 1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930 . Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981 , when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town 's population . This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester , with residents relocating to new jobs . The table below details population changes since 1801 , including the percentage change since the last census . 
 = = Economy = = 
 During the medieval period , most of the land was used for growing crops and raising livestock such as cattle . The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population , but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes . Agriculture provided the main source of employment for Sale 's residents until the mid @-@ 19th century . Industry was slow to develop in the area , as in most of what would become Trafford . This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area , the <unk> and the de Traffords , to invest . Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century , by 1851 only 4 % of the population was employed in that industry . 
 Along with the rest of the region , Sale 's economy during the early @-@ 19th century was weak , a state of affairs which persisted until the arrival of the railway in the middle of the century . Despite the dominance of agriculture , there was a growing service industry ; Sale and Ashton upon Mersey experienced a growth in numbers employed in retail and domestic services in the first half of the 19th century . By 1901 , less than 20 % of Sale residents were employed in agriculture . Employment was available in workhouses for those who could not find work elsewhere . Sale was part of the Altrincham Union , which ran the nearest work house in Altrincham . 
 The main shopping centre in Sale , the Square Shopping Centre , was constructed in the 1960s . Following the Trafford Centre 's opening in 1998 , it was expected that the centre would suffer , but it has since prospered . In 2003 the Square Shopping Centre underwent a £ 7 million refurbishment , a major part of the redevelopment of Sale 's town centre . It was sold for £ 40M in 2005 , by which time the Square had experienced an increase in trade and demand for tenancy that had led to an increase of 70 % in rental income . The town 's economy expanded to the extent that in 2007 , at a time when the rest of south Manchester was oversupplied with office space , Sale 's available office and commercial space was at an all @-@ time low because of high demand . 
 According to the 2001 UK census , the industry of employment of residents aged 16 – 74 was 18 @.@ 4 % property and business services , 15 @.@ 9 % retail and wholesale , 11 @.@ 1 % manufacturing , 10 @.@ 9 % health and social work , 9 @.@ 1 % education , 7 @.@ 8 % transport and communications , 6 @.@ 1 % construction , 6 @.@ 3 % finance , 4 @.@ 5 % public administration , 3 @.@ 8 % hotels and restaurants , 0 @.@ 7 % energy and water supply , 0 @.@ 5 % agriculture , 0 @.@ 2 % mining , and 4 @.@ 7 % other . Compared with national figures , the town had a relatively high percentage of residents working in property , business services and finance . The town had a relatively low percentage working in agriculture , public administration , and manufacturing . The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16 – 74 , 2 @.@ 6 % students were with jobs , 3 @.@ 3 % students without jobs , 4 @.@ 9 % looking after home or family , 5 @.@ 2 % permanently sick or disabled , and 2 @.@ 3 % economically inactive for other reasons .

 Sale has three Grade II * listed buildings – two churches ( St. Martin and St. John the Divine ) and Ashton New Hall – and eighteen Grade II listed buildings . The cenotaph outside the town hall was designed by Ashton upon Mersey sculptor Arthur Sherwood Edwards and is a Grade II listed building . It commemorates the 400 men from Sale who died in the First World War and the 300 who died in the Second World War . The memorial consists of a statue of a mourning Saint George on top of a granite pedestal . Costing £ 600 ( £ 31 thousand as of 2016 ) , it was funded by public subscription and unveiled in May 1925 in front of a crowd of 10 @,@ 000 . 
 The oldest surviving building in Sale is Eyebrow Cottage . Built around 1670 , it was originally a yeoman farmhouse and is one of the earliest brick buildings in the area . Its name is derived from the decorative brickwork above the windows . It was built in Cross Street , which at the time was a separate village from Sale . Of the twenty @-@ one conservation areas in Trafford , two are in Sale : Ashton upon Mersey and Brogden Grove . 
 A bronze bust of James Joule , the physicist who gave his name to the SI unit of energy , is in Worthington Park . Originally a tower was to have been erected in his honour , but lack of donations led to the production of the bust as a substitute ; it was unveiled in 1905 . Joule moved to Sale in the 1870s for his health ; he died at his home at 12 Wardle Road in 1889 , and is buried in Brooklands Cemetery . 
 The area has several parks and green spaces . Worthington Park , originally called Sale Park , was opened in 1900 . It features a bandstand , gardens , play areas , and a skate ramp and is maintained by Trafford Council and The Friends of Worthington Park . Opened in 1939 , Walton Park is in the southwest of the town and features a miniature railway . Sale Water Park is an artificial lake , created from a 35 @-@ metre ( 115 ft ) deep gravel pit left during the construction of the M60 . It opened in 1980 and is a venue for water sports , fishing and bird watching . The water park is the site of the Broad Ees Dole wildlife refuge , a local nature reserve that provides a home for migratory birds .

 Situated next to the town hall , the Waterside Arts Centre houses a plaza , a library , the Robert Bolt Theatre , the Lauriston Gallery , and the Corridor Gallery . The centre , which was opened in 2004 , regularly hosts concerts , exhibitions and other community events . Performers have included comedian Lucy Porter , Midge Ure , Fairport Convention , The Zombies and Sue Perkins . In 2004 , the centre received the British Urban Regeneration Association Award for its innovative use of space and for reinvigorating Sale town centre . 
 Sale has a Gilbert and Sullivan society , formed in 1972 , which performs at the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse . The group is directed by Alistair Donkin , a former principal comic for the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company . Members of the group have won several awards at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival . Sale Brass is a traditional brass band based in Sale , formed in about 1849 as the Stretford Temperance Band .

The professional Sale Sharks team was originally part of Sale F.C. but split from it in 2003 . Sale Sharks now play their matches at Salford City Stadium , although they retain the use of the Heywood Road ground for training and for the staging of home games involving their reserve team , Sale Jets . The town is also home to the Ashton upon Mersey and Trafford Metrovick rugby union clubs . 
 Sale Harriers Manchester Athletics Club was formed in 1911 , but is now based in nearby Wythenshawe .

The second school in Sale was built some time in the 18th century , one of about 30 non @-@ grammar schools founded in Cheshire around this time . By 1831 , there were two private schools – with the children 's parents paying fees for their education – in Sale and one in Ashton upon Mersey . At the same time , there were also four Sunday schools in Sale and one in Ashton upon Mersey , operated by various religious denominations , including Congregationalists , Methodists , and Unitarians . The first school @-@ chapel built in Sale as part of a school was constructed by Primitive Methodists in 1839 , and still survives .

 Sale is a diverse community with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations . The church buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th century in the wake of the population boom created by the arrival of the railway in 1849 , although records show that the Church of St Martin in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304 . Before the English Reformation , the inhabitants of Sale were predominantly Catholic , but afterwards were members of the Church of England . Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th century in the form of Irish immigrants . Two of the three Grade II * listed buildings in the town are churches . The Church of St Martin , which was probably originally an early 14th century timber framed structure , was rebuilt in 1714 after the church had been destroyed in a storm . The Church of St John the Divine was built in 1868 , to the design of Alfred Waterhouse . There are three Grade II listed churches in Sale : the Church of St Anne ; the Church of St Mary Magdalene ; and the Church of St Paul . 
 As of the 2001 UK census , 78 @.@ 0 % of Sale residents reported themselves as Christian , 1 @.@ 4 % Muslim , 0 @.@ 7 % Hindu , 0 @.@ 6 % Jewish , 0 @.@ 2 % Buddhist and 0 @.@ 2 % Sikh .

 = = Transport = = 
 The first turnpike road in the area was the latter @-@ day A56 Chester Road between Manchester and Crossford Bridge ( on the border between Sale and Stretford ) . Turnpike trusts collected tolls from road users and used the proceeds to maintain the highway . There was a toll booth on the Sale side of Crossford Bridge . Another section of road between Altrincham and Crossford Bridge was turnpiked in 1765 . The commencement of " swift packet " services on the newly opened Bridgewater Canal in 1776 made commuting from Sale into Manchester both practical and convenient , with boats travelling at a relatively swift 10 mph ( 16 km / h ) . However the arrival in 1849 of the Manchester , South Junction and Altrincham Railway sounded a death @-@ knell for both the canal packet services and turnpike trusts . Many trusts went into terminal decline , mirroring a national trend . By 1888 almost all roads and highways were the responsibility of the local authority . Sale 's railway station , originally named Sale Moor , was renamed to Sale in 1856 . Three years later Brooklands railway station was opened , followed in 1931 by the opening of Dane Road railway station along with the electrification of the entire line . The line was renovated in the early 1990s and is now part of the Metrolink . 
 Following the completion of a tramway between Manchester and Stretford in 1901 , the British Electric Traction Company applied to Parliament for an extension to Sale . The proposal was amended to continue the line further south , into Altrincham . The line through Sale was owned by Sale Urban District Council and leased to the Manchester Corporation . Services to Sale commenced in 1907 . A branch along Northenden Road from the line to Sale Moor was created in 1912 . Sale Moor 's line had only a single track which in 1925 resulted in a head @-@ on collision between two tramcars , injuring eight passengers . Bus services were first introduced to the area in the 1920s , but became more widespread in the 1930s . The buses did not suffer the drawback of being limited to tracks and were therefore more practical than the tram services , which from the 1930s went into decline . The tramlines along Northenden Road were removed between 1932 and 1934 , and throughout Sale in the 1940s . 
 The Metrolink system connects Sale with other locations in Greater Manchester . Trams depart the town 's three stations at least every 12 minutes between 07 : 00 and 22 : 30 every day . The nearest main line railway station is Navigation Road in Altrincham , from where trains run to Manchester Piccadilly , Stockport and Chester . Bus routes operated by various companies provide services to Manchester and to Altrincham . The A56 road runs between Chester and North Yorkshire via Sale , Manchester , and Burnley , and the M60 motorway – which encircles Manchester – can be accessed via junction 7 , just to the north of Sale . The M56 and M62 motorways are about 4 miles ( 6 km ) away , and the M6 motorway , which runs between Warwickshire and Gretna , is about 7 miles ( 11 km ) to the west . Manchester Airport , the busiest airport in the UK outside the London area , is 4 miles ( 6 km ) to the south . 
 = Narragansett Pacer = 
 The Narragansett Pacer was the first horse breed developed in the United States , but is now extinct . It was developed in the United States during the 18th century and associated closely with the state of Rhode Island , and it had become extinct by the late 19th century . The Pacer was developed from a mix of English and Spanish breeds , although the exact cross is unknown , and they were known to and owned by many famous personages of the day , including George Washington . Sales to the Caribbean and cross @-@ breeding diminished the breed to the point of extinction , and the last known Pacer died around 1880 . 
 The Narragansett was possibly an ambling horse , rather than a true pacing breed . It was known as a sure @-@ footed , dependable breed , although not flashy or always good @-@ looking . Pacers were used for racing and general riding . They were frequently crossed with other breeds , and provided the foundation for several other American breeds , including the American Saddlebred , Standardbred and Tennessee Walking Horse . 
 = = History = = 
 Highly valued by plantation owners of the 19th century , the Narragansett Pacer had a major influence on many American gaited breeds . The breed was especially associated with the state of Rhode Island in the early 18th century , but had become extinct by the late 19th century . It was known as the first breed of horse developed in America . The exact origins of the breed are unknown , but it was probably developed from a cross between English " ambling " horses and Spanish breeds . These Spanish breeds often included bloodlines that included lateral gaits . The horses developed from this cross were known for their smoothness and sure @-@ footedness over poor terrain . The English horses which contributed to the Narragansett Pacer may have been members of the Irish Hobby breed ; another possible ancestor is the Galloway pony . In the early 18th century , William Robinson , the Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island , began the serious development of the breed with a stallion named " Old Snip " — speculated to be either an Irish Hobby or an Andalusian , and considered the father of the breed . 
 In 1768 , George Washington owned and raced a Narragansett Pacer , while in 1772 , Edmund Burke asked an American friend for a pair . Paul Revere possibly rode a Pacer during his 1775 ride to warn the Americans of a British march . The extinction was due mainly to the breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely diminished in the United States . The few horses that were left were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct . North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett , with breeding stock having been brought to the area as early as 1790 by early pioneers . The last known Pacer , a mare , died around 1880 . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The Narragansett Pacer was not exclusively a pacing horse , as strong evidence indicates it exhibited an ambling gait , which is a four @-@ beat , intermediate @-@ speed gait , while the pace is a two @-@ beat , intermediate @-@ speed gait . The amble is more comfortable to ride than the pace , and Narragansett Pacers were known for their qualities as both riding and driving horses . They averaged around 14 @.@ 1 hands ( 57 inches , 145 cm ) tall , and were generally chestnut in color . James Fenimore Cooper described them as : " They have handsome foreheads , the head clean , the neck long , the arms and legs thin and tapered . " ; however , another source stated , " The hindquarters are narrow and the hocks a little crooked ... " , but also said , " They are very spirited and carry both the head and tail high . But what is more remarkable is that they amble with more speed than most horses trot , so that it is difficult to put some of them upon a gallop . " Other viewers of the breed rarely called them stylish or good @-@ looking , although they considered them dependable , easy to work with and sure @-@ footed . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The breed was used for " pacing races " in Rhode Island , where the Baptist population allowed races when the greater part of Puritan New England did not . Pacers reportedly covered the one @-@ mile tracks in a little more than two minutes . 
 The Narragansett Pacer played a significant role in the creation of the American Saddlebred , the Standardbred and the Tennessee Walking Horse . The breed was also combined with French pacers to create the Canadian Pacer , a breed especially suited to racing over ice and which also contributed substantially to the creation of the Standardbred . In the early 19th century , Pacer mares were bred to stallions of the fledgling Morgan breed . However , the Morgan breed was selected for a trot as an intermediate gait , and thus ambling horses were frowned upon , so most Narragansett / Morgan crosses were sold to Canada , the Caribbean , and South America , so the bloodlines did not remain within the Morgan breed . Other breeds indirectly influenced by the Narragansett Pacer include the Rocky Mountain Horse , a gaited breed started in Kentucky , and the Tiger Horse , a gaited breed with Appaloosa patterning .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Cambridge by four lengths in the previous year 's race . Oxford led overall with twelve wins to Cambridge 's ten . 
 In late 1865 , the Cambridge University Boat Club president Robert Kinglake wrote to Oxford in order to draw up rules on the seniority of participants in the Boat Race , asserting that Cambridge could not agree to send out a challenge unless this agreement was made . The proposal included the suggestion that " no pass or <unk> man may row after one year has elapsed from the date of him having passed his final examination . That no honour man may row after the end of his fourth year from the date of his commencing residence . " While both universities were agreed with regard to the <unk> of those reading " ordinary " degrees ( also referred to as " pass " degrees , as opposed to honours degrees ) , Oxford rejected the second clause which would have potentially excluded a small number of rowers given the differences in timetables between the universities . 
 Despite the disagreement , Kinglake sent the traditional challenge to Oxford who accepted . Cambridge went to Putney ten days before the race which was scheduled for 24 March , while Oxford practised there for eight days . The Light Blues rowed against a London Rowing Club eight in the buildup while the Dark Blues took on a watermen eight and a Kingston eight during their preparations . The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in the March and December races ) and the 1852 race , while the starter was Edward Searle .

 Oxford won the toss for the fifth consecutive year and elected to start on the Middlesex side of the river , handing the Surrey station to Cambridge , despite the advantage being " nullified ... for there was a strong wind blowing from the south @-@ west . " According to The Field , " arrangements had been made by the Thames Conservancy Board , which had most effectually put a stopper " on disruption from paddle boats to allow an uninterrupted start at <unk> Oxford led from the start but Cambridge redressed the balance and were half a length ahead by the time the crews shot Hammersmith Bridge . They maintained their lead to Chiswick Eyot and despite rough water , Cambridge continued in front . Avoiding a barge at Corny Reach , the Light Blues allowed their opponents to pass and take a half @-@ length lead which Oxford took to Barnes Bridge . Even though Cambridge made a push , even drawing level , Oxford pulled away and won by three lengths in a time of 25 minutes and 35 seconds . It was the third @-@ slowest time in the history of the event on the Championship Course . 
 = Bara Gumbad = 
 Bara Gumbad ( literally " big dome " ) is an ancient monument located in Lodhi Gardens in Delhi , India . It is part of a group of monuments that include a Friday mosque ( Jama Masjid ) and the " mehman khana " ( guest house ) of Sikandar Lodhi , the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate . The Bara Gumbad was constructed in 1490 CE , during the reign of the Lodhi dynasty . Its construction is generally attributed to Sikandar Lodhi , and it is believed to have the earliest constructed full dome of any building in Delhi . 
 The monument is situated near the Tomb of Sikandar Lodhi and Shisha Gumbad . Although the three structures , which share a common raised platform , were all built during the Lodhi reign , they were not constructed at the same time . The intended purpose of the builders of Bara Gumbad is unclear : it may have been intended as a free @-@ standing tomb , but no tombstone has been identified . The area in which Bara Gumbad is situated was formally called <unk> village .

 Bada Gumbad was constructed in 1490 CE , and is believed to have the earliest constructed full dome of any building in Delhi . Its construction is generally attributed to Sikandar Lodhi . A mihrab ( prayer niche ) in the Friday mosque ( Jama Masjid ) of the Bara Gumbad gives the date of construction as 900 AH ( Anno <unk> ) of the Islamic lunar calendar . 
 Including the Bada Gumbad , there are four monuments in the Lodhi Gardens ; the other three being Tomb of Sikandar Lodhi , Shisha Gumbad and the tomb of Muhammad Shah ( who belonged to the Sayyid dynasty ) . The Bada Gumbad is situated approximately 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) southwest of the tomb and 75 metres ( 246 ft ) south of Shisha Gumbad . During the rule of Sikander Lodhi , the Bara Gumbad , the adjacent mosque and the " mehman khana " ( guest house ) were constructed . The Bara Gumbad is speculated to serve as a gateway to the Friday mosque . However owing to the constitutions date , placement and stylistic differences the theory of gateway is not supported . The purpose and significance of the Bara Gumbad is unknown and to date remains a mystery . The Friday mosque was constructed in 1494 CE . It was the first mosque to be built in a style that first appeared during the Lodhi Dynasty . 
 Some historians suggest that the Bara Gumbad was built by an unidentified noble in 1490 CE , before being appropriated by Sikander Lodhi in 1494 CE , to provide an entryway to his mosque . Initially , all the monuments were built independently , and were not in one confine . In the early twentieth century , a park was developed , bringing the four monuments in one confine . The park was inaugurated on 9 April 1936 by Lady Willingdon , the wife of Viceroy Lord Willingdon . The park was originally called the Lady Willingdon Park after her , but was renamed to Lodhi Gardens after independence of India in 1947 .
