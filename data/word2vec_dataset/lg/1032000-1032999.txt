In November 2014 , ABC aired another one @-@ hour television special titled , Marvel 75 Years : From Pulp to Pop ! , which featured behind the scenes footage of Ant @-@ Man . Marvel Comics ' February 2015 solicitations released in December 2014 , revealed a two @-@ issue comic tie @-@ in , Marvel 's Ant @-@ Man Prelude , following Hank Pym as Ant @-@ Man on a mission during the Cold War . A second comic tie @-@ in , Marvel 's Ant @-@ Man — Scott Lang : Small Time , was released digitally on March 3 , 2015 . It explains Lang 's circumstances at the beginning of the film . 
 In January 2015 , Disney officially began the film 's marketing campaign by releasing a miniature " ant @-@ sized " teaser trailer , a full @-@ sized version of the same teaser trailer , a poster , a cover on Entertainment Weekly , and a full @-@ length trailer during the premiere of the television series Agent Carter . Scott Mendelson of Forbes , said , " It was darn @-@ clever for Disney to put out a miniature ' can 't see anything without a microscope ' version of the now @-@ standard trailer for the trailer . I sighed just a little when they ' gave in ' and released a human @-@ sized version , realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer ... But nonetheless , credit where credit is due , Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days . " Mendelson went on to say that " the peppy , witty trailer above is a general audience sell . Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones , but it 's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold . So far , so good . " However , Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of Agent Carter , its tone , its soundtrack , and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios . McMillan concluded , " The Ant @-@ Man trailer isn 't bad , per se ; it is , however , impressively underwhelming , which almost seems worse . Thanks to the last @-@ minute exit of original writer @-@ director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement , Ant @-@ Man has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel 's first failure , in critical if not financial terms , at least ; this trailer , which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything else , doesn 't do enough — or anything , really — to persuade audiences that that 's not the case . " The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days , the third @-@ largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film , behind trailers for Iron Man 3 and Avengers : Age of Ultron . 
 In April 2015 , Marvel debuted a second trailer for Ant @-@ Man . Mendelson said it was " frankly the Ant @-@ Man trailer that we 've been waiting for . It 's not just funny and exciting , it 's an ' Ah ha ! ' moment when we realize just what exactly an Ant @-@ Man movie has to offer . " Also in April , miniature billboards promoting Ant @-@ Man with battery @-@ powered LED lights began appearing in Melbourne , Brisbane and other areas around Queensland , Australia as part of a street marketing campaign for the film . The next month , Marvel , in partnership with Dolby Laboratories , Visa , and Raspberry Pi , announced the " Ant @-@ Man Micro @-@ Tech Challenge " , aimed at females aged 14 through 18 , to create DIY projects involving micro technology and readily accessible and found materials . Winners teamed with STEM ( Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics education ) programs in their areas to lead teams in recreating their projects . In June , Marvel released posters featuring Ant @-@ Man juxtaposed with Iron Man 's armor , Captain America 's shield , and Thor 's hammer Mjolnir . Mendelson compared this to Disney 's marketing campaign for Lilo & Stitch that put the protagonist into iconic scenes from other Disney cartoons . A six @-@ minute IMAX preview of the film began <unk> before showings of Jurassic World , and scenes from the film were shown at Disney California Adventure 's Bug 's Life Theater in 3D with in @-@ theater effects . 
 In early July 2015 , Marvel began a viral marketing campaign featuring Leslie Bibb , reprising her role from the Iron Man films as journalist Christine Everhart , reporting for the faux news program WHIH Newsfront . In the program , Everhart discuses the fallout from the events of Avengers : Age of Ultron , Lang 's imprisonment , and events leading to Captain America : Civil War . Also in July , Michael Douglas and executives from Marvel Entertainment rang the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange in celebration of the release of Ant @-@ Man . Disney spent $ 34 @.@ 8 million on television advertising for the film , more than the $ 26 @.@ 9 million spent for Avengers : Age of Ultron , since the former was a new property . 
 In December 2015 , to commemorate the home media release of Ant @-@ Man , Marvel UK launched a website that offers visitors a view of various London landmarks from the perspective of an ant in a Google Street View @-@ type experience . The company commissioned photographer Will Pearson to capture ten different locations including Tower Bridge , Oxford Circus , the British Museum , St Paul 's Cathedral and Nelson 's Column using a 360 ° miniature camera that sat centimeters off of the ground .

 The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 81 % approval rating , based on 267 reviews , with an average rating of 6 @.@ 8 / 10 . The website 's consensus reads , " Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd , Ant @-@ Man offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale – albeit not as smoothly as its most successful predecessors . " On Metacritic , the film has an average score of 64 out of 100 , based on 43 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an " A " grade on an A + to F scale . 
 Justin Chang of Variety said the film " succeeds well enough as a genial diversion and sometimes a delightful one , predicated on the rarely heeded Hollywood wisdom that less really can be more . " Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked , " Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff , with its parallel father @-@ daughter melodrama , is elemental button @-@ pushing , a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion . " Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote , " Playful in unexpected ways and graced with a genuinely off @-@ center sense of humor , Ant @-@ Man ( engagingly directed by Peyton Reed ) is light on its feet the way the standard @-@ issue Marvel behemoths never are . " Kim Newman of Empire wrote that it " straddles as many genres as the Avengers films have characters but manages to do most of them pretty well . Extremely likable , with a few moments of proper wonder . " A. O. Scott of The New York Times said , " This film is a passable piece of drone work from the ever @-@ expanding Marvel @-@ Disney colony . " 
 Conversely , Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said the film " serves up jokes that don 't land and thrills that don 't thrill . " Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times said Ant @-@ Man " is a lightweight , cliché @-@ riddled origins story that veers between inside @-@ joke comedy , ponderous redemption story lines and admittedly nifty CGI sequences that still seem relatively insignificant compared to the high stakes and city @-@ shattering destruction that take place in most of the Avengers movies . " Catherine Shoard of The Guardian wrote , " Ant @-@ Man is a cut @-@ and @-@ shut muddle , haunted by [ Edgar Wright 's ] ghost , produced by a high @-@ end hot dog factory , by turns <unk> and stupefying . " Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said that it is " a film that will surely be popular , given Marvel 's marketing might , but one that 's woefully short on coherence and originality . " Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said , " It 's difficult to shake the sense that the film was assembled hurriedly and somewhat haphazardly . Which , from all available evidence , is exactly what happened . "

 In June 2015 , Reed stated , " If we were lucky enough to be able to do a sequel or even a prequel , I 'd be way into it . I 've really fallen in love with these characters ...

" In July 2015 , Douglas expressed the desire to have his wife Catherine Zeta @-@ Jones play Janet van Dyne , while Lilly hoped to see Michelle Pfeiffer in the role . Douglas also revealed he was not signed for any additional films , but " would look forward to more if it comes my way " . Also in July , Feige revealed that the studio had " a supercool idea for the next Ant @-@ Man film , and if audiences want it , we 'll find a place to do it . " Reed also mentioned that there had been talks of doing a standalone adventure with Hank Pym as Ant @-@ Man , possibly including the original opening to Ant @-@ Man that featured Jordi Mollà , which had been cut from the final film . Eric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend opined that a standalone adventure with Pym and the cut sequence would be a good candidate to revive the Marvel One @-@ Shots short film series . By the end of the month , Dastmalchian expressed interest in returning for a sequel . In October 2015 , Marvel Studios confirmed that a sequel , titled Ant @-@ Man and the Wasp , is scheduled for release on July 6 , 2018 .

 = Henry Fownes Luttrell ( died 1780 ) = 
 Henry Fownes Luttrell ( c . 1722 – 30 October 1780 ) , born Henry Fownes , of Dunster Castle , Somerset , was High Sheriff of Somerset from 1754 to 1755 , and a member of parliament for the borough of Minehead from 1768 to 1774 . 
 Fownes was born into a family belonging to Devon 's gentry and led the life of a country squire . In 1747 , he married Margaret Luttrell , the heiress of Dunster Castle and added his wife 's name to his own to comply with her late father 's will . In accordance with the era 's laws concerning the property rights of married women , on his marriage he became the legal owner of his wife 's property , including not only Dunster Castle , but also the lordships of the manors of Dunster , Heathfield , and <unk> amongst others . The newly named Fownes Luttrell altered the castle considerably , remodelling its interior and park and building the Conygar Tower , a folly in the grounds . Following the death of his wife in 1766 he remarried in 1771 . 
 When Fownes Luttrell 's candidate for the 1754 election was defeated , he realised that his estate bought him relatively little political power . Frustrated , he set about nursing his interest in the borough . Later , a compromise with a rival landowner placed one of the borough 's two parliamentary seats in his pocket . He stood for election in 1768 and was returned with the support of the Government . He was returned again in 1774 alongside his eldest son , John ; the Prime Minister was disgruntled that he had not returned his own favoured candidate and Fownes Luttrell resigned on the condition that the Government 's candidate would not interfere in the future without his permission . Thenceforth until abolition by the Reform Act of 1832 the borough 's parliamentary seats were effectively controlled by his family . 
 Fownes Luttrell was an inactive politician , and is not known to have spoken or voted in Parliament during the six years he was a member . Instead , he led the life of a country squire , hunting and managing his estates . Fownes Luttrell died in 1780 , and his eldest son succeeded to his estates . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Henry Fownes was born about 1722 or 1723 , the eldest son of John Fownes of Kittery Court , Kingswear , Devon , Member of Parliament for Dartmouth , and his wife Anne Maddock , daughter of Samuel Maddock of <unk> <unk> . He matriculated at Queen 's College , Oxford , in 1741 , but did not take a degree . 
 On 16 February 1747 , Fownes married his second cousin Margaret Luttrell ( born 7 February 1726 ) , the daughter and heiress of Alexander Luttrell ( 1705 – 1737 ) , MP , whose family had owned Dunster Castle since 1376 , by his wife Margaret Trevelyan , daughter of Sir John Trevelyan , 2nd Baronet of Nettlecombe , Somerset . According to Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte , the historian of Dunster Castle , " the union proved exceptionally happy and her letters to her husband ... are conceived in the spirit of the sincerest affection . " Following his marriage and inheritance not only was he required under the bequest to add to his surname but was also compelled to spend six months of each year at Dunster Castle . 
 By his wife he had six sons and four daughters . Of these , several died as infants : Alexander ( born and died in 1749 ) , Anne ( born and died 1750 ) , Anne ( born and died 1751 ) , and Anne ( born and died 1758 ) ; while Lieutenant Henry Fownes Luttrell ( 1753 – 77 ) was an officer in the Royal Horse Guards , but died unmarried and Margaret Fownes Luttrell ( 1747 – 92 ) married , in 1769 , John Henry Southcote of Buckland <unk> , Devon , and sat for a portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds that year .

 Lieutenant @-@ Colonel John Fownes Luttrell ( 1752 – 1816 ) . He was a member of parliament for Minehead from 1774 to 1806 and again from 1807 to 1816 . 
 The Reverend Alexander Luttrell ( baptised 1754 ; died 1816 ) . He was educated at Pembroke College , Cambridge , and took holy orders ; in 1807 , he married Lucy Gatchell . 
 Francis Fownes Luttrell ( 1756 – 1823 ) . He sat as a member of parliament for Minehead from 1780 to 1783 and went on to be Chair of the Board of Customs from 1813 to 1819 . 
 Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Thomas Fownes Luttrell ( 1763 – 1811 ) . He was an army officer and sat as a member of parliament for Minehead from 1795 to 1796 . 
 Margaret Luttrell died in 1766 . Five years later , Fownes Luttrell married Frances Bradley , a daughter of Samuel Bradley of Dunster . She died in 1803 . 
 = = Country squire = = 
 Margaret Luttrell 's father died in 1737 , when she was eleven , and she inherited the position . Her father left debts due to his lifestyle and also provisions in his parents ' wills that forced him to support his niece , Anne Luttrell , a daughter of Francis , his brother . This situation caused the family seat at Dunster Castle , to be closed and valued , while much of the family silver now in her possession was sold off , in some cases to relatives . Margaret Luttrell went to live with her mother 's new husband , Edward Dyke of <unk> , a wealthy landowner . While there , she married Fownes , who was then a resident of <unk> , Devon . 
 To improve his wife 's estate , Fownes Luttrell obtained a sanction from the Court of Chancery to sell the manors of Heathfield and <unk> , but found no buyers ; he subsequently attempted to sell the manor of Minehead , and also offered at least one of the Parliamentary seats for the Borough of Minehead for £ 30 @,@ 000 , but there were no serious bidders , largely due to the high prices and the fact that Fownes Luttrell had in fact not inherited much control over the seats he was putting up for sale . However , frugal spending helped to recover the estate and Fownes Luttrell invested in 1760 in the manor of <unk> , near Dunster , which he purchased from John Poyntz . He went on to buy the manor of Staunton Fry in 1777 and a number of tenements in Dunster . In leisure , he particularly enjoyed hunting , keeping hounds and horses , and cockfighting . 
 = = = Dunster Castle = = = 
 Beginning in 1747 , Fownes Luttrell made numerous and significant alterations to Dunster Castle , redecorating and redesigning it in the Rococo style . He renovated the Great Parlour , converted a bedroom over it into a Drawing Room in 1758 , created a Breakfast Room over the Hall in 1772 , remodelled the southern part of the castle , and altered the Great Staircase in 1773 . His changes to the décor of the castle are also noteworthy , particularly for his use of newly @-@ fashionable wallpaper . 
 Further alterations were made by Fownes Luttrell to the castle grounds . He created the park there and constructed Conygar Tower . The latter was commissioned in 1775 and was designed as a decorative folly to improve the views from the castle ; he also built a gatehouse and a statue of Neptune in Conygar wood at a similar time , while commissioning the reconstruction of Dunster Water Mill and the adjacent bridge , which were rebuilt from 1779 to 1780 . In 1764 , the Lower Ward of the Castle was reduced to one level , while several adjoining walls were removed and the road passing through the gateway was covered over . Additionally , his 141 @-@ hectare ( 350 @-@ acre ) park was built south of the castle , and required the eviction of a number of tenant farmers . 
 = = Member of Parliament = = 
 Being Lord of the Manor of Minehead theoretically gave Fownes Luttrell a " Natural Interest " in elections to Parliament for the borough — i.e. the power to influence the votes of its householders . However , the Luttrells had let it slip out of their control and Fownes Luttrell was being warned by his estate 's agent , John St. <unk> , in 1747 that " you do not appear sure of more than one quarter of the vote , and it may happen too that of even one quarter of them some will fail you " . At the British General Election of 1754 , Fownes Luttrell was serving as High Sheriff of Somerset , which barred him from standing as a candidate to be a member of parliament ; however Henry Shiffner , a merchant from London , approached him and offered himself as a candidate for the borough in his place . 
 As St. <unk> had warned , Shiffner was not returned as a Member ; instead , Lord Egremont , a local landowner , offered considerable financial support to his own candidate , Daniel Boone , while one of the incumbent MPs , Charles Whitworth , offered to sell parts of his estate to loyal supporters . An intervention from the Duke of Newcastle , at Egremont 's request , led to Boone and Whitworth forming an alliance against Fownes Luttrell . Shiffner petitioned Parliament and was supported by an angered Fownes Luttrell , but Egremont and Fownes Luttrell eventually agreed a truce and by 1757 had agreed to return a member each and oppose any third candidates . Reluctant to stand himself , Fownes Luttrell supported Shiffner again . The pair would spend seven years dealing with the estate and consolidating his interest there ; this , coupled with his arrangement with Egremont , meant that Shiffner was duly returned in 1761 , alongside the first Earl of Thomond , brother of Egremont , beating an outsider , the Earl of <unk> . During this Parliament , Fownes Luttrell entertained voters at Dunster Castle and in the village , where he laid on expensive feasts . 
 After his wife 's death in 1766 , Fownes Luttrell decided to stand at the general election in 1768 . Despite his efforts to build up support , there were still factions and opposition to him . To gain some form of patronage in Minehead , he travelled to London and obtained from the Government control over the offices in Minehead , which prevented his opponents from doing the same . Fownes Luttrell won that election , accumulating more than £ 1 @,@ 800 worth of expenses in the process . While a member of parliament , he is not recorded as speaking and does not appear in the small number of division lists still surviving . According to Maxwell Lyte , " it does not appear that [ he ] had any real zest for Parliamentary life [ and was ] probably far happier with his hounds and his fighting cocks in Devon or Somerset . " However , it appears that the Prime Minister , Lord North , believed that in return for the Government 's support in 1768 , Fownes Luttrell had promised to return the Government 's candidate , Thomas Pownall , at the next election ; when that time came , in 1774 , North supported Fownes Luttrell and " warned off " his rival , Charles Whitworth . However , Fownes Luttrell was elected alongside his eldest son , John , which caused a dispute between the former and North . The dispute was resolved when the elder Fownes Luttrell offered to resign that December , in favour of Pownall , on the condition that Pownall seek his approval before nominating any of his friends or himself in future ; a draft document outlining his other conditions included a payment of £ 3 @,@ 000 in return for his resignation . 
 Despite resigning , Fownes Luttrell had asserted his influence and control over both seats and , in 1780 his son Francis was elected alongside John Fownes Luttrell , who remained one of the MPs until 1806 and went on to sit again from 1807 to 1816 ; his other son , Thomas , and John 's son ( also called John ) were also elected subsequently . 
 Henry Fownes Luttrell died on 30 October 1780 .

 = Jeannie Mole = 
 Harriet Fisher Mole ( née Jones ; 2 May 1841 – 15 April 1912 ) , known as Jeannie , was a British socialist , feminist , and trade union organiser in Liverpool . Arriving there in 1879 , Mole was instrumental in bringing socialism to Liverpool , as well as setting up a number of societies to encourage trade unions amongst Liverpool 's female workforce . She supported strikes to improve the workforce 's conditions , especially to remove fines . 
 Mole was also a supporter of dress reform , set up a socialist food van and advocated at a coroner 's investigation for the family of a woman killed in an industrial accident , ensuring the family received compensation and encouraging the jury to recommend safety improvements as part of the verdict . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Harriet Fisher Jones was born on 2 May 1841 in Warrington to her father , Evan Jones , a tinsmith , and his wife , Harriet Jones . As she and her mother shared the same name , she became better known as Jeannie . In 1860 , she married a fruit merchant , Robert Willis , and the couple travelled to New York , where she took an interest in the black rights movement . On her return to England , she and her husband settled in London and had a son , Robert Frederick Evan Willis , better known as Fred . Willis spent some time helping the poor in the slums of London . She was heavily influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin , setting her on the path of socialism . 
 In the late 1870s , Willis divorced her husband and remarried . Her new husband was another fruit merchant , William <unk> Mole , who was also the son of a wealthy Liverpool jeweller . William was 22 at the time , and the marriage was witnessed by Mole 's son , as well as her brother . The family moved to Liverpool , living on Bold Street . It was there that she began her lifelong ambition to improve the lives of those in poverty within Liverpool . 
 Mole suffered a heart attack in 1896 , likely due to excessive work and the ensuing illness lead to her taking a step back from organisational work the following year . Her son , Fred , died in 1905 . On 15 April 1912 , whilst on holiday in Paris , Mole died . 
 = = Feminist and socialist work = = 
 Finding just six socialists in Liverpool , Mole started propaganda meetings in her home with the support of her husband and son . These meetings lead to the formation in 1886 of the Worker 's Brotherhood , the first socialist society in Liverpool . The Brotherhood , despite never achieving great numbers , went on to help form the Liverpool branch of the Fabian Society in 1892 . Mole became vice president of the Liverpool Fabian Society in 1895 . She also focused on more practical solutions for social issues , for example , funding a " socialist food van " at a cost of £ 55 6s 5d and campaigning for a " people 's hall " in Liverpool for the working class . 
 Mole was an early follower of dress reform , a feminist movement against the cumbersome garments of the Victorian era , and would regularly wear an outfit reminiscent of Greek robes . She gave the pattern to Caroline Martyn and Julia Dawson , who wore similar outfits . 
 In 1888 , Mole and the Workers ' Brotherhood started to campaign to unionise the female workers in Liverpool into female @-@ only unions . They started working with the Women 's Protective and Provident League ( <unk> ) , calling for the founding of a local branch , and in January 1889 , the group set up the Liverpool <unk> 's Society , representing <unk> , tailors , and cigar makers , with Mole acting as secretary . Women were over @-@ represented in these poorly paid trades , with four women for every man working in them . The society relaunched the following year as " Liverpool Society for the Promotion of Women 's Trade Unions " , expanding its membership to other trades in reaction to Liverpool City Council 's inaction over sweating systems in the area . Mole helped set up specific unions , such as one for ( primarily Chinese ) <unk> and washerwomen . Around the same time , the House of Lords launched a select committee on sweating systems , with the ensuing publicity encouraging the group to take further action . 
 In 1894 , Clementina Black set up the Women 's Industrial Council ; soon after , Mole helped found a Liverpool branch in which she was the secretary . The council helped form unions for <unk> and marine @-@ <unk> , as well as worked with the other groups set up by the <unk> 's society . In her role , Mole also stepped up inquiries into working conditions for women ; for example , when an industrial accident killed a woman at the Old Swan Rope Works in Liverpool , Mole attended the case as secretary of the ' society for inquiring into the conditions of working women ' . She ensured that a factory inspector attended , that the jury made recommendations to prevent future accidents , and that compensation was paid to the woman 's next of kin . 
 In 1895 , Mole leveraged her position in the Liverpool Women 's Industrial Council ( <unk> ) to encourage a strike amongst Liverpool 's women <unk> to stop fines on top of loss of wages for petty misdemeanors such as turning up late . Despite the successful outcome of the strike , the section of the <unk> led by Eleanor Rathbone wanted to focus on " social investigation " and disapproved of the action , leading Mole to disassociate herself from the group . Mole also created and edited the " Women 's Page " of the Liverpool Labour Chronicle newspaper . 
 = Battle of Ramillies = 
 The Battle of Ramillies / <unk> / , fought on 23 May 1706 , was a battle of the War of the Spanish Succession . For the Grand Alliance – Austria , England , and the Dutch Republic – the battle had followed an indecisive campaign against the Bourbon armies of King Louis XIV of France in 1705 . Although the Allies had captured Barcelona that year , they had been forced to abandon their campaign on the Moselle , had stalled in the Spanish Netherlands and suffered defeat in northern Italy . Yet despite his opponents ' setbacks Louis XIV was desirous of peace – but he wanted it on reasonable terms . For this end and in order to maintain their momentum , the French and their allies took the offensive in 1706 . 
 The campaign began well for Louis XIV 's generals : in Italy Marshal Vendôme had defeated the Austrians at the Battle of <unk> in April , while in Alsace Marshal Villars had forced the Margrave of Baden back across the Rhine . Encouraged by these early gains Louis XIV urged Marshal Villeroi to go over to the offensive in the Spanish Netherlands and , with victory , gain a ' fair ' peace . Accordingly , the French Marshal set off from Leuven ( Louvain ) at the head of 60 @,@ 000 men and marched towards Tienen ( Tirlemont ) , as if to threaten Zoutleeuw ( <unk> ) . Also determined to fight a major engagement , the Duke of Marlborough , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of Anglo @-@ Dutch forces , assembled his army – some 62 @,@ 000 men – near Maastricht , and marched past Zoutleeuw . With both sides seeking battle , they soon stumbled upon one other on the dry ground between the Mehaigne and Petite Gheete rivers , close to the small village of Ramillies . 
 In less than four hours Marlborough 's Dutch , English , and Danish forces overwhelmed Villeroi 's and Max Emanuel 's Franco @-@ Spanish @-@ Bavarian army . The Duke 's subtle moves and changes in emphasis during the battle – something his opponents failed to realise until it was too late – caught the French in a tactical vice . With their foe broken and routed , the Allies were able to fully exploit their victory . Town after town fell , including Brussels , Bruges , Antwerp ; by the end of the campaign Villeroi 's army had been driven from most of the Spanish Netherlands . With Prince Eugene 's subsequent success at the Battle of Turin in northern Italy , the Allies had imposed the greatest loss of territory and resources that Louis XIV would suffer during the war . The year 1706 had indeed proved to be the Allies ' annus mirabilis . 
 = = Background = = 
 After their disastrous defeat at Blenheim in 1704 , the next year brought the French some respite . The Duke of Marlborough had intended the 1705 campaign – an invasion of France through the Moselle valley – to complete the work of Blenheim and persuade King Louis XIV to make peace but the plan had been thwarted by friend and foe alike . The reluctance of his Dutch allies to see their frontiers denuded of troops for another gamble in Germany had denied Marlborough the initiative but of far greater importance was the Margrave of Baden ’ s pronouncement that he could not join the Duke in strength for the coming offensive . This was in part due to the sudden switching of troops from the Rhine to reinforce Prince Eugene in Italy and part due to the deterioration of Baden ’ s health brought on by the re @-@ opening of a severe foot wound he had received at the storming of the Schellenberg the previous year . Marlborough had to cope with the death of Emperor Leopold I in May and the accession of Joseph I , which unavoidably complicated matters for the Grand Alliance . 
 The resilience of the French King and the efforts of his generals , also added to Marlborough ’ s problems . Marshal Villeroi , exerting considerable pressure on the Dutch commander , Count Overkirk , along the Meuse , took Huy on 10 June before pressing on towards Liège . With Marshal Villars sitting strong on the Moselle , the Allied commander – whose supplies had by now become very short – was forced to call off his campaign on 16 June . " What a disgrace for Marlborough , " exulted Villeroi , " to have made false movements without any result ! " With Marlborough ’ s departure north , the French transferred troops from the Moselle valley to reinforce Villeroi in Flanders , while Villars marched off to the Rhine . 
 The Anglo @-@ Dutch forces gained minor compensation for the failed Moselle campaign with the success at Elixheim and the crossing of the Lines of Brabant in the Spanish Netherlands ( Huy was also retaken on 11 July ) but a chance to bring the French to a decisive engagement eluded Marlborough . The year 1705 proved almost entirely barren for the Duke , whose military disappointments were only partly compensated by efforts on the diplomatic front where , at the courts of Düsseldorf , Frankfurt , Vienna , Berlin and Hanover , Marlborough sought to bolster support for the Grand Alliance and extract promises of prompt assistance for the following year 's campaign . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 On 11 January 1706 , Marlborough finally reached London at the end of his diplomatic tour but he had already been planning his strategy for the coming season . The first option ( although it is debatable to what extent the Duke was committed to such an enterprise ) was a plan to transfer his forces from the Spanish Netherlands to northern Italy ; once there , he intended linking up with Prince Eugene in order to defeat the French and safeguard Savoy from being overrun . Savoy would then serve as a gateway into France by way of the mountain passes or an invasion with naval support along the Mediterranean coast via Nice and Toulon , in connexion with redoubled Allied efforts in Spain . It seems that the Duke ’ s favoured scheme was to return to the Moselle valley ( where Marshal Marsin had recently taken command of French forces ) and once more attempt an advance into the heart of France . But these decisions soon became academic . Shortly after Marlborough landed in the Dutch Republic on 14 April , news arrived of big Allied setbacks in the wider war . 
 Determined to show the Grand Alliance that France was still resolute , Louis XIV prepared to launch a double surprise in Alsace and northern Italy . On the latter front Marshal Vendôme defeated the Imperial army at <unk> on 19 April , pushing the Imperialists back in confusion ( French forces were now in a position to prepare for the long @-@ anticipated siege of Turin ) . In Alsace , Marshal Villars took Baden by surprise and captured Haguenau , driving him back across the Rhine in some disorder , thus creating a threat on Landau . With these reverses , the Dutch refused to contemplate Marlborough 's ambitious march to Italy or any plan that denuded their borders of the Duke and their army . In the interest of coalition harmony , Marlborough prepared to campaign in the Low Countries . 
 = = = On the move = = = 
 The Duke left The Hague on 9 May . " God knows I go with a heavy heart , " he wrote six days later to his friend and political ally in England , Lord Godolphin , " for I have no hope of doing anything considerable , unless the French do what I am very confident they will not … " – in other words , court battle . On 17 May the Duke concentrated his Dutch and English troops at Tongeren , near Maastricht . The Hanoverians , Hessians and Danes , despite earlier undertakings , found , or invented , pressing reasons for withholding their support . Marlborough wrote an appeal to the Duke of Württemberg , the commander of the Danish contingent – " I send you this express to request your Highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at the earliest moment … " Additionally , the King in Prussia , Frederick I , had kept his troops in quarters behind the Rhine while his personal disputes with Vienna and the States General at The Hague remained unresolved . Nevertheless , the Duke could think of no circumstances why the French would leave their strong positions and attack his army , even if Villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from Marsin ’ s command . But in this he had miscalculated . Although Louis XIV wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms ; for that , he needed victory in the field and to convince the Allies that his resources were by no means exhausted . 
 Following the successes in Italy and along the Rhine , Louis XIV was now hopeful of similar results in Flanders . Far from standing on the defensive therefore – and unbeknown to Marlborough – Louis XIV was persistently goading his marshal into action . " [ Villeroi ] began to imagine , " wrote St Simon , " that the King doubted his courage , and resolved to stake all at once in an effort to vindicate himself . " Accordingly , on 18 May , Villeroi set off from Leuven at the head of 70 battalions , 132 squadrons and 62 cannon – comprising an overall force of some 60 @,@ 000 troops – and crossed the river Dyle to seek battle with the enemy . Spurred on by his growing confidence in his ability to out @-@ general his opponent , and by Versailles ’ determination to avenge Blenheim , Villeroi and his generals anticipated success . 
 Neither opponent expected the clash at the exact moment or place where it occurred . The French moved first to Tienen , ( as if to threaten Zoutleeuw , abandoned by the French in October 1705 ) , before turning southwards , heading for <unk> – this line of march took Villeroi ’ s army towards the narrow aperture of dry ground between the Mehaigne and Petite Gheete rivers close to the small villages of Ramillies and Taviers ; but neither commander quite appreciated how far his opponent had travelled . Villeroi still believed ( on 22 May ) the Allies were a full day ’ s march away when in fact they had camped near <unk> waiting for the Danish squadrons to catch up ; for his part , Marlborough deemed Villeroi still at <unk> when in reality he was now approaching the plateau of Mont St. André with the intention of pitching camp near Ramillies ( see map at right ) . However , the Prussian infantry was not there . Marlborough wrote to Lord Raby , the English resident at Berlin : " If it should please God to give us victory over the enemy , the Allies will be little obliged to the King [ Frederick ] for the success . " 
 The following day , at 01 : 00 , Marlborough dispatched Cadogan , his Quartermaster @-@ General , with an advanced guard to reconnoitre the same dry ground that Villeroi ’ s army was now heading , country that was well known to the Duke from previous campaigns . Two hours later the Duke followed with the main body : 74 battalions , 123 squadrons , 90 pieces of artillery and 20 mortars , totalling 62 @,@ 000 troops . At about 08 : 00 , after Cadogan had just passed <unk> , his force made brief contact with a party of French hussars gathering forage on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille . After a brief exchange of shots the French retired and Cadogan 's dragoons pressed forward . With a short lift in the mist , Cadogan soon discovered the smartly ordered lines of Villeroi ’ s advance guard some 6 kilometres ( 4 miles ) off ; a <unk> hastened back to warn Marlborough . Two hours later the Duke , accompanied by the Dutch field commander Field Marshal Overkirk , General Daniel <unk> , and the Allied staff , rode up to Cadogan where on the horizon to the westward he could discern the massed ranks of the French army deploying for battle along the 6 km ( 4 mi ) front . Marlborough later told Bishop Burnet that , ‘ the French army looked the best of any he had ever seen ’ .

 = = = Battlefield = = = 
 The battlefield of Ramillies is very similar to that of Blenheim , for here too there is an immense area of arable land unimpeded by woods or hedges . Villeroi ’ s right rested on the villages of Franquenée and Taviers , with the river Mehaigne protecting his flank . A large open plain , about 2 km ( 1 mi ) wide , lay between Taviers and Ramillies , but unlike Blenheim , there was no stream to hinder the cavalry . His centre was secured by Ramillies itself , lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to the north and east . The French left flank was protected by broken country , and by a stream , the Petite Gheete , which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes . On the French side of the stream the ground rises to Offus , the village which , together with Autre @-@ Eglise farther north , anchored Villeroi ’ s left flank . To the west of the Petite Gheete rises the plateau of Mont St. André ; a second plain , the plateau of Jandrenouille – upon which the Anglo @-@ Dutch army amassed – rises to the east . 
 = = = Initial dispositions = = = 
 At 11 : 00 , the Duke ordered the army to take standard battle formation . On the far right , towards <unk> , the British battalions and squadrons took up their posts in a double line near the <unk> stream . The centre was formed by the mass of Dutch , German , Protestant Swiss and Scottish infantry – perhaps 30 @,@ 000 men – facing Offus and Ramillies . Also facing Ramillies Marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24 @-@ pounders , dragged into position by a team of oxen ; further batteries were positioned overlooking the Petite Gheete . On their left , on the broad plain between Taviers and Ramillies – and where Marlborough thought the decisive encounter must take place – Overkirk drew the 69 squadrons of the Dutch and Danish horse , supported by 19 battalions of Dutch infantry and two artillery pieces . 
 Meanwhile , Villeroi deployed his forces . In Taviers on his right , he placed two battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment , with a smaller force forward in Franquenée ; the whole position was protected by the boggy ground of the Mehaigne river , thus preventing an Allied flanking movement . In the open country between Taviers and Ramillies , he placed 82 squadrons under General de Guiscard supported by several interleaved brigades of French , Swiss and Bavarian infantry . Along the Ramillies – Offus – Autre Eglise ridge @-@ line , Villeroi positioned Walloon and Bavarian infantry , supported by the Elector of Bavaria 's 50 squadrons of Bavarian and Walloon cavalry placed behind on the plateau of Mont St. André . Ramillies , Offus and Autre @-@ Eglise were all packed with troops and put in a state of defence , with alleys barricaded and walls loop @-@ holed for muskets . Villeroi also positioned powerful batteries near Ramillies . These guns ( some of which were of the three barrelled kind first seen at Elixheim the previous year ) enjoyed good arcs of fire , able to fully cover the approaches of the plateau of Jandrenouille over which the Allied infantry would have to pass . 
 Marlborough , however , noticed several important weaknesses in the French dispositions . Tactically , it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre @-@ Eglise on his left , but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over @-@ extend his forces . Moreover , this disposition – concave in relation to the Allied army – gave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line , drawn up in a shorter front between the ‘ horns ’ of the French crescent ; when the Allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight . Additionally , the Duke ’ s disposition facilitated the transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe , a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as the events of the afternoon unfolded . Although Villeroi had the option of enveloping the flanks of the Allied army as they deployed on the plateau of Jandrenouille – threatening to encircle their army – the Duke correctly gauged that the characteristically cautious French commander was intent on a defensive battle along the ridge @-@ line . 
 = = = Taviers = = = 
 At 13 : 00 the batteries went into action ; a little later two Allied columns set out from the extremities of their line and attacked the flanks of the Franco @-@ Bavarian army . To the south the Dutch Guards , under the command of Colonel <unk> , came forward with their two field guns to seize the hamlet of Franquenée . The small Swiss garrison in the village , shaken by the sudden onslaught and unsupported by the battalions to their rear , were soon compelled back towards the village of Taviers . Taviers was of particular importance to the Franco @-@ Bavarian position : it protected the otherwise unsupported flank of General de Guiscard ’ s cavalry on the open plain , while at the same time , it allowed the French infantry to pose a threat to the flanks of the Dutch and Danish squadrons as they came forward into position . But hardly had the retreating Swiss rejoined their comrades in that village when the Dutch Guards renewed their attack . The fighting amongst the alleys and cottages soon deteriorated into a fierce bayonet and clubbing mêlée , but the superiority in Dutch firepower soon told . The accomplished French officer , Colonel de la Colonie , standing on the plain nearby remembered – " this village was the opening of the engagement , and the fighting there was almost as murderous as the rest of the battle put together . " By about 15 : 00 the Swiss had been pushed out of the village into the marshes beyond . 
 Villeroi ’ s right flank fell into chaos and was now open and vulnerable . Alerted to the situation de Guiscard ordered an immediate attack with 14 squadrons of French dragoons currently stationed in the rear . Two other battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment were also sent , but the attack was poorly co @-@ ordinated and consequently went in piecemeal . The Anglo @-@ Dutch commanders now sent dismounted Dutch dragoons into Taviers , which , together with the Guards and their field guns , poured concentrated <unk> and canister @-@ fire into the advancing French troops . Colonel d ’ <unk> , leading his regiment , fell mortally wounded . 
 As the French ranks wavered , the leading squadrons of Württemberg ’ s Danish horse – now unhampered by enemy fire from either village – were also sent into the attack and fell upon the exposed flank of the Franco @-@ Swiss infantry and dragoons . De la Colonie , with his Grenadiers Rouge regiment , together with the Cologne Guards who were brigaded with them , was now ordered forward from his post south of Ramillies to support the faltering counter @-@ attack on the village . But on his arrival , all was chaos – " Scarcely had my troops got over when the dragoons and Swiss who had preceded us , came tumbling down upon my battalions in full flight … My own fellows turned about and fled along with them . " De La Colonie managed to rally some of his grenadiers , together with the remnants of the French dragoons and Greder Suisse battalions , but it was an entirely peripheral operation , offering only fragile support for Villeroi ’ s right flank . 
 = = = Offus and Autre @-@ Eglise = = = 
 While the attack on Taviers went in the Earl of Orkney launched his first line of English across the Petite Gheete in a determined attack against the barricaded villages of Offus and Autre @-@ Eglise on the Allied right . Villeroi , posting himself near Offus , watched anxiously the redcoats ' advance , mindful of the counsel he had received on 6 May from Louis XIV – " Have particular care to that part of the line which will endure the first shock of the English troops . " Heeding this advice the French commander began to transfer battalions from his centre to reinforce the left , drawing more foot from the already weakened right to replace them . 
 As the English battalions descended the gentle slope of the Petite Gheete valley , struggling through the boggy stream , they were met by Major General de la Guiche ’ s disciplined Walloon infantry sent forward from around Offus . After concentrated volleys , exacting heavy casualties on the redcoats , the Walloons reformed back to the ridgeline in good order . The English took some time to reform their ranks on the dry ground beyond the stream and press on up the slope towards the cottages and barricades on the ridge . The vigour of the English assault , however , was such that they threatened to break through the line of the villages and out onto the open plateau of Mont St André beyond . This was potentially dangerous for the Allied infantry who would then be at the mercy of the Elector ’ s Bavarian and Walloon squadrons patiently waiting on the plateau for the order to move . 
 Although Henry Lumley ’ s English cavalry had managed to cross the marshy ground around the Petite Gheete , it was soon evident to Marlborough that sufficient cavalry support would not be practicable and that the battle could not be won on the Allied right . The Duke , therefore , called off the attack against Offus and Autre @-@ Eglise . To make sure that Orkney obeyed his order to withdraw , Marlborough sent his Quartermaster @-@ General in person with the command . Despite Orkney ’ s protestations , Cadogan insisted on compliance and , reluctantly , Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille . It is still not clear how far Orkney ’ s advance was planned only as a feint ; according to historian David Chandler it is probably more accurate to surmise that Marlborough launched Orkney in a serious probe with a view to sounding out the possibilities of the sector . Nevertheless , the attack had served its purpose . Villeroi had given his personal attention to that wing and strengthened it with large bodies of horse and foot that ought to have been taking part in the decisive struggle south of Ramillies .

 Meanwhile , the Dutch assault on Ramillies was gaining pace . Marlborough ’ s younger brother , General of Infantry , Charles Churchill , ordered four brigades of foot to attack the village . The assault consisted of 12 battalions of Dutch infantry commanded by Major Generals Schultz and <unk> ; two brigades of Saxons under Count Schulenburg ; a Scottish brigade in Dutch service led by the 2nd Duke of Argyle ; and a small brigade of Protestant Swiss . The 20 French and Bavarian battalions in Ramillies , supported by the Irish dragoons who had left Ireland in the Flight of the Wild Geese to join Clare 's Dragoons and a small brigade of Cologne and Bavarian Guards under the Marquis de Maffei , put up a determined defence , initially driving back the attackers with severe losses as commemorated in the song Clare 's Dragoons : 
 Seeing that Schultz and <unk> were faltering , Marlborough now ordered Orkney ’ s second @-@ line British and Danish battalions ( who had not been used in the assault on Offus and Autre @-@ Eglise ) to move south towards Ramillies . Shielded as they were from observation by a slight fold in the land , their commander , Brigadier @-@ General Van <unk> , ordered the regimental colours to be left in place on the edge of the plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position . Therefore , unbeknown to the French who remained oblivious to the Allies ’ real strength and intentions on the opposite side of the Petite Gheete , Marlborough was throwing his full weight against Ramillies and the open plain to the south . Villeroi meanwhile , was still moving more reserves of infantry in the opposite direction towards his left flank ; crucially , it would be some time before the French commander noticed the subtle change in emphasis of the Allied dispositions . 
 At around 15 : 30 , Overkirk advanced his massed squadrons on the open plain in support of the infantry attack on Ramillies . Overkirk 's squadrons – 48 Dutch , supported on their left by 21 Danish – steadily advanced towards the enemy ( taking care not to prematurely tire the horses ) , before breaking into a trot to gain the impetus for their charge . The Marquis de <unk> writing after the battle described the scene – " They advanced in four lines … As they approached they advanced their second and fourth lines into the intervals of their first and third lines ; so that when they made their advance upon us , they formed only one front , without any intermediate spaces . " 
 The initial clash favoured the Dutch and Danish squadrons . The disparity of numbers – exacerbated by Villeroi stripping their ranks of infantry to reinforce his left flank – enabled Overkirk 's cavalry to throw the first line of French horse back in some disorder towards their second @-@ line squadrons . This line also came under severe pressure and , in turn , was forced back to their third @-@ line of cavalry and the few battalions still remaining on the plain . But these French horsemen were amongst the best in Louis XIV ’ s army – the Maison du Roi , supported by four elite squadrons of Bavarian Cuirassiers . <unk> led by de Guiscard , the French cavalry rallied , thrusting back the Allied squadrons in successful local counterattacks . On Overkirk ’ s right flank , close to Ramillies , ten of his squadrons suddenly broke ranks and were scattered , riding headlong to the rear to recover their order , leaving the left flank of the Allied assault on Ramillies dangerously exposed . Notwithstanding the lack of infantry support , de Guiscard threw his cavalry forward in an attempt to split the Allied army in two . 
 A crisis threatened the centre , but from his vantage point Marlborough was at once aware of the situation . The Allied commander now summoned the cavalry on the right wing to reinforce his centre , leaving only the English squadrons in support of Orkney . Thanks to a combination of battle @-@ smoke and favourable terrain , his redeployment went unnoticed by Villeroi who made no attempt to transfer any of his own 50 unused squadrons . While he waited for the fresh reinforcements to arrive , Marlborough flung himself into the mêlée , rallying some of the Dutch cavalry who were in confusion . But his personal involvement nearly led to his undoing . A number of French horsemen , recognising the Duke , came surging towards his party . Marlborough ’ s horse tumbled and the Duke was thrown – " <unk> Marlborough was rid over , " wrote Orkney some time later . It was a critical moment of the battle . " Major @-@ General Murray , " recalled one eye witness , " … seeing him fall , marched up in all haste with two Swiss battalions to save him and stop the enemy who were hewing all down in their way . " Fortunately Marlborough ’ s newly appointed aide @-@ de @-@ camp , Richard Molesworth , galloped to the rescue , mounted the Duke on his horse and made good their escape , before Murray ’ s disciplined ranks threw back the pursuing French troopers . 
 After a brief pause , Marlborough ’ s equerry , Colonel <unk> ( or <unk> ) , led up another of the Duke ’ s spare horses ; but while assisting him onto his mount , the unfortunate <unk> was hit by an errant cannonball that sheared off his head . One account has it that the cannonball flew between the Captain @-@ General ’ s legs before hitting the unfortunate colonel , whose torso fell at Marlborough ’ s feet – a moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards . Nevertheless , the danger passed , enabling the Duke to attend to the positioning of the cavalry reinforcements feeding down from his right flank – a change of which Villeroi remained blissfully unaware . 
 = = = Breakthrough = = = 
 The time was about 16 : 30 , and the two armies were in close contact across the whole 6 km ( 4 mi ) front , from the skirmishing in the marshes in the south , through the vast cavalry battle on the open plain ; to the fierce struggle for Ramillies at the centre , and to the north , where , around the cottages of Offus and Autre @-@ Eglise , Orkney and de la Guiche faced each other across the Petite Gheete ready to renew hostilities . 
 The arrival of the transferring squadrons now began to tip the balance in favour of the Allies . Tired , and suffering a growing list of casualties , the numerical inferiority of Guiscard ’ s squadrons battling on the plain at last began to tell . After earlier failing to hold or retake Franquenée and Taviers , Guiscard ’ s right flank had become dangerously exposed and a fatal gap had opened on the right of their line . Taking advantage of this breach , Württemberg ’ s Danish cavalry now swept forward , wheeling to penetrate the flank of the Maison du Roi whose attention was almost entirely fixed on holding back the Dutch . Sweeping forwards , virtually without resistance , the 21 Danish squadrons reformed behind the French around the area of the Tomb of <unk> , facing north across the plateau of Mont St André towards the exposed flank of Villeroi ’ s army . 
 The final Allied reinforcements for the cavalry contest to the south were at last in position ; Marlborough ’ s superiority on the left could no longer be denied , and his fast @-@ moving plan took hold of the battlefield . Now , far too late , Villeroi tried to redeploy his 50 unused squadrons , but a desperate attempt to form line facing south , stretching from Offus to Mont St André , floundered amongst the baggage and tents of the French camp carelessly left there after the initial deployment . The Allied commander ordered his cavalry forward against the now heavily outnumbered French and Bavarian horsemen . De Guiscard ’ s right flank , without proper infantry support , could no longer resist the onslaught and , turning their horses northwards , they broke and fled in complete disorder . Even the squadrons currently being scrambled together by Villeroi behind Ramillies could not withstand the onslaught . " We had not got forty yards on our retreat , " remembered Captain Peter Drake , an Irishmen serving with the French – " when the words sauve qui peut went through the great part , if not the whole army , and put all to confusion " 
 In Ramillies the Allied infantry , now reinforced by the English troops brought down from the north , at last broke through . The Régiment de Picardie stood their ground but were caught between Colonel Borthwick ’ s Scots @-@ Dutch regiment and the English reinforcements . Borthwick was killed , as was Charles O ’ Brien , the Irish Viscount Clare in French service , fighting at the head of his regiment . The Marquis de Maffei attempted one last stand with his Bavarian and Cologne Guards , but it proved in vain . Noticing a rush of horsemen fast approaching from the south , he later recalled – " … I went towards the nearest of these squadrons to instruct their officer , but instead of being listened to [ I ] was immediately surrounded and called upon to ask for quarter . " 
 = = = Pursuit = = = 
 The roads leading north and west were choked with fugitives . Orkney now sent his English troops back across the Petite Gheete stream to once again storm Offus where de la Guiche ’ s infantry had begun to drift away in the confusion . To the right of the infantry Lord John Hay ’ s ‘ Scots Greys ’ also picked their way across the stream and charged the Régiment du Roi within Autre @-@ Eglise . " Our dragoons , " wrote John Deane , " pushing into the village … made terrible slaughter of the enemy . " The Bavarian Horse Grenadiers and the Electoral Guards withdrew and formed a shield about Villeroi and the Elector but were scattered by Lumley ’ s cavalry . Stuck in the mass of fugitives fleeing the battlefield , the French and Bavarian commanders narrowly escaped capture by General Cornelius Wood who , unaware of their identity , had to content himself with the seizure of two Bavarian Lieutenant @-@ Generals . Far to the south , the remnants of de la Colonie ’ s brigade headed in the opposite direction towards the French held fortress of Namur . " 
 The retreat became a rout . Individual Allied commanders drove their troops forward in pursuit , allowing their beaten enemy no chance to recover . Soon the Allied infantry could no longer keep up , but their cavalry were off the leash , heading through the gathering night for the crossings on the Dyle river . At last , however , Marlborough called a halt to the pursuit shortly after midnight near <unk> , 19 km ( 12 mi ) from the field . " It was indeed a truly shocking sight to see the miserable remains of this mighty army , " wrote Captain Drake , " … reduced to a handful . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 What was left of Villeroi ’ s army was now broken in spirit ; the imbalance of the casualty figures amply demonstrates the extent of the disaster for Louis XIV ’ s army : ( see below ) . In addition , hundreds of French soldiers were fugitives , many of whom would never <unk> to the colours . Villeroi also lost 52 artillery pieces and his entire engineer pontoon train . In the words of Marshal Villars , the French defeat at Ramillies was – " The most shameful , humiliating and disastrous of routs . " 
 Town after town now succumbed to the Allies . Leuven fell on 25 May 1706 ; three days later , the Allies entered Brussels , the capital of the Spanish Netherlands . Marlborough realised the great opportunity created by the early victory of Ramillies : " We now have the whole summer before us , " wrote the Duke from Brussels to Robert Harley , " and with the blessing of God I shall make the best use of it . " Malines , <unk> , Ghent , <unk> , Damme , Oudenaarde , Bruges , and on 6 June Antwerp , all subsequently fell to Marlborough ’ s victorious army and , like Brussels , proclaimed the Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne , the Archduke Charles , as their sovereign . Villeroi was helpless to arrest the process of collapse . When Louis XIV learnt of the disaster he recalled Marshal Vendôme from northern Italy to take command in Flanders ; but it would be weeks before the command changed hands . 
 As news spread of the Allies ’ triumph , the Prussians , Hessians and Hanoverian contingents , long delayed by their respective rulers , eagerly joined the pursuit of the broken French and Bavarian forces . " This , " wrote Marlborough wearily , " I take to be owing to our late success . " Meanwhile , Overkirk took the port of Ostend on 4 July thus opening a direct route to the English Channel for communication and supply , but the Allies were making scant progress against Dendermonde whose governor , the Marquis de <unk> , was stubbornly resisting . Only later when Cadogan and Churchill went to take charge did the town ’ s defences begin to fail . 
 Vendôme formally took over command in Flanders on 4 August ; Villeroi would never again receive a major command – " I cannot foresee a happy day in my life save only that of my death . " Louis XIV was more forgiving to his old friend – " At our age , Marshal , we must no longer expect good fortune . " In the mean time , Marlborough invested the elaborate fortress of Menin which , after a costly siege , capitulated on 22 August . Dendermonde finally succumbed on 6 September followed by Ath – the last conquest of 1706 – on 2 October . By the time Marlborough had closed down the Ramillies campaign he had denied the French most of the Spanish Netherlands west of the Meuse and north of the Sambre – it was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English Duke but once again it was not decisive as these gains did not defeat France . 
 The immediate question for the Allies now was how to deal with the Spanish Netherlands , a subject which the Austrians and the Dutch were diametrically opposed . Emperor Joseph I , acting on behalf of his younger brother King ’ Charles III ’ , absent in Spain , claimed that reconquered Brabant and Flanders should be put under immediate possession of a governor named by himself . The Dutch , however , who had supplied the major share of the troops and money to secure the victory ( the Austrians had produced nothing of either ) claimed the government of the region till the war was over , and that after the peace they should continue to garrison Barrier Fortresses stronger than those which had fallen so easily to Louis XIV ’ s forces in 1701 . Marlborough mediated between the two parties but favoured the Dutch position . To sway the Duke ’ s opinion , the Emperor offered Marlborough the governorship of the Spanish Netherlands . It was a tempting offer , but in the name of Allied unity , it was one he refused . In the end England and the Dutch Republic took control of the newly won territory for the duration of the war ; after which it was to be handed over to the direct rule of ‘ Charles III ’ , subject to the reservation of a Dutch Barrier , the extent and nature of which had yet to be settled . 
 Meanwhile , on the Upper Rhine , Villars had been forced onto the defensive as battalion after battalion had been sent north to bolster collapsing French forces in Flanders ; there was now no possibility of his undertaking the re @-@ capture of Landau . Further good news for the Allies arrived from northern Italy where , on 7 September , Prince Eugene had routed a French army before the Piedmontese capital , Turin , driving the Franco @-@ Spanish forces from northern Italy . Only from Spain did Louis XIV receive any good news where Das Minas and Galway had been forced to retreat from Madrid towards Valencia , allowing Philip V to re @-@ enter his capital on 4 October . All in all though , the situation had changed considerably and Louis XIV began to look for ways to end what was fast becoming a ruinous war for France . For Queen Anne also , the Ramillies campaign had one overriding significance – " Now we have God be thanked so hopeful a prospect of peace . " Instead of continuing the momentum of victory , however , cracks in Allied unity would enable Louis XIV to reverse some of the major setbacks suffered at Turin and Ramillies . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 The total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely , so complete was the collapse of the Franco @-@ Bavarian army that day . David G. Chandler ’ s Marlborough as Military Commander and A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe are consistent with regards to French casualty figures i.e. , 12 @,@ 000 dead and wounded plus some 7 @,@ 000 taken prisoner . James Falkner , in Ramillies 1706 : Year of Miracles , also notes 12 @,@ 000 dead and wounded and states ‘ up to 10 @,@ 000 ’ taken prisoner . In The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History , Dupuy puts Villeroi ’ s dead and wounded at 8 @,@ 000 , with a further 7 @,@ 000 captured . John Millner ’ s memoirs – <unk> Journal ( 1733 ) – is more specific , recording 12 @,@ 087 of Villeroi ’ s army were killed or wounded , with another 9 @,@ 729 taken prisoner . In Marlborough , however , Correlli Barnett puts the total casualty figure as high as 30 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 dead and wounded with an additional 15 @,@ 000 taken captive . Trevelyan estimates Villeroi ’ s casualties at 13 @,@ 000 , but adds , ‘ his losses by desertion may have doubled that number ’ .

Voltaire , however , in Histoire du siècle du Louis XIV records , ' the French lost there twenty thousand men ' .

 Blunt was awarded an Honorary Doctorate for Music in 2016 by University of Bristol . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Blunt was born at an army hospital in Tidworth , Wiltshire , the first of three children to Colonel Charles Blount and Jane Ann Farran Blount ( née Amos ) . His father was a cavalry officer in the 13th / 18th Royal Hussars and then a helicopter pilot and Colonel of the Army Air Corps . The Blount family has a long history of military service , dating back to King Gorm of Denmark in the 10th century . 
 Blunt grew up primarily in St Mary Bourne in Hampshire , but moved every two years depending on his father 's military postings in : Middle Wallop ; Cyprus ; Soest ( Germany ) ; York ; and Netheravon . He also spent time in Cley next the Sea where his father owned Cley Windmill . 
 Blunt was educated at Elstree School in Woolhampton , Berkshire , and Harrow School , gaining A @-@ levels in Physics , Chemistry and Economics . He went on to study Aerospace Manufacturing Engineering and Sociology at University of Bristol . , graduating with a BSc ( Hons ) in Sociology in 1996 . 
 Like his father , Blunt is a pilot , gaining his fixed winged Private pilot licence aged 16 , and has a keen interest in motorcycles . 
 = = Military service = = 
 Having been sponsored through university on an army bursary , Blunt was committed to serve a minimum of four years in the armed forces . He trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in intake 963 , and was commissioned into the Life Guards , a reconnaissance regiment . He rose to the rank of Captain . 
 The Life Guards , part of the Household Cavalry Regiment , were primarily based in Combermere Barracks . Blunt also trained in British Army Training Unit Suffield in Alberta , Canada , where his regiment was posted for six months in 1998 to act as the opposing army in combat training exercises . 
 In 1999 , Blunt volunteered to join a Blues and Royals squadron deploying with NATO to Kosovo . Initially assigned to carry out reconnaissance of the Republic of Macedonia – Yugoslavia border , Blunt 's troop worked ahead of the front lines locating and targeting Serb forces for the NATO bombing campaign . On 12 June 1999 , Blunt led the 30 @,@ 000 @-@ strong NATO peacekeeping force from the Macedonia border to Pristina International Airport , however a Russian military contingent had moved in and taken control of the airport before his unit 's arrival . American NATO commander Wesley Clark ordered that Blunt 's unit forcibly take the airport from the Russians . However , Blunt refused the order , citing the wider consequences . General Mike Jackson , Blunt 's superior officer , stepped in stating that they were " not going to start the Third World War " . There were less intense moments during Blunt 's Kosovo assignment . Blunt had brought along his guitar , strapped to the outside of his tank , and would sometimes perform for locals and troops . It was while on duty there that he wrote the song " No Bravery " . 
 Blunt extended his military service in November 2000 , and was posted to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment in London , as the Queen 's Guard . During this posting , Blunt was featured on the television programme " Girls on Top " , a series highlighting unusual career choices . He stood guard at the coffin of the Queen Mother during her lying in State and was part of the funeral procession on 9 April 2002 . 
 A keen skier , Blunt captained the Household Cavalry alpine ski team in Verbier , Switzerland , becoming Royal Armoured Corps ski champion in 2000 . Blunt left the army on 1 October 2002 having served six years .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 Blunt had piano and violin lessons as a child , but was introduced to the electric guitar aged 14 at Harrow by a fellow student . His dissertation at Bristol University was titled , The <unk> of Image – Production of a Pop Idol . One of his main references for was Simon Frith , a sociologist and rock critic , and chair of the Mercury Music Prize panel of judges since 1992 , who later did a lecture tour entitled : " The unpopular and unpleasant thoughts inspired by the work of James Blunt " . While still in the army Blunt would write songs during his time off . A backing vocalist and songwriting collaborator suggested he contact Elton John 's manager , Todd Interland , with whom she used to share a house . Interland told HitQuarters that he listened to Blunt 's demo while driving home and , after hearing the track ' Goodbye My Lover ' , pulled over and called the mobile number written on the CD to set up a meeting . 
 Blunt left the British Army in 2002 so that he could pursue his musical career . He started using the stage name " Blunt " in part to make it easier for others to spell ; " Blount " is pronounced the same way , and remains his legal surname . Shortly after leaving the army he was signed to EMI music publishers and to Twenty @-@ First Artists management . A record contract remained elusive , with recording label executives pointing to Blunt 's posh speaking voice as a barrier in class @-@ divided Britain . Linda Perry , who was just launching her own Custard Records label in early 2003 , heard Blunt 's promotional tape when visiting London , and soon after heard him perform live at the South by Southwest Music Festival . She made an offer to him the same night and within a few days Blunt signed a recording contract with Perry . One month later , he travelled to Los Angeles to meet producer Tom Rothrock . 
 = = = Back to Bedlam : 2003 – 2006 = = = 
 Blunt recorded Back to Bedlam in 2003 with producer Tom Rothrock in Conway Recording Studios and Rothrock 's home studio in Los Angeles , playing many instruments himself . During recording , he lodged with actress Carrie Fisher . Fisher contributed in naming the album and Blunt recorded the song " Goodbye My Lover " in her bathroom . Back to Bedlam was released in the UK in October 2004 . 
 Blunt 's debut single in the UK was " High " ( co @-@ written with Ricky Ross of Deacon Blue ) . This song initially peaked below the Top 100 of the UK Singles Chart , however after the subsequent success of " You 're Beautiful " it finally made the Top 75 before being re @-@ released . The song was chosen to appear in a Vodafone commercial in Italy , and was a Top 10 hit in that country . 
 The debut album from the unknown Blunt initially attracted little critical attention , and there were no published reviews from major UK music journals . His live performances , mainly in support of better known musicians , received somewhat mixed but generally favourable reviews . Blunt 's lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon , while his music was likened to that of Damien Rice and David Gray . In March 2004 , with Blunt performing in the support role for Katie Melua in Manchester , Alex McCann of Designer Magazine wrote , " Blunt 's ascendance is a dead cert and this time next year it isn 't that far removed from reality to suggest that a number one album , Brit Award and countless accolade 's [ sic ] will be his for the taking . " After release of the album , concert support slots for Elton John and Lloyd Cole and the <unk> in late 2004 and early 2005 followed , as did a band residency at London club 93 Feet East . In March 2005 , his second single , " Wisemen , " was released . 
 Blunt 's third single , " You 're Beautiful " , was his break @-@ out hit . The song debuted at number 12 in the UK , and rose all the way to number one six weeks later . The song also received huge airplay in the UK , propelling Back to Bedlam to number one on the UK Albums Chart . The extensive airplay ultimately led to Blunt and his co @-@ writers being awarded the Ivor Novello Award for Most Performed Work . After the success of " You 're Beautiful " in the UK , the song crossed over to mainland Europe , becoming one of the biggest hits of summer 2005 across the continent . In the US , " You 're Beautiful " made its debut in the summer of 2005 on <unk> , a prominent radio station in New York City , despite not having been released to radio yet . The song was released to radio stations in the fall of 2005 and climbed into the Top 10 in three radio formats : Adult Contemporary Music , Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks , and Adult album alternative . Blunt became the first British artist to top the American singles chart in nearly a decade when " You 're Beautiful " reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2006 ; the last British artist to do so had been Elton John in 1997 with the song " Candle in the Wind 1997 " . 
 " Goodbye My Lover " was released as the fourth UK single from the album in December 2005 , and the second US single . The songs " High " and " Wisemen " were subsequently re @-@ released in 2006 . Blunt started off 2006 celebrating five Brit Award nominations , going on to win Best British male solo artist and Best pop act categories , having already started an 11 @-@ month world tour . On 31 August , Blunt won two awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards , with " You 're Beautiful " winning the award for Best Male Video . 
 In late 2005 , Blunt made appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show and as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live . Eight of the songs on the album were featured in television shows ( The O.C. , Grey 's Anatomy and many more ) , films ( Undiscovered ) , and advertising campaigns ( Hilton Hotels , Sprint telecommunications ) throughout 2005 and 2006 . Blunt performed " You 're Beautiful " at the 49th Grammy Awards in February 2007 , dedicating the song to the late Ahmet Ertegün of Atlantic Records , but he did not win in any of the five categories for which he had received nominations ( including Best New Artist , won by Carrie Underwood ) . 
 The album eventually sold 11 @.@ 2 million copies and topped the album charts in 16 territories worldwide . It sold 2 @.@ 6 million in the U.S. and was certified 2 × platinum . In Britain the album sold over three million copies , was certified 10 × platinum , and entered the Guinness Book of World Records for the fastest selling album in one year . 
 In 2005 , Blunt performed 90 live shows , mainly across the UK and Europe , and supported Jason Mraz in a North American tour . The " Back to Bedlam World Tour " started off in January 2006 , covering cities in Europe , the UK , Australia , New Zealand , and Japan , as well as three separate headline tours in North America , ending in November of that year . Not including promotional appearances , Blunt performed over 140 live shows in 2006 . 
 The videos for all of Blunt 's singles from Back To Bedlam feature symbolism and dark imagery . In the first video for " High " , he is buried in a desert . In the first video for " Wisemen " , he is kidnapped and taken hostage . In the video for " You 're Beautiful " , he alludes to suicide by jumping off a cliff into the sea . In the " Goodbye My Lover " video , he is the outsider in a love triangle , imagining the couple , a man and woman ( played by Matt Dallas of Kyle XY and Mischa Barton of The O.C. ) together . The re @-@ release video for " High " features Blunt running in a forest . The re @-@ release video for " Wisemen " has Blunt burning identification papers , and then walking through a forest while he is on fire . 
 Blunt appeared on an episode of Sesame Street which aired on 14 November 2007 , singing about triangles to the tune of " You 're Beautiful " . 
 A parody of " You 're Beautiful " titled " You 're Pitiful " was recorded by Weird Al Yankovic . Blunt gave personal permission for this parody to be included on a Weird Al album , but Atlantic Records , Blunt 's label , stepped in to forbid the commercial release of the song . Weird Al has since made the song available as a free MP3 download on his website . In a request by Yankovic to include the song on an upcoming compilation CD , Blunt 's manager replied via email , " Thanks for your email , but both James and I will never approve this parody to be released on any label . " 
 On 28 December 2009 , BBC Radio 1 announced that Back to Bedlam was the biggest selling album of the 2000s decade in the United Kingdom . 
 = = = All the Lost Souls : 2007 – 2008 = = = 
 Blunt 's second studio album , All the Lost Souls , was released on 17 September 2007 in the United Kingdom and one day later in North America . It sold 65 @,@ 000 units in its first week , and was certified gold in the UK after only four days . By the end of January 2008 , the album had sold 600 @,@ 000 copies in the UK , and 4 @.@ 5 million copies internationally . Blunt completed the album 's songs at his home in Ibiza in the winter of 2006 – 2007 . He performed five of the ten album tracks during his 2005 – 2006 tours ; lyrics , melodies , and harmonies were refined for the studio recording , on which his touring band played and Tom Rothrock worked as producer . 
 While Blunt 's first album received little critical attention , critics from every major music publication , and newspapers around the world , weighed in on All the Lost Souls . The album was met with generally mixed to positive reviews , and maintains a 53 / 100 rating at Metacritic . " Eric Danton , of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and The Hartford Courant wrote that the album is " a collection so bland , it makes hardtack seem sumptuous " . However , Kerri Mason of Billboard said Blunt " shows the abandon and confidence of a long @-@ term artist , not just a one @-@ hit wonder " and continued " there is not a misstep throughout " . Equally effusive , Liz Hoggard of The Observer wrote that " it 's impossible to resist Blunt 's troubadour yearning . " 
 The first single from All the Lost Souls , " 1973 " , was inspired by Blunt 's nights out at Pacha , an Ibiza club , which opened in that year . The song became another hit for Blunt reaching number one the Billboard European Hot 100 Singles chart . D.J. Pete Tong remixed " 1973 " and played the track during his set at Pacha over the summer of 2007 . The second single , " Same Mistake " , was released in early December 2007 but did not fare well in the UK charts , peaking at number 57 . It was Number one in Brazil and a hit in many South American countries . The third single from the album was " Carry You Home " , released in March 2008 , peaking at number 20 in the U.K charts and bringing the album back into the Top 10 , six months after its release . The fourth and final single from the original " All The Lost Souls " album was " I Really Want You " . 
 Blunt collaborated twice during this album cycle . In late 2007 , he worked with French rapper <unk> . They released " Je <unk> " , which took elements of Blunt 's song " I 'll Take Everything " , which hit the top three in France . On 14 November 2008 , " Primavera in <unk> " , Laura Pausini 's new album , was released . The title track is a duet with Blunt . The album reached the Number one in Italy . 
 Throughout 2007 and 2008 , Blunt went on his second world tour , including a performance in London 's O2 Arena . On 24 November 2008 , All The Lost Souls was re @-@ released as a deluxe edition , with new album artwork , new single " Love , Love , Love " and the documentary James Blunt : Return to Kosovo .

 Blunt 's third studio album titled Some Kind of Trouble , was released on 8 November 2010 . The album debuted at number four in the UK with over 100 @,@ 000 copies sold in the first week . The album 's first single " Stay the Night " was released on 27 October 2010 . The single did much better in Europe than the UK , sitting at number two on the European Airplay Chart for five consecutive weeks , but only charting at number 37 in the UK top 40 . The second single from the album , " So Far Gone " was released in the UK on 3 January 2011 . The third single from the album , " If Time Is All I Have " was released in the UK on 4 April 2011 . Overall critical reception has been mixed , with Allmusic saying , in a positive review , that " Some Kind of Trouble is a step in the right direction for Blunt , a move toward love songs free of pretension " whilst BBC Music felt " When all 's said , Some Kind of Trouble is not a terrible record by any means , but there 's little sense that Blunt has advanced , and equally little sense that it 'll make any difference to his bottom line . " 
 As of February 2011 , worldwide sales stood at over one million copies .

 Blunt 's fourth album , " Moon Landing " , was released on 18 October 2013 . It featured production from Back to Bedlam producer Tom Rothrock . The lead single , " Bonfire Heart " , debuted at number six before peaking at number two the following week in the UK Singles Chart . The single went to number 1 in Australia , Germany , Switzerland and Austria , and was in top 10 in several other countries . 
 On 16 September 2014 , Blunt confirmed on his official Instagram account that Moon Landing would be re @-@ released on 3 November 2014 . The new version of the album was named Moon Landing - Apollo Edition and contained 19 tracks : 11 from the original disc , plus the three bonus tracks of the deluxe version ( Telephone , Kiss This Love Goodbye and Hollywood ) and five new tracks ( Smoke Signals , When I Find Love Again , Breathe , Trail of Broken Hearts and Working it Out ) . The new track When I Find Love Again was released as a single that same day , after being played on BBC 's Radio 2 for the first time . The official music video for When I Find Love Again was released on 14 October 2014 . The new version of the album also contains a 19 @-@ track live DVD recorded during Blunt 's performance in the 2014 edition of the Paléo Festival . 
 On 3 May 2015 , Blunt was confirmed to be replacing Ronan Keating on the seventh season of The X Factor Australia . He was joined by American rock musician Chris Isaak and returning judges Guy Sebastian and Dannii Minogue .

 The President , Council , and Fellows of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge , commonly known as the Royal Society , is a learned society for science and is possibly the oldest such society still in existence . Founded in November 1660 , it was granted a royal charter by King Charles II as " The Royal Society " . The Society is the United Kingdom 's and Commonwealth of Nations ' Academy of Sciences and fulfills a number of roles ; promoting science and its benefits , recognising excellence in science , supporting outstanding science , providing scientific advice for policy , fostering international and global cooperation , education and public engagement . 
 The society is governed by its Council , which is chaired by the Society 's President , according to a set of statutes and standing orders . The members of Council and the President are elected from and by its Fellows , the basic members of the society , who are themselves elected by existing Fellows . There are currently about 1 @,@ 450 fellows , allowed to use the postnominal title FRS ( Fellow of the Royal Society ) , with up to 52 new fellows appointed each year . There are also royal fellows , honorary fellows and foreign members , the last of which are allowed to use the postnominal title ForMemRS ( Foreign Member of the Royal Society ) . As of 2015 the Royal Society President is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan , who took up the post on November 30 , 2015 . 
 Since 1967 , the society has been based at 6 – 9 Carlton House Terrace , a Grade I listed building in central London which was previously used by the Embassy of Germany , London . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding and early years = = = 
 The Royal Society started from groups of physicians and natural philosophers , meeting at variety of locations , including Gresham College in London . They were influenced by the " new science " , as promoted by Francis Bacon in his New Atlantis , from approximately 1645 onwards . A group known as " The Philosophical Society of Oxford " was run under a set of rules still retained by the Bodleian Library . After the English Restoration , there were regular meetings at Gresham College . It is widely held that these groups were the inspiration for the foundation of the Royal Society . 
 Another view of the founding , held at the time , was that it was due to the influence of French scientists and the Montmor Academy in 1657 , reports of which were sent back to England by English scientists attending . This view was held by Jean @-@ Baptiste du Hamel , Giovanni Domenico Cassini , Bernard le <unk> de Fontenelle and <unk> Thévenot at the time and has some grounding in that Henry Oldenburg , the society 's first secretary , had attended the Montmor Academy meeting . Robert Hooke , however , disputed this , writing that : 
 [ Cassini ] makes , then , Mr Oldenburg to have been the instrument , who inspired the English with a desire to imitate the French , in having Philosophical Clubs , or Meetings ; and that this was the occasion of founding the Royal Society , and making the French the first . I will not say , that Mr Oldenburg did rather inspire the French to follow the English , or , at least , did help them , and hinder us . But ' tis well known who were the principal men that began and promoted that design , both in this city and in Oxford ; and that a long while before Mr Oldenburg came into England . And not only these Philosophic Meetings were before Mr Oldenburg came from Paris ; but the Society itself was begun before he came hither ; and those who then knew Mr Oldenburg , understood well enough how little he himself knew of philosophic matter . 
 On 28 November 1660 , the 1660 committee of 12 announced the formation of a " College for the Promoting of Physico @-@ Mathematical Experimental Learning " , which would meet weekly to discuss science and run experiments . At the second meeting , Sir Robert Moray announced that the King approved of the gatherings , and a royal charter was signed on 15 July 1662 which created the " Royal Society of London " , with Lord <unk> serving as the first president . A second royal charter was signed on 23 April 1663 , with the king noted as the founder and with the name of " the Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge " ; Robert Hooke was appointed as Curator of Experiments in November . This initial royal favour has continued and , since then , every monarch has been the patron of the society . 
 The society 's early meetings included experiments performed first by Hooke and then by Denis Papin , who was appointed in 1684 . These experiments varied in their subject area , and were both important in some cases and trivial in others . The society also published an English translation of Essays of Natural Experiments Made in the Accademia del Cimento , under the Protection of the Most Serene Prince Leopold of Tuscany in 1684 , an Italian book documenting experiments at the Accademia del Cimento . Although meeting at Gresham College , the Society temporarily relocated to Arundel House in 1666 after the Great Fire of London , which did not harm Gresham but did lead to its appropriation by the Lord Mayor . The Society returned to Gresham in 1673 . 
 There had been an attempt in 1667 to establish a permanent " college " for the society . Michael Hunter argues that this was influenced by " Solomon 's House " in Bacon 's New Atlantis and , to a lesser extent , by J. V. Andreae 's <unk> , dedicated research institutes , rather than the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge , since the founders only intended for the society to act as a location for research and discussion . The first proposal was given by John Evelyn to Robert Boyle in a letter dated 3 September 1659 ; he suggested a grander scheme , with apartments for members and a central research institute . Similar schemes were expounded by Bengt <unk> and later Abraham Cowley , who wrote in his Proposition for the Advancement of Experimental Philosophy in 1661 of a " ' Philosophical College " , with houses , a library and a chapel . The society 's ideas were simpler and only included residences for a handful of staff , but Hunter maintains an influence from Cowley and <unk> 's ideas . Henry Oldenburg and Thomas <unk> put forward plans in 1667 and Oldenburg 's co @-@ secretary , John Wilkins , moved in a council meeting on 30 September 1667 to appoint a committee " for raising contributions among the members of the society , in order to build a college " . These plans were progressing by November 1667 , but never came to anything , given the lack of contributions from members and the " unrealised — perhaps unrealistic " — aspirations of the society . 
 = = = 18th century = = = 
 During the 18th century , the gusto that had characterised the early years of the society faded ; with a small number of scientific " greats " compared to other periods , little of note was done . In the second half , it became customary for His Majesty 's Government to refer highly important scientific questions to the council of the society for advice , something that , despite the non @-@ partisan nature of the society , spilled into politics in 1777 over lightning conductors . The pointed lightning conductor had been invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1749 , while Benjamin Wilson invented blunted ones . During the argument that occurred when deciding which to use , opponents of Franklin 's invention accused supporters of being American allies rather than being British , and the debate eventually led to the resignation of the society 's president , Sir John Pringle . During the same time period , it became customary to appoint society fellows to serve on government committees where science was concerned , something that still continues . 
 The 18th century featured remedies to many of the society 's early problems . The number of fellows had increased from 110 to approximately 300 by 1739 , the reputation of the society had increased under the presidency of Sir Isaac Newton from 1703 until his death in 1727 , and editions of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society were appearing regularly . During his time as president , Newton arguably abused his authority ; in a dispute between himself and Gottfried Leibniz over the invention of infinitesimal calculus , he used his position to appoint an " impartial " committee to decide it , eventually publishing a report written by himself in the committee 's name . In 1705 , the society was informed that it could no longer rent Gresham College and began a search for new premises . After unsuccessfully applying to Queen Anne for new premises , and asking the trustees of Cotton House if they could meet there , the council bought two houses in Crane Court , Fleet Street , on 26 October 1710 . This included offices , accommodation and a collection of curiosities . Although the overall fellowship contained few noted scientists , most of the council were highly regarded , and included at various times John Hadley , William Jones and Hans Sloane . Because of the <unk> of fellows in paying their subscriptions , the society ran into financial difficulty during this time ; by 1740 , the society had a deficit of £ 240 . This continued into 1741 , at which point the treasurer began dealing harshly with fellows who had not paid . The business of the society at this time continued to include the demonstration of experiments and the reading of formal and important scientific papers , along with the demonstration of new scientific devices and queries about scientific matters from both Britain and Europe . 
 Some modern research has asserted that the claims of the society 's degradation during the 18th century are false . Richard <unk> writes that " far from having ' fared ingloriously ' , the society experienced a period of significant productivity and growth throughout the eighteenth century " , pointing out that many of the sources critical accounts are based on are in fact written by those with an agenda . While Charles Babbage wrote that the practice of pure mathematics in Britain was weak , laying the blame at the doorstep of the society , the practice of mixed mathematics was strong , and although there were not many eminent members of the society , some did contribute vast amounts – James Bradley , for example , established the nutation of the Earth 's axis with 20 years of detailed , meticulous astronomy . 
 Politically within the society , the mid @-@ 18th century featured a " Whig supremacy " as the so @-@ called " Hardwicke Circle " of Whig @-@ leaning scientists held the society 's main Offices . Named after Lord Hardwicke , the groups members included Daniel Wray and Thomas Birch and was most prominent in the 1750s and 60s . The circle had Birch elected secretary and , following the resignation of Martin Folkes , the circle helped oversee a smooth transition to the presidency of Earl Macclesfield , whom Hardwicke helped elect . Under Macclesfield , the circle reached its " zenith " , with members such as Lord Willoughby and Birch serving as vice @-@ president and secretary respectively . The circle also influenced goings @-@ on in other learned societies , such as the Society of Antiquaries of London . After Macclesfield 's retirement , the circle had Lord Morton elected in 1764 and Sir John Pringle elected in 1772 . By this point , the previous Whig " majority " had been reduced to a " faction " , with Birch and Willoughby no longer involved , and the circle declined in the same time frame as the political party did in British politics under George III , falling apart in the 1780s . 
 In 1780 , the society moved again , this time to Somerset House . The property was offered to the society by His Majesty 's Government and , as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778 , he began planning the move . Somerset House , while larger than Crane Court , was not satisfying to the fellows ; the room to store the library was too small , the accommodation was insufficient and there was not enough room to store the museum at all . As a result , the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms , one of which was used for council meetings . 
 = = = 19th century to the present = = = 
 The early 19th century has been seen as a time of decline for the society ; of 662 fellows in 1830 , only 104 had contributed to the Philosophical Transactions . The same year , Charles Babbage published Reflections on the Decline of Science in England , and on Some of Its Causes , which was deeply critical of the Society . The scientific Fellows of the Society were spurred into action by this , and eventually James South established a Charters Committee " with a view to obtaining a supplementary Charter from the Crown " , aimed primarily at looking at ways to restrict membership . The Committee recommended that the election of Fellows take place on one day every year , that the Fellows be selected on consideration of their scientific achievements and that the number of fellows elected a year be limited to 15 . This limit was increased to 17 in 1930 and 20 in 1937 ; it is currently 52 . This had a number of effects on the Society : first , the Society 's membership became almost entirely scientific , with few political Fellows or patrons . Second , the number of Fellows was significantly reduced — between 1700 and 1850 , the number of Fellows rose from approximately 100 to approximately 750 . From then until 1941 , the total number of Fellows was always between 400 and 500 . 
 The period did lead to some reform of internal Society statutes , such as in 1823 and 1831 . The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report , along with a copy of the total income and expenditure of the Society . These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting , with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing . This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions , where previously the names had only been announced a couple of days before . As with the other reforms , this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates . The Society 's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850 , when a government grant @-@ in @-@ aid of £ 1 @,@ 000 a year was accepted . This was increased to £ 4 @,@ 000 in 1876 , with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds , doling them out to individual scientists . This grant has now grown to over £ 47 million , some £ 37 million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships . 
 By 1852 , the congestion at Somerset House had increased thanks to the growing number of Fellows . Therefore , the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty 's Government to find new facilities , with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies , such as the Linnean and Geological societies , under one roof . In August 1866 , the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there . The Academy moved in 1867 , while other societies joined when their facilities were built . The Royal Society moved there in 1873 , taking up residence in the East Wing . The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary , while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker 's apartment was converted into offices . One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff , which was then approximately eighty . When , for example , the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954 , additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House . 
 On 22 March 1945 , the first female Fellows were elected to the Royal Society . This followed a statutory amendment in 1944 that read " Nothing herein contained shall render women ineligible as candidates " , and was contained in Chapter 1 of Statute 1 . Because of the difficulty of co @-@ ordinating all the Fellows during the Second World War , a ballot on making the change was conducted via the post , with 336 Fellows supporting the change and 37 opposing . Following approval by the Council , Marjory Stephenson , Kathleen Lonsdale and Edith <unk> were elected as Fellows . 
 = = Coat of arms = = 
 The Coat of arms of the Royal Society is " in a dexter corner of a shield argent our three Lions of England , and for crest a helm adorned with a crown studded with florets , surmounted by an eagle of proper colour holding in one foot a shield charged with our lions : supporters two white hounds gorged with crowns " , with the motto of " nullius in verba " . John Evelyn , interested in the early structure of the society , had sketched out at least six possible designs , but in August 1662 Charles II told the society that it was allowed to use the arms of England as part of its coat and the society " now <unk> 'd that the armes of the Society should be , a field Argent , with a canton of the armes of England ; the supporters two <unk> Argent ; Crest , an eagle Or holding a shield with the like armes of England , viz . 3 lions . The words Nullius in verba " . This was approved by Charles , who asked Garter King of Arms to create a diploma for it , and when the second charter was signed on 22 April 1663 the arms were granted to the president , council and fellows of the society along with their successors . 
 The helmet of the arms was not specified in the charter , but the engraver sketched out a peer 's helmet on the final design , which is used . This is contrary to the heraldic rules , as a society or corporation normally has an esquire 's helmet ; it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule , which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615 , or that he used the peer 's helmet as a compliment to Lord <unk> , a peer and the first President of the Royal Society . 
 = = Motto = = 
 The society 's motto , Nullius in verba , is Latin for " Take nobody 's word for it " . It was adopted to signify the fellows ' determination to establish facts via experiments and comes from Horace 's Epistles , where he compares himself to a gladiator who , having retired , is free from control . 
 = = Functions and activities = = 
 The Society has a variety of functions and activities . It supports modern science by disbursing nearly £ 42 million to fund approximately 600 research fellowships for both early and late career scientists , along with innovation , mobility and research capacity grants . Its Awards , prize lectures and medals all come with prize money intended to finance research , and it provides subsidised communications and media skills courses for research scientists . Much of this activity is supported by a grant from the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , most of which is channeled to the University Research Fellowships . In 2008 , the Society opened the Royal Society Enterprise Fund , intended to invest in new scientific companies and be self @-@ sustaining , funded ( after an initial set of donations on the 350th anniversary of the Society ) by the returns from its investments . 
 Through its Science Policy Centre , the Society acts as an advisor to the European Commission and the United Nations on matters of science . It publishes several reports a year , and serves as the Academy of Sciences of the United Kingdom . Since the middle of the 18th century , government problems involving science were irregularly referred to the Society , and by 1800 it was done regularly . 
 = = Publishing = = 
 The society introduced the world 's first journal exclusively devoted to science in 1665 , Philosophical Transactions , and in so doing originated the peer review process now widespread in scientific journals . Its founding editor was Henry Oldenburg , the society 's first secretary . 
 Through Royal Society Publishing , the society publishes the following journals : 
 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A ( mathematics and the physical sciences ) 
 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B ( biological sciences ) 
 Proceedings of the Royal Society A 
 Proceedings of the Royal Society B 
 Biology Letters 
 Open Biology 
 Royal Society Open Science

 Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society 
 Philosophical Transactions is the oldest and longest @-@ running scientific journal in the world , having first been published in March 1665 by the first secretary of the society , Henry Oldenburg . It now publishes themed issues on specific topics and is currently divided into two parts ; A , which deals with mathematics and the physical sciences , and B , which deals with the biological sciences . Proceedings of the Royal Society consists of freely submitted research articles and is similarly divided into two parts . Biology Letters publishes short research articles and opinion pieces on all areas of biology and was launched in 2005 . Journal of the Royal Society Interface publishes cross @-@ disciplinary research at the boundary between the physical and life sciences , while Interface Focus , publishes themed issue in the same areas . Notes and Records is the Society 's journal on the history of science . Biographical Memoirs is published annually and contains extended obituaries of deceased Fellows . Open Biology is an open access journal covering biology at the molecular and cellular level . Royal Society Open Science is an open access journal publishing high @-@ quality original research across the entire range of science on the basis of objective peer @-@ review . All the society 's journals are peer @-@ reviewed . 
 = = Structure and governance = = 
 The society is governed by its council , which is chaired by the society 's president , according to a set of statutes and standing orders . The members of council , the president and the other officers are elected from and by its fellowship . 
 = = = Fellows = = = 
 The society 's core members are the fellows : scientists and engineers from the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth selected based on having made " a substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge , including mathematics , engineering science and medical science " . Fellows are elected for life and gain the right to use the postnominal Fellow of the Royal Society ( FRS ) . The rights and responsibilities of fellows also include a duty to financially contribute to the society , the right to stand for council posts and the right to elect new fellows . Up to 52 fellows are elected each year and in 2014 there were about 1 @,@ 450 living members in total . Election to the fellowship is decided by ten sectional committees ( each covering a subject area or set of subjects areas ) which consist of existing fellows . 
 The society also elects royal fellows , honorary fellows and foreign members . Royal fellows are those members of the British Royal Family , representing the British monarchy 's role in promoting and supporting the society , who are recommended by the society 's council and elected via postal vote . There are currently five royal fellows : The Duke of Edinburgh , The Prince of Wales , The Duke of Kent , the Princess Royal , and The Duke of Cambridge . Honorary fellows are people who are ineligible to be elected as fellows but nevertheless have " rendered signal service to the cause of science , or whose election would significantly benefit the Society by their great experience in other walks of life " . Six honorary fellows have been elected to date , including Baroness O 'Neill of <unk> . Foreign members are scientists from non @-@ Commonwealth nations " who are eminent for their scientific discoveries and attainments " . Eight are elected each year by the society and also hold their membership for life . Foreign members are permitted to use the post @-@ nominal ForMemRS ( Foreign Member of the Royal Society ) and currently number about 140 . 
 The appointment of fellows was first authorised in the second charter , issued on 22 April 1663 , which allowed the president and council , in the two months following the signing , to appoint as fellows any individuals they saw fit . This saw the appointment of 94 fellows on 20 May and 4 on 22 June ; these 98 are known as the " Original Fellows " . After the expiration of this two @-@ month period any appointments were to be made by the president , council and existing fellows . Many early fellows were not scientists or particularly eminent intellectuals ; it was clear that the early society could not rely on financial assistance from the king , and scientifically trained fellows were few and far between . It was therefore necessary to secure the favour of wealthy or important individuals for the society 's survival . While the entrance fee of £ 4 and the subscription rate of one shilling a week should have produced £ 600 a year for the society , many fellows paid neither regularly nor on time . Two @-@ thirds of the fellows in 1663 were non @-@ scientists ; this rose to 71 @.@ 6 % in 1800 before dropping to 47 @.@ 4 % in 1860 as the financial security of the society became more certain . In May 1846 , a committee recommended limiting the annual intake of members to 15 and insisting on scientific eminence ; this was implemented , with the result being that the society now consists exclusively of scientific fellows . 
 = = = Council = = = 
 The council is a body of 21 fellows , including the officers ( the president , the treasurer , two secretaries — one from the physical sciences , one from life sciences — and the foreign secretary ) , one fellow to represent each sectional committee and seven other fellows . The council is tasked with directing the society 's overall policy , managing all business related to the society , amending , making or repealing the society 's standing orders and acting as trustees for the society 's possessions and estates . Members are elected annually via a postal ballot , and current standing orders mean that at least ten seats must change hands each year . The council may establish ( and is assisted by ) a variety of committees , which can include not only fellows but also outside scientists . Under the charter , the president , two secretaries and the treasurer are collectively the officers of the society . The current officers are : 
 President : Venkatraman Ramakrishnan 
 Treasurer : Anthony Cheetham 
 Biological Secretary : Sir John <unk> 
 Physical Secretary : Alex Halliday 
 Foreign Secretary : Sir Martyn Poliakoff . 
 = = = President = = = 
 The President of the Royal Society is head of both the society and the council . The details for the presidency were set out in the second charter and initially had no limit on how long a president could serve for ; under current society statute , the term is five years . 
 The current president is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan , who took over from Paul Nurse on 30 November 2015 . Historically , the duties of the president have been both formal and social . The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 left the president as one of the few individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal was justified . In addition , the president is to act as the government 's chief ( albeit informal ) advisor on scientific matters . Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists . 
 = = = Permanent staff = = = 
 The society is assisted by a number of full @-@ time paid staff . The original charter provided for " two or more Operators of Experiments , and two or more clerks " ; as the number of books in the society 's collection grew , it also became necessary to employ a curator . The staff grew as the financial position of the society improved , mainly consisting of outsiders , along with a small number of scientists who were required to resign their fellowship on employment . The current senior members of staff are : 
 Executive Director : Julie Maxton 
 Director of Science Policy : Claire Craig

 The premises at 6 – 9 Carlton House Terrace is a Grade I listed building and the current headquarters of the Royal Society , which had moved there from Burlington House in 1967 . The ground floor and basement are used for ceremonies , social and publicity events , the first floor hosts facilities for Fellows and Officers of the Society , and the second and third floors are divided between offices and accommodation for the President , Executive Secretary and Fellows . The first Carlton House was named after Baron Carleton , and was sold to Lord Chesterfield in 1732 , who held it on trust for Frederick , Prince of Wales . Frederick held his court there until his death in 1751 , after which it was occupied by his widow until her death in 1772 . In 1783 , the then @-@ Prince of Wales George bought the house , instructing his architect Henry Holland to completely remodel it . When George became King , he authorised the demolition of Carlton House , with the request that the replacement be a residential area . John Nash eventually completed a design that saw Carlton House turned into two blocks of houses , with a space in between them . The building is still owned by the Crown Estates and leased by the Society ; it underwent a major renovation from 2001 to 2004 at the cost of £ 9 @.@ 8 million , and was re @-@ opened by the Prince of Wales on 7 July 2004 . 
 Carlton House Terrace underwent a series of renovations between 1999 and November 2003 to improve and standardise the property . New waiting , exhibition and reception rooms were created in the house at No.7 , using the Magna <unk> marble found in No.8 , and greenish grey <unk> <unk> marble was used in other areas to standardise the design . An effort was also made to make the layout of the buildings easier , consolidating all the offices on one floor , Fellows ' Rooms on another and all the accommodation on a third .

 In 2009 <unk> Hall , a Grade I listed building located near Milton Keynes , was bought by the Royal Society for £ 6 @.@ 5 million , funded in part by the Kavli Foundation . The Royal Society spent several million on renovations adapting it to become the Kavli Royal Society International Centre , a venue for residential science seminars . The centre held its first scientific meeting on 1 June 2010 and was formally opened on 21 June 2010 . 
 = = Honours = = 
 The Royal Society presents numerous awards , lectures and medals to recognise scientific achievement . The oldest is the Croonian Lecture , created in 1701 at the request of the widow of William <unk> , one of the founding members of the Royal Society . The Croonian Lecture is still awarded on an annual basis , and is considered the most important Royal Society prize for the biological sciences . Although the Croonian Lecture was created in 1701 , it was first awarded in 1738 , seven years after the Copley Medal . The Copley Medal is the oldest Royal Society medal still in use and is awarded for " outstanding achievements in research in any branch of science " .

 = Harrisburg , Illinois = 
 Harrisburg ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) is a city in and the county seat of Saline County , Illinois , United States . It is located about 57 miles ( 92 km ) southwest of Evansville , Indiana and 111 miles ( 179 km ) southeast of St. Louis , Missouri . The 2010 population was 9 @,@ 017 , and the surrounding Harrisburg Township had a population of 10 @,@ 790 , including the city residents . Harrisburg is included in the Illinois @-@ Indiana @-@ Kentucky Tri @-@ State Area and is the principal city in the Harrisburg Micropolitan Statistical Area with a combined population of 24 @,@ 913 . 
 Located at the concurrency of U.S. Route 45 , Illinois Route 13 , Illinois Route 145 , and Illinois Route 34 , Harrisburg is known as the " Gateway to the Shawnee National Forest " , and is also known for the Ohio River flood of 1937 , the old Crenshaw House ( also known as the Old Slave House ) , the Tuttle Bottoms Monster , prohibition @-@ era gangster Charlie Birger , and the 2012 EF4 tornado . A Cairo and Vincennes Railroad boomtown , the city was one of the leading bituminous coal mining distribution hubs of the American Midwest between 1900 and 1937 . 
 At its peak , Harrisburg had a population that reached 16 @,@ 000 by the early 1930s . The city had one of the largest downtown districts in Southern Illinois . The city was the 20th @-@ most populated city in Illinois outside of the Chicago Metropolitan Area and the most @-@ populous city in Southern Illinois outside of the Metro East in 1930 . However , the city has seen an economic decline due to the decreased demand for high @-@ sulfur coal , the removal of the New York Central railroad , and tributary lowlands leaving much area around the city unfit for growth due to flood risks .

 = = = Pioneer and native coexistence = = = 
 At the beginning of recorded American history , the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes , including the Shawnee and Piankashaw , who lived in the dense inland forests . Prior to the arrival of white settlers , the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee . European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750 , mainly along the Mississippi River . English speaking settlers arrived in 1790 . The French came as merchants and missionaries , with farming supplementing the need for trade . The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans . The American migration , however , followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through English Law , ignoring previous indigenous rights . Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes . Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist , though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful . 
 The town of Harrisburg was platted a few miles south of the junction of the Goshen and <unk> – Kaskaskia Trail , two of the first pioneer trade routes in the state . Prior to the War of 1812 , most of the population of today 's Saline County lived in cabins clustered around blockhouses to protect against Indian attack and dangerous wildlife such as wild cats and bears . Permanent settlements in the forested area were inevitable with the influx of more settlers , and the first land entry was made in 1814 by John Wren and Hankerson Rude . By 1840 the settlers outnumbered the Native Americans , and most of the black bear population of the county had been killed off by 1845 .

 Founded at the start of the Second Industrial Revolution , Harrisburg was plotted shortly after Saline County was established in 1847 from part of Gallatin County . The city was named for James Alexander Harris , who had built a farmhouse and planted a corn field in a clearing in the area of the current city square around 1820 . 
 Harris along with John Pankey , James P. Yandell , and John X. Cain , donated land for the first additions of the town to a special committee at Liberty Baptist Church in 1852 , after complaints that the county seat should be centralized in the county . The county seat then was in Raleigh . The county 's two main population centers were divided by the Saline River and 14 miles ( 23 km ) of thicket . There were no roads in the county and many residents from the areas of Carrier Mills and <unk> became lost when traveling to the northern settlements of Raleigh , Galatia , and Eldorado . The designated town plat was considered due to its aesthetic properties , a 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) sandstone bluff overlooking the Saline River valley called " Crusoe 's Island " . Although it was heavily timbered with oak and hickory with an impenetrable hazel underbrush , the site was at the geographical center of the county . A major legal battle took place within the county government because of voter fraud accusations by the people of Raleigh . Nevertheless , Harrisburg was plotted as a village on 20 acres ( 80 @,@ 940 m2 ) in 1853 and became the county seat in 1859 . 
 = = = Industrial origins = = = 
 Between 1860 and 1865 southern cotton became unavailable during the Civil War , Harrisburg was one of the few cities in the Upland South during this time to have woolen mills , making the town an industrial asset early on to Southern Illinois . Several planing mills and flour mills also dotted the city . The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was completed in 1872 by Ambrose Burnside , and American Civil War , Union Army , brigadier general Green Berry Raum , who was living in Harrisburg at that time . 
 Robert King , an early proprietor , opened a brick and tile factory at the southern terminus of Main Street in 1896 with the capacity of carrying out 15 @,@ 000 bricks every 10 hours . Harrisburg also saw the opening of several saw mills . The <unk> and Company Saw Mill and Lumber Yard opened in 1895 , as well did J.B Ford Harrisburg <unk> Mill the same year . The mill had the capacity of producing 10 @,@ 000 board feet ( 23 @.@ 6 m3 ) of lumber every 10 hours . The Barnes Lumber Company in Harrisburg started as a sawmill operation in 1899 . Since 1904 it has retailed a complete line of lumber and building materials and is the oldest , currently active mill in the city . 
 The Woolcott Milling Company , operated by <unk> Woolcott and <unk> Wilson built a flour mill in 1874 , on the now defunct south Woolcott Street , with rail spur , behind the current Parker Plaza , that had 23 grain elevators and the capacity of carrying out 200 barrels of flour in a 24 @-@ hour period and up to 400 by 1907 , with a new 75 @,@ 000 @-@ US @-@ bushel ( 2 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 L ) tower . The exchange market was located in Carrier Mills . Located on Commercial Street across the tracks from the train depot , The Southern Illinois Milling & Elevator Company was incorporated on July 29 , 1891 by Philip H. <unk> , with a capital stock of $ 50 @,@ 000 . The company had two elevators , erected at a cost of $ 125 @,@ 000 , one of which had a capacity of 25 @,@ 000 US bushels ( 881 @,@ 000 L ) and the other a capacity of 100 @,@ 000 bushels . Their milling capacity was six hundred barrels per day . Twenty @-@ five men were employed in the operations of the mill and elevators , in addition to a force of from six to eight men regularly employed in the cooperage department . 
 During the Reconstruction Era , when economic conditions made impractical the growing of cotton , lumbering and tobacco growing ( which pioneers found profitable commercially ) , grain farming by crop rotation , dairying , reforestation , merchandising and manufacturing , and Coal mining especially , began to occupy the city . In 1889 , with a population of 1 @,@ 500 , Harrisburg became a city , with an aldermanic form of government . It adopted the commission form in 1915 . Despite these early industrial advantages over other cities in the region , the Sanborn Map company still referred to the water facilities and road conditions within the city limits , " Not good , and not paved " up to 1900 . 
 = = = Coal and rail era = = = 
 First slope mine operations began in 1854 southeast of Harrisburg . During the early years , the coal was transported by wagon to local homes and businesses for heating . Coal Mining became an important industry for the post @-@ Antebellum , now Gilded Age city . The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was completed in 1872 and provided transportation for coal and the miners who tired away underground . After a series of corporate transactions brought the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad into the hands of the Cleveland , Cincinnati , Chicago & St. Louis Railway around 1890 , with Illinois state representative Charles P Skaggs as mayor , Harrisburg evolved into one of the leading coal @-@ mining centers of the Midwest . Harrisburg was a strategic spot on the railroad route with a large hump yard , making it the focal point for the most productive coal field operations . Some of the most profitable coal companies that operated around Harrisburg were Big Creek Coal , Harrisburg Coal and O 'Gara Coal . Each one with their own sizable rail yards . O 'gara was a Progressive Era coal company owned by Thomas J. O 'gara of Chicago . He purchased and annexed 23 privately owned mines in the Harrisburg coal field which equaled 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 200 km2 ) of land . The Company based its headquarters in Harrisburg in 1905 . O 'gara only owned 12 operating mines , all in Saline County , but they had an annual output of 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 tons . 6 @,@ 000 men were employed in a field capacity and the pay roll disbursement was $ 150 @,@ 000 per month . The company paid $ 10 @,@ 000 monthly royalty . H. Thomas was the company 's general manager of mines , Ed Ghent its chief engineer and D. B. McGehee the assistant general manager . 
 By 1905 , several small slope mines and 15 shaft mines operated in the county . Most were along the railroad line . Large numbers of immigrants from England , Wales , and eastern Europe , looking for work , detrained at the Harrisburg Train Depot ; crowding around quickly expanding mining villages directly outside of the city , such as Muddy , Wasson , <unk> and Ledford . The city 's population quickly expanded from 5 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 in a few years . By 1906 , the Big four / CCC & STL Railroad became the New York Central , and Saline County was producing more than 500 @,@ 000 tons of coal annually with more than 5000 miners at work . In 1915 the Ringling Brothers Circus made an appearance in Harrisburg . In 1913 the Southern Illinois Railway and Power Company operated an interurban trolley line , that ran from downtown Eldorado , into Muddy , Wasson , Beulah Heights , through downtown Harrisburg , Dorrisville , Ledford and into downtown Carrier Mills , all of which had larger residential areas than present . In 1917 there were plans to extend the line westward to Marion and Carbondale to connect to the Coal Belt Co. line , and then run it towards St. Louis . The trolley wire through the county was 16 feet ( 5 m ) high . It was an off branch of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad . The corporation erected the first electrical generating plant in Muddy , Illinois . 
 The Central Illinois Public Service Company purchased the Muddy Power Station in 1916 . It had a generating capacity of 7 @,@ 500 kilowatts . After removing an original 2 @,@ 500 @-@ kilowatt unit , the company added two 5 @,@ 000 @-@ kilowatt turbine @-@ generators and one 10 @,@ 000 kilowatt unit , bringing the stations total capacity to 25 @,@ 000 kilowatts in 1922 . Electricity generated at the station was distributed over 66 @-@ <unk> , double circuit steel tower transmission lines extending to West Frankfort to the west , the Ohio River to the east , and Olney to the north . The plant had two impounding reservoirs which covered 80 acres ( 320 @,@ 000 m2 ) and held 320 million gallons of water . 
 The community benefited from the prosperity of the Roaring Twenties , flaunting the most extravagant displays of wealth in the city 's history . The 230 @-@ foot ( 70 m ) neon red tower belonging to the <unk> @-@ A.M. radio station was the tallest structure in the city and could be seen for miles . Harrisburg had just finished the new three @-@ story Horning Hotel around 1920 , and two new theaters with a combined total of 1 @,@ 600 seats : the Orpheum and the Grand the same year . The eight @-@ story Harrisburg National Bank building , the O 'Gara Coal Headquarters , the Cummins Office building , and the four @-@ story Harrisburg Hospital were all built in 1923 . A new four @-@ story city hall building was constructed in 1927 , and a complex highway system was constructed through the city , with Illinois Route 13 and Illinois Route 34 constructed in 1918 ; U.S. Route 45 and Illinois Route 145 constructed in 1925 – 1926 . During this time the city expanded to 15 @,@ 000 people . The annexation of Dorrisville and Dorris Heights created blue collar , multiple , and single family homes filling in between . On Vine Street south of the town square was " <unk> Chute " , a saloon vice district for local miners . It was also during this time that the town was home to prohibition @-@ era bootlegger Charles Birger , whose gang was said to have protected local business owners better than the law enforcement . For a time , the gangster 's prized Tommy gun was displayed in a glass case in the City Hall . The geography around Harrisburg changed indefinitely , with coal areas producing a surface mining landscape the size of San Jose , California , roughly 172 sq mi ( 450 km2 ) , aptly named The Harrisburg Coal Field . The field completely encased the towns of Carrier Mills and Harrisburg , while creating partial borders to <unk> , Galatia , and Raleigh . Near the mines were gob piles that spontaneously combusted . The horizon around the city for many years flickered with burning coal refuse .

 Harrisburg reached its peak population of 15 @,@ 659 in 1930 , making it the 20th most populated city outside of the Chicago Metropolitan Area , in Illinois , and the most populous city in Southern Illinois outside of the metro @-@ east . If the city combined the service communities bordering Harrisburg such as Ledford and Muddy , the population would have been even greater at 26 @,@ 000 , and Saline county as a whole reached nearly 40 @,@ 000 people . Even with the economic downturn during the Great depression , with business owners and industrial firms closing shop , the city continued to thrive due to its enormous coal industry . On June 17 , 1936 , Eleanor Roosevelt visited Harrisburg to observe work of the WPA and delivered a speech in the packed High School gymnasium . The heyday ended quickly when the Ohio River flood of 1937 left 4 @,@ 000 within the city homeless and 80 % of the city inundated . Many flooded mines were deemed condemned which left the local economy crippled . In 1938 , the state of Illinois had completed one of the largest operations of its kind ever attempted in the United States , the removal of more than two and a half billion gallons of flood water from Sahara mine No. 3 . 
 Soon the Southern Illinois Railway and Power company was bought by the Central Illinois Public Service Company . The inter @-@ urban line was abandoned in 1933 after 20 years of service . After the decommission of the Interurban line , Harrisburg opened the Harrisburg @-@ Dorrisville Bus Co . , which was a private predecessor bus company to the current Rides Mass Transit District which was opened in 1980 . Between 1930 and 1940 the city lost 27 % of its overall population . 
 Immediately after World War II new coal companies , Peabody , Bluebird , and Sahara starting mining within the city . The war created a great demand for energy , which was satisfied by expanded strip mining operations throughout the Harrisburg Coal Fields . Shortly after World War II , it became clear that coal was losing favor to other energy sources such as oil and natural gas . In contrast to other cities in the United States that prospered in the post @-@ war boom , the fortunes of Saline County began to quickly diminish . Harry Truman stopped briefly in Harrisburg during his <unk> tour in September 30 , 1948 , giving some hope for economic recovery for the region . Without hesitating , the long parade of police , buses , and accompanying cars sped through town . Poplar street , at that time the main drag through town , was crowded with multitudes of persons for its entire length . It was reported by the Daily Register Newspaper that cars were lined along Route 13 all the way from Marion and on to Eldorado on Route 45 . In 1950 Assistant State Attorney General of Illinois , George N. Leighton , Represented parents in a proceeding which desegregated the public schools of Harrisburg . On December 1 , 1953 , WSIL @-@ TV 3 was founded and based out of the city . The station built the 503 ft ( <unk> ) , WSIL tower in downtown which was one of the tallest television towers in the state at the time and is still the tallest structure in the city . 
 By 1957 , the Egyptian was the last passenger train to travel through the city . Between 1940 and 1960 Harrisburg lost another 20 % of its population due to economic standstill . With only 9100 people left in the city that once had 16 @,@ 000 , then Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign stop on October 3 , 1960 . Speaking at the Saline County Court House he said 
 " This district , which is built on the land and which has been nourished by the land , personifies the kind of problems which I think the United States is going to face in the 1960s . This district has depended in the main for its resources , its growth , its wealth , upon the minerals underground and upon the food that is grown on the ground . And those are those industries that have faced serious problems in the 1960s . " 
 Later during the same speech after addressing agriculture Senator Kennedy stated 
 " Farmers could farm and work in the cities and towns , but this year we have the highest unemployment that we have had in any months of August and September , the three Augusts and <unk> preceding the recession of 1949 , 1954 , and 1958 , and this district knows this problem well , because this district has lost 60 @,@ 000 people in the last 10 years . " 
 By 1968 with hopes of bringing a new influx of coal mining into the city , Sahara Coal Company ordered the Bucyrus @-@ Eerie " GEM of Egypt " strip mine shovel , one of the largest in the world at 8 @-@ stories high and weighing 1 @,@ 000 tons . It took three men to operate it , and its bucket capacity was 30 cubic yards . Even with such great efforts coal mining continued to dwindle within the community . The train depot was razed in 1972 and all coal freight was ordered out of the Harrisburg Hump Yard by 1973 . During the 1970s and 1980s , many of the city @-@ square storefronts and mini @-@ plazas became vacant and were slowly abandoned as large Chain stores and Strip malls on Commercial Street became the dominant venues for shopping and entertainment , hoping to bring an influx of travelers from the main highway . 
 The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 legislation forced many utility companies in the United States to switch to low @-@ sulfur coal . In response Harrisburg 's already waning economy took a severe downturn . The freight yard closed in 1982 , Sahara Coal company shut down operations in 1993 , 865 jobs were lost in the county that year . This ended the reign of big coal in Harrisburg , a way of life for residents for over 100 years . The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad / Cleveland , Cincinnati , Chicago and St. Louis Railway system tracks were taken up in the late 1980s and replaced by the Tunnel Hill State Trail in 1996 .

 In 1984 , a respected local physician , John Dale <unk> , was charged with the murder of his two sons for insurance money . The case was chronicled in the book by Darcy O 'Brien , Murder in Little Egypt . Soon Pioneer history was showcased at the Saline County Area Historical Museum on the city 's southern edge . The 3 @-@ acre ( 12 @,@ 000 m2 ) site includes the three @-@ story high Old Pauper Home , which was once part of the county 's 170 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 69 km2 ) poor farm , built in 1877 . The site also features a variety of cabins , a one @-@ room school house , a small church and other historic buildings that have been acquired , moved to the site and restored . 
 The Harrisburg @-@ Raleigh Airport is located approximately four miles north of Harrisburg on Highway 34 . The Harrisburg @-@ Raleigh Airport Authority operates the airport . The Airport has two runways – 32 / 14 and 6 / 24 . Runway 24 includes a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 300 m ) extension , bringing the runway to 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) with a GPS @-@ <unk> approach . 
 Two industrial zones were set up within the township in 1974 by the Saline County Industrial Development Co . , one located in Dorrisville , and the other located near the Harrisburg @-@ Raleigh Airport . The one in Dorrisville had the advantage of rail spur prior to the removal of the New York Central tracks . A Tax Increment Finance district was built on the property of the old rail yard north of the city where the Harrisburg Professional Park was built . 
 The 2000s saw a slight economic boom to the city . The industrial base within the city , while most were not coal related , gave opportunity to a number of city residents . American Coal and <unk> , the only two coal mines in the county were producing low sulfur coal as an energy resource . Kerr @-@ McGee Coal Corporation 's Galatia Complex was purchased by the American Coal Company in 1998 . American Coal employed about 580 workers , while <unk> employed 175 persons . Nationwide Glove Factory employed 225 persons , and American Needle was the second @-@ largest non coal company with 125 workers . Southern Truss and Harrisburg Truss companies employed together 100 employees manufacturing building components . In 2008 construction on the Harrisburg Wal @-@ Mart Supercenter was completed . Wal @-@ Mart will give $ 21 @,@ 950 in grants to the Anna Bixby Women 's Center , Bridge Medical Clinic , CASA of Saline County , Harrisburg District Library , Harrisburg Police Department , Harvest Deliverance Center Food Pantry , Regional Superintendent of Schools , Saline County Senior Citizens Council and Saline County Sheriff 's Department . The building is 184 @,@ 000 square feet ( 17 @,@ 100 m2 ) and added 150 new jobs to the county . The Supercenter became the second @-@ largest employer in the city , with 340 employees on its payroll . A new strip mall was completed on the south side of town , and Parker Plaza , the oldest shopping center in town was renovated with a new facade to promote commercial growth in the city . 
 Things slowly took a turn for the worse when former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich 's decision to move a division of I @-@ DOT to Southern Illinois was overturned by his successor Pat Quinn . The decision outraged lawmakers in Springfield . A lawsuit was filed to stop the move to Harrisburg . Matters were exacerbated when videos of the new home for the IDOT traffic safety division being surrounded by water surfaced on YouTube in late 2007 . 
 The early 2010s saw a series of unfortunate economic events for the city . In December 2010 , Harrisburg 's AMC , formerly <unk> ' Cinema 4 theater , closed . This was the first time Harrisburg had been without a cinema since 1920 . After release of the 2010 census , in February 2011 , the city learned that its population had dropped to a low of 9 @,@ 017 people , an 8 @.@ 5 percent decrease . It was the lowest population since the pre @-@ coal boom of 1900 . Harrisburg also suffered from numerous scandals involving the school district and police department . In 2011 , the Chief Deputy of the Saline County Sheriffs Department was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing a high school student who was working as an intern . The biggest hit was in late February 2012 , an EF4 tornado hit Harrisburg during the 2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak . The southern part of the city was heavily damaged , with houses and businesses destroyed , many of which were completely leveled . Eight people were killed and 110 were injured by that tornado . In November 2012 a decision was made to close Willow Lake Mine , one of the last remaining mines in Saline County , putting 400 employees out of work . 
 In 2016 , after the 2015 election of Mayor Dale Fowler , Harrisburg opened a brand new theater on the north side of town , and unveiled park plaza , gateway for southeastern Illinois entertainment and culture downtown . The initiative was to bring more people downtown . Mayer Fowler wanted to start promoting Harrisburg as the destination capital of southeastern Illinois . A new movie theater and a family entertainment outlet , Z @-@ Factor , also opened , Fowler said he was preparing new announcements including the opening of new restaurants on top of other established draws including a state @-@ of @-@ art gun range . 
 Harrisburg continues to be the retail hub of Saline County . It holds the nearest shopping centers , restaurants , churches , gas stations , banks , and other commerce within miles . However , industrial jobs are scarce .

The square in the center of town , as well as Dorrisville and Gaskins City , stand on top of a series of sandstone bluffs that were once islands rising above natural lowlands , 338 feet ( 103 m ) above sea level , dredged by the middle fork of the Saline River . The Saline River was a navigable river used by early settlers for transportation to and from Salt Works just east of Harrisburg . The Saline flowed towards the Ohio and flooded every spring in events called <unk> . The locals called the island " Crusoe 's Island " . When the area was drained , homes and businesses were built in the floodplain , and it became prone to serious flooding for years to come . The town square in the center of town is a sandstone bluff 410 feet ( 125 m ) above sea level , one of the first that start the Shawnee Hills to the south . Topographic maps show the bluffs that rise from the Saline River that wraps the northeast part of the city . Harrisburg is located at the ending point of the Laurentide ice sheet , which covered about 85 percent of Illinois .

 After the 5 @.@ 5 Richter Scale magnitude 1968 Illinois earthquake , scientists realized that there was a previously unknown fault under Saline County , just north of Eldorado , Illinois near Harrisburg . This fault is called the Cottage Grove Fault , a small tear in the Earth 's rock running west – east , in the Southern Illinois Basin . The fault is connected to the north – south trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end . <unk> mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines , anticlines , and synclines are present within the region ; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era coincident to strike @-@ slip faulting nearby . 
 A focal mechanism solution of the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north @-@ south and dipping approximately 45 degrees to the east and to the west . This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion , and to a horizontal east @-@ west axis of confining stress . The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault , responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812 , consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States . 
 = = = Cityscape = = = 
 During the early 20th century , urbanization of the city due to the geographical feature of " <unk> 's Island " and surrounding coal mining property created a density not seen in many cities of its size . The city at the time with a population nearing 10 @,@ 000 was forced to tightly cram homes and businesses upon the sandstone outcropping less than a square mile in diameter leading many to build their buildings with multiple stories around the town square . The Saline County courthouse and square have gone through many transformations within the past 100 years . In the 19th century , the town had dirt streets with a large Greek Revival courthouse with Doric columns built by Swiss @-@ born , Evansville , Indiana Architect J. K. Frick & Co in 1861 . The courthouse was then replaced in 1906 with a larger building designed by then well @-@ known architect John W. Gaddis of Vincennes , Indiana . The structure was an identical model to the Perry County Courthouse at Perryville , Missouri , both built the same year . A smaller version of the central clock tower of the courthouse , including the original clock , manufactured by the Howard Clock Company , of Boston Massachusetts in 1904 was recreated in 1996 , and placed in a small lot behind the <unk> Building 's parking lot . The Howard clock company was notable for manufacturing large clocks in such buildings as the Wrigley Building in Chicago , and the Ferry Building in San Francisco , California . The town square was completely surrounded by brick streets in 1906 . Harrisburg had 25 miles ( 40 km ) of brick streets , but now only a few blocks are left . 
 Harrisburg has not yet begun a National Trust for Historic Preservation , Main Street historical preservation program . Saline County is within a recognized historical district , the " Ohio River Route Where Illinois Began " . Two buildings in Harrisburg are currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places , those being the City Hall and the Saline County Poor Farm . 
 The square itself held an array of coal mining offices , privately owned business , grocery and department stores , pharmacies and bars . During the closing of the coal mining era , most of the businesses left the square and moved to the main drag of Rt. 45 , constructed in 1926 . The courthouse built by John W. Gaddis was replaced with a modern , more efficient building in 1967 after the older building was condemned . Over the years , the architecture that graced Harrisburg square has slowly turned to rotting older structures mixed in with a hodge @-@ podge of newer updated buildings . Currently there are a few privately owned downtown renovation projects in progress on and around the square . 
 The Harrisburg Mitchell @-@ Carnegie Library , located on Church Street south of the square and built with a grant from Andrew Carnegie , was built in 1908 and opened to the public in 1909 . The building served the community until 2000 when the library was moved to a new building on north Main Street . During the 1937 flood , the library was used as a makeshift hospital until the water boiler burst . The building now serves as a church . 
 Harrisburg has three city parks . Memorial Park , Gaskins City Park , and Dorris Heights Park . Memorial Park , on the west end of town , is the largest with the city park pool and a large lagoon snaking through the center , founded in 1935 . 
 The Sunset Lawn Cemetery is the largest in the county , founded in 1880 , connected to the west edge of the city . The cemetery contains ornate tombstones and crypts , within which are the remains of most of the city 's original founders and prominent residents . Sunset Lawn contained the 90 @-@ year @-@ old Sunset Mausoleum . The crypt had marble floors , with 75 persons buried inside . The structure was condemned in 2008 and there were plans of removal of the bodies and reburial within the cemetery , but due to problems finding many of the family members , has not came to fruition . 
 In May 2010 , on 301 N. Granger Street , the 1895 home of city bricklayer and early proprietor Robert King was set to be demolished . The homeowners donated it to Saline County Habitat for Humanity last year hoping that the organization might be able to restore it . The home was considered " <unk> " . In 2012 , Harrisburg High School was placed on the Landmark Illinois endangered buildings list . Two seniors at Harrisburg High School were preparing a nomination of the building for listing in the National Register of Historic Places , and they helped to distribute a petition through social media in order to help save the school . 
 = = = Harrisburg neighborhoods = = = 
 Harrisburg is split up into several small neighborhoods that were annexed into the city limits over time , from north to south . 
 Dorris Heights – A subdivision established in 1923 on land owned by W.S. and Bertha Dorris . Annexed in 1979 . Sits to the direct north of Harrisburg with the Dorris Heights Street being the main road through the area . The Saline County Fair Grounds sits to between Dorris Heights St. and the Levee to the north . Small Street heads east from Dorris Heights towards the Arrow Head Point shopping center . 
 Buena Vista – Situated to the south and north of Route 13 ( Poplar Street ) , and west of the main village . It holds the newer town water tower and several homes . It is bordered by Liberty to the south . 
 Wilmoth Addition – Is an area of prominently African American residents north of Old Harrisburg , and just south of Dorris Heights . A good portion of the Wilmoth Addition was slowly abandoned and torn down when the Rt. 13 bypass was built in 2008 . 
 Old Harrisburg Village – The streets that surround the town square . It includes everything on Main street north and south , and Poplar street from the levee to the east and the town park to the west . It also includes the High School , the old Junior High , West and East Side schools , the Courthouse , the town park and cemetery to the west , and the main shopping strip on Route 45 . This part of the city is the oldest , and is recognized mainly by the densely packed gilded age houses and structures lined on narrow brick streets . Most of this area is located on " Crusoe 's Island " , and was built during a pre @-@ automobile @-@ centric Harrisburg . 
 Gaskins City – Includes a small village annexed in 1905 , named for the Gaskins family of Harrisburg , prominent business owners and coal entrepreneurs of the Egyptian Coal Company , later sold to O 'Gara . Gaskins City is a series of several blocks that exists to the east of the Harrisburg Levee and Route 45 . Sloan Street crosses Route 45 , runs straight into the center of Gaskins City and terminates at the Harrisburg Medical Center . It contains Gaskins City Baptist Church , Shawnee Hills Country Club , and is an upper @-@ class neighborhood . It used to have its own school at one time . A large part of Gaskins City was obliterated by the 2012 EF4 Tornado . Part of Harrisburg Medical Center was also heavily damaged . 
 Garden Heights – Slightly south of Gaskins City . <unk> it with Route 34 and <unk> . 
 Dorrisville – Straight south of Harrisburg , and established in 1905 with a post office , and annexed by the city in 1923 . Dorrisville holds the Dorrisville Baptist Church , the Saline County Area Historical Museum , and " Pauper Farm Crossing " , which is on the crossroads of <unk> Street and Route 45 . Most people recognize Dorrisville as the first 5 @-@ 6 blocks north , west , and east of the <unk> Street and Barnett Street 4 @-@ way stop . A large part of Dorrisville along the Barnett Street corridor and south of Main Street was destroyed in the tornado . Many houses were destroyed or had lost their roofs . 
 Liberty – Was a smaller rural community to the far southwest of Harrisburg along Liberty Road . It included Liberty Church and cemetery . In 1873 , designer of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad , Green Berry Raum of Harrisburg , opened a slope mine on the south side of the rails near Liberty . It became the first in the county to ship coal by rail @-@ car . The mine was called Ledford Slope , and the spot was called Liberty Crossing . Liberty is bordered by the old mining community of Ledford 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south of Harrisburg , Dorrisville to the west , and Buena Vista to the north . Liberty holds the new Junior High building . 
 Ledford – Ledford had been a complete town unto itself . It was the home ground of Charles Birger , and had several stores , its own school system , and a post office . Ledford was a coal mining community set up by mostly Hungarians during the 19th century . It holds a large cemetery , an historic Hungarian cemetery , and the Ledford Baptist Church . Ledford is spread across a 4 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) span of land along Route 45 between Carrier Mills and Harrisburg , with several roads branching off to the left and right of the highway . It is all considered " Ledford " . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Harrisburg lies on the border between humid continental climate ( Köppen climate classification Dfa ) and humid subtropical climate ( Köppen climate classification Cfa ) , and has neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature . Both cold Arctic air and hot , humid tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico affect the region . The city has four distinct seasons . The highest average temperature is in July at 89 ° F ( 32 ° C ) , while the lowest average temperature is 22 ° F ( − 6 ° C ) in January . However , summer temperatures can rise over 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) , and winter temperatures can drop below 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) . Average monthly precipitation ranges from 3 to 5 inches ( 130 mm ) , with the heaviest occurring during late fall . Snowfall , which normally occurs from November to April , ranges from 1 to 7 inches ( 180 mm ) per month . The highest recorded temperature was 113 ° F ( 45 ° C ) on July 13 , 1936 , and the lowest recorded temperature was on February 2 , 1951 at − 23 ° F ( − 31 ° C )

 = = = Flood risks = = = 
 Flooding along the Ohio River , causing back flow of the middle fork of the Saline River has plagued Harrisburg over the years . The city was flooded in 1883 – 1884 and again in 1913 . The most severe came during the Ohio River flood of 1937 when much of the city , except " Crusoes ' Island " , a downtown orbit that encircled the town square , was underwater . High water had reached 30 miles ( 48 km ) from the river , and the city was flooded in its position among tributary lowlands . 10 @,@ 000 out of the 16 @,@ 000 residents were left stranded on the crowded " island " for weeks , while the other 80 % of Harrisburg was completely inundated . By the time the flood waters had receded , 4000 were left homeless . Between Gallatin County and Harrisburg , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) of Illinois Route 13 was covered by 8 @.@ 0 to 14 @.@ 0 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 to 4 @.@ 3 m ) of water ; motorboats navigated the entire distance to rescue marooned families . National guard boats were the means of transportation in the city , and several thousand people were transported daily from temporary island to island . According to the Sanborn Map Company , Harrisburg in October 1925 had a population of 15 @,@ 000 , and in a revised version by January 1937 the population had fallen to 13 @,@ 000 . After that , a levee was erected north and east of the city for protection from future floods . The levee became the unofficial northern and eastern border of the town . No businesses or residences exist in the Saline River Middle Fork floodplains . Flooding reoccurred in January 1982 due to drainage problems from the frozen ground , and in 1983 , due to 8 inches ( 200 mm ) of rain . The Pankey Branch pumping system , on the east side of town , was built to handle flooding from the Saline River only , and has serious complex watershed technical problems , causing continual water backup within the levee during large rain events . The city rebuilt a new pumping system and requested the Army Corps of Engineers to certify the levee .

 In Saline County , a preliminary estimate indicated $ 16 @.@ 8 million in damage caused by 11 @.@ 5 inches ( 290 mm ) of rain on March 18 – 19 , 2008 . At least 30 homes and 44 businesses had water over the first floor . Many business owners faced quite a task as they assessed the damage and began cleaning up . Others were able to reopen fairly quickly after suffering only minimal damage or waiting for flood waters to recede so that customers could reach their businesses . Harrisburg officials reported 74 businesses affected by flooding , Businesses along Commercial Street ( U.S. Route 45 ) , were hardest hit . Kroger , which had just undergone a major renovation , reportedly had 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) or more of water inside . The Federal Emergency Management Agency denied flood recovery grants and loans to Illinois . Flooding in the city was being called the worst in 71 years . 
 = = = Tornado of 2012 = = = 
 Spawned by a weather system that had originated in Kansas , an EF @-@ 4 tornado slammed into Harrisburg early on the morning of February 29 , 2012 . The tornado touched down just north of Carrier Mills at 4 : 51 a.m. , destroyed a church and damaged houses along Town Park Road , and then traveled ENE through the Harrisburg Coal Field just north of Ledford , and then went through Liberty , where it damaged Harrisburg Middle School . The tornado then reached the south @-@ western edge of the city at 4 : 56 a.m. , specifically Dorrisville , which suffered significant property damage , and then churned eastward to Gaskins City which was nearly leveled ; 7 people were confirmed dead in that area , most killed in an apartment complex that was crushed by another residence , and 110 were injured overall . On June 3 , another victim died in the hospital from their injuries , raising the death toll to 8 . Harrisburg Medical Center was also significantly damaged in Gaskins City . Peak winds were estimated to have been about 180 mph , and the width of the tornado path was 275 yards , traveling 26 @.@ 5 miles . In Harrisburg , more than 200 houses , and about 25 businesses were destroyed or damaged heavily . At least 10 houses and other buildings were leveled completely , and several structures were displaced from their foundations . Early estimates indicated nearly 40 % of the city was damaged or destroyed . The following night , a mandatory curfew was enforced in the effected areas , from 6 p.m. through 6 a.m. Counting the damage and death toll , it was reported to be the worst storm since the Joplin , Missouri tornado . Harrisburg Unit 3 schools were closed until March 5 , 2012 , and later they offered trauma counseling to students after reopening . 
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency and IEMA began doing preliminary damage assessments on March 5 , 2012 in order to determine the need for public assistance . The storm damage in Harrisburg dominated national airwaves for several days , with both Anderson Cooper and Diane Sawyer doing special reports . Both the New York Times and Chicago Tribune published articles about the resilient history and nature of Harrisburg to rebound from the tornado and floods that have hit the city since its founding in 1889 .

There are seven federally listed threatened and endangered species that inhabit the Forest , as well as 33 species which are considered regionally sensitive , and 114 Forest @-@ listed species . 
 When the Shawnee Purchase Units were first established , temporary headquarters were set up in Room 303 , First Trust and Savings Bank Building , Harrisburg , Illinois . This was the only modern office building in the town of Harrisburg suitable for headquarters , and the forest has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor 's offices . Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933 , until today ( June 1938 ) , ten rooms on the third floor , and four rooms on the fourth floor , are leased by the Forest Service . Employees who were here during the early days of the forest tell of the chaos and confusion caused by the small space under lease , the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies , and the constant inflow of new personnel .

 = Janet Jackson 's Rhythm Nation 1814 = 
 Janet Jackson 's Rhythm Nation 1814 is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson , released on September 19 , 1989 , by A & M Records . Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album , Control ( 1986 ) , Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues . Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media , exploring racism , poverty , and substance abuse , in addition to themes of romance . Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions , its composition received critical acclaim . Jackson came to be considered a role model for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics . 
 Noted for its use of sample loop and utilizing swing note and synthesized percussion throughout its production , the album encompasses a variety of musical styles , such as new jack swing , hard rock , pop , dance and industrial music . The songs range from mechanized dance rhythms to soft balladry , giving it appeal across multiple radio formats . It became the singer 's second consecutive album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States . It also topped the ARIA Charts in Australia and peaked within the top ten positions of the album charts in Japan , New Zealand , and United Kingdom . Certified six @-@ times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , it emerged the biggest @-@ selling album of 1990 and has sold an estimated twenty million copies worldwide . Due to its innovative production and lyrical exploration , critics have come to regard it as the pinnacle of Jackson 's artistic achievement . It is included in Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and the British reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die , among other publications " best of " album lists . It has been cited as an influence in various musical trends , inspiring numerous artists . 
 It is the only album in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart to have seven commercial singles peak within the top five positions . It is also the only album to produce number one hits on the chart in three separate calendar years ( 1989 – 1991 ) . The 30 @-@ minute Rhythm Nation 1814 film , a screenplay depicting two aspiring musicians whose lives are disrupted by substance abuse , aired on MTV to promote the album . Jackson received nine Grammy Award nominations , becoming the first female artist to be nominated for Producer of the Year and winning Best Long Form Music Video for Rhythm Nation 1814 . Her Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 became the most successful debut concert tour by a recording artist , in addition to setting venue records in Japan . She was regarded as a fashion icon , with her " Rhythm Nation " attire being emulated by youth . Proceeds from the tour were used to establish the Rhythm Nation Scholarship and fund other educational programs . Jackson received the MTV Video Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her significant contributions to popular culture .

 Following the critical and commercial breakthrough of her third studio album Control ( 1986 ) , Jackson was motivated to take a larger role in her album 's creative process . According to Billboard 's Hottest Hot 100 Hits ( 2002 ) , A & M Records requested she record an album similar to Control . It was rumored that label executives suggested a concept album entitled Scandal , which would have centered around her personal and family life . However , Jam later denied the claim that Scandal was ever suggested , although he confirmed there was encouragement to produce a " Control II . " Jackson opposed the idea of a direct sequel to Control , stating " that 's what I didn 't want to do . I wanted to do something that I really believed in and that I really felt strong about . " She was initially criticized for choosing to dedicate the album 's theme to social consciousness , but remained resolute in her commitment to the concept . Jam stated that her inspiration for the album 's theme came primarily from watching CNN and other news sources . In particular , her reaction to the Stockton playground murders led to recording " Livin ' in a World ( They Didn 't Make ) " , " Rhythm Nation " and " State of the World " . 
 While discussing the origin of the title " Rhythm Nation " , Jackson stated she first uttered the phrase during a conversation with her producers . " I thought it would be great if we could create our own nation " adding that it would be " one that would have a positive message and that everyone would be free to join . " She based the idea on the prevalence of various youth groups and organizations that are formed as a means of creating a common identity . The usage of the number " 1814 " represents the year the national anthem " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " was written . Rolling Stone emphasized the core concept is further explored in the album 's opening pledge ( the first track of the recording ) , which states : " We are a nation with no geographic boundaries , bound together through our beliefs . We are like @-@ minded individuals , sharing a common vision , pushing toward a world rid of color @-@ lines . " Several critics noted that " R " ( Rhythm ) and " N " ( Nation ) are the eighteenth and fourteenth letters of the alphabet , though Jackson said this was coincidental . 
 Jackson 's primary goal for the record was to reach a younger audience who may have been unaware of what it means to be socially conscious individuals . She expressed : " I wanted to capture their attention through my music . " She was influenced by other musical acts such as Joni Mitchell , Bob Dylan , Tracy Chapman , and U2 , although she felt their music appealed primarily to adults who were already invested in social change . She also stated , " I 'm not naive — I know an album or a song can 't change the world . I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience 's attention " hoping it would motivate people to " make some sort of difference . " 
 = = Composition and production = = 
 Rhythm Nation 1814 was recorded over a period of seven months . Its production took place at Flyte Tyme studios in Minneapolis , Minnesota , with majority of the album being recorded in the winter of 1988 . According to Jam , he , Lewis and Jackson chose to isolate themselves to compose the record . No one from A & M Records was invited to the studio to observe and label executives complied with their request . The trio co @-@ authored six of the album 's songs : " Rhythm Nation " , " State of the World " , " Alright " , " Escapade " , " Come Back to Me " and " Someday Is Tonight . " Five of the six remaining songs for the record , " The Knowledge " , " Miss You Much " , " Love Will Never Do ( Without You ) " and " Livin ' in a World ( They Didn 't Make ) " , were penned by Jam and Lewis , while " Black Cat " was written solely by Jackson . She co @-@ produced the album with Jam and Lewis , while John McClain served as executive producer ; the song " Black Cat " was produced by Jellybean Johnson . 
 The LP was produced primarily through use of synthesizers and drum machines . Prior its recording , Jam and Lewis had begun to update their equipment for Flyte Tyme studios , experimenting with different types of drum machines and keyboards . While Control had been recorded primarily using the LinnDrum machine , songs for Rhythm Nation 1814 were mostly recorded using the E @-@ mu SP @-@ 1200 , which was more commonplace for hip hop music at the time . The Oberheim OB @-@ 8 analog synthesizer , as well as those made by Sequential Circuits , were also used for mixing and recording . The only equipment utilized for the recording of Control that was also used for producing Rhythm Nation 1814 was the Ensoniq Mirage keyboard . The instrumental tracks for " Miss You Much " , " Love Will Never Do ( Without You ) " and " Escapade " were among the first to be recorded , considered to be follow @-@ ups to the " beat @-@ heavy , catchy songs " that Jackson , Jam and Lewis crafted on Control which " defined the punch and power of 1980s dance and pop music . " 
 Jam noted it was commonplace for Jackson to sing her vocals with the base track first and then have the rest of the song built around it in order to make her voice the center of the piece . " Janet did all of her background vocals and not just the lead vocals . The idea with her has always been that she does all of her own vocals , so that it 's totally a Janet record . " On the title track " Rhythm Nation " , her vocals range from Bb3 to G5 , climaxing within its middle eight . Musicologist Richard J. Ripani observed the album and title track showcased the variety of contemporary R & B styles , making " use of elements across the R & B spectrum , including use of a sample loop [ " Rhythm Nation " samples " Thank You ( Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin ) " by Sly and the Family Stone ] , triplet swing , rapped vocal parts and blues notes ( D naturals and G naturals ) . " This style of music , known as new jack swing , was immensely popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s . Though officially credited to the production techniques of Teddy Riley , Ripani theorized Riley was influenced by Jackson 's 1986 single " Nasty " , which also features a distinctive triplet swing . Jon Pareles observed the album 's diversity catered to a wide variety of radio formats , including pop , quiet storm , Adult contemporary and mainstream rock . " Black Cat " was a stand @-@ out for the record , not only for being composed exclusively by Jackson , but for its stark departure from her general style of music , delving into hard rock . While Jellybean Johnson was elected to produce it , Dave Berry was recruited to play guitar for the song . It was recorded using a mixture of Rockman and Marshall amplifier to give the song a heavy metal sound . 
 The sequencing of the record 's track list was done strategically , starting with songs that lyrically depict societal injustices and ending with those that explore love , relationships and sexuality . This decision also factored into the album 's artwork and marketing , giving it an overt black and white militant imagery . Jam explained that " [ t ] he idea of putting ' Rhythm Nation ' , ' Living in the World ' and ' The Knowledge ' as the first three songs on the record really set the tone as to what the record was . Then to have the segue after that where she says , ' Get the point ? Good . Let 's dance ... ' and then go into ' Miss You Much ' , that was purposely done . " He also stated that the safer marketing strategy for the project would have been " a beautiful colored picture of Janet on the cover " with Escapade as its title , starting the track listing with " Miss You Much " , " Love Will Never Do ( Without You ) " and " Escapade " , and ending it with " Livin ' in a World ( They Didn 't Make ) " , " The Knowledge " and " Rhythm Nation " but noted that despite being the same collection of songs , the alternate sequencing and imagery would not have had the same impact . Of its lyrical themes , Kate Kelly stated the album " reveals a social conscience speaking of getting an education , avoiding drugs , and feeding the homeless . All this might seem a little heavy for dance music or pop radio , but Jackson fuses her concepts with driving dance energy that hits the hearts of those hitting the dance @-@ floor . " Andrew Barker of Variety described it as " a quasi @-@ concept album whose opening three songs directly addressed crime , the crack epidemic , racism , homelessness and youth illiteracy — not exactly a recipe for a party . And yet the record was somehow even more successful than Control , generating a then @-@ record seven top 5 singles . "

 = = Critical reception = = 
 The album received generally positive reviews , with a mixed reaction to Jackson 's social and political themes . Dennis Hunt of Los Angeles Times called it " intriguing " and diverse , ranging from " social commentary to lusty , sensual tunes , from dance music to songs laced with jazz and Brazilian textures . " Vince Aletti of Rolling Stone likened Jackson 's themes to a politician , " abandoning the narrow ' I ' for the universal ' we ' and inviting us to do the same . " Aletti complimented Jackson 's balance of " despair with optimism , anger with hope , " incorporated within its theme of social progress . Andy Ellis @-@ <unk> of Keyboard considered it " a powerful statement on racial integration , social accountability , and personal integrity . " In his review for The Boston Globe , Steve Morse compared its success to that of Aerosmith and Billy Joel , declaring it " a dance record with a ruthlessly frank social conscience that addresses drugs , homelessness , illiteracy and teen runaways . She 's reached far beyond dance music 's fluffy image to unite even serious rockers and rappers who usually look the other way . " Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle considered it a worthy successor to Jackson 's previous album Control , adding " a little sociopolitical substance " as she " bounces between the two extremes of romance and generalized , politically correct topicality . " 
 Writing for The New York Times , Jon Pareles compared the album 's concept to Pink Floyd 's The Dark Side of the Moon ( 1973 ) and Guns N ' Roses Appetite for Destruction ( 1987 ) , referring to it as " a cause without a rebellion . " However , Pareles commended its musicality and vocals , stating " [ t ] he tone of the music is airless , sealing out imprecision and reveling in crisp , machine @-@ generated rhythms ; Ms. Jackson 's piping voice , layered upon itself in punchy unisons or lavish harmonies , never cracks or falters . " Robert Christgau wrote in his review for The Village Voice , " Her voice is as unequal to her vaguely admonitory politics as it was to her declaration of sexual availability , but the music is the message . " 
 In 1990 , the album earned Grammy Award nominations for " Best Female R & B Vocal Performance " and " Best Rhythm & Blues Song " for " Miss You Much " , and " Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist " and " Best Long Form Music Video " for " Rhythm Nation " , winning the latter award . Jackson was also nominated for " Producer of the Year , Non @-@ Classical " , becoming the first woman to be nominated for the award . The following year , Jackson received nominations for " Best Female Rock Vocal Performance " for " Black Cat , " in addition to " Best Rhythm & Blues Song " and " Best R & B Vocal Performance , Female " for " Alright . " 
 Contemporary reviews continue to find the album favorable . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine declared the album a " masterpiece . " Henderson also praised its diversity , stating : " She was more credibly feminine , more crucially masculine , more viably adult , more believably childlike . This was , of course , critical to a project in which Janet assumed the role of mouthpiece for a <unk> , multicultural utopia . " Though referring to Jackson 's voice as " wafer @-@ thin " , Alex Henderson of AllMusic applauded Jackson 's spirit and enthusiasm , praising the album 's numerous " gems . " Henderson regarded it " an even higher artistic plateau " than her prior album , adding : " For those purchasing their first Janet Jackson release , Rhythm Nation would be an even wiser investment than Control — and that 's saying a lot . " 
 = = Promotion and videography = = 
 Upon the release of the album 's lead single " Miss You Much " , A & M Records issued a press release for the record , announcing social themes to " run throughout much of the material . " Jackson performed " Rhythm Nation " on several television shows internationally , including Top of the Pops and the Royal Variety Performance , in celebration of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother 's ninetieth birthday . She also performed a controversial rendition of " Black Cat " at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards in which she tore open her snapped blouse ; although this was routine for performances of the song in concert , it was considered to have " ushered in a new age of sexual spontaneity " for the singer and viewed as the first " shocking " performance of her career . 
 A thirty @-@ minute long @-@ form music video , Rhythm Nation 1814 , was produced to promote the album . Referred to as a " <unk> , " the storyline incorporates three separate music videos : " Miss You Much , " " The Knowledge , " and " Rhythm Nation . " Jackson and director Dominic Sena developed the screenplay , which centers around two boys whose dreams of pursuing music careers are destroyed through substance abuse and drug trafficking . Sena referred to the film as the " 1814 Project " , attempting to keep the public unaware that Jackson was filming on the streets of Los Angeles . The project had a budget of $ 1 @.@ 6 million and was aired on MTV prior to the album 's release . A & M co @-@ founder Jerry Moss stated that the decision to film the composite videos all at once for Rhythm Nation 1814 regardless of budget was " a brilliant way to go " allotting Jackson more time to focus her attention elsewhere . 
 Parallel Lines : Media Representations of Dance ( 1993 ) observed that in Rhythm Nation 1814 , Jackson represents a " modern good fairy " attempting to guide troubled youth to a more positive way of life . Each of the three segments serve a different purpose , beginning with affinity and companionship in " Miss You Much " , followed by anger and frustration in her rooftop solo and ending with " Rhythm Nation " , in which Jackson and her dancers " have become a uniformed , formidable army , whose controlled energetic moves and shouts project a disciplined resolution to inspire others through dance and music . " Their group dynamic visually depicts a gender neutral equality , with Jackson " performing asexually and anonymously in front of , but as one of the members of the group . " It is also noted that the success of the film is not only the final product , but in the commercial and social implications of its development . In selecting an unknown street dancer , Anthony Thomas , to develop her choreography , " Janet Jackson secures a threefold achievement : she satisfies the dictates of the commercial pop music industry by creating a dance image which is significantly different from her earlier work ; she demonstrates that , despite fame , she is still in touch with contemporary youth pop culture and its fashions ; and finally , she [ utilizes ] , not the dance traditions of Hollywood musical ... but the work of a young black man whose training is outside the institutions of Western theatre and clearly an Afro @-@ American cultural expression of the late 1980s . " The film received positive reception . Jefferson Graham in USA Today commented that " she dances up a storm in the moody black @-@ and @-@ white video 's three songs ... and plays the role of a mystical figure to young kids . " Jon Pareles remarked that " [ it ] juxtaposes her dance routines with grim urban imagery and a plot line about drugs versus dreams . " It was later released on VHS as the Rhythm Nation 1814 Compilation , and reissued the following year with each of the album 's promotional music videos . Jackson received two MTV Music Video Award nominations for " Best Dance Video " and " Best Choreography " for " Rhythm Nation " , winning the latter . 
 Five other music video were produced to promote the album 's singles . While the video for " Black Cat " was taken from live footage of Jackson 's concerts , those for " Escapade " and " Alright " utilized a Broadway @-@ influenced production . The video for " Alright " was an homage to choreographer Michael Kidd , who was asked to participate in the project and also featured appearances by the flash dancing Nicholas Brothers , actress Cyd Charisse and bandleader Cab Calloway . An extended version of the video also features rapper Heavy D. The somber video for " Come Back To Me " was filmed near the Eiffel Tower in Paris , France . Similarly , " Love Will Never Do ( Without You ) " was a notable departure from the typically elaborate choreography associated with Jackson 's other videos , focusing on her as an individual rather than as a part of a dancing troupe . Featuring appearances by Antonio <unk> , Jr. and Djimon Hounsou , the sandy beach setting exemplifies director Herb Ritts " signature style through use of graceful movements , bold contrasts , and wide @-@ open spaces . " The music video is also regarded as the origin of what would later become Jackson 's sexually overt persona , freely displaying her legs , torso and cleavage , as well as touching her own bare skin and <unk> , Jr 's in a sensual manner . In Present Tense : Rock & Roll and Culture ( 1992 ) , Anthony DeCurtis states that " [ t ] he video celebrates hedonism and voyeurism ; there are languorous displays of Jackson 's body in ripped jeans and brief top , and of several muscular male bodies , black and white , with bare arms , and chests . " She received the MTV Video Vanguard Award , regarded as MTV 's highest honor for artists whose videography has significantly impacted pop culture . 
 = = Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 = = 
 The Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 was Jackson 's debut concert tour . Described as " an elaborately choreographed spectacle , " it aimed to recreate the award @-@ winning , innovative music videos of Rhythm Nation 1814 and those of its predecessor , Control . Anthony Thomas served as the tour 's main choreographer , while <unk> Booker became its musical director and opening act . She was assisted by a team of eleven musicians , five back @-@ up singers , and six dancers . Jackson 's total production and staging reportedly cost $ 2 million . In addition to Jackson 's choreography , the tour was reported to portray " dazzling lighting effects and pyrotechnics , " as well as illusionary magic , in which Jackson was transformed into a leopard on stage . 
 Writing for Time magazine , Jay Cocks observed the show to integrate " sleek high tech and smooth dance rhythm into an evening of snazzy soul with a social conscience . " Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times remarked that Jackson 's choreography " represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping ' n ' locking style — a rapid @-@ fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements . " Several critics noted Jackson lip synced portions of the show , in a similar fashion to her contemporaries . Jon Pareles commented , " most lip @-@ synched shows are done by video @-@ era pop performers whose audiences are young and television trained . They fill arenas to enjoy a spectacle like what they saw on television — the dancing ... the stage effects and incidentally the songs . " Michael MacCambridge considered it a " moot point " stating , " Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre @-@ recorded vocals , to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles . " 
 The tour became the most successful debut concert tour in history , with an attendance of over two million . It also set a record for the fastest sell @-@ out of Japan 's Tokyo Dome , selling out within seven minutes . Jackson became the only female artist other than Madonna to fill arenas at the time . It was ranked the fifth most successful tour of 1990 , making her the only female artist to place within the top ten . It also solidified her reputation as a fashion icon , as fans imitated her " Rhythm Nation " outfit and regalia . Ebony magazine reported " hoards of teen girls were imitating her distinctive look — black quasi @-@ military long jackets , black tight @-@ tight pants , and big white shirts . " Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote " the 23 @-@ year @-@ old has been making smash hit records for four years , becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country . " Over $ 450 @,@ 000 @.@ 00 in proceeds from the tour 's Madison Square Garden show were used to establish the Rhythm Nation scholarship program . The annual scholarship awards $ 5 @,@ 000 @.@ 00 to students majoring in performing arts and communications at United Negro College Fund member colleges and universities . William Allen , then @-@ executive vice president of the <unk> , remarked : " Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she has gotten to the young people of this country through the lyrics of ' Rhythm Nation 1814 ' is having positive effects . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The commercial success of Rhythm Nation 1814 was an unexpected achievement for mainstream pop music . Although Jackson was told focusing her album 's theme on social consciousness would negatively impact sales , it was " a prediction soon proved wrong when the album was certified multi @-@ platinum " and subsequently topped the pop , R & B and dance music charts . In She Bop II : The Definitive History of Women in Rock , Pop and Soul ( 2003 ) , Lucy O 'Brien wrote that contrary to A & M 's fear that the album would <unk> , its multi @-@ platinum sales pushed Jackson to a level of superstardom rivaling her brother Michael , calling it a " personal manifesto " and regarding it as a female counterpart to Marvin Gaye 's What 's Going On ( 1971 ) . Timothy E. Scheurer , author of Born in the USA : The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present ( 2007 ) , wrote that the album " may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There 's a Riot Going On and other African @-@ American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible , that the American Dream is a dream for all people . " It made history as the only album to generate seven top @-@ five hits on the Billboard Hot 100 , surpassing Michael Jackson 's Thriller ( 1982 ) and Bruce Springsteen 's Born in the U.S.A. ( 1984 ) , each having seven top ten hits . It is also the only album to achieve number one hits in three separate calendar years , with " Miss You Much " in 1989 , " Escapade " and " Black Cat " in 1990 , and " Love Will Never Do ( Without You ) " in 1991 . Additionally , it is one of only nine albums — including Michael Jackson 's Bad ( 1987 ) , Saturday Night Fever : The Original Movie Sound Track ( 1977 ) , Whitney Houston 's Whitney ( 1987 ) , George Michael 's Faith ( 1987 ) , Paula Abdul 's Forever Your Girl ( 1989 ) , Mariah Carey 's self @-@ titled debut ( 1990 ) , Usher 's Confessions ( 2004 ) and Katy Perry 's Teenage Dream ( 2010 ) — to produce a minimum of four number ones . 
 Aside from its commercial performance , the album 's composition has continued to receive acclaim for its sonic innovation . Upon its 25th anniversary , music critic and scholar Joseph Vogel observed that when viewed " as a complete artistic statement , Rhythm Nation 1814 was a stunning achievement . It married the pleasures of pop with the street energy and edge of hip @-@ hop . " Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly asserted the record " has barely aged — it sounds as rich and vital as it did when it was first released , and stylistically as contemporary as anything on the Billboard charts . " Anderson also underscores that it pioneered several musical trends , citing records by pop and R & B artists including Rihanna , Pink , Beyoncé , Frank Ocean , Gwen Stefani , The Weeknd , Lady Gaga , Jhené Aiko , Miguel , Christina Aguilera , <unk> Twigs , and Tinashe that have exhibited similarities to the " landmark " album . Its single for " Alright " featuring Heavy D made Jackson the first pop artist to team with a rapper , " setting the trend for future pop and hip @-@ hop collaborations . " Additionally , " Black Cat " set a precedent for female pop stars segueing into glam metal . The album notably influenced Michael Jackson 's Dangerous ( 1991 ) and HIStory ( 1995 ) , the latter of which features the sibling 's duet " Scream " , produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis . Its impact also extends to indie and alternative rock music , with School of Seven Bells , A Sunny Day in Glasgow , and Alexis Krauss of Sleigh Bells citing the album as an influence in their work . MTV 's Brenna Ehrlich remarked : " From Beyoncé ... to Britney Spears to Robyn to Sleigh Bells , the influence of Jackson 's game @-@ changer of a record is still rippling through the radio waves ( or SoundCloud waves ) today . " 
 Jackson 's handwritten lyrics to " Rhythm Nation " have been preserved by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 's " Women Who Rock " exhibit , which Kathryn Metz describes as " the perfect platform to talk about song structure " for the museum 's " Women Who Rock : Songwriting and Point of View " course , in which students analyze music written by female songwriters . Rolling Stone observed the song 's music video " set the template for hundreds of videos to come in the Nineties and <unk> . " Mike Weaver remarked the " innovative , one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind , funk @-@ and @-@ groove choreography was unlike anything seen in the history of pop music . " Although music historian Ted Gioia considered the song to be an " awkward chant " he commented that " Rhythm Nation " became " one of the most riveting videos of the era , a kind of sensual steampunk for MTV viewers . " In 1990 , Jackson received MTV 's Video Vanguard Award for her contributions to the art form . That same year , she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of her impact on the recording industry and philanthropic endeavors , including her Rhythm Nation Scholarship fund . With her contractual obligations to A & M fulfilled in 1991 , she signed with Virgin Records for an unprecedented multimillion @-@ dollar deal , becoming the world 's highest paid musician at the time . 
 Sal Cinquemani noted her popularity had eclipsed Michael Jackson 's , " as she would continue to do for more than a decade . " Music scholars John Shepherd and David Horn wrote that as a crossover artist on the pop and R & B charts , she emerged " the most dominant female performer of the 1980s " behind Whitney Houston . Dan <unk> observed that she presented herself as a role model for black women and as a creative intellect whose work advocated the advancement of black people . Joseph Vogel stated that her rising popularity towards the end of the decade was important for several reasons , " not the least of which was how it coincided with ( and spoke to ) the rise of black feminism . " At a time when radio airplay and MTV primarily catered to white rock musicians , her album and its predecessor garnered widespread critical acclaim alongside other " unprecedented breakthroughs " by black women — including Alice Walker 's The Color Purple ( 1982 ) , Toni Morrison 's Beloved ( 1987 ) and Patricia Hill Collins 's Black Feminist Thought ( 1990 ) — musically capturing the spirit of the movement and presenting an alternate model on both womanhood and feminism to that of Madonna . Regarding her diverse appeal among youth , he also stated : " Janet didn 't have the vocal prowess of Whitney Houston , or the poetic subtlety of Kate Bush ; she didn 't have Annie Lennox 's penchant for the avant @-@ garde or Madonna 's predilection for shock . But none of these artists achieved the cross @-@ racial impact ( particularly on youth culture ) of Janet . And none of them had an album like Rhythm Nation 1814 . " 
 Jackson herself would comment on the album 's legacy on her 2015 album Unbreakable . In the song " Shoulda Known Better " , she reflects on her optimistic wish that Rhythm Nation 1814 could have profoundly changed the world , noting that there are many , deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren 't enough . The chorus includes the line , " Cause I don 't want my face to be / That poster child for being naive " ; and Rhythm Nation 's title is referred to as " an epiphany " , with Jackson mentioning that " next time , I 'll know better . " Album co @-@ producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC : " When you 're young , you feel like : ' I can change the world ! I 'm going to lead the revolution ! ' And then you look 25 years later and you go : ' OK , I should have known better . The same problems still exist but there 's a different way to go about tackling it . It still involves mobilising people , but I can 't do it by myself . ' It 's just a wiser , more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change , a social change . "

 = ICGV Þór = 
 The ICGV Þór ( Thor ) is an UT <unk> type offshore patrol vessel designed by Rolls Royce for the Icelandic Coast Guard , built to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn . The construction of the ship was approved by the Icelandic government on 4 March 2005 . Construction of the ship began at the ASMAR Naval Shipyard in Talcahuano , Chile on 16 October 2007 . Construction was delayed by over a year due to the 2010 Chilean earthquake , but damage to the structure of the ship was not as detrimental as had been expected . After repairs , the ICGV Þór was delivered to ICG personnel on 23 September 2011 in Chile . She arrived in Reykjavík on 27 October 2011 . Its main tasks are EEZ patrol , fishery inspection and search and rescue support . The ship is named after the Norse god Thor . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The origins of the ship date back to 4 March 2005 , in a proposal drafted by then @-@ Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs ( which is now a nonexistent entity ) , Björn <unk> , regarding the purchase of a new vessel , in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn , and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard . The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter , and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal . A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi @-@ purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005 . The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling , pollution prevention , fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight , and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country . In addition , it was to be equipped for response to , and prevention of , terrorist threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities , and for all types of rescue and salvage work . The bollard pull of the vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland ’ s economic zone and coastal waters . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Bids for the construction of the ship were open to application and submission at the State Trading Centre . After processing through the STC , the bids were to be submitted dually to the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs and the ICG . 15 bids were received from 12 countries . The winning bid was the second bid of ASMAR , Chile 's largest shipbuilding corporation . The contract for the construction of the new vessel was signed on 20 December 2006 by Björn , Árni M. Mathiesen , Minister of Finance , and Georg Kr . <unk> , Director of the ICG , and Carlos Fanta de la Vega , Rear Admiral of the Chilean Navy and Director of the ASMAR Naval Shipyard . Construction commenced on 16 October 2007 . The ship was launched on 29 April 2009 at a ceremony in the ASMAR Naval Shipyard in Talcahuano . The then @-@ unnamed vessel received the official name Þór , or Thor , after the god Thor .

 The ICGV Þór 's design is concurrent with that of the <unk> Harstad ; in fact , both vessels were designed by Rolls Royce plc . The vessel is powered by two Rolls Royce Marine Bergen diesel engines . The ship 's propellers are two Rolls Royce Marine <unk> Ulstein feathering propellers ( feathering propellers are rotated parallel to the water flow in order to reduce drag ) . The ship is 93 @.@ 8 metres ( 308 feet ) long overall , a 16 metres ( 52 feet ) wide , and a has a height of 30 metres ( 98 feet ) . The maximum speed of the vessel is 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 kilometres per hour ; 22 @.@ 4 miles per hour ) , while its towing capacity , or bollard pull , is 120 tonnes ( 120 long tons ; 130 short tons ) . The cargo deck covers 300 square metres ( 3 @,@ 200 square feet ) . The vessel is outfitted with various life @-@ saving equipment , designed to aid it in rescue missions , including two MOB boats and six Viking life rafts . Other specially @-@ designed equipment the vessel is outfitted with includes oil booms , 1 × 40 mm Bofors gun , and oil skimmers .

 In 2010 , a magnitude 8 @.@ 8 earthquake struck Chile , forming an immense tsunami that left a <unk> wake along the Chilean coastline . It was feared that the ICGV Þór would have been damaged beyond repair in the disaster , as the shipyard itself was known to have incurred massive damage . Despite the odds , the ship had sustained minimal damage . After being placed in dry dock for minor repairs , the vessel was delivered , albeit more than a year late . 
 = = Delivery = = 
 After being fully repaired following the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami , the ICGV Þór was delivered to ICG authorities and personnel at the ASMAR shipyard on 23 September 2011 . The ship then embarked on the voyage to Reykjavík harbour , and was slated to arrive in late October of the same year . After making stops in cities such as Halifax , the ship finally arrived in Reykjavík on 27 October 2011 . The vessel maintains a complement ( number of personnel on board the ship ) of 48 . 
 On 11 June 2015 , Þór was rammed and damaged by <unk> at Reykjavík .

 New York State Route 146 ( NY 146 ) is a state highway in the Capital District of New York in the United States . It extends for 43 miles ( 69 km ) from Gallupville at NY 443 to near Mechanicville at U.S. Route 4 ( US 4 ) and NY 32 . NY 146 is a major thoroughfare in the city of Schenectady , just outside Albany . Most of the route follows an east – west alignment ; however , the middle third of the route between Guilderland and Clifton Park runs in a more north – south manner in order to serve Schenectady . At one time , NY 146 had three spur routes ; only one — NY 146A — still exists . 
 NY 146 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . At the time , NY 146 began at modern NY 443 in Berne and followed what is now NY 156 northeast to Altamont while modern NY 146 west of Altamont was part of NY 156 . The alignments of the two routes were flipped in the late 1930s . Other minor realignments have occurred since , most notably near Mechanicville .

 NY 146 begins at a T @-@ intersection with NY 443 in Gallupville , a hamlet within the town of Wright . The highway spends only 4 @.@ 24 miles ( 6 @.@ 82 km ) in Schoharie County before passing into neighboring Albany County . Along this stretch , NY 143 has an intersection with County Route 26 ( CR 26 , named Larry Hill Road ) just over 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from NY 443 . After crossing into Albany County , NY 146 turns eastward and heads toward Albany , the capital of New York . In the Knox hamlet of West , NY 146 intersects CR 259 . As NY 146 reaches the hamlet of East a short time later , it meets CRs 252 , 260 , 261 , and 262 in quick succession . NY 146 continues eastward , passing through a rural area of Albany County on its way to the town of Guilderland and the village of Altamont contained within . 
 NY 146 enters Altamont from the west on Western Avenue . At Maple Avenue , NY 146 turns south to follow that street for two blocks while NY 397 begins on the road that NY 146 vacates . NY 146 leaves Maple Avenue at Main Street , which connects to NY 156 one block to the west . Both NY 156 and NY 146 are marked with signs directing traffic to the other route by way of this one block of Main Street . NY 146 heads east from Maple Avenue , following Main Street eastward out of the village . After leaving Altamont , NY 146 continues for about 3 miles ( 5 km ) through a lightly populated portion of Guilderland before intersecting with the southern terminus of NY 158 . The route progresses onward , intersecting CRs 201 and 202 and passing over the CSX Transportation @-@ owned Selkirk Subdivision railroad line and Normans Kill before meeting US 20 at Hartmans Corners . NY 146 joins US 20 for about 0 @.@ 7 miles ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) northwestward to McCormack Corners , where NY 146 leaves US 20 and heads northward toward Schenectady County .

NY 146 continues on through Rotterdam , meeting NY 7 at a junction about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south of Schenectady . The route continues on , paralleling I @-@ 890 into the Schenectady city limits at <unk> Avenue . Here , maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) to the city of Schenectady . Five blocks later , NY 146 intersects with Altamont Avenue ( unsigned NY <unk> ) just before crossing over I @-@ 890 and entering Schenectady 's downtown district . In downtown Schenectady , NY 146 follows Brandywine Avenue northeastward past an intersection with NY 5 ( State Street ) to Union Street , where the route turns to follow Union eastward out of the city . Upon crossing into <unk> , ownership of the route shifts to Schenectady County , which maintains the roadway as CR 159 . CR 159 ends five blocks later at Balltown Road ( unsigned NY <unk> ) . NY 146 turns north onto Balltown , becoming NYSDOT maintained once more in the process . 
 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) north of Union Street , NY 146 crosses over the Mohawk River on the Rexford Bridge and enters Saratoga County . On the north bank of the river in Clifton Park , CRs 88 and 91 terminate at NY 146 in opposite directions . This portion of CR 91 was once part of NY 146B , a former spur of NY 146 .

NY 146 comes to an end soon afterward at US 4 and NY 32 south of Mechanicville on the banks of the Hudson River . 
 = = History = = 
 NY 146 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and originally extended from NY 43 ( now NY 443 ) in Berne northeast through Schenectady to US 4 and NY 32 in Mechanicville . The portion of the route northeast of Altamont generally followed its modern alignment ; however , west of Altamont , NY 146 followed what is now NY 156 to Berne while NY 156 was routed on modern NY 146 to Gallupville . Although it was signed as part of NY 156 , the Gallupville – Altamont highway was locally maintained until 1939 , when it was acquired by the state of New York . The alignments of NY 146 and NY 156 west of Altamont were flipped c . 1940 , placing NY 146 on the new state highway . Most of former NY 146 west of Altamont became part of NY 156 , save for a one @-@ block section of Main Street within the village . It is now designated as NY <unk> , an unsigned 0 @.@ 08 @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 13 km ) reference route serving a connector between NY 156 and NY 146 , which do not meet despite both highways using Main Street as an entrance to the village . 
 In Schenectady , NY 146 was originally routed on Union , Jay , and Nott Streets and Van <unk> Avenue through the northern portion of the city . It was realigned between 1938 and 1947 to bypass the northern part of the city on Balltown Road . The New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) has reserved the NY 646 designation for the former routing of NY 146 through Schenectady ; however , there is no timetable for its assignment . In Halfmoon , NY 146 was initially routed on <unk> Hill Road and South Street in the vicinity of Mechanicville . The route was altered in the late 1940s to follow a new highway that bypassed Mechanicville to the south . The portion of NY 146 's former routing outside of the Mechanicville city limits is now designated and signed as CR 1345 , reflecting the number of the legislative state highway ( SH 1345 ) that makes up the portion of NY 146 in Halfmoon and thus once followed <unk> Hill Road .

 The New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) has identified the NY 146 corridor from Riverview Road to Glen Ridge Road as in need of future improvements . Intersection improvements are scheduled at the NY 146 / Aqueduct Road / Williams Road and NY 146 / Riverview Road intersections . This part of the project will be built in 2008 and is to include new turn lanes at each intersection . To the south , the Rexford Bridge over the Mohawk River and the surrounding roadway will be improved in stages , with completion expected by 2017 . The objective of these projects is to improve highway capacity and safety along the corridor .

 = International Pentecostal Holiness Church = 
 The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ( IPHC ) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church ( PHC ) is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations . Historically centered in the Southeastern United States , particularly the Carolinas and Georgia , the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence . In 2000 , the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million — over three million including affiliates . 
 Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements — the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century — the church 's theological roots derive from John Wesley 's teachings on sanctification . 
 Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself , such as Oral Roberts , an internationally known charismatic evangelist ; Charles Stanley , a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention ; and C.M. Ward , a former Assemblies of God radio preacher . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 In 1894 , the Methodist Episcopal Church , South adopted a statement which opposed the growing holiness movement in the church . Within a decade about 25 new holiness groups , including the Pentecostal Holiness Church , came into existence . 
 = = = = Fire @-@ Baptized Holiness = = = = 
 The oldest group that is part of the foundation of the Pentecostal Holiness Church originated in 1895 as the Fire @-@ Baptized Holiness Association in <unk> , Iowa . The leader , Benjamin H. Irwin of Lincoln , Nebraska , a former Baptist preacher , organized the body into the national Fire @-@ Baptized Holiness Church at Anderson , South Carolina , in August 1898 . By this time , Irwin 's group had organized churches in eight U. S. states and two Canadian provinces . 
 = = = = Pentecostal Holiness of North Carolina = = = = 
 The first congregation to carry the name Pentecostal Holiness Church was formed in Goldsboro , North Carolina in 1898 . This church was founded as a result of the evangelistic ministry of Abner Blackmon Crumpler , a Methodist evangelist . A year earlier , Crumpler had founded the inter @-@ denominational North Carolina Holiness Association . After his trial and acquittal by a Methodist ecclesiastical court for preaching holiness doctrines , Crumpler and several of his followers left the Methodist Church and formed a new denomination known as the Pentecostal Holiness Church ( " Pentecostal " being a common name for holiness believers at the time ) . 
 The first convention was held at Fayetteville , North Carolina in 1900 . The convention adopted a denominational discipline , and Crumpler was elected president . In 1901 at a meeting in Magnolia , North Carolina , the word " Pentecostal " was dropped from the name to more fully associate the church with the holiness movement . For the next eight years , the church would be known as " The Holiness Church of North Carolina " . The church had congregations outside of North Carolina as well , principally in South Carolina and Virginia . 
 Gaston B. <unk> , a minister of the Methodist Church , joined Crumpler 's group in 1903 . He became a leading figure in the church and the Pentecostal movement on the east coast . In 1906 , he traveled to Los Angeles to visit the Pentecostal revival at the Azusa Street mission . While there he professed having received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of speaking in tongues . Upon returning to Dunn , North Carolina , in December 1906 , <unk> preached the Pentecost experience in the local holiness church . 
 The influence of the Pentecostal renewal grew while , at the same time , the leader and founder of the church , Abner Crumpler , though willing to accept speaking in tongues , did not accept the idea that it was the initial evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit . At the annual conference of 1908 , Crumpler was re @-@ elected president of the body ; however , with a majority of the delegates having experienced tongues , he permanently disaffiliated himself from the church . After Crumpler 's departure , the conference added an article to the statement of faith , recognizing tongues as the initial evidence : 
 We believe the pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire is obtainable by a definite act of appropriating faith on the part of the fully cleansed believer , and the initial evidence of the reception of this experience is speaking with other tongues as the Spirit gives utterance ( Luke 11 : 13 ; Acts 1 : 5 ; 2 : 1 @-@ 4 ; 8 : 17 ; 10 : 44 @-@ 46 ; 19 : 6 ) . 
 The PHC Foreign Mission Board was formed in 1904 , and its members were all women . In 1907 , Tom J. McIntosh , a PHC member , traveled to China and may have been the first Pentecostal missionary to reach that nation . 
 = = = Mergers and schisms = = = 
 The Fire @-@ Baptized Holiness Association also embraced Pentecostalism around the same time , taking the line that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was the " baptism of fire " that it had been seeking . Given the similarities in doctrine and geographic reach with the Pentecostal Holiness Church , the two groups began talks on a merger . The two groups merged on January 30 , 1911 , at the Falcon Tabernacle in Falcon , North Carolina . The new denomination took the name of the smaller of the two , Pentecostal Holiness Church . S.D. Page was elected the first General Superintendent . 
 Following the 1911 merger , the Tabernacle Pentecostal Church , originally the <unk> Presbyterian Church , merged with the Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1915 . Having Presbyterian roots and located mostly in South Carolina , this group of around 15 congregations was affiliated with Nickles Holmes Bible College in Greenville . After the mergers , the new denomination , which continued to go by the name Pentecostal Holiness Church , had about 200 churches with approximately 5 @,@ 000 members . Property for the denomination 's first headquarters was purchased in 1918 for $ 9 @,@ 000 in Franklin Springs , Georgia . 
 In 1918 , several PHC members who wanted stricter standards concerning dress , amusements , tobacco , and association between the sexes withdrew to form the Pentecostal Fire @-@ Baptized Holiness Church . In 1920 , another schism came into the Pentecostal Holiness Church over divine healing and the use of medicine . Some pastors believed that while divine healing was provided in the atonement , Christians still had the right to turn to medicine and doctors . The majority of the <unk> did many Pentecostals of the <unk> in trusting God for healing without turning to earthly means . The minority withdrew and formed the Congregational Holiness Church in 1921 . 
 = = = Further development = = = 
 The Pentecostal Holiness Church was a charter member of the National Association of Evangelicals in 1943 and joined the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America in 1948 . At the general conference a year later an attempt at merging with the mostly black United Holy Church failed when the United Holy Church asked if their members could attend the church 's schools and colleges . 
 In the 1960s , the Pentecostal Holiness Church began to branch out beyond the United States by affiliating with sister Pentecostal bodies in other parts of the world . In 1967 , an affiliation was formed with the Pentecostal Methodist Church of Chile , one of the largest national Pentecostal churches in the world and the largest non @-@ Catholic church in Chile . At the time , the <unk> Pentecostal Methodist congregation was the largest church in the world with over 60 @,@ 000 members . With over 150 @,@ 000 members , it ranks second to the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul , South Korea . This denomination claims 1 @.@ 7 million adherents . A similar affiliation was forged in 1985 with the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Brazil . A Neo @-@ Pentecostal body with roots in the Brazilian Methodist Church , the Wesleyan Church numbered some 50 @,@ 000 members and adherents in 1995 . The word International was added to the church 's name in 1975 .

 In January 2011 , the PHC celebrated the 1911 merger centennial with special events at Falcon , North Carolina . 
 = = Doctrine = = 
 The doctrine of the Pentecostal Holiness Church is articulated in the Apostles ' Creed and the Articles of Faith . The Articles were placed in their present form in 1945 . The first four articles are essentially the same as the first four Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church . 
 The IPHC believes in common evangelical beliefs , including the Trinity , the dual nature of Christ , his crucifixion for the forgiving of sins , his resurrection and ascension to heaven , the inerrancy of the Bible , a literal belief in heaven and hell , and the responsibility of every believer to carry out the Great Commission . The church holds water baptism and communion ( open communion observed quarterly ) to be divine ordinances . Though not considered an ordinance , some of the churches also engage in the practice of feet washing . In baptism ceremonies , the church allows its members to " have the right of choice between the various modes as practised by the several evangelical denominations " , including infant baptism . 
 = = = Cardinal doctrines = = = 
 Since the adoption of the article of faith on the baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1908 , the Pentecostal Holiness Church has taught the following beliefs as their five cardinal doctrines : justification by faith , entire sanctification , the baptism in the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues , Christ 's atonement ( including divine healing ) , and the premillennial second coming of Christ . 
 = = = = Justification by faith = = = = 
 The Pentecostal Holiness Church believes that no amount of good works can achieve justification or salvation . This is achieved only " on the basis of our faith in the shed blood , the resurrection , and the justifying righteousness " of Christ . Good works , however , are a product of salvation . " When we believe on Jesus Christ as our Savior , our sins are pardoned , we are justified , and we enter a state of righteousness , not our own , but His , both imputed and imparted " . 
 = = = = Sanctification = = = = 
 As a holiness church , the PHC believes that for the Christian there is not only justification and forgiveness for actual transgressions but also " complete cleansing of the justified believer from all indwelling sin and from its pollution . " This cleansing is not " maturity " but a " crisis experience " and a " definite , instantaneous work of grace , obtainable by faith . " The church recognizes that there is maturity and growth in the life of the believer , but states that " we must get into this grace before we can grow in it . " The sanctified life is described as " one of separation from the world , a selfless life , a life of devotion to all the will of God , a life of holiness ... a life controlled by ' perfect love ' which ' <unk> out fear . ' " The Pentecostal Holiness Church specifically rejects absolute perfection , angelic perfection , and sinless perfection — terms that imply that it is impossible for a sanctified believer to commit sin . 
 = = = = Baptism with the Holy Spirit = = = = 
 As a Pentecostal church , the PHC believes the " baptism with the Holy Ghost and fire is obtainable by a definite act of appropriating faith on the part of the fully cleansed believer . " Spirit baptism is available to all believers and provides empowerment to witness for Christ . To receive the baptism , a person must have a " clean heart and life " and to " live in the fullness of the Holy Spirit 's power and possession , one must continue to live a clean and consecrated life , free from sin , strife , worldliness , and pride , and must avoid attitudes and actions that tend to ' grieve ' or ' quench ' the Holy Spirit . " 
 The Pentecostal Holiness Church distinguishes the initial evidence of Spirit baptism - which all believers experience when Spirit baptized - from the gift of tongues , which is not given to every Spirit @-@ filled believer . Speaking in tongues is only the first sign of Spirit baptism . Other evidence that will follow Spirit baptism include : the fruit of the Spirit , power to witness for Christ , and power to endure the <unk> of faith and the oppositions of the world . Besides speaking in tongues , other spiritual gifts recorded in the Bible ( specifically in 1 Corinthians 12 , 13 , and 14 ) are encouraged to operate in Pentecostal Holiness congregations for the edification of the Body of Christ . 
 = = = = Divine healing = = = = 
 The PHC believes that " provision was made in the atonement for the healing of our bodies " . Congregations will pray for the healing of sick people and church elders will lay hands on and anoint the person being prayed over . While in its early years the Pentecostal Holiness were against receiving medical care , emphasizing divine healing , that is not the case today . The church teaches that Christians should believe in divine healing but also teaches that medical knowledge comes to humanity through God 's grace . 
 = = = = Second Coming = = = = 
 The PHC believes in the imminent , personal , premillennial second coming of Jesus Christ . It will occur in two stages : the first stage will be the rapture of the saints before the Tribulation , and the second stage will be at the end of the Tribulation when Christ will return to defeat the Antichrist , judge the nations of the world , and begin his millennial reign . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Reflecting its Methodist heritage , the IPHC is governed under the principles of <unk> , a mixed system of episcopal and congregational polity . Authority in the church is shared between local churches , quadrennial conferences , and the General Conference . 
 Pentecostal Holiness congregations are self @-@ governing in local affairs and are led by pastors . The pastor preaches , administers the ordinances , and promotes the " spiritual welfare " of congregants . Furthermore , the pastor is the chairman of the church board . Other than the pastor , the church board consists of deacons and a secretary / treasurer elected by the church members . The board is accountable to the pastor and church members , and pastors are accountable to the quadrennial conferences . 
 Geographically , churches are organized into conferences led by conference superintendents . In their spiritual roles , superintendents function as bishops , and in their administrative roles they act as chief executive officers of their conference . All conference leaders are elected by their local conference but are accountable to the General Superintendent . 
 The General Conference is the highest administrative body in the church . Under it are regional , annual , district , and missionary conferences . When the General Conference is out of session , the General Board of Administration acts as the church 's governing body . In the IPHC , the terms " bishop " and " superintendent " are used interchangeably . The church recognizes the biblical office of bishop but does not believe in an historical episcopate or adhere to the doctrine of apostolic succession . The General Superintendent and Presiding Bishop , Dr. A. Doug Beacham , Jr . , was elected in 2012 . 
 = = Educational and charitable institutions = = 
 The IPHC has five affiliated institutions of higher education and operates several charitable organizations . The IPHC colleges are Emmanuel College in Franklin Springs , Georgia ; Holmes Bible College in Greenville , South Carolina ; Southwestern Christian University in Bethany , Oklahoma ; and Advantage College in San Jose , California . Charitable organizations include the Falcon Children 's Home , Alternative to Abortion Ministries , New Life Adoption Agency , and The Children 's Center . 
 = White @-@ headed capuchin = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin ( Cebus capucinus ) , also known as the white @-@ faced capuchin or white @-@ throated capuchin , is a medium @-@ sized New World monkey of the family Cebidae , subfamily <unk> . Native to the forests of Central America and the extreme north @-@ western portion of South America , the white @-@ headed capuchin is important to rainforest ecology for its role in dispersing seeds and pollen . 
 Among the best known monkeys , the white @-@ headed capuchin is recognized as the typical companion to the organ grinder . In recent years the species has become popular in North American media . It is a highly intelligent monkey and has been trained to assist paraplegic persons . It is a medium @-@ sized monkey , weighing up to 3 @.@ 9 kg ( 8 @.@ 6 lb ) . It is mostly black , but with a pink face and white on much of the front part of the body , giving it its common name . It has a distinctive prehensile tail that is often carried coiled up and is used to help support the monkey when it is feeding beneath a branch . 
 In the wild , the white @-@ headed capuchin is versatile , living in many different types of forest , and eating many different types of food , including fruit , other plant material , invertebrates , and small vertebrates . It lives in troops that can exceed 20 animals and include both males and females . It is noted for its tool use , including rubbing plants over its body in an apparent use of herbal medicine , and also using tools as weapons and for getting to food . It is a long @-@ lived monkey , with a maximum recorded age of over 44 years . 
 White @-@ headed capuchins are highly social , living in groups of 16 individuals on average , about three quarters of which are females . Groups consists of related females , immigrant males , and offspring . On average , females birth offspring every 27 months even though they mate throughout the year . Females tend to stay within their original group while males leave their natal group when they are 4 years old and change groups every 4 years after . Both male and female capuchins exhibit different dominance behaviors within the group . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work , Systema Naturae . It is a member of the family Cebidae , the family of New World monkeys containing capuchin monkeys , squirrel monkeys , tamarins and marmosets . It is the type species for the genus Cebus , the genus that includes all the capuchin monkeys . It is a member of the C. capucinus species group within the genus Cebus , a group that also includes the white @-@ fronted capuchin , the weeper capuchin and the <unk> capuchin . 
 There is disagreement among primatologists about whether there are any subspecies of white @-@ headed capuchin . Some authorities consider there to be three subspecies of white @-@ headed capuchin , based on small differences in appearance : 
 C. c. capucinus , from the southern part of the range in Ecuador , Colombia and eastern Panama 
 C. c. imitator , from most of Nicaragua , Costa Rica and western Panama 
 C. c. <unk> , from Honduras and northern Nicaragua 
 However , other authorities do not recognize any separate subspecies , and regard C. c. imitator and C. c. <unk> as synonyms of C. capucinus . 
 = = Physical description = = 
 Like other monkeys in the genus Cebus , the white @-@ headed capuchin is named after the order of Capuchin friars – the cowls of these friars closely resemble the monkey 's head coloration . The white @-@ headed capuchin has mostly black fur , with white to yellow like fur on the neck , throat , chest , shoulders , and upper arms . The face is pink or a white @-@ cream color and may have identifying marks such as dark brows or dark fur patches . An area of black fur on the crown of the head is distinctive . It has a prehensile tail that is often held coiled , giving the white @-@ headed capuchin the nickname " ringtail " . 
 Adults reach a length of between 335 and 453 mm ( 13 @.@ 2 and 17 @.@ 8 in ) , excluding tail , and a weight of up to 3 @.@ 9 kg ( 8 @.@ 6 lb ) . The tail is longer than the body , at up to 551 mm ( 21 @.@ 7 in ) in length . Males are about 27 % larger than females . The brain of a white @-@ headed capuchin is about 79 @.@ 2 g ( 2 @.@ 79 oz ) , which is larger than that of several larger monkey species , such as the mantled howler . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Social structure = = = 
 The white @-@ headed capuchin is a diurnal and arboreal animal . However , it does come down to the ground more often than many other New World monkeys . It moves primarily by walking on all four limbs . It lives in troops , or groups , of up to 40 monkeys ( mean 16 , range 4 – 40 ) and has a male / female adult sex ratio of 0 @.@ 71 on average ( range 0 @.@ 54 – 0 @.@ 88 ) . With rare exceptions , females spend their entire lives with their female kin . Males migrate to new social groups multiple times during the course of their lifetimes , migrating for the first time between 20 months and 11 years of age . The median age of migration in the Santa Rosa population is 4 @.@ 5 years . Males sometimes migrate alone , but more often they migrate in the company of other males who are often their kin . One of the unusual features of the kinship structure of the white @-@ headed capuchin , relative to other primate species , is the high degree of relatedness within groups that results from the long tenures of alpha males who sire most of the offspring . Alpha males have been known to keep their positions as long as 17 years in this species and this puts them in the unusual position of being available to sire the offspring of their daughters and granddaughters , who produce their first offspring at about 6 – 7 years of age . Typically , however , alpha males do not breed with their own daughters , even though they do sire virtually all offspring produced by females unrelated to them . Those subordinate males who are allies of the alpha male in group defense are the males who sire the offspring of the alpha male 's daughters . The high degree to which alpha males monopolize matings results in an unusually large number of paternal half @-@ siblings and full siblings in this species relative to other primate species . 
 Kinship is an important organizing factor in the structuring of female @-@ female social relationships . Particularly in larger groups , females preferentially associate with , groom , and provide <unk> support to their matrilineally related female kin . They do not exhibit a similar preference for their paternal half sisters , which may mean that they only are capable of recognizing kinship through the maternal line . Dominance rank is also an important organizing factor , with females more often grooming and associating with females who are closer to them in the dominance hierarchy . Female @-@ female dyads groom far more than male @-@ female and male @-@ male dyads . <unk> aggression is common both among males and females , and capuchins seem to have an excellent understanding of the alliance structure in their group . For example , when capuchins are fighting , they sensibly recruit aid from someone who is both higher ranking than they are and also better friends with themselves than with their opponent . 
 Female capuchins have linear dominance hierarchies . In contrast to many Old World monkeys such as macaques , in which females socially inherit the rank just below their mothers and just above their next oldest sisters , capuchins do not have a highly predictable ranking within their matrilines . Males are typically dominant to females . The alpha male is always easy to discern , but there are sometimes ambiguous rankings among subordinate males . Male @-@ male relationships are tense , and affiliation between males is typically expressed by resting in contact , playing , or non @-@ <unk> sex rather than by grooming . Males cooperate in coalitions against potential predators , and also in defense of the group against other males . Occasionally male <unk> aggression becomes so violent that males are killed , particularly if they are encountered roaming the forest unaccompanied by allies . Because aggression from other male capuchins is the leading cause of death ( aside from poaching by humans , where there is contact between humans and capuchins ) , male allies are critical for self @-@ defense during migration , and to assist in taking over other groups . Male emigration to a new troop typically occurs about every 4 years , so most males are in constant danger of having to defend themselves against other groups of males . 
 <unk> males often kill young infants when they take over a group . Females band together to defend their infants from infanticidal males , but they rarely succeed in saving their infants . Because infants inhibit their mothers from ovulating by nursing frequently , males are able to bring females into estrus earlier by killing the infants and thereby terminating nursing ; this has the effect of increasing their breeding opportunities . Females do often mate with the killers of their infants , and with time , they typically become as supportive of the new alpha male as they had been of the previous one . The alpha male helps defend females from subordinate males within the group as well as from infanticidal males from other groups .
