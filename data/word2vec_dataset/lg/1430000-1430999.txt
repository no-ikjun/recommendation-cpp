 Winschoten ( Dutch pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; abbreviation : Ws ) is an unstaffed railway station in Winschoten in the Netherlands . It is located on the Harlingen – Nieuweschans railway between Scheemda and Bad Nieuweschans in the province of Groningen . 
 The station building , designed by Karel Hendrik van <unk> , was completed in 1865 and expanded in 1904 . Train services started on 1 May 1868 and have since been provided by Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen ( 1868 – 1937 ) , Nederlandse Spoorwegen ( 1938 – 2000 ) , NoordNed ( 2000 – 2005 ) , and Arriva ( 2005 – present ) . During World War II , 500 Jews were transported from the station via the Westerbork transit camp to Nazi concentration camps , where most of them were killed . 
 The station has three tracks and two platforms . As of 2016 there are two local train services with trains every half an hour to and from Groningen , and trains every hour to and from Bad Nieuweschans and Leer ( Germany ) . The station handles 2 @,@ 500 rail passengers on an average weekday . There is a park and ride area for cars and bicycles , and a bus station with eleven regional services provided by <unk> . 
 = = Location = = 
 The railway station is located at the <unk> in the city of Winschoten , part of the municipality of Oldambt , in the east of the province of Groningen in the northeast of the Netherlands . It is situated on the Harlingen – Nieuweschans railway , also called Staatslijn B , between the railway stations of Scheemda in the west and Bad Nieuweschans in the east , both also in the municipality of Oldambt . The <unk> railway stop was between Scheemda and Winschoten from 1908 to 1934 , and the <unk> railway stop was between Winschoten and Nieuweschans from 1887 to 1938 . The railway connects via Zuidbroek and Groningen to the rest of the Dutch railway network in the west ; and via Bad Nieuweschans to the German railway network in the east . The distance from Winschoten westward to railway terminus Harlingen Haven is 115 km ( 71 mi ) , to Groningen 34 km ( 21 mi ) , to Zuidbroek 12 km ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) , and to Scheemda 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , and eastward to Bad Nieuweschans is 12 km ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1860 , the Dutch government passed a law for the construction of ten state railways ( Dutch : <unk> ) . The Harlingen – Nieuweschans railway or Staatslijn B was opened between 1863 and 1868 . The first part between Harlingen Haven and Leeuwarden was opened in 1863 and the second part between Leeuwarden and Groningen in 1865 . 
 The station building in Winschoten was completed in 1865 . The third part of Staatslijn B between Groningen and Winschoten was opened on 1 May 1868 . Trains were initially operated by the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen ( Company for the Exploitation of the State Railways ) . Services between Winschoten and Nieuweschans started in November 1868 , and between Nieuweschans and Leer in Germany in December 1876 , when the Harlingen – Nieuweschans railway was connected to the Ihrhove – Nieuweschans railway . 
 In 1904 , the station building was expanded with a porch and additional waiting room . From 1938 to 2000 , train services were provided by the Nederlandse Spoorwegen ( Netherlands Railways ) , when the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen merged with the Hollandsche <unk> <unk> @-@ Maatschappij ( <unk> Iron Railroad Company ) . In 1942 , during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II , approximately 500 Jews from Winschoten were transported by train to the Westerbork transit camp and from there to Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Poland , where 446 of them were killed . As a result of the war , the German border at the railway was closed for passenger transport from 1944 to 1954 . In 1967 , the roofed bus station was built next to the station building . In the last quarter of the 20th century , the station building 's porch was replaced . 
 From 1999 onwards , other railway companies received concessions for the northern railway lines of the Netherlands . NoordNed , a joint venture of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen and Arriva , provided the railway services to and from Winschoten between 2000 and 2005 . The Ihrhove – Nieuweschans railway was closed for major renovations in the years 2000 – 2002 . Arriva bought all shares of NoordNed in 2003 , and rebranded the services as Arriva in 2005 . In 2013 – 2015 , the station building was restored to its state of 1904 as part of a larger project to improve the quality and functionality of the station area . The Ihrhove – Nieuweschans railway has been closed since December 2015 because a railway bridge near <unk> was destroyed in a collision with the ship <unk> . Until the bridge is replaced , Arriva is providing a rail replacement bus service between Bad Nieuweschans and Leer . 
 = = Building and layout = = 
 The 19th @-@ century station building is owned by NS Stations . It is of the type SS 3rd class , which was designed by Karel Hendrik van <unk> . SS 3rd class was chosen instead of the smaller SS 4th class because of the importance of Winschoten as a commercial center . Eight buildings of SS 3rd class were completed in the Netherlands between 1862 and 1865 , of which four remain today . This building of 1865 has a median <unk> and wings on both sides parallel to the railway . The facade on the city side and railway side are identical , except for a half round decoration on the city side . The doors and windows of the building have arched frames . In the 1904 expansion , an enclosed porch was added and the east wing was extended with an extra waiting room . 
 The railway through Winschoten is unelectrified and oriented west to east . At the station , the single @-@ track railway splits into three tracks , with the station building on the north side . Platform 1 is on the northern side of the northern track , serving trains towards Groningen , and is partly covered by a roof attached to the station building . Platform 2 , serving trains towards Bad Nieuweschans and Leer is on the northern side of the central track , and is accessed via a level crossing from platform 1 . The platforms have shelters , wheelchair ramps , tactile paving and dynamic passenger information . The southern track has no platform and serves as a passing loop . Beyond the station the tracks merge back into a single track . 
 West of the station building is a free park and ride ( Dutch : <unk> en <unk> ) area with 120 car parking spaces and 320 bicycle stands at the station . There are also subscription @-@ only bicycle lockers and a subscription @-@ only bicycle rental service . There is a tunnel for cyclists and pedestrians underneath the tracks and platforms to the south side of the city . East of the station building is a roofed bus station which is owned by Arriva . There is also a taxicab stand at the station .

 = Brachychiton rupestris = 
 Brachychiton rupestris , commonly known as the narrow @-@ leaved bottle tree or Queensland bottle tree , is a tree in the family Malvaceae native to Queensland , Australia . Discovered and described by Sir Thomas Mitchell and John Lindley in 1848 , it gained its name from its bulbous trunk , which can be up to 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) diameter at breast height ( DBH ) . Reaching 10 – 25 metres ( 33 – 82 ft ) high , the Queensland bottle tree is deciduous , losing its leaves between September and December . The leaves are simple or divided , with one or more narrow leaf blades up to 11 centimetres ( 4 in ) long and 2 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) wide . Cream @-@ coloured flowers appear from September to November , and are followed by woody boat @-@ shaped follicles that ripen from November to May . No subspecies are recognised . 
 As a drought @-@ deciduous succulent tree , B. rupestris adapts readily to cultivation and is tolerant of a range of soils and temperatures . It is a key component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi @-@ evergreen vine thickets — also known as <unk> scrub — of the Queensland Brigalow Belt . Remnant trees are often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees . 
 = = Description = = 
 Brachychiton rupestris grows as a succulent tree reaching 10 – 20 metres ( 33 – 66 ft ) ( rarely 25 metres ( 82 ft ) ) in height , though plants in cultivation are usually shorter . The thick trunk is 5 – 15 metres ( 16 – 49 ft ) tall , with a 1 – 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 3 @.@ 3 – 11 @.@ 5 ft ) diameter at breast height ( DBH ) . It has dark grey bark and is marked by shallow tessellation and deeper fissures . Smaller branches are light green or grey , as are the trunks of immature trees . Like those of all members of the genus , the leaves are alternately arranged along the stems . 
 B. rupestris is deciduous . Trees in their native habitat are typically leafless between September and December ; the timing , duration and extent of leaf drop may be affected by extremes of rainfall or drought . Sometimes trees shed leaves from only some branches . On every tree , the leaves vary in shape , ranging from narrow and elliptic to deeply divided . The upper surface is glossy , contrasting with a pale undersurface . The adult leaf blades are 4 – 11 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 3 in ) long and 0 @.@ 8 – 2 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) wide with pointed ( acuminate or apiculate ) tips . They have a raised midrib on the upper and lower surface , with 12 – 25 pairs of lateral veins that are more prominent on the upper surface , arising at 50 – 60 degrees from the midrib . The compound juvenile leaves have 3 – 9 spear @-@ shaped ( lanceolate ) or linear lobes . These each measure 4 – 14 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) long and 0 @.@ 3 – 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) wide . 
 <unk> of creamy @-@ yellow flowers with red markings appear from September to November in the species ' native range . These arise from axillary buds on end branches . Each panicle contains 10 – 30 flowers and is 3 – 8 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) long , and each flower is 0 @.@ 5 – 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) long and 1 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 8 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 7 in ) wide . The length of the lobes of the perianth is more than half the perianth diameter . Like all Brachychiton species , B. rupestris is monoecious — each plant has distinct male and female flowers . Male flowers have 15 stamens , with pale yellow anthers , while female flowers have cream or white stigmas surrounded by rudimentary stellate ( star @-@ shaped ) carpels , which sit atop the ovaries . 
 Groups of 3 to 5 woody boat @-@ shaped follicles , each containing 4 to 8 ( or occasionally up to 12 ) seeds , develop from November to May . The follicles , smooth on the outer surface and hairy inside , split along their length to reveal seeds . The seeds , which are ovoid with a smooth surface , and 6 – 7 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 28 in ) long by 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 14 – 0 @.@ 18 in ) wide , are covered by a hairy coating known as the <unk> . 
 The closely related Proserpine bottle tree ( Brachychiton compactus ) that occurs only in the vicinity of the town of Proserpine can be distinguished by its more oval leaves , more compact flower heads , and longer ellipsoid follicles .

 The species came to the attention of the scientific community when explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell observed the trees on his expedition through Queensland in 1848 and published an account in Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia in the same year . He came across them as he ascended Mount Abundance near present @-@ day Roma , remarking that " The trunk bulged out in the middle like a barrel , to nearly twice the diameter at the ground , or of that at the first springing of the branches above . These were small in proportion to their great girth , and the whole tree looked very odd In the same publication , English botanist John Lindley provided the first formal description . Lindley placed it in the genus Delabechea as the sole representative — Delabechea rupestris . The genus name was selected by Mitchell to honor the director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain , Henry De la Beche , while the Latin specific epithet rupestris ( meaning living among rocks ) alludes to the rocky hilltop habitat of specimens observed by Mitchell . Ferdinand von Mueller , the Government Botanist in Victoria , renamed it Brachychiton <unk> in 1862 , incorporating the genus Delabechea into Brachychiton . 
 In his landmark Flora Australiensis , English botanist George Bentham published the first key for the nine described species of Brachychiton , and relegated them to a section of Sterculia . Hence the Queensland bottle tree became Sterculia rupestris . Von Mueller maintained his recognition of Brachychiton as a separate genus . German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Sterculia in 1891 , on the grounds that the name <unk> took precedence . He republished the Queensland bottle tree as <unk> rupestris . German botanist Karl Moritz Schumann gave it its current binomial name in 1893 , which was accepted by Achille <unk> of the Orto botanico di Palermo and subsequent authorities , and remains current . 
 In 1988 Gordon <unk> of the Queensland Herbarium published a taxonomic revision of Brachychiton ; he classified B. rupestris in the section Delabechea along with the related and newly described Proserpine bottle tree . A third species , from southeast Queensland , has been recognised but not yet described . Unique to the section , all three species have bulbous trunks and can have large cavities in the vertical wood parenchyma . The genus Brachychiton lies within an Australasian clade within the subfamily <unk> ( previously family <unk> ) in a large broadly defined Malvaceae . It is only distantly related to Sterculia , belonging to a different clade within the <unk> . 
 The name of the genus is derived from the Greek brachys , short , and <unk> , tunic , a reference to the loose seed coats . Brachychiton was for many years misconstrued as being of neuter gender — first by the genus describers Heinrich Wilhelm Schott and Stephan Endlicher and later by von Mueller and others — with the specific names then incorrectly amended . Thus the bottle tree 's binomial was recorded as Brachychiton <unk> , now regarded as an orthographical variant . Besides " Queensland bottle tree " , common names for the species include " narrow @-@ leaved bottle tree " and " bottle tree " . 
 Brachychiton x <unk> is a naturally occurring hybrid cross of B. rupestris with the kurrajong B. <unk> subsp. <unk> . It is particularly prevalent east of <unk> . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Brachychiton rupestris is found in central Queensland from latitude 22 ° S to 28 ° S , with the western limits of its range defined by the 500 mm rainfall isohyet . It grows on the tops and slopes of hills or ridges in low hilly country , in clay , shale , or basalt soils . It is an emergent tree in forests dominated by <unk> ( Acacia <unk> ) , hoop pine ( Araucaria cunninghamii ) , or <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . It is always present in the Central semi @-@ evergreen vine thicket — also known as <unk> Scrub — of the Brigalow Belt . Other common species include broad @-@ leaved bottle tree ( Brachychiton australis ) and <unk> ( Casuarina cristata ) . The bottle tree is replaced by the kurrajong in similar communities in New South Wales . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Although the species status under Queensland 's Nature Conservation Act is " least concern " , it is an emergent tree species in an endangered ecosystem known as " semi @-@ evergreen vine thickets of the Brigalow Belt ( North and South ) and <unk> bioregions " , listed under the Commonwealth EPBC Act , and is declining across its range . Furthermore , the health of trees in cleared areas may be compromised . The species is conserved within its natural habitat in a number of National Parks including Auburn River , <unk> , Bunya Mountains , Coalstoun Lakes , <unk> , Good Night Scrub , Humboldt , Isla Gorge and <unk> . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Brachychiton rupestris has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species <unk> glabrescens . Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton <unk> bug , a pest of cotton crops , and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves , within which it then pupates . Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black @-@ breasted buttonquail . Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Aboriginal people made use of the trees through eating the roots of young plants and by consuming secretions from the trunk that were induced by wounds . Fibre obtained from the species was used to make nets . The leaves have also been used for fodder , and Queensland farmers often leave bottle trees as a potential food source when land is cleared . During drought conditions , whole trees have been felled to feed stock . The soft edible pulp inside the trunk is exposed by removing the bark . The pulp is energy @-@ rich but protein @-@ poor , and occasional cases of nitrate poisoning have led to cattle deaths . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Bottle trees are commonly found planted in streets and parks , on farms , and as features in gardens . An avenue in Roma , Queensland , was planted between 1918 and 1920 , each tree representing one of 93 local men killed in World War I. The species has been cultivated as an indoor plant and a bonsai subject . 
 Bottle trees grow best in well @-@ drained , slightly acidic soil , in full sunshine . They are suited to cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12 . In the first stages of growth , the bottle tree is very slow @-@ growing , and the formation of the unique bottle shape is not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old . Mature trees transplant easily , and can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment . Bottle trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower . Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared . 
 Plants are readily propagated from seed . As seed is surrounded by irritating hairs within the pod , extraction requires care . Stem cuttings of semi @-@ mature growth can be taken in late summer and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat . 
 = Nótt = 
 In Norse mythology , Nótt ( Old Norse " night " ) is night personified , grandmother of Thor . In both the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources , and the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , Nótt is listed as the daughter of a figure by the name of Nörvi ( with variant spellings ) and is associated with the horse Hrímfaxi , while the Prose Edda features information about Nótt 's ancestry , including her three marriages . Nótt 's third marriage was to the god Dellingr and this resulted in their son Dagr , the personified day ( although some manuscript variations list Jörð as Dellingr 's wife and Dagr 's mother instead ) . As a proper noun , the word <unk> appears throughout Old Norse literature .

 = = = Poetic Edda = = = 
 In stanza 24 of the poem Vafþrúðnismál , the god Odin ( disguised as " Gagnráðr " ) asks the jötunn Vafþrúðnir from where the day comes , and the night and its tides . In stanza 25 , Vafþrúðnir responds : 
 Delling hight he who the day 's father is , 
 but night was of Nörvi born ; 
 the new and waning moons the beneficent powers created , 
 to count the years for men . 
 In stanza 14 of the Vafþrúðnismál , Odin states that the horse Hrímfaxi " draws every night to the beneficent gods " and that he lets foam from his bit fall every morning , from which dew comes to the valleys . In stanza 30 of the poem Alvíssmál , the god Thor asks the dwarf Alvíss to tell him what night is called in each of the nine worlds , whom " <unk> " birthed . Alvíss responds that night is referred as " night " by mankind , " darkness " by the gods , " the <unk> " by the mighty Powers , " <unk> " by the jötunn , " joy @-@ of @-@ sleep " by the elves , while dwarves call her " dream @-@ <unk> " ( meaning " dream @-@ goddess " ) . 
 In Sigrdrífumál , after the valkyrie Sigrdrífa is woken from her sleep curse by the hero Sigurd , Sigurd asks her name , and she gives him a " memory @-@ drink " of a drinking horn full of mead , and then <unk> says a heathen prayer . The first verse of this prayer features a reference to the " sons of Dagr " and the " daughter of Nótt " : 
 Hail to the Day ! Hail to the sons of Day ! 
 To Night and her daughter hail ! 
 With placid eyes behold us here , 
 and here sitting give us victory . 
 Hail to the Æsir ! Hail to the Asyniur ! 
 Hail to the bounteous earth ! 
 Words and wisdom give to us noble twain , 
 and healing hands while we live ! 
 = = = Prose Edda = = = 
 In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning , Nótt is again personified . In chapter 10 , the enthroned figure of High states that Nótt is the daughter of a jötunn from Jötunheimr by the name of " <unk> or Narfi " . Nótt is described as " black and swarthy " , and has had three marriages . Her first marriage was with <unk> , and the two produced a son by the name of <unk> . Nótt 's second marriage was to <unk> , resulting in their daughter Jörð , the personified earth . Finally , Nótt marries the god Dellingr , and the couple have Dagr , who takes after his " father 's people " in brightness and fairness . Odin took Nótt and her son Dagr , placed them into the sky with a chariot and a horse each , and they ride around the earth every 24 hours . Nótt rides before Dagr , and foam from her horse Hrímfaxi 's bit sprinkles the earth . 
 However , scholar Haukur Thorgeirsson points out that the four manuscripts of Gylfaginning vary in their descriptions of the family relations between Nótt , Jörð , Dagr , and Dellingr . In other words , depending on the manuscript , either Jörð or <unk> is the mother of Dagr and partner of Dellingr . Haukur details that " the oldest manuscript , U , offers a version where Jǫrð is the wife of Dellingr and the mother of Dagr while the other manuscripts , R , W and T , cast Nótt in the role of Dellingr 's wife and Dagr 's mother " , and argues that " the version in U came about accidentally when the writer of U or its antecedent shortened a text similar to that in RWT . The results of this accident made their way into the Icelandic poetic tradition " . 
 In the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , means of referring to Jörð are provided , including " daughter of Nótt " . Chapter 58 states that " <unk> or <unk> draw the night " , and in chapter 64 , " <unk> " is stated as one of various words for time and a version of the Alvíssmál passage is cited . 
 = Syaoran ( Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle ) = 
 Syaoran ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a fictional character and protagonist in Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle , a manga series written and illustrated by Clamp . Syaoran is introduced as a young archaeologist who is in love with Sakura , his childhood friend and the princess from the Kingdom of Clow . When Sakura 's memories are scattered throughout parallel dimensions , Syaoran goes on a quest to recover them , at the cost of Sakura never remembering him . Later in the series , Syaoran is revealed to be a clone created by Fei @-@ Wang Reed — the sorcerer who caused Sakura to lose her memories . As a seal from his original self placed on the clone 's body breaks , Syaoran becomes one of the series ' antagonists , moving according to Fei @-@ Wang 's will . Syaoran has featured in other works by Clamp , including the manga xxxHolic and the drama CD series <unk> . 
 Syaoran 's character is based on Syaoran Li , a character from Clamp 's Cardcaptor Sakura manga and had several changes to appeal to the series ' demographic . The character has been well received by readers of the series , placing high in popularity polls from Tsubasa and manga and anime series in general . He also received positive comments by manga and anime publications . Syaoran 's role as an antagonist has also received positive comments ; some writers use nicknames to differentiate his antagonistic self from his original self , often calling him evil .

 Syaoran is introduced in Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle as a young archaeologist who often visits the Kingdom of Clow and is in love with his childhood friend Sakura , the kingdom 's princess . Syaoran is the adopted son of the late archeologist <unk> , who found him as a child in the street with no memories of his past . Syaoran often accompanied his father on expeditions , and following his father 's death , he lived alone while continuing his father 's job . After Sakura 's memories are scattered in the form of feathers throughout many dimensions , Syaoran meets Yūko Ichihara , a witch who gives him , Fai D. Flowright , and Kurogane — her other clients — Mokona Modoki ; a creature that can transport them to different dimensions . Syaoran pays Yūko for the use of Mokona with all of Sakura 's memories that involved him . 
 Throughout the journey , Syaoran starts bonding with Sakura again , and becomes friends with Fai , Kurogane , and Mokona . Syaoran specializes in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , mainly focusing on kicks taught by hunter Seishirō during his childhood when he had no visual perception of depth because he was blind in his right eye . He later trains blindfolded with Kurogane to overcome this weakness . Kurogane also teaches him <unk> to make him a stronger fighter , and he gains Hien ( <unk> , lit . " Scarlet Flame " ) — a sword with magical properties that allow it to create fire . 
 Syaoran is a clone of another teenager ; the sorcerer Fei @-@ Wang Reed created the clone to find Sakura 's feathers . The original Syaoran placed some of his " heart " within the clone 's right eye , allowing the clone to develop his own personality . After the seal breaks , Syaoran loses all his emotions and Fei @-@ Wang uses him to collect feathers in other dimensions on his own , betraying his friends . Syaoran becomes immune to pain , which makes him ruthless and strong . Before leaving his former friends , he devours Fai 's left eye to gain his own magic powers , which grow stronger every time he uses them . When fighting his original self , Syaoran destroys Sakura 's soul — which is revealed as another clone who asks Syaoran to recover his heart just before disappearing . Despite being shocked by this , Syaoran is again emotionless when the original Syaoran , Kurogane and Fai go to fight Fei @-@ Wang . In the course of the battle , Syaoran betrays Fei @-@ Wang to help his original self kill him . When Fei @-@ Wang tries to kill the original Syaoran , the clone intervenes and is impaled by Fei @-@ Wang 's sword . As his body is about to be destroyed , Syaoran apologizes to his friends — including the original Syaoran — leaving only the eye he took from Fai . 
 Yūko later rebuilds Syaoran 's and Sakura 's bodies using the remnants left after their apparent deaths . As neither could properly die , Yūko grants their wishes to be reborn as normal humans , which Syaoran accepts because Sakura tells him she wants to stay with him . As both grow up as normal humans , they meet and live together . He and Sakura have a son , who is the original Syaoran , creating a time paradox . Because they realize that all the previous events would be repeated and their son would not be able to save the original Sakura , they seal themselves inside a glass tube hidden in Yūko 's shop . Being reborn as a descendant of the sorcerer Clow Reed , Syaoran and Sakura break free from the tube and use their new powers to help their friends defeat Fei @-@ Wang . As their creator dies , Syaoran and Sakura vanish , leaving two feathers that merge within their original selves ' bodies .

 Syaoran appears in other adaptations of Tsubasa , including the animated film The Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom , in which he still travels with Sakura , Fai , Kurogane and Mokona across dimensions . He is included a playable character in two Nintendo DS video games from Tsubasa . In the drama CD series The Matinée of the Palace , Syaoran 's group perform a play that re @-@ enacts the series ' story while searching for one of Sakura 's feathers . Outside Tsubasa , Syaoran appears in Clamp 's manga xxxHolic , which shows events in Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle . He does not appear in the animated adaptions of xxxHolic until the original video animation ( OVA ) series xxxHolic <unk> , in which he appears in the Dream World to confront the original Syaoran . In the spin @-@ off drama CD series Holitsuba Gakuen , Syaoran is featured as a new student in a school named " Holitsuba " , which includes characters from Tsubasa and xxxHolic . While he shares traits with his Tsubasa persona , such as his relationship with Sakura , he is portrayed as the identical twin of the original Syaoran . 
 = = Creation and conception = = 
 Clamp designed Syaoran using the ideas of manga author Osamu Tezuka and his Star System . Syaoran was based on Syaoran Li , a character from Cardcaptor Sakura — another series written by Clamp . Syaoran and Sakura were chosen to be the series ' protagonist because their Cardcaptor Sakura counterparts had a happy ending , but Clamp said that the characters would have to go throughout the series to get their own happy ending . At the start of the manga , Syaoran 's character was already planned to go through development . The characters Fai D. Flowright and Kurogane were added to provide additional characters who were older than Syaoran . In early versions of the manga , Syaoran was portrayed as a mechanic rather than an archaeologist , with <unk> having taught him about machines . In the original design , Syaoran wore a cap , a different outfit and an enormous adjustable spanner . 
 Clamp said Syaoran became popular with male readers as a hero . After events of the Oto country where Syaoran participated in several battles fighting for the king Ashura and was at disadvantage , Clamp 's editor for Tsubasa , <unk> Sugawara , wrote that he wondered whether " anything good ever happen [ s ] to Syaoran " ; Clamp said that their publishing company , Kodansha had received demands from readers for Syaoran to become stronger , and advised Clamp to let him have occasional good experiences . In order to make his fight scenes more entertaining , Clamp thought about giving Syaoran named sword techniques like those of Kurogane but in the end this was not added to the series . 
 In the animated adaptations of Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle , Syaoran is voiced by Miyu Irino in Japanese , and by Jason Liebrecht in English . Irino said that ever since the introduction of the original Syaoran — who he also voiced — he sometimes had problems voicing both characters . Fellow voice actress Yui Makino also discussed Irino 's role , saying that he was the most difficult character to cast because of the requirement to portray the two <unk> . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Syaoran was well received by Japanese readers of Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle . In two popularity polls held by Weekly Shōnen Magazine , Syaoran was the most @-@ liked character . He was also highly rated in other polls , which included best groups and best scenes from the series . In March 2010 , Syaoran was ranked twenty @-@ third best male anime character of the 2000s by the Japanese magazine Newtype . In the Animage 's Anime Grand Prix poll from 2006 , he was voted as the twelfth most popular male anime character . In the same year , he remained the fourteenth most popular male character . In the Animedia " 2006 Animedia Character Awards " , Syaoran was nominated in categories including " Strongest Character Award " , " Best Newcomer Award " , " Most Heroic Character Award " and " MVP ( Most Valuable Player ) Award " ; his highest rating was in the " Best Newcomer Award " , where he was ranked third . Various types of merchandising have been made based on Syaoran 's appearance including plush , keychains and patches . In the 2007 Seiyu Awards , Miyu Irino was a nominee in the category " Best New Actor " for his portrayal as Syaoran , but lost to Tetsuya <unk> and Masakazu Morita . 
 Publications for manga , anime and other media have commented on Syaoran 's character and role in the series . He received mainly positive responses . Ed Sizemore from Comics Worth Reading called him as " the perfect young hero " because of his seriousness , with points given for his care for Sakura . Although Carl Kimlinger found differences between Syaoran and his Cardcaptor Sakura counterpart , he found the traits of the former appealing . Michael Aronson from Manga Life found that while the characters behaves differently from Syaoran Li and act considerably older , it helps readers who have not read previous Clamp series understand the series . 
 Japanese singer Maaya Sakamoto said that in the animated adaptation of Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle , Syaoran 's straightforward feelings and strength to protect Sakura were very touching . Therefore , in the song " <unk> Jet " — the closing theme of the second season of the anime — she tried to capture the image of Syaoran growing from his naïve self into a young man through the meetings and <unk> over his journey and Syaoran 's continuing protection of his loved one in spite of adversity . When writing " Saigo no Kajitsu " , Sakamoto described Syaoran 's fate as sad because he becomes the antagonist of his friends and is a clone . Singer <unk> Kotani also described sadness in Syaoran 's strength , and said he had both forwarding @-@ facing and backward @-@ facing characteristics . 
 The plot twist in which Syaoran is revealed to be a clone and his fight against his original self has been regarded as " a titanic clash " by Chris Zimmerman from Comic Book Bin . Following this , Syaoran was called " evil Syaoran " and " Syaoran 's evil clone " . The twist has been a " potential real upset " because Syaoran is revealed to have been created by the series ' main antagonist , Fei @-@ Wang Reed . The relationship between both <unk> has also been found confusing for some readers to understand ; others said that while there was confusion in this scene , the events led to a well @-@ executed ending . They also highlighted the bond both have through their eyes . Sakura Eries from Mania Entertainment said Syaoran 's actions after the twist were disturbing because of his violent acts . Syaoran has been labeled as " an agent of destruction " because he ignores seemingly mortal wounds and encounters various opponents in a single manga volume . Eries said that she felt cheated after the revelations of Syaoran 's and Sakura 's true natures because it changed the readers ' views of them . 
 Mania Entertainment 's Megan Lavey said Syaoran 's and Sakura 's initial relationship is a " pretty simple love story " , and liked their personalities . IGN 's Jeff Harris said Syaoran 's role is interesting because he sacrifices his relationship with Sakura and his own life to recover her memories . Active Anime 's Christopher Seaman said the romantic relationship between them is one of the most mature parts of the series , and it helped balance the other fantastic themes , which added more variety for the series ' audience . Kimlinger said their relationship made up for some problems in the anime adaptation . Kimlinger also said Jason Liebrecht 's role as Syaoran 's English voice is better than Irino 's work . However , Kimlinger praised both performances because of the way Syaoran 's emotions are played . 
 = Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga = 
 Kaga ( <unk> ) was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) and was named after the former Kaga Province in present @-@ day Ishikawa Prefecture . Originally intended to be one of two Tosa @-@ class battleships , Kaga was converted under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty to an aircraft carrier as the replacement for the battlecruiser Amagi , which had been damaged during the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake . Kaga was rebuilt in 1933 – 35 , increasing her top speed , improving her exhaust systems , and adapting her flight decks to more modern , heavier aircraft . 
 The ship figured prominently in the development of the IJN 's carrier striking force doctrine , which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power . A revolutionary strategic concept at the time , the employment of the doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during the first six months of the Pacific War . 
 Kaga 's aircraft first supported Japanese troops in China during the Shanghai Incident of 1932 and participated in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War in the late 1930s . With other carriers , she took part in the Pearl Harbor raid in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942 . The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin , Australia , helping secure the conquest of the Dutch East Indies by Japanese forces . She missed the Indian Ocean raid in April as she had to return to Japan for permanent repairs after hitting a reef in February . 
 Following repairs , Kaga rejoined the 1st Air Fleet for the Battle of Midway in June 1942 . After bombarding American forces on Midway Atoll , Kaga and three other IJN carriers were attacked by American aircraft from Midway and the carriers Enterprise , Hornet , and Yorktown . Dive bombers from Enterprise severely damaged Kaga ; when it became obvious she could not be saved , she was scuttled by Japanese destroyers to prevent her from falling into enemy hands . The loss of four large attack carriers , including Kaga at Midway , was a crucial setback for Japan , and contributed significantly to Japan 's ultimate defeat . In 1999 , debris from Kaga including a large section of the hull was located on the ocean floor at a depth in excess of 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 16 @,@ 404 ft ) ; 350 miles ( 560 km ) northwest of Midway Island . The main part of the carrier 's wreck has not been found . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Kaga was laid down as a Tosa @-@ class battleship , and was launched on 17 November 1921 at the Kawasaki Heavy Industries shipyard in Kobe . On 5 February 1922 both Tosa @-@ class ships were canceled and scheduled to be scrapped under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 The Treaty authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers of up to 33 @,@ 000 long tons ( 34 @,@ 000 t ) standard displacement . The incomplete battlecruisers Amagi and Akagi were initially selected , but the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923 damaged Amagi 's hull beyond economically feasible repair , and Kaga was selected as her replacement . The formal decision to convert Kaga to an aircraft carrier was issued 13 December 1923 , but no work took place until 1925 as new plans were drafted and earthquake damage to the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was repaired . She was officially commissioned on 31 March 1928 , but this signified only the beginning of sea trials . She joined the Combined Fleet ( <unk> Kantai ) on 30 November 1929 as the IJN 's third carrier to enter service , after Hōshō ( 1922 ) and Akagi ( 1927 ) . 
 Kaga was completed with a length of 238 @.@ 5 meters ( 782 ft 6 in ) overall . She had a beam of 31 @.@ 67 meters ( 103 ft 11 in ) and a draft at full load of 7 @.@ 92 meters ( 26 ft 0 in ) . She displaced 26 @,@ 900 long tons ( 27 @,@ 300 t ) at standard load , and 33 @,@ 693 long tons ( 34 @,@ 234 t ) at full load , nearly 6 @,@ 000 long tons ( 6 @,@ 100 t ) less than her designed displacement as a battleship . Her complement totaled 1340 crewmembers . 
 = = = Flight deck arrangements = = = 
 Kaga , like Akagi , was completed with three superimposed flight decks , the only carriers ever to be designed so . The British carriers converted from " large light cruisers " , HMS Glorious , HMS Courageous , and HMS Furious , each had two flight decks , but there is no evidence that the Japanese copied the British model . It is more likely that it was a case of convergent evolution to improve launch and recovery cycle flexibility by allowing simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft . Kaga 's main flight deck was 171 @.@ 2 meters ( 561 ft 8 in ) long , her middle flight deck was only about 15 meters ( 49 ft 3 in ) long and started in front of the bridge , and her lower flight deck was approximately 55 meters ( 180 ft 5 in ) long . The utility of her middle flight deck was questionable as it was so short that only some of the lightly loaded aircraft could use it , even in an era when the aircraft were much lighter and smaller than they were during World War II . At any rate the ever @-@ increasing growth in aircraft performance , size and weight during the 1930s meant that even the bottom flight deck was no longer able to accommodate the take @-@ off roll required for the new generations of aircraft being fielded and it was plated over when the ship was modernized in the mid @-@ 1930s . Kaga 's main flight deck was completely flat until a conning tower was added during the modernization . 
 As completed , the ship had two main hangar decks and a third auxiliary hangar with a total capacity of 60 aircraft . The hangars opened onto the middle and lower flight decks to allow aircraft to take off directly from the hangars while landing operations were in progress on the main flight deck above . No catapults were fitted . Her forward aircraft lift was offset to starboard and 10 @.@ 67 by 15 @.@ 85 meters ( 35 @.@ 0 by 52 @.@ 0 ft ) in size . Her aft lift was on the centerline and 12 @.@ 8 by 9 @.@ 15 meters ( 42 ft 0 in by 30 ft 0 in ) . Her arresting gear was a French transverse system as used on their aircraft carrier Béarn and known as the Model <unk> ( <unk> shiki ) in the Japanese service . 
 As originally completed , Kaga carried an air group of 28 Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers , 16 Nakajima <unk> fighters and 16 Mitsubishi <unk> reconnaissance aircraft . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Kaga was armed with ten 20 cm / 50 3rd Year Type guns : one twin @-@ gun Model B turret on each side of the middle flight deck and six in casemates aft . They fired 110 @-@ kilogram ( 240 lb ) projectiles at a rate of three to six rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of 870 m / s ( 2 @,@ 900 ft / s ) ; at 25 ° , they had a maximum range between 22 @,@ 600 and 24 @,@ 000 m ( 24 @,@ 700 and 26 @,@ 200 yd ) . The Model B turrets were nominally capable of 70 ° elevation to provide additional anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) fire , but in practice the maximum elevation was only 55 ° . The slow rate of fire and the fixed 5 ° loading angle minimized any real anti @-@ aircraft capability . This heavy gun armament was provided in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle , but her large and vulnerable flight deck , hangars , and other features made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship . Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized . 
 She was given an anti @-@ aircraft armament of six twin 12 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) 45 @-@ caliber 10th Year Type Model A2 gun mounts fitted on sponsons below the level of the funnels , where they could not fire across the flight deck , three mounts per side . These guns fired 20 @.@ 3 @-@ kilogram ( 45 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 825 – 830 m / s ( 2 @,@ 707 – 2 @,@ 723 ft / s ) ; at 45 ° this provided a maximum range of 16 @,@ 000 meters ( 17 @,@ 000 yd ) , and they had a maximum ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 meters ( 33 @,@ 000 ft ) at 75 ° elevation . Their effective rate of fire was 6 to 8 rounds per minute . She had two Type 89 directors to control her 20 cm guns and two Type 91 manually powered anti @-@ aircraft directors ( <unk> ) to control her 12 cm guns . 
 Kaga 's waterline armored belt was reduced from 280 to 152 mm ( 11 @.@ 0 to 6 @.@ 0 in ) during her reconstruction and the upper part of her torpedo bulge was given 127 mm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) of armor . Her deck armor was also reduced from 102 to 38 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 to 1 @.@ 5 in ) .

 When Kaga was being designed the problem of how to deal with exhaust gases in carrier operations had not been resolved . The swiveling funnels of Hōshō had not proved successful and wind @-@ tunnel testing had not provided an answer . As a result , Akagi and Kaga were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real @-@ world conditions . Kaga 's funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck , in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck . The predictions proved to be correct , not least because Kaga was slower than the Akagi which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations . Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew 's quarters located on the side of the ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable . 
 Kaga was completed with four Kawasaki Brown @-@ Curtis geared turbines with a total of 91 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 68 @,@ 000 kW ) on four shafts . As a battleship her expected speed had been 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 49 @.@ 1 km / h ; 30 @.@ 5 mph ) , but the reduction in displacement from 39 @,@ 900 to 33 @,@ 693 long tons ( 40 @,@ 540 to 34 @,@ 234 t ) allowed this to increase to 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) , as demonstrated on her sea trials on 15 September 1928 . She had twelve Kampon Type B ( Ro ) boilers with a working pressure of 20 kg / cm2 ( 2 @,@ 000 kPa ; 280 psi ) , although only eight were oil @-@ fired . The other four used a mix of oil and coal . She carried 8 @,@ 000 long tons ( 8 @,@ 128 t ) of fuel oil and 1 @,@ 700 long tons ( 1 @,@ 727 t ) of coal to give her a range of 8 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 000 km ; 9 @,@ 200 mi ) at 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . 
 = = Early service and development of carrier doctrine = = 
 On 1 December 1931 Kaga was assigned as the flagship of the First Carrier Division under the command of Rear Admiral Takayoshi Katō . The First Carrier Division , along with Hōshō , departed for Chinese waters on 29 January 1932 to support Imperial Japanese Army troops during the Shanghai Incident as part of the IJN 's 3rd Fleet . The <unk> carried by Kaga and Hōshō were the main bombers used during the brief combat over Shanghai . 
 Kaga 's aircraft , operating from both the carrier and a temporary base at Kunda Airfield in Shanghai , flew missions in support of Japanese ground forces throughout February 1932 . During one of these missions three of Kaga 's Nakajima <unk> fighters , including one piloted by future ace Toshio <unk> , escorting three Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers , scored the IJN 's first air @-@ to @-@ air combat victory on 22 February when they shot down a Boeing P @-@ 12 flown by an American volunteer pilot . Kaga returned to home waters upon the declaration of the cease @-@ fire on 3 March and resumed fleet training with the rest of the Combined Fleet . 
 At this time , the IJN 's developing carrier doctrine was still in its earliest stages . Kaga and the IJN 's other carriers were initially given roles as tactical force multipliers supporting the fleet 's battleships in the IJN 's " decisive battle " doctrine . In this role , Kaga 's aircraft were to attack enemy battleships with bombs and torpedoes . Aerial strikes against enemy carriers were later , beginning around 1932 – 1933 , deemed of equal importance in order to establish air superiority during the initial stages of battle . The essential component in this strategy was that the Japanese carrier aircraft must be able to strike first with a massed , preventive aerial attack . As a result , in fleet training exercises the carriers began to operate together in front of or with the main battle line . The new strategy emphasized maximum speed from both the carriers and the aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range . Thus , longer flight decks on the carriers were required in order to handle the newer , heavier aircraft which were entering service . 
 Kaga was soon judged inferior to Akagi because of her slower speed , smaller flight deck ( 64 feet ( 19 @.@ 5 m ) shorter ) , and problematic funnel arrangement . Because of Kaga 's perceived limitations , she was given priority over Akagi for modernization . Kaga was relegated to reserve status on 20 October 1933 to begin a second major reconstruction , with an official start date of 25 June 1934 . 
 = = Reconstruction = = 
 During her second reconstruction Kaga 's two lower flight decks were converted into hangars and , along with the main flight deck , were extended to the bow . This increased the flight deck length to 248 @.@ 55 meters ( 815 ft 5 in ) and raised aircraft capacity to 90 ( 72 operational and 18 in storage ) . A third elevator forward , 11 @.@ 5 by 12 meters ( 37 ft 9 in × 39 ft 4 in ) , serviced the extended hangars . Bomb and torpedo elevators were modified to deliver their munitions directly to the flight deck . Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese @-@ designed Type 1 system . A small starboard island superstructure was also installed . 
 Her power plant was completely replaced as were her propellers . New Kampon multi @-@ stage geared turbines were fitted that increased her power from 91 @,@ 000 to 127 @,@ 400 shp ( 67 @,@ 859 to 95 @,@ 002 kW ) during trials . Each had a high @-@ pressure , a low @-@ pressure , and a cruising turbine coupled to a single shaft . Her boilers were replaced by eight improved oil @-@ burning models of the Kampon Type B ( Ro ) with a working pressure of 22 kg / cm2 ( 2 @,@ 157 kPa ; 313 psi ) at a temperature of 300 ° C ( 572 ° F ) . The hull was lengthened by 10 @.@ 3 meters ( 33 ft 10 in ) at the stern to reduce drag and she was given another torpedo bulge above the side armor abreast the upper part of the existing bulge to increase her beam and lower her center of gravity as a result of lessons learned from the Tomozuru Incident in early 1934 . This raised her standard displacement significantly , from 26 @,@ 900 to 38 @,@ 200 long tons ( 27 @,@ 332 to 38 @,@ 813 t ) . The extra power and the extra displacement roughly offset each other and her speed increased by less than a knot , up to 28 @.@ 34 knots ( 52 @.@ 49 km / h ; 32 @.@ 61 mph ) on trials . Her fuel storage was increased to 7 @,@ 500 long tons ( 7 @,@ 620 t ) of fuel oil which increased her endurance to 10 @,@ 000 nmi ( 18 @,@ 520 km ; 11 @,@ 510 mi ) at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . The lengthy funnel ducting was replaced by a single downturned starboard funnel modeled on that used by the Akagi with a water @-@ cooling system for the exhaust gasses and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gasses to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea . The space freed up by the removal of the funnel ducts was divided into two decks and converted into living quarters for the expanded air group . The carrier 's complement increased to 1708 crewmembers . 
 The two twin turrets on the middle flight deck were removed and four new 20 cm / 50 3rd Year Type No. 1 guns in casemates were added forward . Her 12 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns were replaced by eight 12 @.@ 7 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) / 40 Type 89 guns in twin mounts . They fired 23 @.@ 45 @-@ kilogram ( 51 @.@ 7 lb ) projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of 700 – 725 m / s ( 2 @,@ 300 – 2 @,@ 380 ft / s ) ; at 45 ° , this provided a maximum range of 14 @,@ 800 meters ( 16 @,@ 200 yd ) , and a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 400 meters ( 30 @,@ 800 ft ) . Their sponsons were raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross @-@ deck fire . Eleven twin 25 mm Type 96 gun mounts were added , also on sponsons . They fired .25 @-@ kilogram ( 0 @.@ 55 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 900 m / s ( 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ) ; at 50 ° , this provided a maximum range of 7 @,@ 500 meters ( 8 @,@ 202 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 meters ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . Six 6 @.@ 5 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 26 in ) Type 11 machine guns were also carried . Six Type 95 directors were fitted to control the new 25 mm guns , but Kaga retained her outdated Type 91 anti @-@ aircraft directors . 
 Several major weaknesses in Kaga 's design were not rectified . Kaga 's aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier , meaning that shocks to the ship , such as those caused by bomb or shell hits , would be transmitted directly to the tanks , resulting in cracks or leaks . Also , the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made fire suppression difficult , at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars . Adding to the danger was the requirement from the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced , fueled , and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck . In addition , the carrier 's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection . Furthermore , there was no redundancy in the ship 's fire @-@ extinguishing systems . These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship . 
 = = Sino @-@ Japanese War = = 
 Kaga returned to service in 1935 and was assigned to the Second Carrier Division . The carrier embarked a new set of aircraft , including 16 Nakajima A2N Type 90 fighters , 16 Aichi D1A Type 94 dive bombers , and 28 Mitsubishi <unk> Type 89 torpedo bombers . 
 The renewal of hostilities with China at the Marco Polo Bridge in July 1937 found Kaga in home waters . The ship 's fighter squadron completed training at Ōmura , Nagasaki then helped escort ships taking army reinforcements from Japan to China . On 15 August , along with Hōshō and Ryūjō , the ship took station in the East China Sea as part of the 3rd Fleet and began supporting Japanese military operations along the central China coast around Shanghai and further inland . 
 Kaga aircraft fought their first battle on 16 August 1937 when six Type 90 fighters engaged four Chinese aircraft over <unk> , shooting down three without loss . Between 17 August and 7 September , Kaga 's Type 90 and two Mitsubishi A5M Type 96 fighters , which joined the carrier on 22 August , engaged Chinese aircraft on several more occasions . Kaga 's fighter pilots claimed to have shot down 10 Chinese aircraft in these encounters without loss . On 17 August twelve of the carrier 's bombers attacked <unk> without fighter escort and 11 of them were shot down by Chinese fighters . Beginning on 15 September , six Type 90 and six Type 96 fighters , 18 dive bombers , and 18 torpedo bombers were temporarily deployed to Kunda Airfield from the ship to support land operations . 
 On 26 September the carrier went to Sasebo for reprovisioning . At Sasebo , the carrier received new replacement aircraft including 32 Yokosuka B4Y Type 96 carrier attack planes ( torpedo bombers ) , 16 Aichi D1A2 Type 96 carrier bombers ( dive bombers ) , and 16 more Type 96 fighters . Several Nakajima A4N Type 95 fighter aircraft augmented the carrier 's fighter group at an unspecified later date . 
 Kaga returned to the front in early October 1937 , and except for two brief trips to Sasebo , remained off China until December 1938 . Using Taiwan ( then part of the Empire of Japan ) as its base , the carrier steamed 29 @,@ 048 nautical miles ( 53 @,@ 797 km ; 33 @,@ 428 mi ) supporting military operations from the South and East China Seas . During that time , Kaga bombers supported army operations by attacking enemy railroad bridges , airfields , and transportation vehicles . The carrier 's fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed at least 17 Chinese aircraft in aerial combat while losing five aircraft themselves . On 12 December 1937 Kaga aircraft participated in the Panay incident . 
 Kaga entered the shipyard on 15 December 1938 , where her arrester gear was replaced by a Type 3 system and her bridge was modernized . The flight deck and hangar areas were enlarged , increasing the carrier 's aircraft capacity . The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service . In the meantime , a new generation of aircraft had entered service and Kaga embarked 12 Mitsubishi A5M fighters , 24 Aichi D1A dive bombers and 36 Yokosuka B4Y torpedo bombers . Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares . 
 The Japanese carriers ' experiences off China had helped further develop the IJN 's carrier doctrine . One lesson learned in China was the importance of concentration and mass in projecting naval air power ashore . Therefore , in April 1941 the IJN formed the First Air Fleet to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command . On 10 April 1941 Kaga was assigned to the First Carrier Division with Akagi as part of the new carrier fleet , which also included the Second and Fifth carrier divisions . The IJN centered its doctrine on air strikes that combined the air groups within carrier divisions , rather than each individual carrier . When more than one carrier division was operating together , the divisions ' air groups were combined with each other . This doctrine of combined , massed , carrier air attack groups was the most advanced of its kind of all the world 's navies . The IJN , however , remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike . Thus , the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations , with approximately 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 7 @,@ 700 yd ) separating the carriers from each other . 
 Although the concentration of so many fleet carriers into a single unit was a new and revolutionary offensive strategic concept , the First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies which gave it , in Mark Peattie 's words , a " ' glass jaw ' : it could throw a punch but couldn 't take one . " Japanese carrier anti @-@ aircraft guns and associated fire control systems had several design and configuration deficiencies which limited their effectiveness . The IJN 's fleet combat air patrol ( CAP ) consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system , including a lack of radar . Poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP . The carriers ' escorting warships were deployed as visual scouts in a ring at long range , not as close anti @-@ aircraft escorts , as they lacked training , doctrine , and sufficient anti @-@ aircraft guns . These deficiencies would eventually doom Kaga and other First Air Fleet carriers .

 = = = Pearl Harbor = = = 
 In November 1941 the IJN 's Combined Fleet , under Isoroku Yamamoto , prepared to participate in Japan 's initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a preemptive strike against the United States Navy 's Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . On 17 November Kaga , under the command of Captain <unk> Okada , loaded 100 torpedoes at Saeki Bay , Hiroshima ; these torpedoes were specially designed for use in the shallow waters of the Pearl Harbor anchorage . On 19 November , Kaga and the rest of the Combined Fleet 's mobile strike force ( Kido Butai ) , under Chuichi Nagumo and including six fleet carriers from the First , Second , and Fifth Carrier Divisions , assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island . The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north @-@ central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes . 
 For the attack on Pearl Harbor , Kaga carried a total of 18 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters , 27 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 27 Aichi D3A dive bombers , plus three crated aircraft of each type for the operation . During the morning of 7 December 1941 Kaga aircraft participated in both First Air Fleet strikes launched against Oahu from a position 230 nautical miles ( 430 km ) north of the island . In the first strike of 183 total aircraft ( six aborted ) , 26 Kaga B5N carrier attack bombers attacked the American ships at anchor with bombs and torpedoes , escorted by nine Zeros . In the second strike of 167 aircraft ( four aborted ) , 26 Kaga D3A dive bombers targeted the airfield at Ford Island in the middle of the harbor while nine Zeros provided escort and attacked aircraft on the ground . A total of five B5Ns , four Zeros and six D3As from the ship were lost during the two strikes , along with their aircrews , a total of 31 personnel . Kaga 's bomber and torpedo crews claimed hits on the battleships Nevada , Oklahoma , Arizona , California , West Virginia , and Maryland . The ship 's fighter pilots claimed to have shot down one US aircraft and destroyed 20 on the ground . Upon completion of the attack , the First and Fifth Carrier divisions , including Kaga , returned immediately to Japan . 
 = = = Pacific conquest = = = 
 In January 1942 , together with the rest of the First and Fifth Carrier Division carriers and staging out of Truk ( now Chuuk ) in Micronesia , Kaga supported the invasion of Rabaul in the Bismarck Islands . Kaga provided 27 bomb @-@ carrying B5N and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on Rabaul on 20 January 1942 , during which one B5N was shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire . The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby Kavieng the following day , of which Kaga contributed nine Zeros and sixteen D3As . On the 22nd Kaga 's D3As and Zeros again attacked Rabaul and two dive bombers had to make emergency landings , but the crews were rescued . Kaga returned to Truk on 25 January and Rabaul and Kavieng were successfully occupied by Japanese forces by February . 
 On 9 February Kaga hit a reef at Palau after she had unsuccessfully sortied against American carrier forces attacking the Marshall Islands on 1 February . The damage reduced the carrier 's speed to 18 knots . After temporary repairs , she continued to the Timor Sea , where on 19 February 1942 she , with the other carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions , launched air strikes against Darwin , Australia from a point 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) southeast of the easternmost tip of Timor . Kaga contributed 27 B5Ns ( carrying bombs ) , 18 D3A , and 9 Zeros to the attack , which caught the defenders by surprise . Eight ships were sunk , including the destroyer Peary , and fourteen more were damaged , at a cost of only one of Kaga 's B5Ns . In March 1942 , Kaga , based out of Staring @-@ baai , helped cover the invasion of Java , although her only contribution appears to have been aircraft for the 5 March 1942 airstrike on Tjilatjap . In that attack Kaga contributed 27 bomb @-@ carrying B5N escorted by nine Zeros . The attacking aircraft bombed merchant ships in the harbor , sinking eight of them , and attacked anti @-@ aircraft batteries and a warehouse without loss . Most of the Allied forces in the Dutch East Indies surrendered to the Japanese later in March . Kaga was unable to participate in the Indian Ocean raid in April because of the damage she had received in February . Instead , she sailed for Sasebo on 15 March for repairs , entering drydock on 27 March . The repairs were completed on 4 May .

 = = = = Midway raid = = = = 
 Concerned by the US carrier strikes in the Doolittle , Marshall Islands , and Lae @-@ Salamaua raids , Yamamoto determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat . Yamamoto decided to invade and occupy Midway Island , which he was sure would draw out the American carrier forces to battle . The Midway invasion was codenamed by the Japanese as Operation MI . 
 In support of MI , on 27 May 1942 , Kaga departed the Inland Sea with the Combined Fleet on her final mission , in the company of carriers Akagi , Hiryū , and Sōryū which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions . Her aircraft complement was 27 Zeros , 20 D3As , and 27 B5Ns . With the fleet positioned 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ) northwest of Midway Island at dawn on 4 June 1942 , Kaga contributed eighteen D3As , commanded by Lieutenant Shōichi Ogawa , escorted by nine Zeros to the strike against the island . The carrier 's B5Ns were armed with torpedoes and kept ready in case enemy ships were discovered during the Midway raid . One each of the D3As and Zeros was shot down by AA fire over Midway , and another four D3As were damaged . Kaga 's Zero pilots claimed to have shot down 12 US aircraft over Midway Island . One Kaga B5N was launched to augment the fleet 's reconnaissance of the surrounding ocean . The carrier also put up two Zeros on CAP . Another five Zeros reinforced her CAP at 07 : 00 and the seven fighters helped to defend the Kido Butai from the first US air attackers from Midway Island at 07 : 10 . Unknown to the Japanese , the US Navy had divined the Japanese MI plan from signals intelligence and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers , positioned northeast of Midway . 
 At 07 : 15 Admiral Nagumo ordered the B5Ns still on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself . This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators . Thus , the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine , assembled and mounted on the aircraft . This process normally took about an hour and a half ; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group . Around 07 : 40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted . At 07 : 30 Kaga recovered three of her CAP . 
 = = = = Sinking = = = = 
 Kaga 's four remaining CAP fighters were in the process of landing when 16 Marine SBD Dauntless dive @-@ bombers from Midway , led by Lofton R. Henderson , attacked Hiryu around 07 : 55 without result . Five Zeros were launched at 08 : 15 and three intercepted a dozen Midway @-@ based United States Army B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses attempting to bomb the three other carriers from 20 @,@ 000 feet ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) , but only limited damage was inflicted on the heavy bombers , although their attacks all missed . Five D3As also joined the CAP around this time . Another trio of Zeros were launched at 08 : 30 . Kaga began landing her returning Midway strike force aboard around 08 : 35 and was finished by 08 : 50 ; one Zero pilot died after crash @-@ landing his aircraft . 
 The five Zeros launched at 08 : 15 were recovered aboard at 09 : 10 and replaced by six more Zeros launched at 09 : 20 . They intercepted the first US carrier aircraft to attack , TBD Devastator torpedo @-@ bombers of VT @-@ 8 from the US carrier Hornet at 09 : 22 , and shot down all 15 , leaving only a single survivor , George H. Gay , Jr . , treading water . Shortly thereafter , 14 Devastators from VT @-@ 6 from the US carrier Enterprise , led by Eugene E. Lindsey , were spotted . They tried to sandwich Kaga , but the CAP , reinforced by another six Zeros launched by Kaga at 10 : 00 , shot down all but four of the Devastators , and the carrier dodged the torpedoes . 
 Soon after the torpedo plane attacks , American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives . At 10 : 22 , 25 SBD Dauntless dive @-@ bombers from Enterprise , led by C. Wade McClusky , hit Kaga with one 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 450 kg ) bomb and at least three 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bombs . The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire , and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar , setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck . Captain Okada and most of the ship 's senior officers were killed by the third bomb , which hit the bridge . The 1000 @-@ pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar . The explosions ruptured the ship 's avgas lines , damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the emergency generator powering her fire pumps , as well as knocking out the carbon dioxide fire suppression system . Fueled by the avgas pouring onto the hangar deck , the fires detonated the 80 @,@ 000 pounds ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) of bombs and torpedoes strewn across the hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple fuel @-@ air explosions that blew out the hangar sides . At nearly the same time , dive bombers hit and fatally damaged Akagi and Sōryū . 
 Unable to contain her fires , Kaga 's survivors were taken off by the destroyers Hagikaze and Maikaze between 14 : 00 and 17 : 00 . Around 19 : 25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from Hagikaze and sank stern @-@ first at position 30 ° 23 ′ N 179 ° 17 ′ W. Ensign Takeshi Maeda , an injured Kaga B5N aircrew member rescued by Hagikaze , described the scene : " My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier , which was nearby . Even though I was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks , and everyone around me was crying ; it was a very sad sight . " 
 The carrier 's crew suffered 811 fatalities , mainly among the aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on the hangar decks and the ship 's engineers , many of whom were trapped below in the boiler and engine rooms by uncontrolled fires raging on the decks above them . Twenty @-@ one of the ship 's aviators were killed . The loss of Kaga and the three other IJN carriers at Midway ( Hiryū was also sunk during the battle ) , with their aircraft and veteran pilots , was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan 's ultimate defeat in the war .

 = World Science Festival , 2008 = 
 The 2008 World Science Festival was a science festival held in New York City . The festival ( May 28 – June 1 , 2008 ) consisted mainly of panel discussions and on @-@ stage conversations , accompanied by multimedia presentations . A youth and family program presented topics such as sports from a scientific perspective and included an extensive street fair . A cultural program led by actor and writer Alan Alda focused on art inspired by science . The festival also included a World Science Summit , a meeting of high @-@ level participants from the worlds of science , politics , administration , and business . 
 The festival was the brainchild of Columbia University physicist Brian Greene and his wife , Emmy Award @-@ winning television journalist Tracy Day . It was held in partnership with major New York City cultural and academic institutions , including Columbia University , New York University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art . 
 = = History and background = = 
 The World Science Festival was founded by Brian Greene , a Columbia University physics professor and author of several popular @-@ science books ( such as The Elegant Universe ) , and his wife , Emmy Award @-@ winning television journalist Tracy Day . Inspired by a visit to the 2005 Festival della Scienza in Genoa , where Greene had been invited to speak , the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public . As they envisioned it , such a festival would allow them to combine Greene 's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day 's as a journalist and producer : the events were meant to be rooted in science , but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions . 
 Day and Greene sounded out scientists and science communicators about their idea , enlisting many of their contacts as the festival 's scientific advisors . They met with the presidents of the city 's major universities and its cultural and scientific institutions , forging partnerships for the festival 's organization . According to Greene , their idea fell on open ears wherever they went , and the most frequent reaction to their proposal was the expression of disbelief that a festival like this did not already exist in New York City . Early 2006 saw the founding of the Science Festival Foundation ( SFF ) , a non @-@ profit organization based in New York City , dedicated to organizing the festival and related events . Greene serves as the foundation 's chairman , and is also on its board of directors . The other members of the board are Alan Alda , Columbia University president Lee Bollinger , the foundation 's president Judith Cox , New York University president John Sexton , and Tracy Day , who also serves as the festival 's executive director . 
 Next came the assembly of a team of producers who were to organize the festival 's events . Notably Kyle Gibson , an Emmy Award @-@ winning former producer of Nightline with Ted Koppel , joined the festival as senior program producer , while production of the Youth and Family Program was put into the hands of Robin Reardon , a former show producer for Walt Disney Imagineering and former vice president of Universal Studios Creative , who also became the festival 's managing director . 
 The foundation organizes the World Science Festival ( WSF ) in partnership with Columbia University , New York University , the City University of New York , Rockefeller University and the Cooper Union , as well as cultural institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Guggenheim Museum , and the Museum of Modern Art . Financial support comes from individuals , from numerous foundations , and from corporate sponsors which , for the 2008 festival , included the Sloan Foundation , the Simons Foundation , the Templeton Foundation , the Rockefeller Foundation , the Cullman Foundation , and Credit Suisse .

 Preceding the public events was the invitation @-@ only World Science Summit on May 28 , 2008 ; New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg opened the Festival . At the summit , an invited audience interacted with eminent scientists in several panel discussions . Participants included Nina Federoff ( Science and Technology Advisor to U. S. Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice ) , biologist David Baltimore and cancer researcher Harold Varmus . 
 As part of the summit , the winners of the first Kavli Prizes were announced in a simulcast linking New York City and Oslo . The first Kavli Prize for astrophysics was awarded to Maarten Schmidt and Donald Lynden @-@ Bell for their pioneering work on quasars . Louis E. Brus and <unk> <unk> shared the nanoscience prize for their contributions to the science of quantum dots and carbon nanotubes , respectively .

 Events covered a wide variety of scientific topics , and combined talks , demonstrations , video presentations and panel discussions . A number of events addressed " big questions " . For example , a roster of scientists including physicist William Phillips , philosopher Patricia Churchland , neuroscientist Antonio Damasio , philosopher Daniel Dennett , cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky , and cancer researcher Harold Varmus , debated " What It Means to Be Human " in a panel discussion moderated by Charlie Rose . A recurring theme was the wider implications of scientific results , as exemplified by a discussion on the promises and consequences of personal genomics involving biochemist Paul Nurse , sociologist Nikolas Rose , and human genome project leader Francis Collins . A number of events explored the interface between science and the arts ; for instance , a panel including psychologist Nancy C. Andreasen , choreographer and dancer Bill T. Jones , and actor and writer Michael York focused on the scientific study of creativity . Other audiences saw physicists Lawrence Krauss and radio host Ira Flatow presenting modern cosmology , paleontologist Richard Leakey exploring the sixth extinction , and chemist F. Sherwood Rowland and Rensselaer Polytechnic president Shirley Ann Jackson discussing new ways of satisfying humanity 's energy needs . A number of events were co @-@ productions with the festival 's partners , such as a discussion between Robert <unk> and neurologist and author Oliver Sacks on perception , held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and musician Mark Oliver Everett 's exploration of the scientific legacy of his father , Hugh Everett , at the Museum of Modern Art . 
 The festival 's cultural program ranged from a string theory @-@ themed dance performance choreographed by Karole Armitage to a storytelling event in cooperation with The Moth , which featured journalist and writer Lucy Hawking , physicist Jim Gates and writer Sam Shepard , among others . Alan Alda revisited his role as Richard Feynman in Peter Parnell 's play QED in a staged reading at Columbia University 's Miller Theatre , and the choir of the Abyssinian Baptist Church joined Oliver Sacks in an exploration of music and science . The festival also saw the première of Dear Albert , a reading for the stage written by Alda based on the letters of Albert Einstein , and starring Anthony LaPaglia as Einstein . 
 Events for a younger audience included an examination of the science of sports ( with sports scientist Tom Crawford , neuroscientist David <unk> , and athletes such as Brevin Knight , Lisa Willis and Leilani Mitchell ) . For the festival 's first event , New York City high @-@ school students interviewed robotics expert Cynthia <unk> and physicist Leon Lederman on @-@ stage , moderated by MTV 's <unk> Pak . Another event was presented by the Disney Imagineers , who explored the science of special effects and amusement park technology , from roller coasters and fireworks to motion capture and artificial fog .

 Festival coverage leading up to the 2008 festival , which included articles in major newspapers and appearances by Alda and Greene on national shows such as Regis and Kelly and The Colbert Report , mostly focused on introducing the festival 's concept , organizers and events , and on the promise of bringing an event of this type to New York . Aside from mention of small organizational glitches , coverage of festival events was generally positive . Both Good Morning America and Science News focused on the potential of the festival to inspire the next generation of scientists and " make geek chic " . The New York Post described the festival 's role in New York 's cultural landscape as the geek counterpart of Fashion Week and the Tony Awards , while the Science Channel 's coverage characterized the festival as " wonderfully inspiring and informative " . The New York Times noted that Greene and Day appeared to have succeeded in creating " a new cultural institution " ; further Times articles declared the festival a critical and a box office success . 
 Online coverage typically focused on specific festival events . Notably , Science , Wired , The Science Channel and USA Today provided same @-@ day or next @-@ day accounts of events including " What It Means to Be Human " , " Ramachandran / Kurzweil : Humanity Now / Humanity Next " , " Future Cities " , as well as the two events featuring Oliver Sacks . 
 = E. W. Bastard = 
 Edward William Bastard ( 28 February 1862 – 2 April 1901 ) was an English cricketer who played for Oxford University and Somerset . Bastard was a slow left @-@ arm orthodox bowler , described in his Wisden obituary as Somerset 's best bowler during his time with the club . Bastard was also part of the Oxford team often said to be the university 's best ever . 
 His first @-@ class career was confined to his university years , when he appeared for both Oxford and Somerset . Close to the top of the bowling averages for both teams in each season , his 62 first @-@ class wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket @-@ takers in the country . Somerset 's temporary loss of first @-@ class status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard 's first @-@ class career when he was 23 . Although he continued to play for the side in second @-@ class cricket until 1889 , by the time Somerset resumed first @-@ class cricket in 1891 , Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions of Ted Tyler and George Nichols . He died at the age of 39 while engaged in scholastic work in Taunton . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Edward William Bastard was born in Wilton , a parish just outside Taunton , the second son of Henry <unk> Bastard . He was educated at Sherborne School , and played for the school cricket team . Although he was later known as a bowler , Bastard occasionally opened the batting for the school , as he did against Clifton College in 1881 . During his time at Sherborne , he also played some games for Dorset . 
 = = University and county cricket = = 
 On completion of his studies at Sherborne School , Bastard attended Wadham College , Oxford University . He played in the Freshmen 's Trial in May 1882 , and collected four wickets in each innings , conceding just 35 runs from his 29 overs . His side , <unk> Owen 's XI won by 79 runs . He played in two matches against the university 's first team during his freshman year , opening the bowling for both the Freshmen side and the " Next XVI " . He made his debut in first @-@ class cricket that June , appearing for the university against the Marylebone Cricket Club . He claimed one wicket during the match , in which the university lost by an innings . Bastard appeared three times in first @-@ class cricket for the university in 1883 , and according to Geoffrey Bolton , author of History of the <unk> , " was lucky to be chosen this year " to play in the University match against Cambridge University . Bastard was wicketless against Lancashire , and although he took three wickets in each innings against the MCC , John Foord @-@ Kelcey took more wickets at a better average . Nevertheless , Bastard was preferred for the contest against Cambridge , thus gaining his Blue . Bastard claimed a wicket in each innings of the match , which Cambridge won by seven wickets . Bolton attributes the loss to a combination of the weather and Oxford 's loss of the toss , which resulted in Cambridge batting first on a good batting pitch . Rain followed , and when Oxford batted , the pitch was described by Bolton as " really nasty " . 
 During the university 's summer break , Bastard made his debut for Somerset . His first match for the county was against the MCC in late July . He appeared six further times in 1883 , against county opposition , and in all matches that season , collected 52 first @-@ class wickets at an average of 30 @.@ 20 . In 1883 , he also made his highest first @-@ class score , making 47 runs during Somerset 's second innings against Hampshire . He came into bat with the score at 86 runs for the loss of seven wickets , and was the last wicket to fall , by which time Somerset had moved to 181 , and Bastard had shared a tenth wicket partnership of 74 with Arnold Fothergill . Even so , Somerset lost the match by seven wickets . 
 Bastard played in all eight of Oxford University 's first @-@ class matches in 1884 as part of the team which was described by Altham and Swanton as a remarkable side , and one of Oxford 's best ever . The university won seven of the matches , and narrowly lost the other . During the opening match , against the Australians , Bastard was wicketless in the first innings , but took five second innings wickets , his maiden first @-@ class five @-@ wicket haul . Among his wickets was the tourists captain Billy Murdoch , who later that summer scored 211 runs against England in the third Test . Bolton wrote that against the Australians , " Bastard had bowled supremely well , " and the performance was Bastard 's best for the university during 1884 ; he collected his wickets steadily and finished as Oxford 's second most prolific wicket @-@ taker . He claimed 34 wickets for the side , second only to the 53 taken by Hugh Whitby , although his average of 17 @.@ 00 ranked him fifth among the bowlers . In the University match that year , he claimed three wickets in each innings . Batting in Oxford 's first innings , he and Benjamin Nicholls quickly scored 52 runs , and then bowling in Cambridge 's second innings , he and Whitby claimed their opponent 's final six wickets for just 17 runs . 
 He returned to play for Somerset during the summer break once again in 1884 , playing four matches for the county , during which he claimed 24 wickets : more than double that of the next most prolific Somerset bowler , Charles Winter . His best performance came against Hampshire , against whom he claimed six second innings wickets to help Somerset to their only victory of the season . 
 The following season , Bastard returned to play for Oxford University , along with most of the successful team of the previous year . Despite the availability of almost the same squad , Oxford did not win a single match during 1885 . Four of the university 's bowlers , Edward Buckland , Herbert Page , Nicholls , and Whitby had an average in excess of 24 in 1885 , having averaged below 21 the previous season . The team came to rely upon the bowling of Bastard and Alfred Cochrane , both slow left @-@ arm bowlers . Bastard began the season with a five @-@ wicket haul in the first innings against the MCC , which he followed up with three more wickets in the second . He improved upon this performance in the next match , taking five wickets in each innings against Lancashire to complete his maiden ten @-@ wicket haul in a first @-@ class match , although the northern county won by 50 runs . He was less effective in later matches , claiming four wickets in an innings twice , but more often going wicketless . In the University match , Bastard 's last , Oxford were bowled out on the first day for 136 , and Cambridge opened a first innings lead of 151 ; Bastard claimed a solitary wicket from 38 @.@ 3 overs . Oxford recovered in the second innings and scored 239 , of which Bastard contributed 12 runs , leaving Cambridge requiring 89 runs to win , with over a day 's play remaining . According to Bolton , Bastard " bowled with great skill on the last morning " , and claimed three Cambridge wickets , but was not supported by his fellow bowlers , and Cambridge achieved victory before lunch on the final day . 
 Bastard was Somerset 's leading wicket @-@ taker again in 1885 , claiming 25 wickets . In his first match for the county that summer , he recorded his second ten @-@ wicket match . Facing Hampshire in Taunton , Bastard claimed eight wickets in the first innings , and a further three in the second as Somerset recorded their only win of the year . His next match for the county was also against Hampshire , this time in Southampton . Somerset could only field nine men in the fixture , and after batting first reached 117 . In the Hampshire response , a contemporary match report recorded that Bastard " did a capital performance in the first innings of Hants , taking eight of the ten wickets at a cost of only 59 runs " . Despite his performance , Hampshire passed Somerset 's total and had a first innings lead of 45 runs . Somerset scored 166 in their second innings , leaving Hampshire requiring 122 to win . Bastard bowled 27 overs in the second innings , but failed to add to his wicket tally , and Hampshire won the match by eight wickets . Bastard 's performances during 1885 saw him selected in two games for the Gentlemen during the Scarborough Festival . The team was a young one , as well as three of his Oxford team @-@ mates from that season , Page , Kingsmill Key and Tim O 'Brien , there were a number of players from the Cambridge team chosen . Bastard claimed five wickets in the first innings of the match against I Zingari , but failed to take any against the Players . In 1885 , his 62 first @-@ class wickets was the eighteenth highest among bowlers in the country . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Bastard graduated from Oxford in 1885 , gaining his B.A. that year , and collecting his M.A. three years later . He continued to play cricket for Somerset , who had by this stage been stripped of their first @-@ class status for three reasons : they had not organised and played enough first @-@ class fixtures during the season , their performances were not what was expected from a first @-@ class county , and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches . He picked up plenty of wickets , particularly in 1886 and 1887 ; eleven in a match against Hampshire , with eight in the first innings , fifteen against Devon , and another eight in the first innings against Warwickshire being the highlights . However , the additions of Sammy Woods , Ted Tyler and George Nichols resulted in Bastard bowling less frequently , and he made his final appearance for the county in August 1889 against the MCC . He was not required to bowl in the match , which Somerset won by 9 wickets , thanks to Tyler and Woods . He was described by Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack as " the chief bowler in the Somersetshire eleven before the County became first @-@ class . " 
 Bastard died in Taunton on 2 April 1901 , aged 39 , while employed in scholastic work . 
 = Mary Carpenter = 
 Mary Carpenter ( 3 April 1807 – 14 June 1877 ) was an English educational and social reformer . The daughter of a Unitarian minister , she founded a ragged school and reformatories , bringing previously unavailable educational opportunities to poor children and young offenders in Bristol . 
 She published articles and books on her work and her lobbying was instrumental in the passage of several educational acts in the mid @-@ nineteenth century . She was the first woman to have a paper published by the Statistical Society of London . She addressed many conferences and meetings and became known as one of the foremost public speakers of her time . Carpenter was active in the anti @-@ slavery movement ; she also visited India , visiting schools and prisons and working to improve female education , establish reformatory schools and improve prison conditions . In later years she visited Europe and America , carrying on her campaigns of penal and educational reform . 
 Carpenter publicly supported women 's suffrage in her later years and also campaigned for female access to higher education . She is buried in Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol and has a memorial in the North transept of Bristol Cathedral . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Carpenter was born in 1807 , in Exeter , the first child of Lant Carpenter , a Unitarian minister in Exeter , and Anna ( or Hannah ) Penn . In 1817 the family moved to Bristol , where her father took charge of the Lewin 's Mead Unitarian meeting house . He established a boarding school at Great George Street , Brandon Hill , which was run by his wife and daughters , where Mary studied the sciences , mathematics , Greek and Latin . She taught in the school , had spells as a governess in the Isle of Wight and Hertfordshire and , in 1827 , returned to Bristol to become head teacher at had by now become Mrs Carpenter 's Boarding School for Young Ladies . 
 In 1833 she met Ram Mohan Roy , a founder of the Brahmo Samaj movement which reformed social Hinduism , and was influenced by his philosophy during his short stay with Miss Castle and Miss <unk> at Beech House in Stapleton before Roy died of meningitis in September of that year . Later that year she also met Joseph Tuckerman , an American Unitarian who had founded the Ministry @-@ at @-@ Large to the Poor in Boston , Massachusetts . He is said to have directly inspired her start on the path of social reform , partly by a chance remark made when walking with Carpenter through a slum district of Bristol . A small boy in rags ran across their path and Tuckerman remarked , " That child should be followed to his home and seen after . " He had established a Farm School in Massachusetts , which became the model for later reformatories . Carpenter 's later writings are based upon ideas she developed from her correspondence with Tuckerman . 
 = = Social work and anti @-@ slavery = = 
 In 1835 she helped organise a " Working and Visiting Society " , in the slums around Lewin 's Mead , of which she remained secretary for nearly twenty years . This group was inspired by Tuckerman 's work in Boston . The purposes of such societies were to visit the poor and raise funds from the emerging middle classes to alleviate poverty and improve education . After her father 's death in 1840 , Carpenter worked with her sisters in her mother 's boarding school in Whiteladies Road , Clifton . 
 In 1843 , her interest in the anti @-@ slavery movement was aroused by a visit from Boston philanthropist Samuel May . In 1846 she attended a meeting which was addressed by prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass , who had escaped from slavery in 1838 . She contributed to fund @-@ raising efforts in the abolitionist cause and maintained an interest in this for the next twenty years . Her brothers William , Philip and Russell and her sister Anna were also active in this campaign . In 1851 the return of a fugitive slave from Boston back to the southern states caused her to say of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 that the United States had " committed an atrocious act ... against humanity , against itself , against God . " This event caused her to concentrate on her educational work . 
 A bill had been introduced into Parliament " to make provision for the better education of children in manufacturing districts " , but it failed to pass due to nonconformist opposition as it was seen to give pre @-@ eminence to the position of the Church of England . As a result of the failure of the bill , ragged schools sprang up in many English towns , providing education , food and clothing to the poor , and prompting Carpenter to start such a school herself in Lewin 's Mead , Bristol . A night school for adults soon followed . In 1848 the closure of the Carpenters ' private school gave her more time for educational and charity work . She published a memoir of Joseph Tuckerman and a series of articles on ragged schools which were published in The Inquirer , an English Unitarian newspaper , and later published in book form . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 This was followed in 1851 by the publication of Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes , and for Juvenile Offenders . She sketched out three classes of schools as urgently needed ; good free day schools ( for the children in the general population ) , feeding industrial schools ( for children in need ) and reformatory schools ( for young offenders ) . This book drew public attention to her work , and she began to communicate with leading educational and reformist thinkers and reformers . Carpenter was consulted by those drafting educational bills , and she was invited to give evidence before House of Commons committees and in 1852 she published Juvenile Delinquents , their Condition and Treatment , which contributed to the passing of the Juvenile Offenders Act in 1854 . 
 In 1852 she put her ideas into practice , establishing a reformatory school at Bristol in 1852 , in Kingswood in the premises of a school which had originally been set by John Wesley . Originally this was for boys and girls , but she soon decided to separate the sexes and set up a girls ' reformatory in what is now the Red Lodge Museum in 1854 , initially funded by Lady Byron . 
 = = = Red Lodge Reformatory = = = 
 When Lady Byron died in 1860 , Mary Carpenter was given a legacy to outright purchase the Red Lodge , including a cottage to be used for training the girls in domestic service . Mary Carpenter ’ s detailed diaries ( Ref . <unk> / 1 @-@ 2 ) ( online catalogue ) present the earliest days at the Red Lodge transforming it from deserted house into functional school , including the discovery of a human foot in an outhouse . Carpenter ’ s diaries also reveal the use of ‘ the cells ’ located in the cellar of the Red Lodge for disciplining “ violent , refractory and noisy girls ” . Other punishments included caning and having their hair cut very short . 
 The famous anti @-@ vivisectionist , Frances Power Cobbe worked at the Red Lodge and lived with Mary Carpenter from 1858 @-@ 9 , but a turbulent relationship between the two meant that Cobbe left the school . 
 Her strong religious beliefs drove her reforms . " Love must be the ruling sentiment of all who attempt to influence and guide these children " , she wrote in Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes , and for Juvenile Offenders . Now that the principle of reformatory schools was established , Carpenter agitated for free day schools , arguing the ragged schools were entitled to financial aid from the government . At the Oxford meeting of the British Association ( 1860 ) she read a paper on this subject , and , mainly owing to her instigation , a conference on ragged schools in relation to government grants for education was held at Birmingham in 1861 . 
 In the same year , Carpenter was invited to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on the Education of Destitute Children . Amongst other evidence she criticised Catholic priests who warned young children of Irish immigrants from attending her ragged school . She condemned the " low Anglo Irish " as combining " the vices of the English in a large commercial town with their ... natural character in a very undesirable way . " 
 She further said , " I can only say that the children told us that the priests had in one case flogged a child for coming to our school , and had used very strong influence to prevent them from coming , and that I have myself been absolutely insulted in the street by Catholic children ... who feel erroneously that they were showing their zeal for their own religion by insulting Protestants . " 
 = = India = = 
 In 1866 Carpenter visited India , which had been an ambition of hers since her meeting with Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1833 . She visited Calcutta , Madras and Bombay , finding that for the most part girls were not educated past the age of twelve years , mainly due to a lack of educated female teachers . During her visit Carpenter met Keshab Chandra Sen , the leader of Brahmo Samaj . Sen asked her to form an organisation in Britain to improve communication between British and Indian reformers , which she did in 1870 , establishing the National Indian Association . She visited many schools , hospitals and gaols and encouraged both Indian and British colonial administrators to improve and fund these . She was particularly concerned that the lack of good female education led to a shortage of women teachers , nurses and prison attendants . The Mary Carpenter Hall at the Brahmo Girls school in Calcutta was erected as a memorial to this work . 
 She also participated in the inauguration of the Bengal Social Science Association , and addressed a paper to the governor @-@ general on proposals for female education , reformatory schools and improving the conditions of gaols . She returned to India in 1868 and achieved funding to set up a Normal School to educate female Indian teachers . In 1875 she made a final visit and was able to see many of her schemes in operation . She also presented proposals to for Indian prison reform to the Secretary of the Indian Government . 
 = = Europe and America = = 
 At the International Penal and Prison Congress in 1872 Carpenter read a paper on The Principles and Results of the English Reformatory and Certified Industrial Schools . She read forty papers at conferences of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science between the years of 1857 and 1746 , gave many public lectures and was known as one of the most prominent speakers on social reform in an era when few women ever addressed public meetings . 
 Carpenter 's work now began to attract attention in Europe and further afield . Not all of such attention was favourable , Pope Pius IX condemned her books and her work in 1864 . Princess Alice of Hesse , who had become interested in social reform , invited her , along with Catherine <unk> , to Darmstadt to help organise a Congress of Women Workers in 1872 . This meeting resolved to work towards a " better preparation for domestic life " and " to pay greater attention to the mental development of an interest in the practical problems of life . " At the conclusion of the meeting Carpenter proposed the establishment of an International Union for the Industrial Education of Women . She went on to Neuchâtel , Switzerland to study Louis Guillaume 's prison system , and in 1873 to America , where she met abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass . She visited prisons and in 1874 wrote to the New York Prison Association to express her concern about " the dreadful state of the Prisons " . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Carpenter supported the movement for the higher education of women , and had always supported the feminist cause but for most of her life would not do so publicly , believing that the unpopularity of the movement for women 's suffrage might damage her educational and penal reforms . But she did in 1877 , the year of her death , appear on a public platform in Bristol , supporting the Bristol and West of England Society for Women ’ s Suffrage . She was invited for an interview with Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale at Windsor Castle in 1868 . 
 Carpenter never married , but she did adopt a five @-@ year @-@ old girl , Rosanna in 1858 . She died , in her sleep , at the Red Lodge in June 1877 and was buried at Arnos Vale Cemetery . Her funeral cortège was half a mile long . A public meeting in October 1877 raised £ 2 @,@ 700 to be spent on her reform schools and a memorial in Bristol Cathedral . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The reformatory school in Kingswood was active until 1984 and the Red Lodge Girls ' Reformatory closed in 1918 . Carpenter 's campaigns for juvenile penal reform had a major influence on the development of a more enlightened regime for dealing with young offenders . Her writings , political activism and public addresses had a major influence on correctional education in Britain , Europe , India and America and helped bring about major reforms in the 19th and 20th century . However , many of the causes of youth crime apparently remain unaddressed in the early 21st century and failures in contemporary youth jails have been criticised by official bodies .

 = Hurricane Easy ( 1950 ) = 
 Hurricane Easy was the fifth tropical storm , hurricane , and major hurricane of the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season . The hurricane developed in the western Caribbean Sea on September 1 , and tracked northeastward . After crossing Cuba , the hurricane rapidly strengthened in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to reach peak winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) . Easy executed a cyclonic loop , moved northeastward to hit near Cedar Key , Florida , executed a second loop , and hit western Florida again . After rapidly weakening over Florida , the hurricane turned to the northwest , and ultimately dissipated over northeastern Arkansas on September 9 . From the point when Hurricane Easy entered the Gulf of Mexico until it weakened to a tropical storm , it was observed nearly constantly from radars or Reconnaissance Aircraft . 
 Easy is the most recent major hurricane to strike the Homosassa , Florida , area . Due to the hurricane remaining near the northwest Florida coast for an extended period of time , Easy produced severe rainfall and strong waves , resulting in heavy damage in the Cedar Key area . Hurricane Easy was one of two major hurricanes to strike Florida during the year ; the other was Hurricane King which affected Miami . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Following the passage of Hurricane Baker through the Caribbean Sea , a trough of low pressure persisted across the western Caribbean Sea . On August 31 , convection became more concentrated to the south of the Isle of Youth , and on September 1 the disturbance developed into a tropical storm ; it was later given the name " Easy " , as part of the United States Weather Bureau naming tropical cyclones with the Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet . A developing anticyclone and moist air over the region provided favorable conditions for intensification , as the storm tracked slowly northeastward . On September 2 , Tropical Storm Easy attained hurricane status about 50 miles ( 85 km ) south of the Isle of Youth . 
 After crossing the Isle of Youth , Hurricane Easy strengthened slightly while continuing northeastward , and the storm struck the Matanzas Province of Cuba with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . The hurricane quickly crossed the island , passing just east of Havana before reaching the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 3 . After entering the Gulf of Mexico , Easy turned to the north @-@ northwest , paralleling the Florida coastline a short distance offshore while producing hurricane force winds onshore . On September 4 , the hurricane quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) , an intensity it would retain for 18 hours . That day , a ridge of high pressure strengthened to the north of the storm , leaving weaker steering currents . This caused Hurricane Easy to execute a counter @-@ clockwise loop to the west of Tampa , Florida . 
 After executing its first loop , Hurricane Easy moved northeastward at 7 mph ( 11 km / h ) until making landfall near Cedar Key on September 5 with winds of 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) . Steering currents again became weak , causing Easy to execute a second loop in 24 hours towards the southeast . After briefly emerging into the Gulf of Mexico , the hurricane made its final landfall on Homosassa Springs to the north of Tampa , and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm over land . Easy turned to the northeast , which was followed by a turn to the northwest as the storm neared the Atlantic coast . On September 7 , Easy crossed into Georgia , and shortly thereafter it weakened to a tropical depression . The depression continued northwestward for two days until dissipating over extreme northeastern Arkansas on September 9 . The reason for its erratic track , including the two loops , is unknown , although it is potentially due to a Fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Dog to its east . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 The hurricane crossed over western Cuba with winds of up to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) ; however , damage was minor , and no deaths occurred in the country . In Havana , winds decreased to 15 mph ( 24 km / h ) as the eye of the hurricane crossed over the city . 
 With an eye ranging from 18 mi ( 29 km ) to 25 mi ( 40 km ) in diameter , the hurricane was well @-@ tracked throughout its lifetime by radars at the University of Florida and by Reconnaissance Aircraft . Despite its unusual track , the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings in a timely manner , though warnings were issued for a larger area than those that actually experienced hurricane force winds . In the Florida Keys , winds from Easy reached 72 mph ( 116 km / h ) , which downed trees and power lines , littering local streets with debris . Heavy seas moved around a Navy barge , though no damage was reported . 
 Hurricane Easy produced hurricane force winds across large portions of western Florida , including over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) winds in Cedar Key for 9 and 1 / 2 hours . The town , which reported a minimum pressure of 958 @.@ 3 mbar ( 28 @.@ 30 in ) , experienced the eye of the hurricane for 2 and 1 / 2 hours while strong waves hit the coast . The tide in Tampa Bay rose 6 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) , the highest since 1921 . While looping twice along its path , the hurricane dropped heavy amounts of rainfall of 10 in ( 250 mm ) to 20 in ( 510 mm ) in large portions of northwestern Florida . Rainfall totals include 24 @.@ 5 in ( 620 mm ) in Cedar Key in 3 days and 38 @.@ 70 in ( 983 mm ) in Yankeetown , Florida , in 24 hours , which easily became the largest 24 ‑ hour rainfall total on record for the United States . The record has since been broken by Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979 with 43 in ( 1 @,@ 100 mm ) , though Easy 's total remains the largest 24 ‑ hour rainfall total on record for the state of Florida . 
 Hurricane Easy was described as the worst hurricane in the Cedar Key area in 70 years . The hurricane left half of the houses destroyed or unfit for rehabilitation , while 90 % of the others were damaged . The strong winds destroyed the roofs of 150 homes and buildings . The rainfall caused severe flooding that resulted in crop damage . Easy was indirectly responsible for two deaths due to electrocutions . In addition , 27 people were injured from the hurricane . The strong waves destroyed the fishing community 's entire fishing fleet of 100 boats , which was the town 's entire livelihood . The town 's main employment center , a broom and brush plant , was severely damaged , and would close two years after the hurricane . The hurricane also produced severe damage in Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties in the Tampa area . Throughout Florida , damages totaled $ 3 @.@ 3 million ( 1950 USD ) , a lower than expected total due to the sparse population in the area of the worst damage . After the storm 's passage throughout central and northern Florida , " blisters " developed on hundreds of cars ; the locations affected reported that the blisters formed on the surface of vehicles shortly after Easy retreated . The following day , the blisters disappeared . Researchers later created several theories as to the unusual occurrence , though they concluded that air pockets under the layer of paint expanded as a result of the decreased barometric pressure .

 Korkoro ( " Alone " in the Romani language ) is a 2009 French drama film written and directed by Tony Gatlif , starring French actors Marc Lavoine , Marie @-@ Josée Croze and James Thiérrée . The film 's cast were of many nationalities such as Albanian , Kosovar , Georgian , Serbian , French , Norwegian , and nine Romani Gatlif recruited in Transylvania . 
 Based on an anecdote about the Second World War by the Romani ( Gypsy ) historian Jacques Sigot , the film was inspired by a Romani who escaped the Nazis with help from French villagers . It depicts the rarely documented subject of Porajmos ( the Romani Holocaust ) . Other than a band of Romani people , the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy , a French teacher who was active in the French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for Romani . Gatlif had intended to make a documentary but the lack of supporting documents led him to present it as a drama . 
 The film premiered at the Montréal World Film Festival , winning the Grand Prize of the Americas , amongst other awards . It was released in France as Liberté in February 2010 , where it grossed $ 601 @,@ 252 ; revenues from Belgium and the United States brought the total to $ 627 @,@ 088 . The film 's music , composed by Tony Gatlif and Delphine Mantoulet , received a nomination in the Best Music Written for a Film category at the 36th annual César Awards . 
 Korkoro has been described as a " rare cinematic tribute " to those killed in the Porajmos . In general , it received positive reviews from critics , including praise for having an unusually leisurely pace for a Holocaust film . Critics regarded it as one of the director 's best works , and with Latcho Drom , the " most accessible " of his films . The film is considered to show Romani in a non @-@ stereotypical way , far from their clichéd depictions as musicians . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The film is set during World War II in rural Vichy France , and begins with a nine @-@ year @-@ old French boy , Claude ( Mathias Laliberté ) escaping from an orphanage . He decides to avoid state protection . He meets a Romani caravan , an extended family of 20 men , women and children , who decide to adopt him . The Romani start calling Claude , Korkoro , the free one . Fascinated by their nomadic lifestyle , Claude decides to stay with them . 
 The caravan sets up camp outside a small wine @-@ growing village , hoping to find seasonal work in the vineyards and a place to sell their wares . The village , as was the trend , is divided into two factions — one welcomes the Romanies , and the other sees them as an intrusion . Théodore Rosier ( Marc Lavoine ) , the village mayor and veterinarian , and Mademoiselle Lundi ( Marie @-@ Josée Croze ) , a school teacher and clerk in city hall , are two of the friendlier villagers . The Vichy France gendarmerie used the documentation made in the passports of its citizens to monitor their movements for which a threshold was set , along with imprisonment for violations This adversely affected the Romanies . Lundi uses her powers as a clerk , and forges their passports , removing the documentation about their movements . 
 Later , when Rosier has an accident outside the village , he is rescued by the Romani , who treat the mayor with their traditional healing practices . He sells them his father 's house , in order to protect them from the Fascist policy of imprisoning the homeless . Lundi enrolls the children in her school . The freedom @-@ loving Romani recognize that these French are trying to help but struggled with life in a fixed place and the rules of formal education . 
 When the Nazis arrive , Rosier and Lundi are revealed to be members of the French Resistance ; they are arrested and tortured during interrogation . The Nazis round up the Romani and send them to concentration camps . Claude , cared for by Rosier , chooses to go with the Romani . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 During World War II , the Porajmos was the attempt by Nazi Germany , the Independent State of Croatia , Horthy 's Hungary and their allies to exterminate the Romani people of Europe . Under Hitler ’ s rule , both Romanies and Jews were defined as " enemies of the race @-@ based state " by the Nuremberg Laws ; the two groups were targeted by similar policies and persecution , culminating in the near annihilation of both populations in Nazi @-@ occupied countries . Estimates of the death toll of Romanies in World War II range from 220 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . 
 Because Eastern European Romani communities were less organised than Jewish communities , Porajmos was not well documented . There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures , according to Ian Hancock , director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin . Tony Gatlif , whose films mostly have Romanies as subjects , had long wanted to make a documentary on this less well @-@ known subject , but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre @-@ war census figures for the Romanies made it difficult . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Gatlif 's quest began in 1970 when he approached <unk> Maximoff , a French writer of Romani ethnicity . The two went to Montreuil to interview the Romanies there who refused to discuss the subject . Gatlif was also researching the <unk> , the French who attempted to shield the Romanies from persecution . Following former French President Jacques Chirac 's efforts to honour the <unk> , Gatlif came across Yvette Lundy , a former schoolteacher in <unk> , La Marne , who had been deported for forging documents for the Romanies . Gatlif came across an anecdote by Jacques Sigot , a historian who has documented the Porajmos , which would later help with the story . The anecdote is about a Romani family saved from being sent to the camp at Montreuil @-@ Bellay by a French lawyer who sold them his home for a single franc . Unable to adjust to a stationary lifestyle , the family took to the streets , which led to their arrest in northern France and eventual incarceration in the Auschwitz concentration camp . 
 The characters in Korkoro are drawn from Sigot 's anecdote . The film traces the Romani familia 's life during the war , from their disbelief at being forbidden to travel but also being rejected by others when they stay in one place , to their arrest , incarceration , liberation with the help of a local French mayor and a notary , their struggle to live in a non @-@ nomadic way , and then final arrest before being sent to the Death Camps . The character Théodore Rosier is based on the notary in the anecdote . The other Juste character , Lise Lundi , is based on Yvette Lundy and an old teacher of Gatlif 's from Belcourt in Algeria who was a communist and an aide with the Front de Libération Nationale ( National Liberation Front ) . 
 Intended to be a documentary , Korkoro became a drama because of the lack of sufficient supporting documents . Gatlif wrote the initial script in one month ; further modifications later followed which made the film 's style a narrative by the characters Rosier and Lundi . Gatlif used Lundy 's help to write the scenes related to her , to which he added his own experiences with his teacher . The first appearance of the Romanies in the film is inspired by the way the nomadic Romanies showed up in the middle of nowhere after Gatlif had been working on the characterisation for over a year . Another year was spent in developing Taloche 's character . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Gatlif wanted to represent the entire Romani community through the characterization of Félix <unk> dit Taloche 's naiveté and purity . For example , Taloche is shown as being afraid of ghosts , which echoes the Romanies ' phobia . For Taloche 's role , Gatlif needed a musician with acrobatic skills , which was very hard to find . In Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville , he was impressed James Thiérrée , a grandson of Charlie Chaplin . A non @-@ Romani , ( though Chaplin 's grandmother was Romani ) Thiérrée learned Romani and Gypsy swing music in six months . 
 For Théodore Rosier , Gatlif wanted someone who looked like a typical Frenchman of the time , with a " voice and face a little like that of Pierre Fresnay , Maurice <unk> , Jacques Charrier or Gérard Philippe " , which he found in Marc Lavoine . Marie @-@ Josée Croze was the obvious choice for Mademoiselle Lise Lundi . Gatlif had envisioned Lundi as being like a " Hitchcock character : fragile , mysterious and strong " . 
 Pierre <unk> , the militia character played by Carlo Brandt , was presented with a pitiful look , rather than a caricature villain . Gatlif depicted him as a character with a drooping hat and a few extra pounds to symbolise the fat militia of the period . The orphan , P <unk> Claude , was played by Mathias Laliberté . Rufus was chosen by Gatlif for the role of Fernand because of his typical French looks . Puri Dai , the grandmother , was played by Raya Bielenberg , a Soviet @-@ born Norwegian artist and 2005 recipient of Oslo City art award , who uses music and dance in an effort to make the Romani culture better known in Norway . Gatlif found her in Oslo . The other notable characters in the movie , Darko , Kako , Chavo , <unk> and <unk> were played by <unk> <unk> , Georges <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Diana and Thomas Baumgartner respectively . A minor character named Levis was played by then 11 @-@ year @-@ old great @-@ grandson of Django Reinhardt , a virtuoso jazz guitarist and composer of <unk> gypsy ethnicity . The cast included people of many nationalities , Albanian , Kosovar , Georgian , Serbian , French and Norwegian along with the nine Romanies Gatlif found living in extreme poverty in Transylvania . Arrangements were made for these Romanies to stay in France for the three to four months it took to shoot the film . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The film was shot in Loire , in the Monts du <unk> , Rozier @-@ <unk> @-@ d <unk> and Saint @-@ Bonnet @-@ le @-@ Château . The tools used in the movie , which were very similar to the ones employed in 1943 , came from Transylvania . The barbed wire fences of the concentration camps are genuine ones built by the Nazis in Romania which can be differentiated from the ones used for cattle by their denser spacing . 
 The male actors were asked to grow their hair and moustaches . The actors also had to diet to lose weight to achieve the look of World War II characters . The costumes had a faded look , a reflection that people of the period owned few clothes , often only two outfits . None of the actors knew the script in advance and were only informed each night before of what they were to do in their daily scenes . The Romanies were not aware of the historic events that were the basis of the movie , and were only told that the story was set in hard times comparable to Ceaușescu 's tenure in Romania . In the scene where the Romanies revolt against the police over the death of Taloche , they were made aware of the character 's death only when the scene was being shot , leading to a genuine outpouring of emotions , making their fight with the police appear more real . Gatlif later remarked in an interview that this scene stands for the actual revolt by the Romanies in Auschwitz on May 16 , 1944 . 
 Thierrée was the only actor allowed to improvise . His characterisation of Taloche was built on spontaneity , and in many instances , Gatlif had no clue how he would act in a scene , such as in the tap scene in which he plunges into a stairwell . In another scene , in which he dances with war music in the background , Thierrée pretended to make love to the earth like an animal . Gatlif , who had wanted the character to have the ability to sense forthcoming danger , like animals often do , stated that Thierrée was suitable for the role because he is very much an animal . The dance scene where Taloche is shown falling from a tree was done without stunt doubles . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Music plays a very important role in all Gatlif 's films , such as Latcho Drom and <unk> <unk> , Scott Tobias noted in his review for NPR . Korkoro is no exception : the importance of music is evident from the opening credits in which barbed wire fences vibrate to the tune of plucked strings of a guitar and a <unk> in line with the opening lines of the screenplay , " the barbed wire sings in the wind " , to the oddest tools used to make music , such as the clanking of buckets and wagon wheels . 
 The background score was composed by Tony Gatlif and Delphine Mantoulet . The main theme of the songs is the Romani association with France . Despite the sad story , there are cheerful tracks too , with pieces for the waltz , tarantella and java . The film 's music plays a prominent role from the opening credits to Catherine Ringer 's track in the closing credits , " Les Bohemians " , a waltz piece written by Gatlif and Mantoulet , which is described as setting the tone for the film . " Les Bohemians " is the first French song ever featured in a Gatlif movie . Gatlif chose Ringer for the track , inspired by the " blood in the mouth " feel to her voice . The song translates as " Good luck to you all , if anyone worries that we ’ re gone , tell them we ’ ve been thrown from the light and the sky , we the lords of this vast universe . " The java dance piece composed by Delphine accompanies a scene where the characters secretly congregate in a barn for dancing , signifying the scenario then when public gatherings were prohibited . The track " Un <unk> A La <unk> " , sung by Gatlif 's son Valentin <unk> , plays on the existing stereotype of Romanies as chicken thieves . The film also incorporates sound effects of horses , explosions and a watch mechanism . The soundtrack also has a tune of the " Le Temps des <unk> " , the revolutionary song of the Paris Commune . The music for the song 's version in the movie was composed by Gatlif , using clockwork sounds and banjo . Other soundtrack vocalists included Kalman <unk> , Sandu <unk> and <unk> . 
 A soundtrack album was released in February , 2010 . It was nominated for the César Award in 2011 in the category Best Music Written for a Film , but lost to Alexandre Desplat 's The Ghost Writer . Korkoro 's soundtrack is said to invoke mixed feelings like good humour , nostalgia and fear , creating a universe parallel to the film . 
 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 Kokoro has been compared to Schindler 's List , a well @-@ known Holocaust movie . In his directing style Gatlif juxtaposed the vibrant Romani culture against the backdrop of war . In particular , reviewers commented on the subtle manner in which he dealt with the <unk> aspects of war , and the manner in which he portrayed the Romanies in a non @-@ stereotypical way . In addition to the Romani characters , the film also has a spy for the French Resistance and a Dickensian orphan . Critics also made comparisons between the state of the Romanies in the film , set during World War II , and their circumstances in the present . 
 = = = Holocaust elements = = = 
 Critics compared Korkoro to Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List because of the sacrifices Rosier made to protect the Romanies from the Nazis . A review in Moving Pictures Network called it " Schindler 's List minus the happy ending " , citing a lack of comic relief , creating an inability to connect with the audience . The opening scene , a close @-@ up shot of barbed wire fences stretched along wooden posts with internment camp barracks in the background , is an image common to many Holocaust films , wrote Scott Tobias , who also commented on the " <unk> " actions of Rosier who gives his home to the Romanies — an assessment backed up by Eric Hynes 's review in Time Out , New York . Sophie Benamon at L 'Express observed that Gatlif dealt with the horrors of the Holocaust by hinting at them through symbolism , such as portraying an abandoned child , suggesting imprisoned parents , and a clock with Hebrew markings seen lying abandoned in the middle of the railroad tracks , implying the passage of a train taking Jews to a ghetto . Jr Glens Heath , writing <unk> Magazine , remarked that Gatlif 's characterisation of the incomplete historic archives with which he was presented made the film a very " personal WWII historiography " , where the characters " transcend victimisation " rather than mire themselves in melodrama , regarded as a typical Holocaust movie characteristic . Michael Nordine wrote for Hammer to Nail that this film cannot be compared with Life is Beautiful and other " uplifting tales " with Holocaust themes because of its straightforward portrayal of realistic events . 
 = = = Gatlif 's " Gypsy soul " = = = 
 There were many reviews on the way Gatlif has depicted the Romanies , comparing it with their portrayals in his earlier movies . A reviewer in Variety said that the film 's central theme lies in its depiction of the " Gypsy soul " , which is its unique element , rather than its rather clichéd portrayal of the Holocaust . Tobias noted that Gatlif has depicted Romanies as " a tight , syncopated unit than a motley collection of individuals " , citing a scene where the members of a group are distressed , even though they have escaped from a ghetto , until a missing person rejoins them . Unlike his earlier films , in which the Romanies were stereotyped as musicians , Korkoro depicts them as possessing many other skills , for example as healers and blacksmiths , and that its portrayal reveals their communitarian side along with their respect for unique individual qualities , stated Odile Tremblay at Le Devoir . Brian Lafferty 's ( East County Magazine ) comments were quite the opposite , complaining that the characterisations were " bland and generic with no unique identity " except for Taloche 's , which was considered more of an annoyance . Rachel Saltz at The New York Times attributed Korkoro 's " unexpectedly leisurely quality " to the Gypsy way of living , their music , colours and bond with nature . The film also depicts the Romanies ' aversion to being tied down to one location , observed Harvey Karten at Arizona Reporter , and some of their customs , such as silencing the sounds of horse 's hooves with cloth bags , according to The Village Voice 's reviewer Nick Schager . Dan Bennett at North County Times approved of the appropriate costumes used in the movie , making it " a visually stylish and detail @-@ friendly look at the nomadic lifestyle " that prevailed at the time . 
 = = = Freedom as a theme = = = 
 A few critics suggested freedom as a theme in light of the importance shown by the characters to it . True to its title , which is a Romani word for freedom , Gatlif used his freedom to direct a tangential , poignant romantic story with the historical documents available to him , unlike other movies with similar themes , remarked Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Monde . The Village Voice review declared that it is " a magnificent paean to the mad ecstasy of freedom " . The Arizona Reporter review added that , for the Romanies , freedom means " being able to keep in motion , that is , the journey , not the destination , is the reward " . It observed the importance the characters give to freedom , citing the scene where Taloche becomes concerned that water is being " held against its will " in the taps , and " releases " it to overflow the sink onto the bathroom floor , and then the stairs , with Taloche blissfully sliding down the stairs as if he were on a Disney ride . Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche remarked that Gatlif has refreshingly portrayed the Romanies as " free @-@ spirited " characters and added that this historic film is a tribute to those free souls who take to the streets even today . The Télérama review was of the opinion that the movie runs out of steam during the scenes depicting historic events , but gains momentum in the forests and on the roads , where its characters ' passion for freedom , and hence Lavoine 's and Croze 's characters , get sidelined by that of Thierrée 's , with his St. Vitus ' dance and Dostoyevsky @-@ like ruminations . It added that Taloche is the true " incarnation " of freedom . 
 = = = Mirroring the current times = = = 
 A section of critics wrote on the relevance of the movie to the current times . In an interview , Gatlif stated that he wanted the movie to mirror the current times , adding that the times have not changed much , and that while the political extermination has gone , the psychological and political views of Romanies have not . He criticised the French law that allows wanderers to stay in one place only for 24 hours . He was also critical of the plight of Romanies in Hungary , Romania and Italy . He went on that the state of the Romanies now in many places , " with the rows of homeless people waiting for a bowl of soup with a tin can on their hands " , is not very different from that in the concentration camps . Gatlif also lashed out against the fact that until 1969 , Romanies were required to have their papers stamped at a police station or city hall whenever they arrived at or left a French village . Bob Hill at Moving Pictures Network remarked that the movie draws parallels to the fact that " we are once again veering toward a culture in which regimes and wealth determine who has the right to live free — and who has no rights at all " , and cited present happenings such as the developments in the Middle East , racial wars and inter @-@ country disputes . It added that the movie makes the audience ask themselves if they live in a society that embraces or condemns diversity .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 The film 's tone and narrative style received mixed response from the critics . Ronnie Scheib at Variety found it to be filled with excessive pathos , " shuttling between the trite and the sublime " , while Odile Tremblay ( Le Monde ) said in contrary that the film avoided excessive pathos , rendering it funny and tragic at the same time , an observation that was supported by Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Devoir , who wrote that the film mixes humour , sensitivity and drama . Hammer to Nail 's review by Michael Nordine asserted that the film is " neither a pity party nor an emotionally manipulative attempt " , but a straightforward portrayal of things as they were , citing Gatlif 's portrayal of the Romanies as " certainly sympathetic , but at no point does it seem overly so . " The film provided insufficient analysis on the " anti @-@ roaming laws " and their targeting of the Romanies , observed the reviewer , to whom the Nazi and all other anti @-@ Romani characters in the film came across as " one dimensional bigots " . Bob Hill ( Moving Pictures Network ) criticised that the film failed to strike an emotional chord , unlike other movies and books with a similar theme . He conceded it to be an " important , but not a great movie — or even a particularly good one , for that matter . " For a casual movie goer , he stated , " ' Korkoro ' feels like a slow burn , lagging on long after most of the audience has long since called it quits " . In defence of the film 's incoherent narrative style , Jr Glenn Heath at Slant Magazine explained that Gatlif intended it less as a historical drama and more as evoking the sense of a memory , imbibing the stream of consciousness techniques . Commenting on its tone , he wrote that " Korkoro is a reserved but lasting examination of collectively silent horror " . At L 'Express , Sophie Benamon declared that with the film 's controlled pace , it keeps its viewers breathless and induces emotion . Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche stated that the film transcends the stereotypes while the reviewer at Arizona Reporter noted that some might consider it to be stereotyping the Romanies . 
 On Gatlif 's direction , Odile Tremblay at Le Monde remarked that he had taken a heavy burden in directing a Holocaust movie along with coupling it with the " poetic effervescence " that the Romanies are known for . He added that this can be regarded the best among his films . Michael Nordine characterised Gatlif 's directorial style as passive and " documentarian " , such that it " sometimes verges on emotional distance " . " What easily noticeable flourishes he adds tend to be understated " , he added . Eric Hynes at TimeOut lauded Gatlif 's work in making a celebration of textures and music of the Romanies out of a melodramatic story . East County Magazine 's negative review summed that Gatlif had too much faith on his audience , " expecting them to take everything at face value " . 
 The film 's plotting and characterisation was regarded flimsy by Nick Schager at The Village Voice , who added that the film 's " robust emotion and cultural detail " offsets it . National Public Radio review by Scott Tobias stated that the film weds the exotic culture of the Romanies to the cliched themes of a war film with its characterisation as its means . With a " <unk> " Theodore Rosier , a Dickensian Claude , a hinted romance between Rosier and Miss Lundi , and the clown @-@ like Taloche , it added , Gatlif has " weaved a tapestry out of the authentic and the chintzy " . Joe <unk> at The Epoch Times stated that the film avoids simply depicting the Romanies as victims , with its " decidedly unsentimental " central character , Taloche , who is " wild almost to the point of being feral " . Sophie Benamon at L 'Express declared that the madness of Taloche is the pivotal element of the film . In Taloche 's face , Nick Schager perceived that " the film seethes with full @-@ bodied fury and anguish " . Arizona Reporter 's review lauded " Taloche 's manic antics " as " both the comic center of the film and a representation of the tragedy " . <unk> Scheib ( Variety ) admired Taloche 's characterisation , commenting on his acrobatic stunts and close @-@ to @-@ nature persona as gelling well with the film 's title of " Freedom " . Lavoine 's and Croze 's characters also received a positive mention in the reviews at L 'Express and The Epoch Times , with Sophie Benamon at L 'Express calling them " compelling " . 
 Julian Hirsch 's cinematography can be regarded as a relief to the eyes from the film 's gory Holocaust theme , stated Ronnie Scheib ( Variety ) . Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Devoir added that the beauty of scenes such as the arrival of the Romanies in caravans in their first scene and the gentle music is a stark contrast to the harsh themes of concentration camps and extermination . Odile Tremblay ( Le Monde ) made mention of a number of scenes , including the one where Taloche opens a tap to " free " water , and the scene with an abandoned watch implying the ghettos as the best moments of the film . Nick Schager ( The Village Voice ) stated that the film scores on its aesthetics in sequences depicting key elements , like the one with trains symbolising the Holocaust , and its detailed depiction of the characters ' intimate practices , which bring depth to a rather predictable plot . Brian Lafferty ( East County Magazine ) criticised Julian Hirsch for making the sequences look dull and gloomy with insufficient lighting . The tap scene received a special mention in L 'Express ' review too . 
 On its historical aspects , Alexis Campion ( Le Journal du Dimanche ) stated that this is the first French film dealing with the Porajmos . Ronnie Scheib ( Variety ) lauded the film on its exposure of the French gendarmerie 's role in the Holocaust , the reviewer added that this is the most " accessible " film of Gatlif after Latcho Drom . A review in the Independent Catholic News said that the film provides one a chance to remember the forgotten aspects of World War II and to learn more about French prejudice and the persecution of the Gypsies . 
 The movie received its highest rating of three stars from the reviewers at Le Journal du Dimanche and Slant Magazine while Arizona Reporter gave it a B + as per its grading system . 
 Korkoro is rated at 75 % on Rotten Tomatoes .

 = Convention of 1832 = 
 The Convention of 1832 was the first political gathering of colonists in Mexican Texas . Delegates sought reforms from the Mexican government and hoped to quell the widespread belief that settlers in Texas wished to secede from Mexico . The convention was the first in a series of unsuccessful attempts at political negotiation that eventually led to the Texas Revolution . 
 Under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico , Texas was denied independent statehood and merged into the new state Coahuila y Tejas . After growing suspicious that the United States government would attempt to seize Texas by force , in 1830 Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante enacted the Law of April 6 , 1830 which restricting immigration and calling for customs duty enforcement . Tensions erupted in June 1832 , when Texas residents systematically expelled all Mexican troops from eastern Texas . 
 The lack of military oversight emboldened the colonists to increase their political activity . On October 1 , 1832 , 55 political delegates met at San Felipe de Austin to petition for changes in the governance of Texas . Notably absent was any representation from San Antonio de Béxar , where many of the native Mexican settlers ( Tejanos ) lived . The delegates elected Stephen F. Austin , a highly respected empresario , as president of the convention . 
 Delegates passed a series of resolutions requesting , among other things , a repeal of the immigration restrictions , a three @-@ year exclusion from custom duties enforcement , permission to form an armed militia and independent statehood . They also voted themselves the power to call future conventions . Before the petition could be delivered to Mexico City , the political chief of Texas , Ramón Músquiz , ruled that the convention was illegal and annulled the resolutions . In a compromise , the ayuntamiento ( city council ) of San Antonio de Béxar drafted a new petition with similar language to the convention resolutions and submitted it through proper legal channels . Músquiz forwarded the new document to the Mexican Congress . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1821 several of Spain 's former colonies in the New World won their independence and banded together to create a new country , Mexico . The Constitution of 1824 established Mexico as a federalist republic comprising multiple states . Sparsely populated former Spanish provinces were denied independent statehood and instead merged with neighboring areas . The former Spanish Texas , which marked Mexico 's eastern border with the United States , was combined with Coahuila to form the new state Coahuila y Tejas . To assist in governing the large area , the state was subdivided into several departments ; all of Texas was included in the Department of Béxar . With the formation of a new state government , the Texas provincial governing committee was forced to disband , and the capital was moved from San Antonio de Béxar to Saltillo . Many Tejanos — native Mexican citizens who lived in Texas — were reluctant to give up their self @-@ rule . 
 The bankrupt federal government was unable to provide much military assistance to the settlers in Texas , who faced frequent raids by native tribes . In the hopes that an influx of settlers could control the raids , in 1824 the government appointed empresarios to settle families from the United States and Europe in Texas . As the number of Americans living in Texas blossomed , Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the United States might wish to annex the area , possibly using force . On April 6 , 1830 , the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas . The laws also cancelled all unfilled empresario contracts and called for the first enforcement of customs duties . 
 The new laws angered both Tejanos and recent immigrants ( Texians ) . Stephen F. Austin , a well @-@ respected empresario who had brought the first group of American settlers to Texas , warned Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante that the laws seemed designed to destroy the colonies . Texas 's two delegates to the state legislature , both Tejanos , were so vocal in their opposition that one of them was expelled from the legislature . Austin was elected to fill his seat , and in December 1830 he left for Saltillo . 
 Implementation of the laws led to much tension within Texas . Much to the displeasure of the colonists , a new military post was established in Anahuac to begin collecting customs duties . The commander of the post , Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn , often clashed with the locals over his strict interpretation of Mexican law . In June 1832 , colonists armed themselves and marched on Anahuac . As a result of these Anahuac Disturbances , Bradburn was forced to resign . 
 The small Texian rebellion coincided with a revolt led by General Antonio López de Santa Anna against Bustamante 's centralist government . The chaos in the Mexican interior and the Texian success at Anahuac emboldened other Texas settlers to take arms against garrisons throughout eastern Texas . Within weeks , settlers expelled all Mexican soldiers from eastern Texas . Free from military oversight , the settlers began to increase their political activity .

 Buoyed by their success , Texians organized a political convention to persuade Mexican authorities to weaken the Laws of April 6 , 1830 . On August 22 , the ayuntamiento at San Felipe de Austin ( the capital of Austin 's colony ) called for each district to elect five delegates . Although Austin attempted to dissuade the instigators , elections were held before his return from Saltillo . Sixteen communities chose delegates . The two municipalities with the largest Tejano population , San Antonio de Béxar and Victoria , refused to participate . The majority of the elected delegates were known as relatively even @-@ tempered . Many known agitators , such as James Bowie and William B. Travis , were defeated . Tejanos did not have a large presence at the convention , largely due to the boycott by the Béxar and Victoria municipalities . Convention organizers invited several prominent Tejanos from these towns to attend , but all declined . 
 On October 1 , 1832 , 55 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin ; attendance may have been diminished due to the short notice . The gathering marked the first time residents from each of the colonies had convened to discuss common goals . 
 The convention was called to order by John Austin , one of the alcaldes of San Felipe de Austin . In his remarks , John Austin laid out four key points that the convention needed to address : the " misrepresentations " made by " enemies of Texas " that the settlers desired independence from Mexico , an appeal of the restrictions on immigration from the United States , a method to grant land titles to residents in certain areas of the province , and reduction of tariffs on many imported items . The first order of business was the election of officers . Stephen F. Austin and William H. Wharton , a known hothead , were nominated to lead the convention ; Austin won , 31 – 15 . Frank W. Johnson , who had led the armed resistance at the Anahuac Disturbances , was elected secretary . In his acceptance speech , Austin praised the delegates for exerting their constitutional rights to petition the government . 
 Over the next six days , the delegates adopted a series of resolutions requesting changes in the governance of Texas . Historian Eugene Campbell Barker suggests that the discussions would likely not have concluded so swiftly unless the delegates had done " considerable preparation before the meeting " . Several of the resolutions were designed to stimulate the local economy . Delegates requested that customs duty enforcement be delayed until 1835 and that citizens be granted a method to remove corrupt customs officers . Resolutions encouraged that land titles be issued more quickly and that public lands be sold to raise money for bilingual schools . Delegates from Nacogdoches asked that the government take a firmer hand in preventing new settlers from encroaching on lands that had previously been promised to native tribes . After explaining that law @-@ abiding potential citizens were being excluded from Texas while disreputable squatters continued to stream illegally in , the delegates asked for the repeal of the prohibition on immigration from the United States . Furthermore , they requested permission to raise a militia , ostensibly for protection from marauding native tribes . The most controversial resolution asked that Texas become an independent state , separate from Coahuila . The separation request was added by a vote of 36 – 12 . The motion included as justification the fact that Coahuila and Texas were very dissimilar in climate and economy and mentioned that Texas 's limited representation in the state legislature made it very difficult to enact laws that specifically addressed the needs of its citizens . Delegates insisted that independent statehood was not a pretext for secession from Mexico . 
 After approving the list of resolutions , delegates created a seven @-@ member central committee to convene future meetings . The central committee would be based in San Felipe " for the purpose of circulating information of events of importance to the interest of the people " . In addition , each municipality was asked to create a committee of correspondence and safety . The sub @-@ committees would keep in close contact with the central committee because " united our strength and resources are more than adequate to our defense in any possible event . <unk> , we may become an easy prey , even to a handful of cowardly invaders . " 
 The convention adjourned on October 6 after unanimously electing Wharton to deliver the resolutions to the state legislature in Saltillo and to the Mexican Congress in Mexico City . Just before the group dispersed , Rafael <unk> , the alcalde ( mayor ) of Goliad , arrived . He was the only delegate from Goliad and the only Tejano to appear at the convention . <unk> volunteered to accompany Wharton at his own expense — he and other delegates thought the expedition might have more success if a Tejano was also involved . Days later , Austin wrote that " we have just had a convention of all Texas , native Mexicans and foreign settlers — all united as one man " . 
 = = Results = = 
 Following the convention , much of the disquiet in Texas subsided . Austin believed the public was calmed simply by having the opportunity to air their grievances . Before the list of concerns could be presented to the state and federal governments , Ramón Músquiz , the political chief , or head , of the Department of Béxar , ruled that the convention was illegal . This type of activism was traditionally forbidden in Texas . The law directed that citizens should protest to their local ayuntamiento ( similar to a city council ) , which would forward their concerns to the political chief . The political chief could then escalate the concerns to the state or federal government . Because the colonists had not followed this process , Músquiz annulled their resolutions . The ayuntamientos at San Felipe , Nacogdoches , Gonzales and Liberty half @-@ heartedly apologized for their participation , and Wharton 's mission was cancelled . 
 The lack of Tejano representation and the San Antonio de Béxar residents ' refusal to participate fostered a perception that only newcomers to Texas were dissatisfied . Austin agreed to meet with the political leaders in San Antonio de Béxar to persuade them to support the resolutions . These Tejano leaders , including Erasmo Seguin , largely agreed with the result of the convention but opposed the methods by which the resolutions had been proposed . The Tejano leaders urged patience ; Bustamante was still president and would not look favorably on a petition from Texas settlers who had sided with his rival , Santa Anna . 
 Austin and the Tejano leaders agreed to a compromise . Because San Antonio de Béxar was the seat of the Department of Béxar , its ayuntamiento drafted a petition containing similar language to the convention resolutions . The petition was endorsed by the ayuntamientos at Goliad , San Felipe , and Nacogdoches and then given to Músquiz , who forwarded it to the Mexican Congress in early 1833 . Although Músquiz had publicly supported the petition , he secretly included a note to the Coahuila y Tejas governor warning that this might be a precursor to secession . 
 The political leaders also agreed to Austin 's stipulation that if the federal government refused to address the petition within several months , Texas residents would form their own state government , essentially declaring independence from Coahuila , if not from Mexico . The central committee elected by the convention was too impatient to wait long . In late December , the committee called for a March election for delegates to the Convention of 1833 . The second convention reiterated some of the previous concerns and took additional steps to declare Texas an independent state , further concerning Mexican <unk> , who feared this was a step towards Texas joining the United States . 
 The Mexican government attempted to address some of the concerns identified by the conventions of 1832 and 1833 . In November 1833 , part of the Laws of April 6 , 1830 were repealed , allowing Americans to immigrate legally to Texas . Several months later , Texas was granted increased representation in the Coahuila y Tejas legislature . Several American legal concepts , such as trial by jury , were introduced to Texas , and English was authorized as a second language . Unimpressed with these compromises , some Texas residents continued to campaign for independent statehood . Rising tensions eventually led to the Texas Revolution , which began in October 1835 .

 " Hold On to Sixteen " received a mixed reception from reviewers , though the music was more favorably received . Robert Canning of IGN called it " very underwhelming " and gave it an " okay " rating of 6 @.@ 5 out of 10 ; he noted that competition episodes such as this one spend more time on performance , and deemed the non @-@ performance segments " blase " . Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman characterized " the moral of this week 's story : embrace your youth " as " overkill " , but noted that once the competition began , the episode " succeeded in spite of itself " . Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times called it a " feel @-@ good episode " that came as a " huge relief " after the show " had lost its moral footing these last few weeks " , and AOLTV 's Crystal Bell said it gave her " some hope for the rest of the season " . Rae Votta of Billboard summarized the episode this way : " Overall , it was a Glee that felt like the plots were dealt with as fast as humanly possible to cram in as much singing and dancing as we can . " 
 Many reviewers took issue with the implausible nature of several plot points . Jen Chaney of The Washington Post decried the " lack of basic logic " in Sam being " able to so easily transfer back to McKinley " , Entertainment Weekly 's Abby West pointed out the " considerable amount of paperwork " required for a " minor to move in with <unk> guardians in another state and register for school " , and Michael Slezak of TVLine was bothered that Sam 's parents did not establish who those guardians would be , and how this would affect him academically . Futterman pointed out that " Mr. Schuester has again failed to pick a set list ahead of time " despite " weeks of pretense about preparing for sectionals " . Both Slezak and MTV 's Kevin P. Sullivan were unimpressed with Quinn 's late @-@ in @-@ the @-@ game thought to apply to so competitive a school as Yale . 
 There was some puzzlement expressed by several reviewers , including Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Votta , as to why Finn would think Sam had been such a great performer to begin with that it was so important to bring him back . Despite that , Votta was pleased by Sam 's return as was Bell , who thought it was one of the more enjoyable aspects of the episode . Sam 's scene with Blaine , however , was met with criticism , but of Blaine 's characterization , not Sam 's : BuddyTV 's John Kubicek pointed out that Blaine " essentially calls Sam a whore " and that " he 's like a completely different person " . Vicki Hyman of The Star @-@ Ledger described the scene as " pretty out of character " for Blaine , and The Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson said that the entire subplot , including Finn 's antagonism toward Blaine , was " so sloppily assembled " he was glad it was ended in the following scene . The confrontation between Kurt and Sebastian over Blaine was little remarked on — West enjoyed it , but said she had been hoping for more . 
 The end of the Quinn / Shelby / Puck triangle and of " crazy Quinn " was celebrated by Bell and Reiter . Several other reviewers , including Kubicek , Slezak and Hyman , were highly critical of Shelby 's failure to acknowledge that she was in the wrong for sleeping with a student . Canning felt there was no possibility that Quinn would actually ruin Shelby and Beth 's life , since she had failed to follow through in earlier episodes , so her threat to do so lacked drama and was " hollow " . 
 Although Sullivan was enthusiastic about Shum , who he said had " emerged as a crux of the show " , he was not happy with his character 's " forced storyline " in the episode . Canning noted that Mike 's storyline had " been a bit cliched all season " , though it had been " fun to root for him " , but he was puzzled by the lack of a " Mike Chang dance showcase " at the competition to justify his father 's change of heart . 
 Rebecca Ford of The Hollywood Reporter was glad that the " tiresome " split glee clubs were now a single group again , though Flandez called the final scene " too neat to be an ending " . While many reviewers , including Reiter , approved of the conclusion of most of the season 's storylines in this episode , Canning called it a " nice little reset button for a season that started off with promise but has failed to deliver of late " , and Kubicek wrote , " With the return of Sam , it 's kind of like the first seven episodes of the season never even happened . " 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The episode 's opening musical number , " Red Solo Cup " , was given a mixed reception by reviewers . Chaney called it a " fun change of pace " , though she wasn 't fond of Toby Keith , who originated the song ; Bell admitted she had never been " much of a Sam fan " , but she thought Sam 's version " was pretty great " . Canning called the song a " terrible choice " , and Ford wrote that it " fell unbelievably short " . Futterman credited a " surprisingly natural country twang from Sam " , but added that the " choir room performance feels mostly stale " . Votta could find no sense in its inclusion , and called it the " weirdest song on " Glee " since ' Run Joey Run ' " , while Hankinson was harsher , and declared it to be his " least favorite Glee performance of all time " . West , on the other hand , said the song was " perfect for Sam " , and Overstreet 's " smooth sultry voice nailed it " . 
 Harmony 's performance with the <unk> received good marks , if not overly enthusiastic ones . Chaney said it was " fine " and gave it a " B " , while Futterman wrote , " Harmony brings Latin flair and proves that she 's legit vocal competition , but the song as a whole has the weird effect of feeling both over @-@ the @-@ top and watered down at the same time . " Kubicek called the performance " fairly forgettable " , while West and Slezak felt that it was not a show @-@ choir presentation , though both gave it a " B + " grade : Slezak termed it a " showcase for a <unk> with some jaunty backup dancers " , and West likened it to a " lounge act " . Both Votta and Hyman were impressed with Harmony : Hyman characterized her as " pretty awesome " , and Votta said she was a " fantastic singer " . 
 Sullivan was amazed that the " I Will Survive " / " Survivor " Troubletones performance " made the mash @-@ up fun for a second time " , and Bell called it " awesome " . Chaney characterized the Mercedes and Santana vocals as " strong " , as did Votta , but both felt it was not as good as the " Rumour Has It " / " Someone Like You " mash @-@ up two episodes prior . Slezak gave the performance an " A " , and said , " I loved that the Troubletones broke free of the standard @-@ operating glee @-@ club choreography , and that there ’ s another legendary duet to add to the <unk> oeuvre . " Flandez wrote that it was " superbly well done and well choreographed " , except for the jumping jacks . Votta thought Blaine and Finn 's triumphant fist bump during the number seemed warranted , though Slezak and Sullivan seemed unconvinced . 
 The New Directions set of three Jackson family numbers was favorably reviewed by most critics , though they didn 't necessarily agree on which songs were most effective . Bell couldn 't decide whether she enjoyed these three songs or the Troubletones mash @-@ up more , and West felt the " choreography on the whole thing was stellar " , and graded it an " A + " . Votta singled out " ABC " , which demonstrated " what a lovely singer Tina is " , and Kubicek said he enjoyed it " mostly because Tina deserves more singing time , and I love the fact that Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos " . Chaney called it " a solid performance " and gave it a B + , while Futterman wrote that it " felt like a flashback to the New Directions ' group performances of yesteryear , when it was all about an over @-@ the @-@ top , feel @-@ good attitude " . The dancing in " Control " was highlighted in many reviews : Hyman and Slezak were complimentary , but Chaney wrote that the " choreography seemed a little awkward and occasionally out of synch " , that it was " the least effective of the three Jackson numbers " and added that for her " this felt dated when it could have been retro @-@ fresh " ; she graded the song a " C " . However , Futterman made mention of the " slick dance moves " , and Votta noted that the " jazz band guys " were " holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number " . However , for Kubicek , the song " definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance " . Bell characterized the final song as " an amazing ' Man in the Mirror ' cover " , and Chaney said it was " the best of their three songs " , and gave it an " A − " . However , Slezak wrote that it " proved to be a tonally jarring ending to the performance " . 
 " We Are Young " was received with near @-@ universal enthusiasm . Slezak called it " totally joyous fun " and Chaney said it was " the most effortlessly joyful moment of the night " ; the two handed out " A − " and " A " grades respectively . Futterman felt it was performed " with silly spirit " , and was " another throwback to simpler and successful Glee moments " . Hankinson thought it was the best musical number of the night , even if " it was more than a little reminiscent of their performance of ' Dog Days Are Over ' " , but Kubicek thought the earlier song was " a million times better " . West called it a " great closing song " , and Votta said " the finale singing was the best kind of ' Glee ' " .

 Grow Home is an adventure game played from a third person perspective . Players control a robot named B.U.D. ( Botanical Utility Droid ) , and are tasked with oxygenating its homeworld by growing and climbing a " Star Plant " , a giant <unk> , and harvesting its seeds . Players are able to freely explore an open world , and have the ability to individually make B.U.D. ' s left and right hands grab , with a button for each hand . The player can reach a small distance and grab onto any part of the environment , allowing them to push and climb objects . Throughout the game , <unk> 's ship computer entitled M.O.M. speaks to the player , informing them of gameplay objectives . 
 The game allows players to grow " Star Shoots " from the Star Plant , which act as platforms for the player to traverse . Star Shoots can only be grown for a limited amount of time , and their path of growth can be directed by the player . They can be used to carry the player to various floating islands found throughout the game world . Some islands , called " Energy Rocks " , can be connected to Star Shoots to make the Star Plant grow along a set path . These Energy Rocks become more distant from the Star Plant as the game progresses . 
 Upon growing to certain heights , the Star Plant grows through larger floating islands . These islands , along with the smaller ones surrounding the Star Plant , contain power @-@ up crystals which can be collected to provide B.U.D. with extra abilities . Creatures and other plant life can also be found throughout the game 's islands , as well as environmental features , such as caves and water currents . Some parts of the environment , such as leaves growing off of both the Star Plant and Star Shoots that allow the player to jump to greater heights than normally possible , can affect how the player moves throughout the world . <unk> pads allow the player to move around the world quickly and act as save points . The player also respawns at their last activated teleportation pad if they die , which can be caused by falling long distances , being in too much water for too long , or by the player making B.U.D. self @-@ destruct . Additionally , players can scan various flora and fauna into the teleporters to retrieve data from them . Items can be picked up by the player and stored in B.U.D. ' s backpack one at a time , such as flower parachutes that make the player fall more slowly towards the ground , and leaf gliders that allow the player to travel further through the air . 
 Once the player grows the Star Plant to 2000 metres and returns a seed to M.O.M. , the main objective is completed , and the player is given the choice of collecting eight more seeds . Completing this final objective unlocks a special suit that allows the player to jump twice as high , and finishes the game . Players are free to explore the world after completion . 
 = = Development = = 
 Grow Home began development as an experimental project created by an eight @-@ person team at Ubisoft Reflections , initially being launched internally for the staff . After testing the project , management at Ubisoft decided to officially launch the title , which was developed into a full game inspired by Hitchhiker ’ s Guide to the Galaxy and WALL @-@ E. 
 Grow Home has a minimalist , low poly graphical style . It uses procedural animation and physics @-@ based gameplay , which allow objects and the player 's actions to adapt to any part of the environment . The developers recommend using a gamepad to play the game , as it gives the player " the deepest connection to the gameplay mechanics " . The game was created using the Unity engine and , unlike other Ubisoft titles , it does not require Uplay to run . After being announced in a post on the official Ubisoft blog on 22 January 2015 , Grow Home was released on 4 February for Microsoft Windows via Valve 's Steam service , as well as being released on 1 September for PlayStation 4 . An OS X version will be released if the PC version sells enough copies . Ubisoft have released multiple updates for the game following release , containing new missions , skins and bug fixes .

 Grow Home received positive reviews upon release . Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating in the 0 @-@ 100 range , calculated an average score of 75 based on 46 reviews for the PC version , indicating " generally favorable " reviews . On aggregate website GameRankings , it received a 75 % based on 23 reviews for the PC version . According to Steam Spy , by March 2016 around 300 @,@ 000 copies had been sold on Steam alone . 
 Grow Home 's open world was highly regarded by critics . PC Gamer 's Erica Webber stated that the game 's joy is in discovery . Destructoid 's Ben Davis said that he got " more than enough enjoyment out of exploring the world " , and Eurogamer 's reviewer Christian Donlan called the game 's map wonderfully generous and varied . However , reviewers criticised the game 's length , with Davis calling it relatively short and both Webber and Donlan stating that it should only take the player a couple of hours or less to complete the game 's campaign , although Webber said that the game has a great pace . IGN 's Brandin Tyrrel also said that there 's little reason to return to the game after completing the main campaign . 
 The game 's visuals were also commended , with Tyrrel calling the game 's world gorgeous and vivid , as well as calling its procedurally generated animation a " fantastic example of how movement can speak volumes more than words " . However , he also stated that the animation system sometimes caused B.U.D. ' s limbs to knot themselves into a state of " unnatural contortion " . Rock , Paper , Shotgun 's John Walker said that the main character 's movement is " deeply involved in the world " , calling its animation the reason the game is " so special " . 
 Critics were divided on the game 's control scheme . Donlan wrote that Grow Home is the best rock @-@ climbing game he has ever played , stating that the " initially bewildering " controls allow the player to move through the world " with real skill " . Davis called it the most entertaining aspect of the game , but also stated that the walking controls were awkward at times . Webber said that the climbing controls caused her wrist strain , and that the walking controls were " cute until the first time you overshoot or go skidding off the edge " .

 " Jack Meets Dennis " is the sixth episode of the first season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock . It was written by co @-@ executive producer Jack Burditt , and directed by Juan J. Campanella . The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) in the United States on November 30 , 2006 . Guest stars in this episode include Michael <unk> , Katrina Bowden , Greta <unk> , Teddy Coluca , Rachel Dratch , Annette Hunt , Keith Powell , Ali Reza , Lonny Ross , Brian Stack , and Dean Winters . 
 In the episode , Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) takes back her sleazy ex @-@ boyfriend Dennis Duffy ( Winters ) , while Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) takes it upon himself to convince her that she is headed for a life of mediocrity . Meanwhile , Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) is enraged when a magazine calls him " normal " , and at the same time Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) becomes worried about her age when Jack asks her how old she is .

 Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) and Dennis Duffy ( Dean Winters ) have gotten back together after Dennis was the only person who remembered her birthday . Disturbed by Liz 's acceptance of mediocrity , her boss , Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) , tries to reform her into someone who enjoys the good life . He refers Liz to the fanciest restaurant in the city , Stone . Nevertheless , Liz declines Jack 's offer to be her mentor . That night at Stone , Jack and his date walk by Liz and Dennis 's table , with Jack very unimpressed by Dennis 's manners . The following day , Jack introduces Liz to a former mentee of his , Howard Jorgensen ( Brian Stack ) . At lunch the next day , Liz realizes she is frustrated with her relationship with Dennis , then she storms off to Jack 's office to ask for help . Jack motivates Liz to end it with him . Liz comes home to break up with Dennis , only to find him distraught after a loss of his favorite hockey team , the New York Islanders . As a result , Dennis moves in with her . 
 Meanwhile , Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) is upset after being identified in a magazine as an actor behaving normally , far from the insane persona he is trying to maintain . To re @-@ establish his street cred , Tracy gets a dragon tattoo on his face , but is later identified as made of <unk> . At the same time , Josh Girard ( Lonny Ross ) is told that he is to receive a special gift from Liz Taylor ( Rachel Dratch ) as a response to an impression he did of the actress on TGS with Tracy Jordan . Liz Taylor sneaks into the 30 Rock studios and , upset over Josh 's impersonation , brutally beats him with a fire extinguisher . 
 At the same time , Jack , responding to audience research , starts cleaning out green clothes from the set . He asks Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) , one of the stars of TGS , how old she is , and she tells him that she is 29 . As a result of this exchange , Jenna gets botox and collagen injections that go terribly wrong . Later , during a sketch rehearsal — involving impersonations of Condoleezza Rice , Laura Bush , and John Kerry — the various mishaps of Tracy , Jenna , and Josh prompt Liz and Pete Hornberger ( Scott Adsit ) that it would be impossible for the three to perform on the show . Fortunately , the power in the NBC Studios goes out , canceling the show .

 " Jack Meets Dennis " was written by co @-@ executive producer Jack Burditt and directed by Juan J. Campanella . This was Burditt 's first writing credit , and was Campanella 's first directed episode . The episode originally aired on November 30 , 2006 on NBC as the sixth episode of the show 's first season and overall of the series . 
 Actor Dean Winters made his 30 Rock debut in this episode as the character Dennis Duffy , a former ex @-@ boyfriend of Tina Fey 's character , Liz Lemon . Comedian actor Brian Stack made his first appearance as Howard Jorgensen , a GE executive and associate of Jack Donaghy 's in the episode . Stack would guest star in the episodes " Succession " and " Larry King " . Rachel Dratch , longtime comedy partner and fellow Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) alumna of Fey , the latter who was the show 's head writer from 1999 until 2006 , was originally cast to portray Jenna Maroney . Dratch played the role in the show 's original pilot , but in August 2006 , actress Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch 's replacement .

 In its original American broadcast , " Jack Meets Dennis " was watched by an average of 5 @.@ 97 million households , according to the Nielsen ratings system . It received a 2 @.@ 1 rating among viewers in the 18 – 49 demographic . " Jack Meets Dennis " finished in 70th place in the weekly ratings for the week of November 27 – December 3 , 2006 . This was an increase from the previous episode , " Jack @-@ Tor " , which was watched by 5 @.@ 2 million American viewers . 
 Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said the series worked because it played " with the absurdities of the television business lightly " . Stanley felt that 30 Rock was at its best when it revolved around the characters , and not the show itself . IGN contributor Robert Canning said that although Tracy and Jenna " had their moments in two rather weak storylines " , the " unfunny and distracting ' Where 's Waldo ? ' casting [ regarding Rachel Dratch 's different characters that she has played on the show ] " disrupted the flow of the episode . He enjoyed the improvement of the show , and said that " though not every story this week was stellar , you didn 't go long without a decent laugh . " Canning gave " Jack Meets Dennis " a 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 rating . TV Guide 's Matt Mitovich said the episode was " one of the stronger episodes thus far " , citing that " [ e ] <unk> got funny stuff to do , the Jack @-@ Liz scenes were crackling and teaming with Liz @-@ induced self @-@ humiliation , and we even got a Rachel Dratch cameo ( as that angry , angry Liz Taylor ) . " Mitovich who had not been a fan of the Jenna character , said that he enjoyed her in this episode . Alan Pergament for The Buffalo News wrote , " The extent that stars go to literally and figuratively maintain their images probably sounded funny on paper [ in regards to Tracy and Jenna 's storylines ] , but most of it falls flat and illustrates why 30 Rock has been sinking like a rock " . Pergament gave this episode two out of four stars . Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald enjoyed Dean Winters ' appearances on 30 Rock , noting that he did a " hilarious turn " as Dennis . Matt Roush for TV Guide reported that Alec Baldwin " stole the show " in this episode . 
 = Felice Beato = 
 Felice Beato ( 1832 – 29 January 1909 ) , also known as Felix Beato , was an Italian – British photographer . He was one of the first people to take photographs in East Asia and one of the first war photographers . He is noted for his genre works , portraits , and views and panoramas of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the Mediterranean region . Beato 's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries , people , and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America . His work provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War , and represents the first substantial oeuvre of photojournalism . He influenced other photographers , and his influence in Japan , where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists , was particularly deep and lasting . 
 = = Early life and identity = = 
 A death certificate discovered in 2009 shows that Beato was born in Venice in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in Florence . The death certificate also indicates that he was a British subject and a bachelor . It is likely that early in his life Beato and his family moved to Corfu , at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands , and so Beato was a British subject . 
 Because of the existence of a number of photographs signed " Felice Antonio Beato " and " Felice A. Beato " , it was long assumed that there was one photographer who somehow photographed at the same time in places as distant as Egypt and Japan . In 1983 it was shown by Chantal Edel that " Felice Antonio Beato " represented two brothers , Felice Beato and Antonio Beato , who sometimes worked together , sharing a signature . The confusion arising from the signatures continues to cause problems in identifying which of the two photographers was the creator of a given image . 
 = = Mediterranean , the Crimea and India = = 
 Little is certain about Felice Beato 's early development as a photographer , though it is said that he bought his first and only lens in Paris in 1851 . He probably met the British photographer James Robertson in Malta in 1850 and accompanied him to Constantinople in 1851 . James Robertson ( 1813 – 88 ) , became his brother @-@ in @-@ law in 1855 . Superintendent of the Imperial Mint , Robertson opened one of the first commercial photography studios in the capital between 1854 and 1856 . Robertson had been an engraver at the Imperial Ottoman Mint since 1843 and had probably taken up photography in the 1840s . In 1853 the two began photographing together and they formed a partnership called " Robertson & Beato " either in that year or in 1854 , when Robertson opened a photographic studio in Pera , Constantinople . Robertson and Beato were joined by Beato 's brother Antonio on photographic expeditions to Malta in 1854 or 1856 and to Greece and Jerusalem in 1857 . A number of the firm 's photographs produced in the 1850s are signed " Robertson , Beato and Co . " , and it is believed that the " and Co . " refers to Antonio . 
 In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato 's sister , <unk> Maria Matilda Beato . They had three daughters , Catherine Grace ( b . 1856 ) , Edith <unk> <unk> ( b . 1859 ) , and Helen <unk> ( b . 1861 ) . 
 In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava , Crimea , where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton 's departure . In contrast to Fenton 's depiction of the dignified aspects of war , Beato and Robertson showed the destruction . They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855 , producing about 60 images . 
 In February 1858 Felice Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . During this time he produced possibly the first @-@ ever photographic images of corpses . It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph 's dramatic impact ( see events at Taku Forts ) . He was also in the cities of Delhi , Cawnpore , Meerut , Benares , Amritsar , Agra , Simla , and Lahore . Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio , who later left India , probably for health reasons , in December 1859 . Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860 , setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862 . 
 = = China = = 
 In 1860 Felice Beato left the partnership of Robertson & Beato , though Robertson retained use of the name until 1867 . Beato was sent from India to photograph the Anglo @-@ French military expedition to China in the Second Opium War . He arrived in Hong Kong in March and immediately began photographing the city and its surroundings as far as Canton . Beato 's photographs are some of the earliest taken in China . 
 While in Hong Kong , Beato met Charles Wirgman , an artist and correspondent for the Illustrated London News . The two accompanied the Anglo @-@ French forces travelling north to <unk> Bay , then to <unk> and the Taku Forts at the mouth of the Peiho , and on to Peking and Qingyi Yuan , the suburban Summer Palace . For places on this route and later in Japan , Wirgman 's ( and others ' ) illustrations for the Illustrated London News would often be derived from Beato 's photographs . 
 = = = Taku Forts = = = 
 Beato 's photographs of the Second Opium War are the first to document a military campaign as it unfolded , doing so through a sequence of dated and related images . His photographs of the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale , forming a narrative recreation of the battle . The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts , the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications , and finally the devastation within the forts , including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers . The photographs were not taken in this order , as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken first — before the bodies were removed ; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts . 
 Beato 's images of the Chinese dead and his manner of producing them particularly reveal the ideological aspects of his photojournalism . Dr. David F. Rennie , a member of the expedition , noted in his campaign memoir , " I walked round the ramparts on the west side . They were thickly strewn with dead — in the north @-@ west angle thirteen were lying in one group around a gun . Signor Beato was here in great excitement , characterising the group as ' beautiful , ' and begging that it might not be interfered with until perpetuated by his photographic apparatus , which was done a few minutes afterwards . " 
 = = = Summer Palace = = = 
 Just outside Peking , Beato took photographs at <unk> Yuan ( the Summer Palace ) , a private estate of the Emperor of China comprising palace pavilions , temples , a large artificial lake , and gardens . Some of these photographs , taken between 6 and 18 October 1860 , are unique images of buildings that were plundered and looted by the Anglo @-@ French forces beginning on 6 October . On 18 and 19 October the buildings were torched by the British First Division on the orders of Lord Elgin as a reprisal against the emperor for the torture and deaths of twenty members of an Allied diplomatic party . Bennett writes that " These [ photographs ] appear to be the earliest images of Peking so far discovered , and are of the utmost historical and cultural importance . " 
 Among the last photographs that Beato took in China at this time were portraits of Lord Elgin , in Peking to sign the Convention of Peking , and Prince Kung , who signed on behalf of the <unk> Emperor . 
 Beato returned to England in October 1861 , and during that winter he sold 400 of his photographs of India and China to Henry Hering , a London commercial portrait photographer . 
 = = Japan = = 
 By 1863 Beato had moved to Yokohama , Japan , joining Charles Wirgman , with whom he had travelled from Bombay to Hong Kong . The two formed and maintained a partnership called " Beato & Wirgman , Artists and Photographers " during the years 1864 – 1867 , one of the earliest and most important commercial studios in Japan . Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato 's photographs , while Beato photographed some of Wirgman 's sketches and other works . ( Beato 's photographs were also used for engravings within Aimé Humbert 's Le Japon illustré and other works . ) Beato 's Japanese photographs include portraits , genre works , landscapes , cityscapes , and a series of photographs documenting the scenery and sites along the Tōkaidō Road , the latter series recalling the ukiyo @-@ e of Hiroshige and Hokusai . During this period , foreign access to ( and within ) the country was greatly restricted by the Shogunate . Accompanying ambassadorial delegations and taking any other opportunities created by his personal popularity and close relationship with the British military , Beato reached areas of Japan where few westerners had ventured , and in addition to conventionally pleasing subjects sought sensational and macabre subject matter such as heads on display after decapitation . His images are remarkable not only for their quality , but also for their rarity as photographic views of Edo period Japan . 
 The greater part of Beato 's work in Japan contrasted strongly with his earlier work in India and China , which " had underlined and even celebrated conflict and the triumph of British imperial might " . Aside from the Portrait of Prince Kung , any appearances of Chinese people in Beato 's earlier work had been peripheral ( minor , blurred , or both ) or as corpses . With the exception of his work in September 1864 as an official photographer on the British military expedition to Shimonoseki , Beato was eager to portray Japanese people , and did so <unk> , even showing them as defiant in the face of the elevated status of westerners . 
 Beato was very active while in Japan . In 1865 he produced a number of dated views of Nagasaki and its surroundings . From 1866 he was often caricatured in Japan Punch , which was founded and edited by Wirgman . In an October 1866 fire that destroyed much of Yokohama , Beato lost his studio and many , perhaps all , of his negatives . 
 While Beato was the first photographer in Japan to sell albums of his works , he quickly recognised their full commercial potential . By around 1870 their sale had become the mainstay of his business . Although the customer would select the content of earlier albums , Beato moved toward albums of his own selection . It was probably Beato who introduced to photography in Japan the double concept of views and costumes / manners , an approach common in photography of the Mediterranean . By 1868 Beato had readied two volumes of photographs , " Native Types " , containing 100 portraits and genre works , and " Views of Japan " , containing 98 landscapes and cityscapes . 
 Many of the photographs in Beato 's albums were hand @-@ coloured , a technique that in his studio successfully applied the refined skills of Japanese <unk> and woodblock printmakers to European photography . 
 Since about the time of the ending of his partnership with Wirgman in 1869 , Beato attempted to retire from the work of a photographer , instead attempting other ventures and delegating photographic work to others within his own studio in Yokohama , " F. Beato & Co . , Photographers " , which he ran with an assistant named H. Woollett and four Japanese photographers and four Japanese artists . Kusakabe <unk> was probably one of Beato 's artist @-@ assistants before becoming a photographer in his own right . But these other ventures would fail , and Beato 's photographic skills and personal popularity would ensure that he could successfully return to work as a photographer . 
 Beato photographed with Ueno Hikoma , and possibly taught photography to Raimund von Stillfried . 
 In 1871 Beato served as official photographer with the United States naval expedition of Admiral Rodgers to Korea . Although it is possible that an unidentified Frenchman photographed Korea during the 1866 invasion of Ganghwa Island , Beato 's photographs are the earliest of Korea whose provenance is clear . 
 Beato 's business ventures in Japan were numerous . He owned land and several studios , was a property consultant , had a financial interest in the Grand Hotel of Yokohama , and was a dealer in imported carpets and women 's bags , among other things . He also appeared in court on several occasions , variously as plaintiff , defendant , and witness . On 6 August 1873 Beato was appointed Consul General for Greece in Japan . 
 In 1877 Beato sold most of his stock to the firm Stillfried & Andersen , who then moved into his studio . In turn , Stillfried & Andersen sold the stock to Adolfo Farsari in 1885 . Following the sale to Stillfried & Andersen , Beato apparently retired for some years from photography , concentrating on his parallel career as a financial speculator and trader . On 29 November 1884 he left Japan , ultimately landing in Port Said , Egypt . It was reported in a Japanese newspaper that he had lost all his money on the Yokohama silver exchange . 
 = = Burma and Later years = = 
 From 1884 to 1885 Beato was the official photographer of the expeditionary forces led by Baron ( later Viscount ) G.J. Wolseley to Khartoum , Sudan , in relief of General Charles Gordon . 
 Briefly back in England in 1886 , Beato lectured the London and Provincial Photographic Society on photographic techniques . 
 Felice Beato arrived in Burma probably in December 1886 , after Upper Burma had been annexed by the British in late 1885 . Much publicity had been made in the British press about the three Anglo @-@ Burmese Wars , which had started in 1825 and culminated in December 1885 with the fall of Mandalay and the capture of King Thibaw Min . 
 Beato , who had covered military operations in India and China , was probably attracted by the news of the annexation . While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended , he would still get to see more of the action , as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade . This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace , Mandalay , as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners . 
 Felice Beato set up a photographic studio in Mandalay and , in 1894 , a <unk> and antiques dealership , running both businesses separately and , according to records at the time , very successfully . 
 His past experience and the credibility derived from his time in Japan brought him a large clientele of opulent locals , posing in traditional attire for official portraits . Other images , from Buddhas to landscapes and buildings , were sold from master albums in Burma and Europe . 
 In 1896 , Trench Gascoigne published some of Beato ’ s images in Among Pagodas and Fair Ladies and , the following year , Mrs Ernest Hart ’ s Picturesque Burma included more , while George W. Bird in his Wanderings in Burma not only presented thirty @-@ five credited photographs but published a long description of Beato ’ s businesses and recommended visitors to come by his shop . 
 By that time , Beato ’ s photographs had come to represent the very image of Burma to the rest of the world , which it would remain for decades to come . 
 As his curios business developed , with branches in Rangoon , Mandalay but also in Colombo and London , he also acquired the Photographic Art Gallery in Mandalay in 1903 , another photographic studio . In his old age , Felice Beato had become an important business party in Colonial Burma , involved in many enterprises from electric works to life insurance and mining . 
 Scott O ’ Connor used a number of these images in his two books , The Silken East in 1904 and Mandalay and Other Cities of the Past in Burma in 1907 , popularizing Beato ’ s work to an even larger extent . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Although Beato was previously believed to have died in Rangoon or Mandalay in 1905 or 1906 , his death certificate , discovered in 2009 , indicates that he died on 29 January 1909 in Florence , Italy . 
 Whether acknowledged as his own work , sold as Stillfried & Andersen 's , or encountered as anonymous engravings , Beato 's work had a major impact : 
 For over fifty years into the early twentieth century , Beato 's photographs of Asia constituted the standard imagery of travel diaries , illustrated newspapers , and other published accounts , and thus helped shape " Western " notions of several Asian societies . 
 = = Photographic techniques = = 
 Photographs of the 19th century often now show the limitations of the technology used , yet Felice Beato managed to successfully work within and even transcend those limitations . He predominantly produced albumen silver prints from wet collodion glass @-@ plate negatives . 
 Beato pioneered and refined the techniques of hand @-@ colouring photographs and making panoramas . He may have started hand @-@ colouring photographs at the suggestion of Wirgman , or he may have seen the hand @-@ coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew . Whatever the inspiration , Beato 's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits , more strongly coloured than the landscapes , are appraised as excellent . As well as providing views in colour , Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness . Throughout his career , Beato 's work is marked by spectacular panoramas , which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together , thereby re @-@ creating the expansive view . The complete version of his panorama of <unk> comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres ( 6 1 / 2 ft ) .

 " Regeneration " is the forty @-@ ninth episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the twenty @-@ third episode of the second season . It first aired on May 7 , 2003 on the UPN network in the United States . The episode was written by Mike Sussman and Phyllis Strong , and was directed by David Livingston . It was a follow @-@ up to the feature film Star Trek : First Contact , and a prelude to the Battle of Wolf 359 ( as seen in " The Best of Both Worlds " . ) 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . In this episode , several cybernetically enhanced aliens are accidentally reanimated by a research team in the Arctic . The aliens assimilate the researchers and their ship before escaping into space . The Enterprise pursues the ship and is attacked , forcing Archer to destroy the vessel . Afterwards they discover that the aliens sent a message into the Delta Quadrant containing the coordinates of Earth , a message that will not arrive until the 24th century . 
 The episode utilised props and costumes from previous Star Trek series in order to represent the Borg and is where they make their last canon appearance . The guest cast including Bonita Friedericy , the wife of main cast member John Billingsley . The ratings received by the episode were similar to those received during the previous week , and the number of viewers were one of the highest for the year . The critical response to " Regeneration " was mixed , with concerns directed at potential continuity problems , and that the appearance of the Borg was a little obvious . A follow @-@ up episode to " Regeneration " featuring the return of Alice Krige as the Borg Queen was pitched for the fifth season of Star Trek : Enterprise but the show was cancelled before the fifth season could be released and thus the episode never aired .

Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport , they then escape into space , upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons . 
 Admiral Forrest orders Enterprise to rescue the " kidnapped " researchers . They soon receive a distress call from a <unk> freighter , and they arrive to discover the ship under attack from the enhanced transport . Captain Jonathan Archer tries to disable their weapons , but the ship jumps to warp speed . Archer brings the survivors to Sickbay , and finds their situation reminiscent of a Zefram Cochrane story he remembers ( relating to first contact ) . The assimilated crew soon awaken , and in the ensuing melee Doctor Phlox is infected with nanoprobes . They escape , and Lieutenant Reed then finds them modifying ship 's systems , and learns their phase pistols are ineffective .

 Filming took place between February 27 , 2003 and while principal photography completed on March 8 , the B unit shoot for the episode was not completed until March 11 . This coincided with the commencement of filming on the following episode , " First Flight " . The Borg in the episode were all played by stuntmen who had previously worked on Enterprise , with four main " Stunt Borg " and four additional Borg for background shots . Bonita Friedericy was cast as Rooney , one of the researchers that discovered the aliens . Friedericy is the wife of main cast actor John Billingsley , but did not share any scenes in the episode with her husband or film on the same days . Billingsley had suggested at one point during the filming of Enterprise that <unk> should play all of his in @-@ character wives . Director David Livingston is one of the more prolific Star Trek directors , and directed two other episodes in season two of Enterprise alone , " Stigma " and " The Crossing " . The Borg make @-@ up applied to Billingsley slowed down production , as there was discussion on set regarding how far the assimilation process on the character should progress . 
 " Regeneration " was intended to follow up on the events depicted in film Star Trek : First Contact which features a Borg sphere being destroyed whilst in orbit of 21st century Earth . Executive producer Brannon Braga initially refused to feature the Borg in Enterprise , calling it a " cheap trick " . He agreed for them to appear when the premise for " Regeneration " was suggested , saying that " it was such a great concept I couldn ’ t resist it " . The set pieces and costumes for the Borg were reused from earlier Star Trek productions , and had not been used since the series finale of Star Trek : Voyager , " Endgame " . The Borg costume worn by Friedericy had been previously used by Roxann Dawson in the episode " <unk> Zero " . For the sequence where the Borg debris is discovered , several other pieces of sets were re @-@ purposed to act as debris . This including part of the saucer section of the USS Enterprise ( NCC @-@ 1701 @-@ E ) , which first appeared in First Contact . Brian Tyler produced the film score for " Regeneration " , one of only two episodes of Enterprise he produced music for . The other episode was the earlier season two episode " Canamar " . 
 Writers Judith and Garfield Reeves @-@ Stevens pitched a story to be used for season five of Enterprise which would have followed up on the events in " Regeneration " . They intended to bring actress Alice Krige back to Star Trek as a Starfleet medical technician who makes contact with the Borg seen in this episode . This was to result in the creation of the Borg Queen first seen in First Contact , which was played by Krige . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " Regeneration " was first shown in the United States on May 7 , 2003 on UPN . It received a 2 @.@ 7 / 4 % share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This means that it was seen by 2 @.@ 7 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 4 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . The ratings were the same as the previous episode , " <unk> " , but saw an increase in overall viewing numbers from 4 @.@ 08 million viewers to 4 @.@ 12 million . This meant that " Regeneration " was the fourth highest viewed episode of Enterprise at the time of airing in 2003 . 
 Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation , and was concerned by the continuity issues that the events in the episode presented , such as why Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise ( NCC @-@ 1701 @-@ D ) didn 't have a record of Archer and the crew 's encounter with some nameless technologically enhanced aliens who assimilated people when he met them for the first time in " Q Who " . She thought that there were good performances by Linda Park and John Billingsley , but thought that Billingsley as Phlox could have been more emotionally affected by his partial assimilation . Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website " Jammer 's Reviews " gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four , saying that it was " a deviously clever premise , with the best @-@ executed action of the season " , but that the show was " doing itself few favors by reaching into the obvious <unk> bag of tricks " . " Regeneration " was listed as the third best episode of Enterprise behind " In a Mirror , Darkly " and " Carbon Creek " by James Hunt at the website Den of Geek . 
 The first home media release of the episode was as part of the season two DVD boxset , released in the United States on July 26 , 2005 . One of the extras included on the sixth disc of the set was audio commentary on " Regeneration " by writers Michael Sussman and Phyllis Strong . A release on Blu @-@ ray Disc for season two occurred on August 20 , 2013 .

 Ahead of the 2007 – 08 season , Bristol City manager Gary Johnson stated his intention to send Myrie @-@ Williams out on loan in order to gain more first @-@ team experience . Johnson believed that Myrie @-@ Williams would only benefit from a loan move to a League One club , given that he was playing in the third tier of English football prior to Bristol City 's promotion to the Championship during the 2006 – 07 campaign . Two days before the start of the 2007 – 08 season , Myrie @-@ Williams joined Cheltenham Town on a month 's loan .

Cheltenham Town manager John Ward said " I am really pleased that Jennison will be staying with us . In the last two or three games he has started to show his tremendous pace and ability on the ball " . His loan was extended yet again in October 2007 , taking him into a third month with Cheltenham . He scored his first goal for Cheltenham in a 3 – 1 away win at Swindon Town in the Football League Trophy , scoring the first goal of the game , " finishing neatly after a superb through ball from Craig Reid " . He made his final appearance for Cheltenham in a 2 – 2 home draw with Crewe Alexandra , coming on as a substitute as Cheltenham scored two late goals to salvage a point . After the game , Myrie @-@ Williams suffered a knee injury in training , ruling him out of first @-@ team action for two weeks . He made 13 appearances for Cheltenham during his three @-@ month loan spell , scoring one goal — he returned to his parent club in early November 2007 . 
 After impressing during his loan spell at Cheltenham , Myrie @-@ Williams joined League One rivals Tranmere Rovers on a month 's loan .

Both managers were " delighted " with the progress Myrie @-@ Williams was making at Tranmere , with Bristol City manager Gary Johnson adding " Jennison 's developing well at Tranmere and it would be criminal to bring him back now " . He scored his second goal for Tranmere just five days later in a 2 – 0 away win at Leeds United — Myrie @-@ Williams scored with an " angled shot " in the 61st minute to give Tranmere their fourth consecutive victory . Myrie @-@ Williams was also fouled in the area in a game against Port Vale , with Chris Greenacre scoring the resulting spot kick to give Tranmere the lead in an eventual 2 – 0 win . He scored his third goal of the <unk> on 5 April 2008 , netting with a header from Andrew Taylor 's cross in the third minute to give Tranmere the lead away at Walsall . However , he was taken off after 55 minutes with an injury that ruled him out for the rest of the campaign . He returned to Bristol City , having scored three goals in 26 appearance for Tranmere .

Dundee United manager Craig Levein stated " I am excited about the signing and I am sure he will develop into a real talent . Jennison is a player I 've known about and admired for some time and up to about two years ago I would have said he was one of the brightest prospects in the country . He is a player who will not only excite the fans with his direct , quick running at defences , but he will also add pace to the team and strengthen our options going forward " .

He made his first league start on 17 October 2009 , playing 84 minutes in a 1 – 1 home draw against Hamilton Academical , earning the ' Man of the Match ' award for his performance . Myrie @-@ Williams was again named as the ' Man of the Match ' for his performance in a 2 – 1 win against Celtic at Tannadice on 22 November 2009 — the club 's website reported that he made " the most creative impact during the game " and that he " continued his fine form of late and in doing so gave Celtic left back Danny Fox a torrid 90 minutes " . He scored his first competitive goal for Dundee United in a 3 – 2 home win against St Mirren on 5 December 2009 , scoring the club 's third with a neat finish . He was on the scoresheet again in January 2010 , scoring in a game against St Johnstone , Myrie @-@ Williams ' goal gave Dundee United the lead after trailing 2 – 0 at half @-@ time , although the game ended 3 – 3 .

It was to be Myrie @-@ Williams ' only appearance for the club at the start of the campaign , and four days later , on 18 August , Dundee United manager Peter Houston told the player he was available for transfer in order to cut the club 's wage bill . Shortly before the summer transfer window closed , on 31 August 2010 , Myrie @-@ Williams left the club by mutual consent .

He made his debut for the club four days later , playing the whole match in St Johnstone 's 2 – 1 home victory against St Mirren . Myrie @-@ Williams started in the club 's next three fixtures , before appearing as a substitute in a 1 – 1 draw at Inverness Caledonian Thistle on 16 October 2010 . After two appearances in two home defeats in quick succession against Celtic in late October 2010 , Myrie @-@ Williams did not feature again for two months . His last appearance for the club was as an 89th @-@ minute substitute in the club 's 2 – 0 away defeat against Celtic at Celtic Park on 26 December 2010 . Shortly after the game , he was told by manager Derek McInnes that he was free to find a new club — with his contract expiring at the end of January 2011 . Myrie @-@ Williams made eight appearances for St Johnstone during his three @-@ month spell at the club . 
 Shortly after leaving St Johnstone , Myrie @-@ Williams opted for a move back to England , signing for League Two side Oxford United on 27 January 2011 for the rest of the 2010 – 11 campaign . However , the transfer collapsed as a result of Myrie @-@ Williams having already played for two clubs during the 2010 – 11 season — playing one game for Dundee United and eight for St Johnstone . Under FIFA regulations , a player can not play for more than two permanent clubs in a season . The English Football Association could not register Myrie @-@ Williams as they are bound by FIFA regulations .

I thought he was outstanding , he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box " . In his next appearance for the club , he scored the equalising goal in a 2 – 1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge , when he " blasted in " a " 25 @-@ yard blockbuster " – fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal . Myrie @-@ Williams ' effort was Vale 's first goal in 502 minutes ( more than five games ) of football . He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club , which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2 – 1 win at Hereford United . He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale , who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds . 
 On his return to Stevenage , Myrie @-@ Williams was made available for transfer by manager Graham Westley , and was told he did not feature in Westley 's plans . Both Port Vale and Sheffield United were reportedly interested in signing the player on a permanent basis . League Two club Bradford City also spoke to Stevenage with a view to bringing in Myrie @-@ Williams , although " the chase was put on hold " following Westley 's departure — with new manager Gary Smith wishing to evaluate the squad .

He ended the campaign with ten goals in 45 appearances , helping the club to secure a ninth @-@ place finish in League One . 
 " I want to thank Jennison for his efforts while he has been at the club . He has been terrific . At times he has been unplayable and at other times he has let himself down slightly , but that is the life of a winger ...

This appears to be a side to his game that comes naturally . As the match became stretched he quickly turned defence into attack with lung @-@ bursting 50 @-@ yard runs " . Claridge did , however , believe that Myrie @-@ Williams often tried to complicate matters too much and needed to work on " simplifying his game " in order to be able to " assess the situation " better .

 The 2008 Maryland Terrapins football team represented the University of Maryland in the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) college football season . It was the Terrapins ' ( also officially known as the " Terps " ) 56th season as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) and its fourth within the framework of the ACC Atlantic Division . 
 Ralph Friedgen led the team for his eighth season as head coach and was assisted by first @-@ year offensive coordinator James Franklin and third @-@ year defensive coordinator Chris Cosh . It was the first season since the departure of Charlie Taaffe in 2005 that Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself . Instead , those duties were handled by Franklin , a former Maryland wide receivers coach , who returned after a brief stint at Kansas State and in the National Football League ( NFL ) . With him , Franklin brought a new system : the West Coast offense . Cosh , whose complex defensive scheme had been criticized as too passive , resigned at the end of the season . 
 The 2008 season in the ACC was described as chaotic , and for Maryland , there was no exception . The Terrapins were within grasp of the ACC Atlantic Division championship at the end of Week 12 , but lost their final two games and fell to a four @-@ way tie for third place . Maryland closed the regular season with a 7 – 5 record — including four wins against Top 25 @-@ ranked teams — which was enough to secure bowl eligibility . In the postseason , Maryland defeated Nevada of the Western Athletic Conference in the Humanitarian Bowl .

 In December 2007 , Maryland hired Kansas State offensive coordinator James Franklin to serve in that same role for the Terrapins . From 2000 to 2004 , he was the Maryland wide receivers coach . In 2003 and 2004 , he also served as the recruiting coordinator , and Rivals.com ranked Franklin as one of the nation 's top @-@ 25 recruiters both years . Because of the arrival of Franklin , 2008 was the first since 2005 that head coach Ralph Friedgen did not call the offensive plays himself . At Maryland , Franklin installed a West Coast offense , which was well suited to quarterback Chris Turner 's playing style and an experienced wide receiver corps that included play @-@ maker Darrius Heyward @-@ Bey and sure @-@ handed Danny Oquendo .

 Maryland lost several important players from the 2007 team . In January 2008 , shortly after Oregon State defeated Maryland in the Emerald Bowl , linebacker Erin Henderson announced that he would forgo his senior year to enter the 2008 NFL Draft . Henderson , the brother of Butkus and Bednarik Award winner E.J. , had recorded an ACC @-@ high four fumble recoveries in 2007 and was the Terrapins ' leader in total tackles ( 133 ) and tackles for loss ( 11 ) . The defensive line lost tackles Dre Moore and Carlos Feliciano , while the secondary unit lost both starting safeties , strong safety Christian Varner and free safety J. J. Justice , as well as cornerback Isaiah Gardner . The Maryland offense lost tailbacks Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore who combined for 1 @,@ 573 rushing yards and 25 touchdowns in 2007 .

 The 2008 recruiting class was ranked 52nd in the nation by Scout.com and 38th by Rivals.com. Scout.com rated three recruits as four @-@ star and six as three @-@ star prospects , while Rivals.com rated six recruits each as four @-@ star and three @-@ star prospects . Kenny Tate , who was originally recruited as a wide receiver , was the only four @-@ star prospect to see significant playing time in 2008 . Before the season , he was converted to safety , a position that had been <unk> by the graduation of former starters Christian Varner and J.J. Justice , and Tate also saw action on special teams . Cornerback Cameron Chism , who saw action in nine games as a reserve , recorded seven tackles on kickoff returns to tie for second on the team in special teams tackles . Tight end Matt <unk> saw limited play time on special teams against Delaware and Middle Tennessee , but injured his foot and was awarded a medical redshirt . Wide receiver Kevin Dorsey also sat out the season as a redshirt to recuperate from foot surgery . The other four @-@ star recruits who sat out on redshirt status were wide receiver Kerry <unk> , tight end <unk> Campbell , and defensive tackle <unk> Kabongo . Running back Davin Meggett , the son of former New York Giants star Dave Meggett , was the only true freshman to start a game for Maryland in 2008 , and he was a significant contributor throughout the season . Meggett was not a highly touted recruit , assessed by Scout.com as a two @-@ star prospect , and his only other scholarship offers were from local @-@ area Division I FCS schools . In 2008 , however , he led all ACC freshman with 5 @.@ 13 yards per carry , and <unk> finished the season with 457 yards and four touchdowns as a reserve . 
 = = = Quarterback controversy = = = 
 There was some controversy at the start of the season when head coach Ralph Friedgen selected senior Jordan Steffy as the starting quarterback over junior Chris Turner . In 2007 , when Steffy suffered a concussion against 10th @-@ ranked Rutgers , the relatively untested Turner took over and led Maryland to an upset victory . He then started the remainder of the season , compiled a 4 – 5 record in games he started , and led another upset against eighth @-@ ranked Boston College . In comparing the practice performances of Steffy , Turner , and third @-@ stringer Josh Portis , offensive coordinator James Franklin said : 
 It gets hard if one quarterback all through spring and all through summer camp was statistically better in almost every single category , it 's hard to rationalize not making him the starter ... because your gut feeling is one thing and the statistics are another . Jordan led by a pretty large amount in completion percentage ... [ and ] the least interception percentage . He didn 't lead in yards per [ attempt or ] ... percentage of explosive plays . I consider an explosive play a play of 16 yards or more ... Portis led in that and Turner was second and Jordan was third . 
 In the season opener against Delaware , Steffy suffered an injured thumb , and Turner took over in the fourth quarter . He remained the starter for the rest of the season , and Steffy saw no further game action . Portis saw limited playing time throughout the season , usually being put in for a single option play at a time .

In accordance with conference rules , Maryland faced all five Atlantic Division opponents : Boston College , Clemson , Florida State , NC State , and Wake Forest . They also faced three Coastal Division opponents : official ACC rival Virginia , North Carolina , and Virginia Tech . Virginia Tech and Boston College were the ACC champions and runners @-@ up , respectively , in 2007 and again in 2008 . Maryland did not play ACC opponents Duke , Georgia Tech , and Miami . 
 Maryland also played four non @-@ conference games . For the season opener , the Terrapins met the 2007 Division I FCS runners @-@ up , Delaware . California of the Pacific @-@ 10 Conference was played for the first time in school history as the first half of a home @-@ and @-@ home series . Athletic director Deborah Yow wanted to play one of the University of Maryland 's five academic peer institutions , and to take a two @-@ year hiatus from the 28 @-@ year series against West Virginia . She said , by adding California , " We weren 't trying to add to the degree of difficulty [ of Maryland 's schedule ] ; we were trying to substitute for West Virginia . " Games were also played against Middle Tennessee State of the Sun Belt Conference and Eastern Michigan of the Mid @-@ American Conference . For the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl , Maryland played Nevada in the teams ' first meeting .
