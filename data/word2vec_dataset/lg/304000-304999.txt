 Batman 's history has undergone various revisions , both minor and major . Few elements of the character 's history have remained constant . Scholars William <unk> and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s , " Unlike some fictional characters , the Batman has no primary <unk> set in a specific period , but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades . "

 The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character 's origin story . As a young boy , Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents , the physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha , murdered by a mugger with a gun . Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents . This event drove him to train his body to physical perfection and fight crime in Gotham City as Batman . Pearson and <unk> also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin , " Until recently , the fixed and accruing and hence , canonized , events have been few in number " , a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O 'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories .

 In Batman 's first appearance in Detective Comics # 27 , he is already operating as a crime @-@ fighter . Batman 's origin is first presented in Detective Comics # 33 ( November 1939 ) and is later expanded upon in Batman # 47 . As these comics state , Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha , two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites . Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor , and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight , when his parents are killed by a small @-@ time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater . That night , Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime . He engages in intense intellectual and physical training ; however , he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough . " Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot " , Wayne remarks , " so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts . I must be a creature of the night , black , terrible ... " As if responding to his desires , a bat suddenly flies through the window , inspiring Bruce to take on the persona of Batman . 
 In early strips , Batman 's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police . During this period , Bruce Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison . In Detective Comics # 38 , Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat , Dick Grayson , who becomes his junior counterpart , Robin . Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America , although he , like Superman , is an honorary member , and thus only participates occasionally . Batman 's relationship with the law thaws quickly , and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City 's police department . During this time , Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor , and after deducing the Dynamic Duo 's secret identities , joins their service as their butler . 
 = = = = Silver Age = = = = 
 The Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced Barry Allen as a new , updated version of The Flash . Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth @-@ One . The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science @-@ fiction elements , and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until Detective Comics # 327 ( May 1964 ) , in which Batman reverts to his detective roots , with most science @-@ fiction elements jettisoned from the series . 
 After the introduction of DC Comics ' multiverse in the 1960s , DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth @-@ Two Batman , a character from a parallel world . This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth @-@ Two Catwoman , Selina Kyle ( as shown in Superman Family # 211 ) . They have a daughter , Helena Wayne , who as the Huntress , becomes ( along with Dick Grayson , the Earth @-@ Two Robin ) Gotham 's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner , a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman . Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre @-@ revamp and post @-@ revamp Batmen ( since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern , Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s ) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age . Nevertheless , details of Batman 's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades . Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth , his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne ( introduced in Batman # 208 , January / February 1969 ) after his parents ' death , and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin , respectively . In 1980 then @-@ editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman 's origin and history . 
 Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age , most notably Superman , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team @-@ ups in World 's Finest Comics , starting in 1954 and continuing through the series ' cancellation in 1986 . Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends . As a founding member of the Justice League of America , Batman appears in its first story , in 1960 's Brave and the Bold # 28 . In the 1970s and 1980s , Brave and the Bold became a Batman title , in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month .

 In 1969 , Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics ' effort to revise the Batman comics . Additionally , Batman also moves from his mansion , Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City , in order to be closer to Gotham City 's crime . Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo , with occasional team @-@ ups with Robin and / or Batgirl . Batman 's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period , depicting increasingly violent crimes , including the first appearance ( since the early Golden Age ) of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath , and the arrival of Ra 's al Ghul , a centuries @-@ old terrorist who knows Batman 's secret identity . In the 1980s , Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing . 
 In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983 , Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders . He serves as the team 's leader until Batman and the Outsiders # 32 ( 1986 ) and the comic subsequently changed its title . 
 Detective Comics # 439 ( 1974 ) depicts Bruce Wayne as a graduate of Yale Law School , in which the final page shows a Yale Law School diploma hanging in Bruce Wayne 's office .

 After the 12 @-@ issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths , DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences . Frank Miller retold Batman 's origin in the storyline " Year One " from Batman # 404 – 407 , which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character . Though the Earth @-@ Two Batman is erased from history , many stories of Batman 's Silver Age / Earth @-@ One career ( along with an amount of Golden Age ones ) remain canonical in the post @-@ Crisis universe , with his origins remaining the same in essence , despite alteration . For example , Gotham 's police are mostly corrupt , setting up further need for Batman 's existence . The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth . Additionally , Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America , although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987 . To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following Crisis , DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one @-@ shot stories since then that largely take place during the " Year One " period . 
 Subsequently , Batman begins exhibiting an excessive , reckless approach to his crime @-@ fighting , a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd . Batman works solo until the decade 's close , when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin . 
 Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter @-@ title crossovers that run for a number of issues . In 1993 , DC published " Knightfall " . During the storyline 's first phase , the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman , leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role . After the end of " Knightfall " , the storylines split in two directions , following both the Azrael @-@ Batman 's adventures , and Bruce Wayne 's quest to become Batman once more . The story arcs realign in " <unk> " , as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne . Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson ( then Nightwing ) for an interim period , while Wayne trains for a return to the role . 
 The 1994 company @-@ wide crossover storyline " Zero Hour " changes aspects of DC continuity again , including those of Batman . Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force . 
 Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison 's 1996 relaunch of the series , titled JLA . During this time , Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade 's closing crossover arc . In 1998 's " Cataclysm " storyline , Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States . Deprived of many of his technological resources , Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999 's " No Man 's Land " . 
 Meanwhile , Batman 's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of " Batman : Officer Down " and " Batman : War Games / War Crimes " ; Batman 's long @-@ time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in " Officer Down " , while " War Games " and " War Crimes " saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City 's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered , resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of the city 's criminal gangs . Lex Luthor arranges for the murder of Batman 's on @-@ again , off @-@ again love interest Vesper ( introduced in the mid @-@ 1990s ) during the " Bruce Wayne : Murderer ? " and " Bruce Wayne : Fugitive " story arcs . Though Batman is able to clear his name , he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha , who is recruited into the organization known as " Checkmate " while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state 's evidence against her employer . While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper , Batman does get his revenge with help from Talia al Ghul in Superman / Batman # 1 – 6 .

 DC 's 2005 limited series Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had altered Batman 's memories to prevent him from stopping the League from <unk> Dr. Light after he sexually assaulted Sue <unk> . Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over and if necessary , kill the other heroes . The revelation of Batman 's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle 's death becomes a driving force in the lead @-@ up to the Infinite Crisis miniseries , which again restructures DC continuity . Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the <unk> , though at the very end Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing . Picking up a gun , Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick , until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger . 
 Following Infinite Crisis , Bruce Wayne , Dick Grayson ( having recovered from his wounds ) , and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City , to " rebuild Batman " . In the Face the Face storyline , Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year @-@ long absence . Part of this absence is captured during Week 30 of the 52 series , which shows Batman fighting his inner demons . Later on in 52 , Batman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in Nanda Parbat . This becomes an important part of the regular Batman title , which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime fighter while undergoing this ritual , having " hunted down and ate " the last traces of fear in his mind . At the end of the " Face the Face " story arc , Bruce officially adopts Tim ( who had lost both of his parents at various points in the character 's history ) as his son . The follow @-@ up story arc in Batman , Batman and Son , introduces Damian Wayne , who is Batman 's son with Talia al Ghul . Although originally in Son of the Demon , Bruce 's coupling with Talia was implied to be consensual , this arc ret @-@ conned it into Talia forcing herself on Bruce . 
 Batman , along with Superman and Wonder Woman , reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series , and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders . 
 Grant Morrison 's 2008 storyline , " Batman R.I.P. " featured Batman being physically and mentally broken by the enigmatic villain Doctor Hurt and attracted news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion , which would speculated to feature the death of Bruce Wayne . However , though Batman is shown to possibly perish at the end of the arc , the two @-@ issue arc " Last Rites " , which leads into the crossover storylines " Final Crisis " , shows that Batman survives his helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and returns to the Batcave , only to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by the JLA to help investigate the New God Orion 's death . The story ends with Batman retrieving the god @-@ killing bullet used to kill Orion , setting up its use in " Final Crisis " . In the pages of Final Crisis Batman is reduced to a charred skeleton . In Final Crisis # 7 Wayne is shown witnessing the passing of the first man , <unk> . Wayne 's " death " sets up the three @-@ issue Battle for the Cowl miniseries in which Wayne 's ex @-@ proteges compete for the " right " to assume the role of Batman , which concludes with Grayson becoming Batman , while Tim Drake takes on the identity of Red Robin . Dick and Damian continue as Batman and Robin , and in the crossover storyline " Blackest Night " , what appears to be Bruce 's corpse is reanimated as a Black Lantern zombie , but is later shown that Bruce 's corpse is one of Darkseid 's failed Batman clones . Dick and Batman 's other friends conclude that Bruce is alive . 
 Bruce subsequently returns in Morrison 's miniseries Batman : The Return of Bruce Wayne , which depicts his travels through time from prehistory to present @-@ day Gotham . Bruce 's return sets up Batman Incorporated , an ongoing series which focuses on Wayne franchising the Batman identity across the globe , allowing Dick and Damian to continue as Gotham 's Dynamic Duo . Bruce publicly announces that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission , known as " Batman , Incorporated " . Due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC 's 2011 relaunch of all of its book , The New 52 , however , Grayson is restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again . The relaunch also interrupts the publication of Batman , Incorporated , which resumed its story in 2012 @-@ 2013 with changes to suit the new status quo . 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 Batman has become a pop culture icon , recognized around the world . The character 's presence has extended beyond his comic book origins ; events such as the release of the 1989 Batman film and its accompanying merchandising " brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness " . In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the character , The Guardian wrote , " Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is modern mass culture . He is at once an icon and a commodity : the perfect cultural artefact for the 21st century . " 
 In addition , media outlets have often used the character in trivial and comprehensive surveys — Forbes magazine estimated Bruce Wayne to be the 8th @-@ richest fictional character with his $ 6 @.@ 9 billion fortune , several places after Iron Man , who is at 5 .

 The Batman television series , starring Adam West , premiered in January 1966 on the ABC television network . <unk> with a camp sense of humor , the show became a pop culture phenomenon . In his memoir , Back to the Batcave , West notes his dislike for the term ' camp ' as it was applied to the 1960s series , opining that the show was instead a farce or lampoon , and a deliberate one , at that . The series ran for 120 episodes ; ending in 1968 . In between the first and second season of the Batman television series , the cast and crew made the theatrical film Batman ( 1966 ) . The Kinks performed the theme song from the Batman show on their 1967 album Live at Kelvin Hall .

The film also won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction . The film 's success spawned three sequels : Batman Returns ( 1992 ) , Batman Forever ( 1995 ) and Batman & Robin ( 1997 ) ; the latter two of which were directed by Joel Schumacher instead of Burton , and replaced Keaton as Batman with Val Kilmer and George Clooney , respectively .

 = = = Gay interpretations = = = 
 Gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist Fredric Wertham asserted in Seduction of the Innocent in 1954 that " Batman stories are psychologically homosexual ... The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies , of the nature of which they may be unconscious . " Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay " Batman , <unk> , and Camp " that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because " he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality " . Professor of film and cultural studies Will Brooker argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman , and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within , whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not . He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigour with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character . 
 Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions . Writer Alan Grant has stated , " The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn 't gay ... everybody 's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane ... none of them wrote him as a gay character . Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view . " Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting , concluding , " He 'd be much healthier if he were gay . " Grant Morrison said that " <unk> is built into Batman ... Obviously as a fictional character he 's intended to be heterosexual , but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay . I think that 's why people like it . All these women fancy him and they all wear fetish clothes and jump around rooftops to get to him . He doesn 't care — he 's more interested in hanging out with the old guy and the kid . " 
 In 2000 , DC refused permission for the reprinting of four panels ( from Batman # 79 , 92 , 105 and 139 ) to illustrate Christopher York 's paper All in the Family : Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s . In 2005 , painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses , prompting DC to threaten legal action .

 Li Long ( <unk> （ <unk> ・ <unk> ） , Ri Ron , pinyin : Lǐ Lóng ) is a fictional character in the Soul series of video games . Created by Namco 's Project Soul division , he first appeared in Soul Edge , later appearing in both console and arcade versions of Soulcalibur III , as well as on various merchandise related to the series . He is voiced in Japanese by Jin <unk> in Soul Edge and Masaya <unk> in Soulcalibur III . 
 Li Long is an assassin , who failed in a mission to kill the leader of a Japanese pirate faction . Taken in by an innkeeper and his daughter , he fell in love with the girl only for her to be apparently killed . Desiring revenge , he battles wandering swordsmen and steals their weapons , while searching for the cursed sword Soul Edge . After being severely beaten by its wielder and now on the run pursued by assassins sent by his former employer , he reflects on who he is with doubt , until he meets a woman reminding him of his lost love . Reinvigorated , Li Long now searches to discover who he is . As a character , Li Long was positively received , and described as " the most dramatic " of the characters in Soul Edge . His replacement by another character later in the series , Maxi , has been criticized by the media , with several sources stating a preference for him .

 As a character introduced in Soul Edge , Li Long 's weapon , a pair of nunchaku with mounted blades , were selected before other elements of the character . One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development , they were designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game . Li Long 's design and concept were built to revolve around them , starting with gender , then physical measurements , and lastly background details . After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist , his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him , and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in @-@ game movements . During development , many ideas were considered for Li Long 's appearance , including several younger drafts . Another idea considered was for him to fight using kung fu , instead of solely with his nunchaku . 
 Due to a ban of nunchaku weapons in the United Kingdom , his weapon was changed to a three @-@ section staff for European releases of Soul Blade , with a section of staff replacing the chain in terms of appearance . Li Long was initially considered for inclusion for Soulcalibur , however the developers instead decided to focus on creating a new character using the same weapon for the title , resulting in Maxi . Later , due to the character 's popularity , Li Long was selected to be included in home and arcade versions of Soulcalibur III . In an interview , Soulcalibur IV director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated many fans had requested for the character to reappear in the series , though added no plans had been made to release the character as downloadable content for the title . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 In Soul Edge , Li Long appears as a tall , Asian male with his brown hair tied in a knot atop his head with long , thick sideburns . His facial contours , expressions and hairdo were designed to be sharp , intended to suggest the " assassin " side of his character , as well as imply the image of Chinese culture in the character . A large light brown jacket with green trimming covers his arms , while a large belt wraps around his midsection . Dark brown pants ending in white trimming cover his legs , and blue and white stripped shoes cover his feet . His alternate character model varies significantly , featuring a shaved head , blue and gray vest with an open collar , small gold belt , green pants , and blue and red striped shoes . Li Long stands 1 @.@ 68 m ( 5 ft 6 in ) tall . 
 When considering his appearance for Soulcalibur , different designs were considered , including one with a heavily bandaged eye and scarred appearance intended to imply his fate at the end of Soul Edge , and another modeled after his appearance in Soul Edge 's opening sequence , featuring a wide @-@ brimmed hat , though both designs were rejected as the developers felt they made the character appear too thin . Elements from both were reused for Soulcalibur III , retaining the hat while giving his left eye a damaged appearance . Elements of his previous design were retained , with the addition of a green vest and bracers , and the lengthening of the tail of his coat to his mid @-@ thighs . His alternate character model from Soul Edge was added as his alternate in the game , featuring minimal changes save for opening the vest to have his chest be bare .

 Introduced in Soul Edge , Li Long is an assassin sent by the Emperor of China to kill a pirate lord , but failed . Badly injured , he was rescued by a woman named Chie and eventually fell in love with her . While out one day , a fight broke out at the inn and Chie was believed to be dead . Told falsely the swordsman <unk> Mitsurugi was responsible , he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade . Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats , repurposing some for his own use . Upon finding and defeating him , he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie , and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge . He located its wielder , Cervantes , but was beaten severely . Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye , he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his former employer . Traveling by night under a false name , he was taken in by a girl that reminded him of Chie . When the assassins eventually found him , Li Long stood his ground and defeated them . Remembering the feel of fighting for something other than revenge , he set out to find himself , not knowing that Chie was actually alive and , after giving birth to their son , had set out to find him . 
 = = = Gameplay = = = 
 Li Long 's fighting style in Soul Edge has been described as accessible to novices of the game , while also usable by experienced players . His Reverse Scales attack consists of three swift horizontal attacks one after another , while his Flaming Fangs attack is similar , only vertical , requiring opponents to guard the attacks differently . Other attacks also consist of variations of existing moves with a different conclusion , such as his Combined Wind and Sand @-@ Dust attacks , which both give similar visible cues but with the latter ending in a lower strike . Others moves such as Violent Cannon make use of feints , appearing to attack from one angle but striking from another . 
 In Soulcalibur III , Li Long represents the game 's " nunchaku " fighting style available to player @-@ created characters through the game 's character creation mode . Though the style utilized several elements from Maxi , many elements were altered , including attack commands , stance , and a separate series of weapons . With the character 's inclusion in the arcade edition of Soulcalibur III , alterations were made to further define Li Long 's fighting style as unique , modifying several attacks to utilize two nunchaku simultaneously as a result .

 In addition to artwork , many promotional items for Soul Edge featured Li Long 's likeness , including toys , window shades and table coasters . A two @-@ page promotional comic was also released by Namco for the character , featuring Mitsurugi attempting to assist him in winning Chie 's heart . 
 In a 2002 poll by Namco prior to the release of Soulcalibur II regarding their favorite character from the series , Li Long placed last , part of a three @-@ way tie with 1 % of the poll 's results . MAXIMUM , on the other hand , described him as " one of the most dramatic characters in the game " , citing visible similarity to actor Bruce Lee 's use of nunchaku . Retronauts in their retrospective of the series cited Li Long as an aspect of Soul Edge not included in later titles they missed . Comparisons have been drawn between the character and later series character Maxi , with sources such as 1UP.com stating preference for the former . GameDaily staff writer Eugene Huang shared the sentiment while naming him as one of his favorite characters , describing his attacks as " focused around efficacy and efficiency " and praising the character as having a compelling backstory .

 Noronhomys vespuccii , also known as Vespucci 's rodent , is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil . Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci may have seen it on a visit to Fernando de Noronha in 1503 , but it subsequently became extinct , perhaps because of the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island . Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal , of uncertain but probably Holocene age , were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999 . 
 Noronhomys vespuccii was a fairly large rodent , larger than the black rat ( Rattus rattus ) . A member of the family Cricetidae and subfamily Sigmodontinae , it shares several distinctive characters with Holochilus and related genera within the tribe Oryzomyini , including high @-@ crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles . Although a suite of traits suggest that Holochilus is its closest relative , it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate genus , Noronhomys . Its close relatives , including Holochilus and Lundomys , are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle , spending much of their time in the water , but features of the Noronhomys bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island . 
 = = Discovery and taxonomy = = 
 Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci may have seen this animal on his fourth voyage , which took him to Brazil ; the Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle Isole <unk> in Quattro Suoi <unk> recorded that he visited an island just south of the equator on August 10 , 1503 . On this island , identified as Fernando de Noronha , he saw " very big rats and lizards with two tails , and some snakes " . The Lettera purports to be an account of Vespucci 's voyages , but it is unlikely that he produced it himself and , additionally , his fourth voyage may never have actually taken place . The biological details given in the Lettera 's account of Fernando de Noronha agree with what is known of the natural history of the island , lending weight to the view that it derives from an actual visit , whether by Vespucci himself or by another explorer . The lizard is probably Trachylepis atlantica and the record of snakes most likely refers to Amphisbaena <unk> , which is actually an <unk> instead of a snake . 
 During excavations conducted in 1973 , American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson found fossils of a moderately large rat on Fernando de Noronha , which were described as a new genus and species in a 1999 publication by Olson and his colleague , mammalogist Michael D. Carleton . The material is now in the United States National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. , and in the museum of the <unk> Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre , Rio Grande do Sul . The generic name , Noronhomys , combines the name of the island of Fernando de Noronha with the Ancient Greek μῦς mys " mouse " and the specific name , vespuccii , honors Amerigo Vespucci . Noronhomys would have been larger than the black rat ( Rattus rattus ) , which was common on ships and which Vespucci would have been familiar with , consistent with his description of " very large rats " . 
 Noronhomys is a member of the tribe Oryzomyini , which includes over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America , including nearby islands such as the Galápagos Islands and some of the Antilles . Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae , which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America . Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae , other members of which include voles , lemmings , hamsters , and deermice , all mainly from Eurasia and North America . 
 Carleton and Olson performed a detailed comparison of Noronhomys to members of the mainland genera Holochilus and Lundomys on the basis of both general morphology and morphometrical data , concluding that the Fernando de Noronha rat is distinct from both other animals . They used a cladistic analysis to examine its relationships within Oryzomyini , also including two species of Holochilus , Lundomys , and five other oryzomyines . They found that Noronhomys appeared closest to Holochilus , with Lundomys more distantly related . Eighteen shared characters ( synapomorphies ) supported the grouping of Noronhomys with Holochilus . Another form described as a species of Holochilus , Holochilus primigenus , may also be related , but is likely to fall outside the Holochilus – Noronhomys clade . 
 In 1998 , a fragmentary fossil of another species of this same group of oryzomyines was found in eastern Argentina . It was initially identified as a possible second species of Noronhomys on the basis of the presence of a crest on the upper first molar , the mesoloph , but the specimen is different from Noronhomys vespuccii in other respects , and in 2008 it was described as a new genus and species , Carletonomys cailoi , related to Noronhomys and associated genera . 
 = = Description = = 
 Noronhomys vespuccii is known from a number of bone fragments , including five skulls , damaged to various degrees , and many isolated jaws and other bones . This material documents that , with a skull of about 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) ( occipitonasal length ) , Noronhomys was a moderately large oryzomyine , smaller than Lundomys but well within the range of Holochilus . It shares a number of the features that characterize the group of Holochilus and related genera , including a reduction in the complexity of the chewing surface of the molars , simple posterolateral palatal pits ( perforations of the palate near the third molar ) , and a similarly shaped interorbital region of the skull . Noronhomys is distinctive , among other characters , in its lack of a spinous process on the zygomatic plate , the flattened front portion of the zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) ; the short palate , which does not extend behind the third molars ; and the presence of an accessory crest , the mesoloph , on the upper molars . 
 Analysis of morphometrical data from the known material of Noronhomys suggests that growth continued in adults — the older the animal , the larger the depth of the mandible and the size of the lower incisor — and does not provide evidence for a difference in size between males and females . Skull shape is strikingly different from both Holochilus and Lundomys , resulting in a clear separation from both of these taxa in statistical analyses of measurement data . In three individuals measured , the occipitonasal length , a measure of skull length , varies from 38 @.@ 0 to 39 @.@ 2 mm ( 1 @.@ 50 to 1 @.@ 54 in ) , averaging 38 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 52 in ) . The width of the braincase is 13 @.@ 4 to 14 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 53 to 0 @.@ 58 in ) , averaging 14 @.@ 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 56 in ) . Between the first molars , the width of the palate is 8 @.@ 1 to 8 @.@ 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 32 to 0 @.@ 35 in ) in four specimens , averaging 8 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 33 in ) . The lower molars have a total length of 7 @.@ 57 to 8 @.@ 29 mm ( 0 @.@ 298 to 0 @.@ 326 in ) , averaging 8 @.@ 00 mm ( 0 @.@ 315 in ) , in 39 specimens with intact molar rows . The femur ( upper leg bone ) is 32 @.@ 5 to 41 @.@ 0 mm ( 1 @.@ 28 to 1 @.@ 61 in ) in length in nine specimens , averaging 36 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 44 in ) . Carleton and Olson estimated that body mass in Noronhomys was similar to that of some populations of living Holochilus sciureus at about 200 to 250 g ( 7 @.@ 1 to 8 @.@ 8 oz ) . 
 = = = Skull = = = 
 The skull is flattened in general shape . The front part is short and broad . The broad interorbital region ( located between the eyes ) is hourglass @-@ shaped , with squared edges and weakly developed beading . A postorbital ridge is present , obscuring the suture ( joint ) between the frontal and squamosal bones , a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines . The braincase is squarish . The interparietal bone is wide , but does not reach the squamosals on the sides . The zygomatic arches , which are well @-@ developed , are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front . The jugal bone is small . 
 The back margin of the zygomatic plate is located close to the front of the upper first molar . The incisive foramina do not extend between the molars . Unlike in both Holochilus and Lundomys , the palate is flat , lacking a distinct ridge at the midline . The <unk> fossae , which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars , are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate . A strut of the alisphenoid bone is present , separating two openings in the skull , the masticatory – buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium . The subsquamosal fenestra , an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal , is present but small . The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani , the roof of the tympanic cavity , a defining character of oryzomyines . 
 The mandible ( lower jaw ) is robust . The two masseteric ridges , which anchor some of the chewing muscles , are joined together as a single crest for a portion of their length and extend forward to a point below the first molar . The capsular process , a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the lower incisor , is well developed . 
 = = = Teeth = = = 
 In the upper incisors , the chewing edges are located behind the vertical plane of the incisors ; thus , they are opisthodont . The microstructure of the enamel of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study . The inner portion ( <unk> <unk> , PI ) is much thicker than the outer portion ( <unk> externa , PE ) . The PI consists of Hunter @-@ Schreger bands , which are <unk> ( consisting of a single enamel prism ) , as in all <unk> rodents . The PE consists of radial enamel , with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the dentine . The microstructure is similar to that of Holochilus brasiliensis and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha . 
 The molars are high @-@ crowned ( hypsodont ) and planar , with the main cusps as high as the crests connecting them , a configuration shared only with Holochilus and Carletonomys among oryzomyines . The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars . The molars lack many accessory ridges , including the anteroloph on the first upper molar , the posteroloph on the first and second upper molar , and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars . The first and second upper molar have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower molar , the anteroconid , encloses a large internal pit . Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars , but two — the <unk> on the lower second molar and the <unk> on the lower third molar — are closed by a wall , or cingulum , at the inner margin of the tooth . As in most oryzomyines , the upper molars all have one root on the inner ( lingual ) side and two on the outer ( labial ) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar ; in addition , the first upper molar has another labial root and the first lower molar has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots . 
 = = = Postcranial skeleton = = = 
 The entepicondylar foramen is absent , as in all members of the Sigmodontinae ; if present , as in some other rodents , this foramen ( opening ) perforates the distal ( far ) end of the humerus ( upper arm bone ) . The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built . The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum ( part of the pelvis ) , which anchors the rectum <unk> muscle , is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys . 
 = = Distribution and origin = = 
 Noronhomys is known only from Fernando de Noronha , a small archipelago of volcanic origin off northeastern Brazil , consisting of a main island and several associated smaller islands . The formation of the archipelago , which has never been connected to the mainland , began about 11 million years ago ; active vulcanism ceased about 2 million years ago . Remains of Noronhomys were found in association with remains of various reptiles , birds , and snails , several of which are also restricted to the archipelago , in sand dunes near the northeastern tip of the main island . The age of the deposits is unknown , but is likely late Holocene , at most a few thousand years old . 
 The ancestor of Noronhomys may have been a semiaquatic animal , similar to living Holochilus or Lundomys , that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log . The morphology of the limb bones in Noronhomys suggests that the animal was not semiaquatic like its relatives , but terrestrial , consistent with its occurrence on a small island , where streams and pools are rare or absent . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 Vespucci 's account suggests that Noronhomys was common when the island was first visited , but was not encountered by the first biological explorers of the island , who conducted their research in the late 19th century . The introduced black rat and house mouse ( Mus musculus ) , which became very common on the island , may have driven it to extinction by directly competing for food , preying on young Noronhomys , or transmitting diseases . Other factors that may have played a role include modification of its habitat , introduction of predators such as cats ( Felis catus ) , and predation by visiting sailors . These extinction mechanisms are common for island endemic species . In 1888 , Henry Nicholas Ridley already suggested that the rat Vespucci had seen had been driven to extinction by the introduced black rat . The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as " extinct " .

 The Nissan Leaf ( also formatted " LEAF " as a backronym for leading environmentally @-@ friendly affordable family car ) is a compact five @-@ door hatchback electric car manufactured by Nissan and introduced in Japan and the United States in December 2010 , followed by various European countries and Canada in 2011 . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) official range for the 2016 model year Leaf with the 30 kWh battery is 172 km ( 107 miles ) on a full battery charge , while the trim with the smaller 24 kWh battery is 135 km ( 84 miles ) , the same as the 2014 / 15 model year . Leaf battery packs can be charged from fully discharged to 80 % capacity in about 30 minutes using DC fast charging . 
 As of April 2016 , the Nissan Leaf is the world 's all @-@ time best selling highway @-@ capable all @-@ electric car . Almost 220 @,@ 000 Leafs have been sold worldwide by mid @-@ April 2016 . The top markets for Leaf sales , as of April 2016 , are the United States with over 93 @,@ 000 units sold , followed by Japan with almost 65 @,@ 000 units , and Europe with over 55 @,@ 000 Leafs through March 2016 . The European market is led by Norway with over 17 @,@ 000 new units registered through the end of April 2016 , and the U.K. with over 12 @,@ 000 units registered by the end of 2015 . 
 As an all @-@ electric car , the Nissan Leaf produces no tailpipe pollution or greenhouse gas emissions at the point of operation , and contributes to reduced dependence on petroleum . Among other awards and recognition , the Nissan Leaf won the 2010 Green Car Vision Award , the 2011 European Car of the Year , the 2011 World Car of the Year , and the 2011 – 2012 Car of the Year Japan . 
 = = Development history = = 
 Nissan introduced its first battery electric vehicle , the Nissan <unk> at the Los Angeles International Auto Show on 29 December 1997 . The <unk> EV was produced between 1998 and 2002 , only about 200 vehicles were ever produced , and it was mainly used as a fleet vehicle for companies such as electric utilities . Nissan also developed the Nissan <unk> , ran a demonstration program and sold limited numbers for government and corporate fleets in Japan between 1999 and 2001 . A small fleet of <unk> was also field tested in several cities in California between 2001 and 2005 . 
 Unveiled in 2009 , the EV @-@ 11 prototype electric car was based on the Nissan Tiida ( Versa in North America ) , but with the conventional gasoline engine replaced with an all @-@ electric drivetrain , and included an 80 kW ( 110 hp ) / 280 N · m ( 210 lb · ft ) electric motor , 24 kWh lithium @-@ ion battery pack rated to have a range of 175 km ( 109 miles ) on the United States Environmental Protection Agency 's LA @-@ 4 or " city " driving cycle , navigation system , and remote control and monitoring via a cellphone connection through Nissan 's secure data center to the car . The technology in the EV @-@ 11 was previously developed and tested in the EV @-@ 01 and EV @-@ 02 test cars , built with an all @-@ electric powertrain that used the Nissan Cube ( Z11 ) as a development mule . The EV @-@ 11 prototype was on display July 26 , 2009 . A week later , on August 2 , 2009 , Nissan unveiled its production version at its Yokohama headquarters and committed to begin retail sales in both the North American market and Japan at end of 2010 .

 The Leaf 's frontal style is characterized by a sharp V @-@ shape design with large , up slanting light @-@ emitting diode ( LED ) headlights that create a distinctive blue internal reflective design . The headlights also split and redirect airflow away from the door mirrors , which reduces wind noise and aerodynamic drag . The LED low @-@ beam headlights consume less electricity than halogen lamps . Nissan sought to make the Leaf appealing to mainstream drivers by giving it a familiar <unk> and hatchback @-@ like design . The bottom of the car has aerodynamic paneling to reduce drag and improve aerodynamics as much as possible . According to Nissan , the 2011 Leaf has a drag coefficient of Cd = 0 @.@ 29 , which was improved to Cd = 0 @.@ 28 in 2012 ( for the 2013 model year ) . 
 = = = Powertrain = = = 
 The Leaf uses an 80 kW ( 110 hp ) and 280 N · m ( 210 ft · lb ) front @-@ mounted synchronous electric motor driving the front axle , powered by a 24 kWh lithium ion battery pack rated to deliver up to 90 kW ( 120 hp ) power . 
 The pack contains air @-@ cooled , stacked laminated lithium ion manganese oxide batteries . 
 The 2011 / 12 model Leaf has a top speed of over 150 km / h ( 93 mph ) . Unofficially , 0 to 60 mph ( 0 to 97 km / h ) performance has been tested at 9 @.@ 9 seconds . 
 = = = Battery = = = 
 With the 24 kWh electric vehicle battery ( total capacity ; usable battery capacity is about 21 @.@ 3 kWh ) it consists of 48 modules and each module contains four battery cells , a total of 192 cells , and is assembled by Automotive Energy Supply Corporation ( AESC ) – a joint venture between Nissan , NEC and NEC Energy Devices , at Zama , Japan . The battery and control module together weigh 218 kg ( 480 lb ) the specific energy of the cells is 140 W · h / kg . 
 The Leaf 's design locates the battery , the heaviest part of any EV , below the seats and rear foot space , keeping the center of gravity as low as possible and increasing structural rigidity compared to a conventional five @-@ door hatchback . 
 The battery pack is expected to retain 70 % to 80 % of its capacity after 10 years but its actual lifespan depends on how often DC fast charging ( 480 volts DC ) is used and also on driving patterns and environmental factors . Nissan said the battery will lose capacity gradually over time but it expects a lifespan of over 10 years under normal use . The 2011 / 12 Leaf 's battery was initially guaranteed by Nissan for eight years or 160 @,@ 000 km ( 100 @,@ 000 miles ) ( see Warranty sub @-@ section below under United States for limitations ) . Nissan stated in 2015 that until then only 0 @.@ 01 percent of batteries , produced since 2010 , had to be replaced because of failures or problems and then only because of externally inflicted damage . Some vehicles have already covered more than 200 @,@ 000 km ( 120 @,@ 000 miles ) with no battery problems . In April 2016 , Nissan estimated that fewer than 5 batteries are replaced per year worldwide ; about 0 @.@ 012 % of all Leafs since introduction . Nissan recycles 15 @-@ 20 batteries per year ; as of 2016 too few to use for stationary energy storage . Nissan plans to offer recycled batteries as 4 @.@ 2 kWh home storage by fall 2016 , called <unk> . 
 In addition to the main battery , the Leaf also has an auxiliary 12 @-@ volt lead – acid battery that provides power to the car computer systems and accessories such as the audio system , supplemental restraint systems , headlights and windshield wipers . The small solar panel on the Leaf rear spoiler helps to charge this accessory battery . ( In the United States models , only comes with SL trim . ) 
 For the 2011 model year Leafs , Nissan recommended owners perform the following preventive actions to help maximize the lithium @-@ ion battery ’ s useful life and its ability to hold a charge : 
 Avoid exposing a vehicle to ambient temperatures above 120 ° F ( 49 ° C ) for over 24 hours . 
 Avoid storing a vehicle in temperatures below − 13 ° F ( − 25 ° C ) for over 7 days . 
 Avoid exceeding 70 % to 80 % state of charge when using frequent ( more than once per week ) fast or quick charging . 
 Allow the battery charge to go below 80 % before charging . 
 Avoid leaving the vehicle for over 14 days where the Li @-@ ion battery available charge gauge reaches a zero or near zero ( state of charge ) . 
 As a result of the controversy regarding several U.S. owners reporting premature loss of battery capacity in places with hot climate , Nissan USA announced in January 2012 , that it will offer an extended battery warranty on the 2013 model year Leaf which includes 2011 and 2012 model years as well . The 2013 Leaf is covered by a " State Of Health " clause which covers gradual capacity loss . This provision allows for the battery pack to either be repaired or replaced if the battery life reduces quicker than anticipated over the eight years warranty period . 
 Costs 
 Each battery pack cost Nissan an estimated US $ 18 @,@ 000 at the car 's launch in May 2010 . By 2015 , the battery costs were around US $ 300 / kWh , giving a battery cost of around US $ 5 @,@ 500 for batteries not within the eight year warranty period . Nissan reported that in Europe only 3 of 35 @,@ 000 leaf batteries had failed . 
 Battery replacement program 
 In June 2013 , Nissan announced a battery replacement program to go into effect in 2014 . At a cost of about US $ 100 ( ~ € 76 ) per month , Leaf owners can sign up at any time for the program and immediately get a new battery pack with the latest available technology that is compatible with their vehicle . The replacement battery has a full 12 bars ( 100 % ) of capacity . Nissan provides assurance that the replacement pack will maintain at least 9 bars ( 70 % capacity ) or more capacity for the time that they own their car and make monthly payments . The program also provides protection from defects in materials or workmanship for the time they own their Leaf and remain in the battery program . In summary , all batteries installed under this program will have coverage similar to the terms of standard battery coverage under the " Nissan New Electric Vehicle Limited Warranty . " 
 In June 2014 , Nissan USA announced an updated battery replacement program allowing the outright purchase of a new battery pack for US $ 5 @,@ 499 . The price does not include labor and the trade @-@ in of the old pack is mandatory . Older 2011 – 12 model year Leafs will require a mounting kit to retrofit the new pack for an additional US $ 225 . The new pack will be the same as the one in the 2015 model year Leaf , with the latest battery chemistry which Nissan claims will be more heat tolerant . Financing for the replacement battery was scheduled to be announced by the end of 2014 . 
 = = = Range = = = 
 2011 / 2012 model year 
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency official range is 117 km ( 73 miles ) , much less than the 160 km ( 100 miles ) quoted by Nissan . The Federal Trade Commission , which is supposed to label all alternative fuel vehicles , disagrees with the EPA rating , and considers that the correct range is between 154 to 177 km ( 96 to 110 miles ) . Although the FTC does not conduct its own tests as EPA does , it relies on a standard set by SAE International and the results reported by automakers . The Leaf has a range of 175 km ( 109 miles ) on the New European Driving Cycle . 
 Based on third @-@ party test drives carried out in the U.S. , reviewers have found that the range available from a single charge can vary up to 40 % in real @-@ world situations ; reports vary from about 100 km ( 62 miles ) to almost 222 km ( 138 miles ) depending on driving style , load , traffic conditions , weather ( i.e. , wind , atmospheric density ) , and accessory use . Nissan tested the Leaf under several scenarios to estimate real @-@ world range figures , and obtained a worst @-@ case scenario of 76 km ( 47 miles ) and a best @-@ case scenario of 222 km ( 138 miles ) . The following table summarizes the results under each scenario tested using EPA 's L4 test cycle and presents EPA rating as a reference : 
 Consumer Reports tested a 2011 / 12 model Leaf loaner under cold @-@ weather driven as a daily commuter . The average range obtained was 105 km ( 65 miles ) per charge with temperatures varying from 20 to 30 ° F ( − 7 to − 1 ° C ) . The magazine also reported one trip under a temperature of 10 ° F ( − 12 ° C ) that began with the range panel indicator showing 32 km ( 20 miles ) remaining . After 13 km ( 8 miles ) the Leaf drastically lost power and dropped its speed and continued to run slower until the last stretch was completed almost at walking speed . Consumer Reports concluded that the Leaf works as designed under cold temperatures but a more accurate range indicator is desirable . 
 In June 2011 , Nissan reported , based on data collected through the Leaf 's advanced telematics system , that most Leaf owners in Japan and the United States drive distances less than 100 km ( 60 miles ) per day . Nissan also found that on average owners charge their electric cars for two hours a night , and occasionally some owners drive two days on one charge . In October 2011 , Nissan North America reported that based on a bigger sample of 7 @,@ 500 Leafs on the U.S. roads , the typical driver averages 60 km ( 37 miles ) a day and the average trip length is 11 km ( 7 miles ) , measured as the distance between power on and power off . 
 In spring 2012 , the Finnish car magazine <unk> <unk> tested the Leaf in city driving at temperatures of − 15 ° C ( 5 ° F ) . They achieved a range of 59 km ( 37 miles ) with cabin and battery heaters on . 
 2013 model year 
 According to Nissan , the U.S. 2013 model year Leaf has a more efficient heating system that allows the Leaf to extend its range in cold @-@ weather conditions by 32 to 40 km ( 20 to 25 miles ) . The EPA rating is 121 km ( 75 miles ) from 117 km ( 73 miles ) in the previous models . Nissan explained that actually these ratings are not comparable , because for the 2013 model year the EPA changed the test procedures to calculate range for electric cars . Before 2013 , the agency estimated the range assuming the battery pack was charged to 100 % of its capacity . Nissan estimates that the 2013 Leaf has a 135 km ( 84 miles ) range from a 100 % charge ( Long @-@ Distance Mode charging ) , while the range drops to 106 km ( 66 miles ) for an 80 % charge ( Long @-@ Life Mode charging ) . The new EPA testing procedure considers the average of these two ranges . The increased Long @-@ Distance Mode range comes from improvements to the Leaf ’ s regenerative braking system , an overall weight reduction and enhanced aerodynamics . 
 The 2013 European version has a certified range of 200 km ( 120 miles ) under the New European Driving Cycle ( <unk> ) , up from 175 km ( 109 miles ) for the 2011 / 12 model . 
 2014 / 2015 model year 
 The official EPA range for the 2014 and 2015 model year Leaf , increased from 121 to 135 km ( 75 to 84 miles ) . The difference in range is due to a technicality , as Nissan decided to eliminate the EPA blended range rating , which was an average of the 80 % charge range and the 100 % charge range . For the 2014 model year , only the 100 % charge range figure applies . 
 2016 model year 
 Nissan added more battery capacity which increased the range of the car on a full charge . A larger 30 kWh battery is featured on the SL and SV trims , and the S trim kept the smaller 24 kWh battery found in earlier Leafs . The official EPA range for the 2016 Leaf with the 30 kWh battery is 172 km ( 107 miles ) , while the range for Leaf with the smaller 24 kWh is 135 km ( 84 miles ) , the same as the 2014 / 15 model year .

 Under its five @-@ cycle testing , the United States Environmental Protection Agency found the 2011 model Leaf 's energy consumption to be 0 @.@ 212 kWh / km ( 34 kWh / 100 miles ) and rated the Leaf combined fuel economy at 99 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent – MPGe – ( 2 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ) , with an equivalent 106 mpg @-@ US ( 2 @.@ 2 L / 100 km ; 127 mpg @-@ imp ) in city driving and 92 mpg @-@ US ( 2 @.@ 6 L / 100 km ; 110 mpg @-@ imp ) on highways . 
 For the 2013 model year Leaf , Nissan achieved a 15 % improvement of its EPA 's fuel economy combined ratings . According to the EPA , the 2013 Leaf improved its energy consumption to 115 mpg @-@ e ( 30 kW · h / 100 mi ; 18 @.@ 6 kW · h / 100 km ) from 99 mpg @-@ e ( 35 kW · h / 100 mi ; 22 kW · h / 100 km ) , giving 129 mpg @-@ e ( 27 kW · h / 100 mi ; 16 @.@ 6 kW · h / 100 km ) in city driving and 102 mpg @-@ e ( 34 kW · h / 100 mi ; 21 kW · h / 100 km ) on highways . 
 According to the EPA , the 2014 and 2015 model year Leafs have an energy consumption of 30 kWh / 100 miles , for a combined city / highway rating of 114 mpg @-@ e ( 30 kW · h / 100 mi ; 18 @.@ 7 kW · h / 100 km ) ; 126 MPGe ( 27 @.@ 3 kW · h / 100 mi ; 17 @.@ 0 kW · h / 100 km ) city and 101 MPGe ( 34 @.@ 0 kW · h / 100 mi ; 21 @.@ 2 kW · h / 100 km ) highway . 
 The 2016 Leaf with the smaller 24 kWh battery has the same ratings and energy consumption as the 2014 / 15 models , while the trims with the larger 30 kWh has the same energy consumption of 30 kWh / 100 miles , but was rated 112 MPGe ( 30 @.@ 7 kW · h / 100 mi ; 19 @.@ 1 kW · h / 100 km ) for combined city / highway ; 124 MPGe ( 27 @.@ 7 kW · h / 100 mi ; 17 @.@ 2 kW · h / 100 km ) city and 101 MPGe ( 34 @.@ 0 kW · h / 100 mi ; 21 @.@ 2 kW · h / 100 km ) highway . 
 = = = Operating costs = = = 
 According to Consumer Reports , as of December 2011 , the Nissan Leaf has an out @-@ of @-@ pocket operating cost of 3 @.@ 5 cents per mile ( 2 @.@ 19 ¢ per km ) while the heavier Chevrolet Volt has a cost in electric mode of 3 @.@ 8 cents per mile ( 2 @.@ 38 ¢ per km ) . These costs are based on the U.S. national average electricity rate of 11 cents per kWh and energy consumption was estimated from their own tests . The consumer magazine also compared the Leaf with the most fuel @-@ efficient hybrid and gasoline @-@ powered cars as tested by Consumer Reports . The results are summarized in the following table , and the analysis found that the Leaf operating cost is much less than half of the gasoline @-@ powered cars for trips up to 110 km ( 70 miles ) , which is close to the Leaf 's maximum range . The Volt while on EV mode has a close cost per mile but as the distance is larger than its electric range of 56 km ( 35 miles ) , the Leaf advantage is similar to the other cars . Consumer Reports also noted that even with a much higher electric rate of 19 cents per kWh , such as rural Connecticut , the Leaf still cost about 20 % less to operate than the Prius and around 50 % less than the Corolla . 
 According to Nissan , the operating cost of the Leaf in the U.K. is 1 @.@ 75 pence per mile ( <unk> per km ) when charging at an off @-@ peak electricity rate , while a conventional gasoline @-@ powered car costs more than 10 pence per mile ( <unk> per km ) . These estimates are based on a national average of British Gas Economy 7 rates as of January 2012 , and assumed 7 hours of charging overnight at the night rate and one hour in the daytime charged at the Tier @-@ 2 daytime rate . 
 Leaf owners in Japan are liable for yearly annual taxes due to the vehicles exterior dimensions that are not in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations for cars in the " compact " classification . This is offset by the tax incentives Japanese consumers receive for a vehicle with no tailpipe emissions . 
 = = = = Payback time = = = = 
 According to Edmunds.com , the price premium paid for the Leaf , after discounting the US $ 7 @,@ 500 federal tax credit , may take a long time for consumers to recover in fuel savings . In February 2012 , Edmunds compared the mid @-@ sized Leaf ( priced at US $ 28 @,@ 550 ) with the compact gasoline @-@ powered Nissan Versa ( priced at US $ 19 @,@ 656 ) and found that the payback period for the Leaf is 9 years for gasoline at US $ 3 per gallon , 7 years at US $ 4 per gallon , and drops to 5 years with gasoline prices at US $ 5 per gallon . Considering gasoline prices by early 2012 , the break even period is 7 years . These estimates assume an average of 24 @,@ 000 km ( 15 @,@ 000 miles ) annual driving and vehicle prices correspond to Edmunds.com 's true market value estimates . For the same two vehicles , the U.S. EPA estimates the Leaf 's annual fuel cost at US $ 612 while the Versa 's annual fuel cost is US $ 1 @,@ 860 . EPA estimates are based on 45 % highway and 55 % city driving , over 15 @,@ 000 annual miles ; gasoline price of US $ 3 @.@ 72 per gallon and electricity price of US $ 0 @.@ 12 per kWh . 
 In a similar comparison carried out in April 2012 , by <unk> for The New York Times , the analysis found that at a gasoline price of US $ 3 @.@ 85 per gallon , the payback period required for the Leaf to compensate the nearly US $ 10 @,@ 000 difference in purchase versus a Nissan Versa , takes 8 @.@ 7 years . The analysis assumes an average of 15 @,@ 000 miles driven a year , a fuel economy of 33 @.@ 6 mpg @-@ US ( 7 @.@ 0 L / 100 km ; 40 @.@ 4 mpg @-@ imp ) for the Versa , priced at US $ 18 @,@ 640 , and a Leaf price of US $ 28 @,@ 421 , after discounting the US $ 7 @,@ 500 federal tax . The payoff time drops to 6 years if gasoline is priced at US $ 5 per gallon . The newspaper also reported that according to the March 2012 Lundberg Survey , gasoline prices would need to reach US $ 8 @.@ 53 a gallon for the Leaf to be competitive with a similar gasoline @-@ powered car in the 6 years an average person owns a car , while the Chevrolet Volt plug @-@ in hybrid requires a gasoline price of US $ 12 @.@ 50 a gallon to break even . 
 = = = = Total cost of ownership = = = = 
 According to a study published in June 2013 , by the Electric Power Research Institute , the total cost of ownership of the 2013 Nissan Leaf SV is substantially lower than that of comparable conventional and hybrid vehicles . For comparison , the study constructed average hybrid and conventional vehicles and assumed an average US distance per trip distribution . The study took into account the manufacturer 's suggested retail price , taxes , credits , destination charge , electric charging station , fuel cost , maintenance cost , and additional cost due to the use of a gasoline vehicle for trips beyond the range of the Leaf .

 In February 2014 , the Automotive Science Group ( ASG ) published the result of a study conducted to assess the life @-@ cycle of over 1 @,@ 300 automobiles across nine categories sold in North America . The study found that among advanced automotive technologies , the Nissan Leaf holds the smallest life @-@ cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the North American market with minimum four @-@ person occupancy . The study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the battery electric technology is more than offset with increased environmental performance during operational life . For the assessment , the study used the average electricity mix of the U.S. grid in 2014 . 
 = = = Recharging = = = 
 Recharging receptacles vary between models . The Leaf , with the SL option , has two charging receptacles : a standard SAE J1772 @-@ 2009 connector for level 1 and 2 charging ( 120 / 220 volts AC ) and a <unk> high @-@ voltage DC connector designed by <unk> for DC fast charging ( 500 volts DC 125 amps ) using the CHAdeMO protocol . 
 Models with an on @-@ board 3 @.@ 6 kW charger can be fully recharged from empty in 8 hours from a 220 / 240 @-@ volt 30 amp supply ( 5 @.@ 2 kW allowable draw ) that can provide the on @-@ board charger its full 3 @.@ 6 kW of usable power . Models with an on @-@ board 6 @.@ 6 kW charger can be fully recharged from empty in 4 hours from a 220 / 240 @-@ volt 40 amp supply ( 7 @.@ 7 kW allowable draw ) that can provide the on @-@ board charger its full 6 @.@ 6 kW of usable power . A third option is to use the supplied EVSE cable from a standard 220 / 240V AC outlet , taking around 12 hours for a full recharge drawing 10A . 
 In North America and Japan using a standard household outlet ( 120 @-@ volt , 15 amp breaker , 12 amp maximum allowable draw , 1 @.@ 4 kW ) and the 7 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 25 ft ) cable included by Nissan , the Leaf will regain approximately 5 miles of range per hour . This type of charging is ideal for the commuter that can plug into standard outlets at home and at work during the typical 21 hours a day that the typical North American car is parked . It is also useful for emergency charging from any ubiquitous 120 @-@ volt outlet just about anywhere in North America . 
 United States electrical regulations require a 240 @-@ volt charging station to be permanently wired unless proper interlock mechanisms are available to ensure the charging current can be safely turned on and off . Nissan selected AeroVironment to supply its charging dock and installation services in North America ( see the United States section below for more details ) . 
 For models with DC fast charging , a battery pack can be charged from fully discharged to 80 % capacity in about 30 minutes . Nissan developed its own 500 @-@ volt DC fast charger that went on sale in Japan for ¥ 1 @,@ 470 @,@ 000 ( around US $ 16 @,@ 800 ) in May 2010 . Nissan warns that if fast charging is the primary way of recharging , then the normal and gradual battery capacity loss is about 10 % more than regular 220 @-@ volt charging over a 10 @-@ year period . Other companies make compatible charging stations , and companies and local government have various initiatives to create networks of public charging stations ( see electric vehicle network ) . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 The Nissan Leaf employs an advanced telematics system called <unk> which originally was only available in Japan . The system sends and receives data via a built @-@ in GPRS radio similar to the connectivity of mobile phones . <unk> is connected any time the car is in range of a cell tower and it makes possible several user functionalities , such as position and possible range on a map and which charging stations are available within range . The system also tracks and compiles statistics about distance traveled and energy consumption and produces daily , monthly and annual reports of these and several other operational parameters . All information is available in the Leaf 's digital screens . Through a smart phone application or secure web page , owners can remotely turn on the air @-@ conditioner or heater as well as reset charging functions even when the vehicle is powered down . This remote functionality can be used to pre @-@ heat or pre @-@ cool the car prior to use while it is still charging so that less energy from the battery is used for climate control . An on @-@ board timer can also be pre @-@ programmed to recharge batteries at a set time such as during off @-@ peak rates . The Leaf 's SL trim has a small solar panel at the rear of the roof / spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary battery . 
 = = = Safety = = = 
 NHTSA rates the 2011 and 2012 model years , as 5 stars overall . The 2013 and 2014 model years rating , is 4 stars overall due to lower scores for passengers in front and side tests . 
 The Nissan Leaf won the " Top Safety Pick " awarded by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2011 . The Leaf received top ratings of " Good " for front , side , and rear impact crash tests , and also on rollover protection . All injury measurements except one were rated good , indicating a low risk of significant injuries in crashes according to the scale of severity employed in the IIHS ’ s testing . The European New Car Assessment Programme ( Euro NCAP ) awarded the Leaf the highest five star car safety rating , earning the following ratings for each criteria : 
 Accident and rescue handling 
 In December 2010 , Nissan published a guide for first responders that details procedures for handling a damaged 2011 Leaf at the scene of an accident . The steps include a manual high @-@ voltage system shutdown , subsequent to the assumed automatic disconnects , built into the car 's safety systems . Rescue personnel are instructed by Nissan to disconnect both the high voltage and 12 V systems before performing any first response actions . 
 The Nissan Leaf 's battery pack is shielded from crash damage by structural steel reinforcement . To prevent shock and fire hazards , the Leaf has a battery safety system that is activated in a crash that involves the airbags . The airbag control unit sends a signal which mechanically disconnects the high voltage from the vehicle . 
 In December 2011 , Nissan reported , as an indication of the Leaf safety performance , that none of the around two dozen Leafs that were destroyed during the March 2011 tsunami caught fire and their batteries remained intact . As of December 2011 , no fires after a crash have been reported in the U.S. associated with the Leaf or other plug @-@ in electric cars available in the market . 
 Warning sounds 
 Due to significant noise reduction typical of electric vehicles that travel at low speeds , the 2011 Leaf includes digital warning sounds , one for forward motion and another for reverse , to alert pedestrians , the blind , and others of its presence . For this purpose Nissan created the Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians ( VSP ) system , which was also used in Nissan Fuga hybrid . The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside in order to be aware of the vehicle approaching , but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside . Nissan explained that during the development of the sound , they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists . The sine @-@ wave sound system sweeps from 2 @.@ 5 kHz at the high end to a low of 600 Hz , an easily audible range across age groups . Depending on the speed and if the Leaf is accelerating or decelerating , the sound system makes sweeping , high @-@ low sounds . The sound system ceases operation when the Nissan Leaf reaches 30 km / h ( 18 @.@ 6 mph ) and engages again as car slows to under 25 km / h ( 15 @.@ 5 mph ) . For the 2011 model , the driver could turn off sounds temporarily through a switch inside the vehicle , but the system automatically reset to " On " at the next ignition cycle . The system is controlled through a computer and synthesizer in the dash panel , and the sound is delivered through a speaker in the front driver ’ s side wheel well . Nissan removed the ability to disable the pedestrian alert between model year 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of the U.S. ruling to be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . 
 After the new sounds were publicized , the U.S. National Federation of the Blind commented that " while it was pleased that the alert existed , it was unhappy that the driver could turn it off . " The Leaf 's electric warning sound had to be removed for cars delivered in the U.K. , as the country 's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11 : 00 pm and 6 : 00 am , and the Leaf 's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation .

 Japanese market 
 In November 2012 , Nissan announced the specifications of the updated 2013 model Leaf destined for the Japanese market . The improved version delivers a range increase of 14 % on the Japanese cycle , allowing the travel distance on a full charge to go from 200 to 228 km ( 124 to 142 miles ) . Besides adjusting the regenerative braking to improve power generation , Nissan reduced the Leaf weight by integrating the electric motor , inverter , and AC / DC converter , achieving a combined weight reduction for those parts of 10 % . Also , lighter parts were used throughout , and an improved battery module and more integrated electronic units have together reduced the car mass by over 77 kg ( 170 lb ) , 5 % of the previous version . 
 The 2013 Leaf has a larger trunk , with its volume increased from 330 to 370 litres ( 11 @.@ 6 to 13 cu ft ) . The extra space was freed by moving a downsized charger from the back of the car to the front . Other improvements include a new gauge that tells the driver how much battery capacity is remaining by percentage , and a long @-@ life battery mode is now available in any charging mode , which charges the battery to 80 % to improve pack life . Also , Nissan will introduce in the Japanese market a lower price entry @-@ level model with less equipment , called the S trim . This model will be priced at just under ¥ 2 @.@ 5 million ( around US $ 29 @,@ 700 ) , almost half a million yen ( approximately US $ 5 @,@ 950 ) cheaper than the previous year ’ s entry price . 
 American market 
 The 2013 model year Leaf destined for the U.S. market has several key improvements similar to the Japanese version , better range , faster charging capabilities , a more efficient cabin heater , and a lower starting price . According to Nissan USA , several of the changes seek to address shortcomings of previous versions of the Leaf , and feedback from Leaf owners was taken into consideration . The 2013 model year Leaf delivers a higher range than the 2012 model with the same 24 kWh battery pack . The efficiency gains come from a combination of improvements to aerodynamics through tweaks to the front fascia that allowed a reduction of the drag coefficient ; a more efficient heater ; the addition of a driver @-@ selected B @-@ mode that increases regenerative braking ; and energy / range management . 
 The 2013 model year offers a dashboard display of the battery ’ s state of charge on a percentage basis , as has been demanded by Leaf owners . A 6 @.@ 6 @-@ kW onboard charger , available as an extra @-@ cost option on the base model , reduces charging times using 240 @-@ volt power . This improvement means adding about 32 km ( 20 miles ) in an hour of charging , rather than about 19 km ( 12 miles ) that took with the 3 @.@ 6 @-@ kW charger on 2012 models . A complete charge from empty to full takes about four hours , instead of seven hours . 
 The charge port area now comes with a light not provided on earlier models , and the ability to open the port door from inside the car or by using the key fob . The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position under the hood , which increases cargo volume . The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model , and is the result of a strategy for affordability . The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams , and uses 16 @-@ inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels . The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone . New features , including LED headlamps , fog lights , 17 @-@ inch alloy wheels and leather seating , are reserved for the higher @-@ end SL trim . Additional premium upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven @-@ speaker audio system and around view monitor , which puts cameras in front , in back and on the side mirrors for parking assistance . 
 The new base @-@ level 2013 Nissan Leaf S starts at US $ 28 @,@ 800 , the mid @-@ level Leaf SV at US $ 31 @,@ 820 , and the high @-@ end Leaf SL trim starts at US $ 34 @,@ 840 . All prices have a mandatory US $ 850 destination fee added . 
 European market 
 The 2013 European version has many of the same improvements of the Japanese and U.S. versions , including an extended range , greater recyclability , more interior space , better charging performance , and more equipment . Also three versions will be available : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> version has a lower starting price than the previous model , and the <unk> model features even more standard equipment than the 2011 / 12 Leaf . The European version was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show , and production of the 2013 model began in March 2013 at the Sunderland plant in the U.K. , and sales started in June 2013 . The price of the 2013 Leaf produced in Sunderland is lower than the one built in Japan , and to further reduce the purchase price by GB £ 5 @,@ 000 , Nissan offered a battery leasing option for all trims produced at Sunderland . The leasing option is also available in several European countries , reducing the purchase price by € 5 @,@ 900 . This measure , among others , helped to reduce the sales price in Germany , for instance , from roughly € 37 @,@ 000 in April 2012 ( with battery ) to roughly € 24 @,@ 000 in July 2013 ( excluding battery lease of € 79 per month ) .

Production of the electric car was disrupted for several months beginning in March 2011 due to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan , and as a result , Nissan announced it was not able to reach its 2011 production target of 50 @,@ 000 Leafs . Nissan expected to increase sales in 2012 to 40 @,@ 000 units from 20 @,@ 000 in 2011 , as production returned to normal output and the Leaf became available in more European countries and more regional markets in the U.S. 
 With cumulative sales of more than 49 @,@ 000 Leafs through December 2012 , Nissan achieved only a 22 % increase in sales during 2012 , which according with Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn " was a disappointment for us . " Mr Ghosn cited the adverse dollar @-@ yen exchange rate as one of the factors affecting the Leaf price . He also said that they realized the price of the original Leaf models was a problem , and the decision to drop the price on the 2013 model year Leaf by 18 % is possible due to the start of U.S. production of the battery car on the new assembly line in Smyrna , Tennessee , which will reduce production costs . Nissan has also taken other steps to improve production efficiency and lower component costs – especially for the battery pack , the single @-@ costliest part of an electric vehicle .

 Nissan had to delay the beginning of deliveries in order to remove the Leaf 's electric warning sound for pedestrians , as U.K. law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11 : 00 pm and 6 : 00 am , and at that time the Leaf 's audible warning system did not allow for such temporary deactivation . Deliveries to individual customers began on March 21 , 2011 . The first retail delivery of a 2013 Leaf produced in the Sunderland plant took place on 31 May 2013 , and Nissan chose the same retail customer who was the first person in the UK to take delivery of a Nissan Leaf in March 2011 . Sales of the three trims of the 2013 model began in June 2013 . 
 Leaf sales in September 2014 , achieved a record of 851 units , up from 332 units in September 2013 , representing not only the best monthly sales ever in the U.K. , but also the largest volume of Nissan Leafs ever sold in one month in a European country .

 = = = Japan = = = 
 The price of the Leaf in Japan starts at ¥ 3 @.@ 76 million ( approximately US $ 44 @,@ 600 ) before any current tax breaks . The Leaf is eligible for a ¥ 770 @,@ 000 government tax credit if current incentives continue through fiscal year 2010 , which reduce the net price to ¥ 2 @.@ 99 million ( US $ 35 @,@ 500 ) . The Leaf is also exempted from the car @-@ weight and car @-@ acquisition taxes . 
 Nissan offers customers various purchasing methods , including a financing program that allows consumers to pay ¥ 2 @.@ 4 million ( US $ 28 @,@ 500 ) and then a monthly fee of ¥ 10 @,@ 000 ( US $ 119 ) , which includes electricity costs . Other services that are available include assistance from Nissan dealers to customers in the installation of charging facilities in their homes . Nissan committed to install 200 @-@ volt regular chargers at 2 @,@ 200 Nissan dealers nationwide before December 2010 ; about 200 dealers would also have quick @-@ charging facilities that provide 80 % of battery capacity in less than 30 minutes . Nissan guarantees the availability of at least one quick @-@ charge unit within a 40 km ( 25 miles ) radius throughout the country . The 220 V quick charger went on sale on May 2010 for ¥ 1 @,@ 470 @,@ 000 ( around US $ 17 @,@ 800 ) excluding taxes and installation . The quick chargers were developed by Nissan but they also work with electric cars from other automakers .

Among individuals , older consumers ( age 50 and higher ) accounted for 61 % of the orders . As of late May 2010 , Nissan claimed it had already received 6 @,@ 000 pre @-@ orders , which allowed it to reach its Japan sales target for FY2010 . The first Leaf delivery took place at the Kanagawa Prefecture on December 22 , 2010 . Ten units were delivered to the Kanagawa Prefecture Government , which decided to assign six Leafs for official use and the other four will be available for the car rental service run by the local government . Since December 2010 , Nissan has sold 65 @,@ 783 units by the end of May 2016 . 
 Nissan Zero Emission Fund 
 In June 2012 , Nissan launched a new fund for individual Nissan electric vehicle owners in Japan called the Nissan Zero Emission Fund . Through participation in this program , Leaf owners are able to generate CO2 emissions credits certified by the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry ( METI ) based on the amount of CO2 emissions that are offset by driving the Nissan Leaf to generate credits . Measurement and certification of the amount of CO2 emissions that are avoided by driving the electric cars is calculated based on the total annual distance traveled as automatically collected by Nissan 's advanced telematics " <unk> " system . These credits are sold to an organization that promotes investment in low carbon emissions , the Green Investment Promotion Organization . All profits earned by the sale of the credits will be invested by the fund to support forest conservation activities of thinning forests in Japan and the installation of quick charging facilities in appropriate locations in the country . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 Nissan offered the 2011 model year Leaf in SV and SL trim levels . The SV trim level included an advanced navigation system and Internet / smart phone connectivity to the vehicle . The SL trim level added features , including rearview monitor , solar panel spoiler , fog lights , and automatic headlights for an additional US $ 940 . An optional CHAdeMO fast charge receptacle was available for US $ 700 , but only as a factory installed option on the SL model . This second charge port is likely to differ from the SAE International standard for electric vehicle fast @-@ charging equipment that is under development , and expected to be published by mid @-@ 2012 . A cold weather package was available , standard in some states , optional in others . The package included a temperature management system for the lithium ion battery , heated front and rear seats , heated steering wheel , rear seat heat duct and heated outside mirrors . 
 Minor upgrades for the 2012 model year Leaf included a quick charge port that is standard on the SL trim , and also the cold weather package is standard on all Leafs ; but pricing for both trims of the 2012 model year Leaf was increased . Nissan explained that these changes reflect customer preferences in the US based on actual orders of the 2011 model in the seven initial launch market states , as the SL trim was chosen by 95 % of the buyers , and of those Leaf <unk> , 90 % had the DC quick charge . 
 Charging options 
 Leaf customers have the option to buy a home charging station through Nissan at cost of around US $ 2 @,@ 200 including installation , which was eligible for a 50 % federal tax credit up to US $ 2 @,@ 000 until December 31 , 2010 , and afterwards the credit was reduced to 30 % up to US $ 1 @,@ 000 for individuals and US $ 30 @,@ 000 for commercial buyers . The charging stations operate on a 240 @-@ volt supply and are built and installed by AeroVironment . This one @-@ stop @-@ shop process includes a home assessment by a certified technician to ensure that the buyer 's garage is plug @-@ in ready . The AeroVironment charging dock is also available as a cash and carry purchase , with installation by any electrical contractor arranged separately . It was originally available for US $ 751 , but the price was increased in April , 2011 to US $ 995 . 
 Other options for level 2 charging of the Leaf include the Blink charging dock from <unk> ( also available through the EV Project ) , the Schneider Electric Square @-@ D , and the <unk> @-@ Green unit from <unk> . A complete list of charging stations is available at Plug In America . It is also possible to have the level 1 charging dock which comes with the Leaf modified to support both 120 V and 240 V charging , the latter at either 12 amps ( US $ 239 ) or 16 amps ( US $ 287 ) . The 16 amp modification provides the maximum current draw the Leaf can use , and thus charges at the same rate as the AeroVironment charging dock . Various adapters allow using the modified unit with a wide range of 240 V sockets . The modified unit provides the cheapest charging solution for those with a 240 volt socket available and is portable for use at other locations . Possible disadvantages include the lack of UL certification and the potential for theft since the unit is not hardwired . The modification of the <unk> charger could also void various warranties associated with the charging cable , EV system , and battery . 
 EV Project 
 The US Department of Energy initially granted US $ 99 @.@ 8 million , and later awarded an additional US $ 15 million , to Electric Transportation Engineering Corporation ( <unk> ) for the EV Project , that involves the installation of up to 11 @,@ 210 charging stations in strategic markets in Phoenix and Tucson , Arizona ; San Diego , California ; Portland , Eugene , Salem and Corvallis , Oregon , Seattle , Washington ; Nashville , Knoxville , and Chattanooga ; Washington D.C. ; Dallas , Fort Worth , and Houston , Texas . Nissan has partnered with <unk> on this project and will supply 4 @,@ 700 vehicles to individual and fleet customers in these areas . 
 The EV Project will collect and analyze data regarding vehicle use under different geographic and climatic conditions , for both commercial and public installations . The effectiveness of the deployed charge infrastructure will also be evaluated as part of the project and the lessons learned will be applied to improve the deployment of the full production number of Leafs and other EVs . 
 Price and government incentives 
 The base retail price for the 2011 model year Leaf in the U.S. was US $ 32 @,@ 780 before any applicable tax incentives ( federal tax credit ) . Nissan also had a 36 @-@ month lease option for US $ 349 a month for the SV trim and US $ 379 a month for the SL trim , plus an initial payment of US $ 1 @,@ 999 in both cases . For eligible customers there is an electric vehicle federal tax credit for up to a US $ 7 @,@ 500 established by the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 . The federal tax credit shrinks by automaker after it has sold at least 200 @,@ 000 vehicles in the U.S. , and then it phases out over a year . Nissan explained that it priced the Leaf lower in the U.S. than in Japan because it wants to achieve higher sales in that market . Other state and local incentives are available and may further decrease the cost . California initially had a US $ 5 @,@ 000 statewide rebate for FY 2010 @-@ 2011 available through the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project ( CVRP ) , and it was decreased to US $ 2 @,@ 500 for FY 2011 @-@ 2012 . Georgia has a US $ 5 @,@ 000 tax credit , and Oregon has a US $ 1 @,@ 500 tax credit . 
 The base retail price for the 2012 model year Leaf SV was increased to US $ 36 @,@ 020 including a US $ 820 destination charge , and the 2012 Nissan SL is also priced higher , at US $ 37 @,@ 250 .

 Sales and regional launches 
 Nissan began the online @-@ only reservation process on April 20 , 2010 , charging a fully refundable US $ 99 reservation fee that allowed customers to secure a place on the list to purchase or lease a Leaf . It limited reservations to one per household and by July 2010 it had received approximately 17 @,@ 000 reservations . The carmaker reported that more than 55 % of the reservations were from what Nissan calls its primary launch markets in California , Washington , Oregon , Arizona , and Tennessee , where the carmaker has its US headquarters and an auto factory . By September 2010 Nissan announced it had reached 20 @,@ 000 reservations , and it did not accept any more reservations for the remainder of 2010 . In July 2011 , Nissan stated that only 48 % of Leaf reservations from the initial 2010 process materialized into firm orders . The US $ 99 reservation fee was ended in mid April 2012 , and customers are since allowed to buy the Leaf directly from dealers , keeping the online reservation as optional . 
 Firm orders started in August , and deliveries began in select markets and limited quantities in December 2010 . Nissan initially limited Leaf sales among states that are home to the EV Project , which was awarded a grant from the United States Department of Energy and is the largest electric vehicle and infrastructure deployment in the US . The first Leaf customer delivery took place in a Nissan dealership in Petaluma , California on December 11 , 2010 to the first person to place an on @-@ line order in the United States . Nissan reopened online reservations for the 2011 model year Leaf on May 1 , 2011 in the seven initial launch states of Arizona , California , Hawaii , Oregon , Tennessee , Texas and Washington . Starting on July 27 , 2011 , Nissan opened up the 2012 model year Leaf ordering process to consumers with existing reservations the second group of launch markets , which included Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Illinois , Maryland , Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , Virginia , and Washington , D.C. Then , on August 4 , Nissan reopened the reservation process to the general public in the first and second launch markets . By October 2011 Nissan had also opened orders for the 2012 Leaf to residents of Colorado , Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York . Deliveries of the first batch of 2012 model year Leafs began in November 2011 . On December 6 , 2011 , Nissan began taking order in Delaware , Indiana , Louisiana , Nevada , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Rhode Island . Since March 2012 the Leaf is available nationwide . Sales of the 2013 model year Leaf began in February 2013 . 
 A total of 19 units were delivered in December 2010 . On June 1 , 2011 , Nissan stated that it expected the total number of U.S. deliveries to be between 10 @,@ 000 and 12 @,@ 000 by the end of 2011 , a drop from its original forecast of 20 @,@ 000 sales . In 2011 , a total of 9 @,@ 674 Leafs were sold . Over 60 % of the Leafs sold in the U.S. were bought in California up to November 2011 . In May 2012 , Nissan announced a sales goal of 20 @,@ 000 Leafs for the year and the company expected to increase sales to meet such target once production starts in the U.S. , however , only 9 @,@ 819 units were sold in 2012 . During 2013 , sales increased to 22 @,@ 610 units , and the Leaf was the top selling Nissan model in Atlanta , Seattle , and San Francisco . Also , the Leaf ranked within the top @-@ three Nissan models in Honolulu and Portland , Oregon . As of August 2013 , Nissan noted that the Leaf is among the ten top selling vehicles in San Francisco regardless of powertrain . Between August 2013 and May 2014 , Atlanta was the Leaf top U.S. metropolitan market for eight out of 10 months . Leaf sales reached a 4 @.@ 4 % share of Nissan passenger car sales in the American market in December 2013 , and the share climbed to a record 5 @.@ 1 % in September 2014 . 
 In March 2015 Leaf sales passed the 75 @,@ 000 unit milestone , and , by the end of March cumulative sales reached 76 @,@ 407 units since its introduction , surpassing Chevrolet Volt sales ( 75 @,@ 231 ) to become the all @-@ time top selling plug @-@ in electric car in the United States since . A total of 17 @,@ 269 Leafs were sold in 2015 , down from 30 @,@ 200 units in 2014 . Cumulative Volt sales passed Leaf sales in March 2016 , and the plug @-@ in hybrid became once again the best selling plug @-@ in car in the American market . As of June 2016 , a total of 95 @,@ 384 Leafs had been sold in the United States . 
 Use patterns and owners profile 
 Based on the aggregate information compiled until late April 2011 through the telematics systems included in all Leafs and reflecting the patterns of early adopters , Nissan found that the average trip length is 7 miles ( 11 km ) and the average charging time is 2 hours and 11 minutes , with most owners charging on a Level 2 , 220 @-@ volt charger at their homes . Nissan also found that early adopters are a combination of conscientious environmentalists and tech @-@ savvy individuals . According to additional information compiled until mid July 2011 and based on the owners profile from more than 4 @,@ 000 Leaf delivered in the U.S. market the Leaf was the primary vehicle for most owners ; 60 % of Leaf sales in the country took place in California , led by Los Angeles and San Francisco ; Leaf owners drive less than 97 km ( 60 miles ) a day ; and the Toyota Prius is the number one vehicle also owned by Leaf buyers , with 19 % . The information compiled allowed Nissan to build a profile of the first owners , finding that Leaf buyers are college educated ; have excellent credit , with an average credit score of 750 , and have a combined household income of US $ 140 @,@ 000 a year . 
 Car rental availability 
 The Nissan Leaf will also be available through two car rental companies and carsharing services in selected markets . Enterprise Rent @-@ A @-@ Car initially plans to offer about 500 vehicles at dealerships in Los Angeles , San Diego , Portland , and Seattle beginning in January 2011 . The Leaf became available for rental at their Santa Monica , California location in late March 2011 . Hertz Rent @-@ a @-@ Car plans to offer the Leaf and other electric cars at select locations in the US and Europe , including New York City ; Washington , D.C. ; and San Francisco in 2011 . The Leaf will also be available at some Hertz on Demand carsharing locations , a service with operations in London , Paris , Madrid , Berlin , and 150 locations in the United States . The carsharing rental by the hour of the Leaf began in New York City in March 2011 . 
 Warranty 
 The 2011 / 12 Leaf 's battery warranty is for eight years or 160 @,@ 000 km ( 100 @,@ 000 miles ) . The warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship , but initially did not cover gradual loss of battery capacity , nor does it cover damage or failure resulting from not following the preventive actions recommended in the Leaf Owner 's Manual for the lithium @-@ ion battery , such as exposing the car to ambient temperatures above 120 ° F ( 49 ° C ) for over 24 hours , or storing the Leaf in temperatures below − 13 ° F ( − 25 ° C ) for over 7 days . 
 Before the Leaf 's market launch , Nissan conducted an e @-@ mail survey in July 2010 among the 16 @,@ 000 individuals that made a reservation in the US and a sample of other potential customers regarding the terms of the battery pack guarantee . The survey was sent two days after General Motors announced that the Chevrolet Volt 's battery was guaranteed for eight years or 160 @,@ 000 km ( 100 @,@ 000 miles ) . The multiple @-@ choice survey had a batch of battery warranty related questions focused on the responder 's preference between a five @-@ year or 97 @,@ 000 km ( 60 @,@ 000 miles ) warranty or an eight @-@ year or 160 @,@ 000 km ( 100 @,@ 000 miles ) warranty . A Nissan spokeswoman commented that the company wanted to hear from future Leaf drivers to ensure Nissan was meeting the expectations of the marketplace before making a decision on its warranty policy . 
 The 2013 model year Leaf battery warranty covers a gradual loss of charge for five years or 97 @,@ 000 km ( 60 @,@ 000 miles ) . In Europe the battery warranty is for five years or 100 @,@ 000 km ( 62 @,@ 000 miles ) . Under the new warranty , Nissan will repair or replace the battery over the warranty period if it loses more than 30 % of its charge capacity ( below nine bars ) . This warranty is in addition of the original Leaf 's batteries that covers defects and flaws for up to eight years or 160 @,@ 000 km ( 100 @,@ 000 miles ) . But even with the new warranty , Nissan says the fix may only restore a diminished battery 's capacity to nine bars out the twelve of a new car , as Nissan clarified that batteries aren 't designed to last forever , and some loss of capacity is to be expected . According to Nissan , " the intent of this warranty is to provide consumers with confidence that despite this normal battery capacity loss , they will be assured of a minimum level of capacity throughout the warranty period . " The new loss of charge warranty also benefits owners of the 2011 / 12 model year Leaf . 
 Marketing 
 In November 2009 , Nissan launched the Zero Emission Tour , with stops in 22 North American cities . At each stop on the tour , visitors were able to view the car and learn about the benefits of zero @-@ emission driving . The first stop of the tour was in Los Angeles on November 13 , 2009 , a event that marked the unveiling of the Leaf in North America . Other stops on the tour included San Francisco ; Seattle ; Vancouver ; Las Vegas , Nevada ; Houston ; Washington , D.C. ; and Orlando , Florida . The tour ended in February 2010 in New York City after visiting 24 cities , including two ( Atlanta and Boston ) that were added to the original itinerary due to requests . Nissan estimates that 100 @,@ 000 people saw the company ’ s lithium @-@ ion battery car . 
 Nissan conducted a test drive tour — dubbed the Drive Electric Tour — in several cities in the initial U.S. launch markets . The tour began on October 1 , 2010 , at the <unk> Expo in Santa Monica , California , and continued in Anaheim , San Diego , Los Angeles , and San Jose . In November , the tour moved to Hillsboro , Oregon ; Seattle , Washington ; and San Francisco . The following month the tour continued in Tucson and Tempe , Arizona ; and Austin , Texas . 
 As winner of the Taxi of Tomorrow competition , Nissan is sponsoring a pilot program in New York City with six Leafs and their charging stations to study the use of zero @-@ emission electric vehicles as taxis . The program was launched in April 2013 , and by June 2013 , four Leafs are providing cab service in the city .

 Barbados 
 In July 2013 , <unk> Limited commenced sale of Nissan Leaf in Barbados and deployment of publicly accessible solar photovoltaic and grid @-@ tied charging points . Nineteen existing locations to charge are available . As of 2014 , there were over 40 Nissan Leafs on the road , making Barbados one of the fastest growing markets for the Nissan Leaf in per capita terms . It is notable that this has been private sector driven and not from government subsidies or direct Nissan backing . 
 Brazil 
 In April 2010 , Nissan signed an agreement with the municipal government of São Paulo to deploy 50 Leafs for use in the city 's Traffic Engineering Agency fleet . In exchange , the municipality had to conduct feasibility studies regarding the use of the electric car in the city , including the deployment of the charging infrastructure required , and how it will help to reduce air pollution . Deliveries were scheduled to begin during the first semester of 2011 and the demonstration project would end on December 2012 . In another agreement between São Paulo 's Municipality , the Renault @-@ Nissan Alliance , AES <unk> and the Association of Taxi Fleet of São Paulo , ten Leafs were deployed for taxi service on pre @-@ defined routes in the city . The first two units began service in June 2012 , and the remaining eight were deployed in December 2012 . A total of 15 dedicated charging stations were installed around the city designed to offer recharging , of which <unk> provided five to allow rapid charging . 
 In March 2013 , the first two Leafs out of a fleet of 15 , were deployed in Rio de Janeiro to operate as taxis . This program is a partnership between the government of Rio de Janeiro City , Nissan do Brasil ( NBA ) and Petrobras <unk> . The first two electric taxis are available at the Santos Dumont airport stand , and charging is provided in two Petrobras service stations at the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas and in the Barra da <unk> neighborhood . The program is part of the city 's goal to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 16 % by 2016 compared to emission levels of 2005 . 
 According to Nissan , a timeline for retail sales has not been set because of the high prices of electric cars in Brazil . The car maker is pursuing an exemption from the 35 % import tax and the enactment of other federal government incentives to make the car affordable and competitive within the Brazilian market . In June 2013 , Nissan and the government of the State of Rio de Janeiro signed a memorandum of understanding to study the possibility of manufacturing the Nissan Leaf in the state , and the entire infrastructure necessary for running electric cars . The state government would provide fiscal incentives during the investment phase , and the electric car will be exempted from import taxes .

 Initial issues 
 In April 2011 , Nissan announced that customers in the United States and Japan reported problems in restarting their Leaf vehicles after switching the motor off . Nissan said the problem does not pose any accident risk . On April 15 . Nissan announced that the problem only affected a small proportion of Leafs . Nissan engineers identified a programming error in an air conditioning system sensor that sometimes triggers an erroneous high voltage alert when the air conditioning unit is switched on , due to the increased demand for power . The system issues an <unk> <unk> command , which does not prevent driving the vehicle , but does prevent it restarting after it is turned off . The solution requires reprogramming of the Vehicle Control Module by a Nissan dealer . Nissan announced a " service campaign " to apply the software fix to all 5 @,@ 300 Nissan Leafs in operation around the world , but it was not an official recall because it was not a safety issue . The applied software update also improves the car ’ s on @-@ board range calculation system , which several Leaf owners reported was overestimating the number of miles left . In addition , the update changes the state @-@ of @-@ charge bars display to provide a true reserve capacity ; the driver now has up to five miles to find a charging spot after the car reaches the zero miles remaining mark . 
 A number of early models had air conditioning failures due to a faulty hose . 
 A number of customers have reported safety problems with the <unk> brakes : after an emergency braking event , and once the driver has released the brake pedal , the brakes remain in full force for some amount of time , increasing the risk of rear collisions . 
 Battery capacity loss 
 In May 2012 , several U.S. owners reported seeing only 11 of 12 battery capacity bars on the in @-@ car display which led them to believe they had lost some battery capacity . As time went on , more people reported seeing the issue , and some had lost two , three , and even in rare cases , four battery capacity bars . The battery capacity loss problem seems to be concentrated in regions with hot climate , and Phoenix , Arizona and the state of Texas in particular . In July 2012 , Nissan responded by saying they were investigating the issue , and a carmaker spokesman also said that " the problem is isolated to maybe 0 @.@ 3 percent of the 13 @,@ 000 Leafs on U.S. roads , and the company reportedly has loaned cars to some Leaf owners in Arizona as it researches the issue . " This is equivalent to around 40 vehicles have experienced a loss of any battery capacity bars . 
 Crowd sourced reports of Nissan Leafs with premature battery degradation have been collected at the <unk> forum and have been tracked on the website 's wiki page . 
 By early September 2012 , Nissan Executive Vice President said that there is " no problem " with the LEAF battery , and that the any customer complaints were merely the result of instrument problems . " As a response , a group of 12 Phoenix Leaf owners participated in an independent test in controlled conditions organized by Leaf driver and EV advocate Tony Williams that took place on September 15 , 2012 . The test confirmed that the Leaf has poor instruments , but the test also found significant loss of range in some cars reflecting battery capacity loss . The worst affected Leaf showed around 60 to 65 % of its original battery capacity remaining , and was only capable of driving 95 km ( 59 miles ) before running out of charge . 
 Based on a complete evaluation that Nissan Americas conducted with seven different Leafs in its Arizona Testing Center , the carmaker found that the common link among the seven Leafs from Arizona was that all of them had covered much higher mileage than the 20 @,@ 100 km ( 12 @,@ 500 miles ) Nissan used to estimate the rate of battery capacity loss over time . All of them had covered at least 50 % more than Nissan estimated average , with 31 @,@ 500 km ( 19 @,@ 600 miles ) as the average mileage for the cars evaluated . According to Nissan , that average is " more than double the average Phoenix customer mileage of 7 @,@ 500 miles per year . " Nissan concluded that " the cars and the battery packs are behaving as we expected . " As a result of this assessment , Nissan published an open letter to Leaf owners explaining the results of the assessment and the details of normal battery capacity loss expected over time . The company also decided to set up an independent advisory board to study how the company may improve its communication with customers about the performance of the Leaf . The group will be led by Chelsea Sexton , known for its prominent role on the marketing of the GM EV @-@ 1 electric car . She will select the members of the advisory board that would make recommendations to Nissan . By late September Nissan reported that around 450 Leafs have been sold in Arizona , and in the interest of customer satisfaction , two units with battery loss problems were repurchased using the buyback formula modeled on Arizona 's lemon law . One of the owners that had their Nissan Leaf repurchased established a blog in order to persuade other potential Nissan Leaf buyers in hot climates to reconsider buying this particular vehicle . By mid September , Nissan 's CEO Carlos Ghosn announced that there is an improved second generation battery coming online that will cost less than the previous one . 
 On September 17 , 2012 , a federal class action lawsuit was filed by California Leaf lessee Humberto Daniel Klee and Arizona Leaf owner David <unk> , accusing Nissan of concealing in its advertising that its Leaf vehicles have a design defect that causes them to prematurely lose battery life and driving range . The class action suit says that " before purchase or lease , Nissan failed to disclose its own recommendations that owners avoid charging the battery beyond 80 % in order to mitigate battery damage and failed to disclose that Nissan ’ s estimated 100 mile range was based on a full charge battery , which is contrary to Nissan ’ s own recommendation for battery charging . " 
 In January 2013 , Nissan USA announced that it will offer an extended battery warranty on the 2013 model year Leaf and will include 2011 and 2012 model years as well . 
 A 2015 report by insurance company Warranty Direct , stated that of 35 @,@ 000 Leafs sold in Europe , three had a battery failure . That is 0 @.@ 01 % immobilized compared to 0 @.@ 255 % for internal combustion engined cars . 
 On July 7 , 2015 , U.S. Circuit Judge A. Wallace <unk> of the 9th Circuit U.S. approved the class action settlement in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California , valued at $ 24 million . 
 Airbag failure 
 In March 2014 , Nissan is recalling nearly one million vehicles for a problem with the airbags . The occupant classification system ( OCS ) may incorrectly think that the passenger seat is empty when it is occupied by an adult , failing to activate the airbag in a collision . Cars affected include the 2013 @-@ 14 model year Leaf , Altima , Pathfinder and <unk> , as well as the 2013 NV200 , 2013 <unk> , 2014 <unk> and the 2014 <unk> . Recall documents say that due to the sensitivity of the OCS software calibration , the system may not sense a passenger . That combined with high @-@ engine vibration at idle when the seat is empty and then becomes occupied , or unusual occupant seating postures , can cause the system to fail . If the car crashes during this time , the airbag won 't deploy . Nissan will notify owners , and dealerships will fix the OCS software free of charge .

After hitting this milestone in September 2010 , Nissan stopped taking reservations in the United States until many of the initial orders had been delivered in early 2011 . 
 The Leaf has received awards from multiple organizations . Notable awards include the inclusion by Time magazine as one of the 50 best inventions of 2009 . At the 2010 Washington Auto Show , the Leaf was given the 2010 Green Car Vision Award by the Green Car Journal ( <unk> ) , who noted that the Leaf " will provide the features , the styling , and the driving experience that will meet the needs of a sophisticated and demanding market , while producing zero localized emissions and requiring no petroleum fuels . " Popular Mechanics , upon awarding the Leaf its 2010 Breakthrough Award , explained that the Nissan Leaf is " not the first pure EV , but [ ... ] hits the mainstream like none of its predecessors . " Popular Mechanics also alluded to the Leaf 's 160 km ( 100 miles ) range , which is said to be " enough for most commuters for the price of an average vehicle – and with a much lower operating cost than gasoline @-@ powered vehicles . " 
 Other awards received by the Leaf include the 2011 European Car of the Year , <unk> ’ s 2011 EV of the Year , 2011 Eco @-@ Friendly Car of the Year by <unk> , 2011 Green Fleet Electric Vehicle of the Year , it was listed among the 2011 Greenest Vehicles of the Year by the American Council for an Energy @-@ Efficient Economy , also listed by Mother Earth News among its " Best Green Cars " of 2011 , and also was ranked first in Kelley Blue Book Top 10 Green Cars for 2011 . The Leaf won the 2011 World Car of the Year , and was a finalist for the 2011 World Green Car . Ward 's Auto listed the Leaf 's 80 kW electric motor in Ward 's 10 Best Engines for 2011 . Until October 2011 the Leaf was ranked as the most efficient EPA certified vehicle for all fuels ever . In December 2011 , the Leaf was awarded with the 2011 – 2012 Car of the Year Japan at the Tokyo Motor Show . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 In 2009 , a former Tesla Motors marketing manager criticized Nissan about the cooling system chosen for thermal management in lithium @-@ ion battery packs . He also claimed there may also be an overestimation of the 160 km ( 100 @-@ mile ) range that was computed using LA @-@ 4 or " city " mode , which may underestimate the energy draw during highway driving conditions . 
 The American magazine Consumer Reports noted that while charger costs vary between US $ 700 and US $ 1 @,@ 200 , an at @-@ home charger and its installation cost more than US $ 2 @,@ 000 even for simple installations . Nissan estimates a typical charger installation costs US $ 2 @,@ 200 . The article did not mention that home charger installations are eligible for a 50 % federal tax credit up to US $ 2 @,@ 000 . Consumer Reports noted that the first 5 @,@ 700 Leaf buyers will get free chargers with federal support in 13 cities . The consumer group also reminded that many older houses with only a 60 – 100 amp supply may need a panel upgrade to install a 240 @-@ volt circuit , which can cost several thousand dollars . The additional 220 – 240 @-@ volt charger is only required for countries ( mainly the North / South American continent ) that do not have a 220 – 240 @-@ volt domestic grid and want faster charging than under 110 – 120 @-@ volt . 
 There are a variety of EVSE manufacturers for the Nissan Leaf including SPX , Schneider , <unk> , <unk> , Blink and GE . Some are priced at less than $ 850 . Since the on @-@ board charger in the Leaf only draws 16 amps , many home installations can be as simple as adding a dedicated 20 amp circuit and receptacle in the garage . 
 Consumer Reports also called buyers ' attention to the fact that the Leaf 's total out @-@ of @-@ pocket costs include a US $ 595 acquisition fee and a US $ 395 disposition fee . The consumer group also emphasized that the lease price of US $ 349 @-@ a @-@ month applies only to buyers with good credit ( Tier 1 , or a <unk> score of 700 or above ) ; for those with less than optimum credit , the monthly rate would increase . They reminded buyers that the lease comes with a 23 @,@ 000 km / year ( 15 @,@ 000 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ year ) allowance , but additional miles will cost extra . 
 = Hurricane Lidia ( 1993 ) = 
 Hurricane Lidia was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 1993 Pacific hurricane season . Forming from a tropical wave on September 8 , Lidia steadily organized and became a hurricane on September 10 . The hurricane continued to strengthen while developing a well @-@ defined eye , and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on September 11 . However , it weakened considerably before making landfall in Sinaloa as a Category 2 storm . Lidia dissipated near Austin on September 14 and was later absorbed by a cold front . Across Mexico , the hurricane killed seven people ; over 100 @,@ 000 people were forced to evacuate their homes . A total of 160 homes were destroyed and 10 @,@ 000 people were left homeless because of the storm . In the United States , five people suffered injuries and storm damage totaled $ 8 million ( 1993 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A westward @-@ moving tropical wave left the coast of Africa on August 24 . Initially , shower activity was minimal , but it increased somewhat as it approached the southern Lesser Antilles . Disorganized , the wave moved through the Southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 3 and 4 . The system quickly emerged into the Pacific Ocean , to the south of Central America . After September 7 , shower activity began to increase and the cloud pattern became more organized . At this time , the disturbance was located about 200 mi ( 320 km ) south of Salina Cruz . After becoming much better organized , it developed well @-@ defined banding features and a well @-@ defined atmospheric circulation . Based on this , the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression later that day . It continued to organize , and a nearby ship later reported near gale @-@ force winds far from its center . Based on this , the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Lidia overnight . 
 Meanwhile , Lidia was moving to the northwest at around 10 mph ( 15 km / h ) . On 0000 UTC September 9 , the tropical storm attained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) while located about 300 mi ( 480 km ) south @-@ southwest of Salina Cruz . After pausing in intensification for a while , Lidia resumed intensification later that day . Predicted to peak as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) , the system developed very deep convection and a well @-@ defined outflow . Shortly thereafter , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) upgraded Lidia into a hurricane . Although Hurricane Lidia was expected to parallel the Pacific Coast of Mexico , the agency did note that Lidia could pose a threat to parts of the country . Late on September 9 , Hurricane Lidia finally developed an eye , and thus the NHC re @-@ assessed the intensity at 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . Over the next six hours , a wind increase of 15 mph ( 25 km / h ) occurred , and the hurricane reached major hurricane intensity ( Category 3 or higher on the SSHS ) . Lidia was now predicted to threaten the Baja California Peninsula . At 1200 UTC on September 11 , Hurricane Lidia reached its peak wind speed of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) as the hurricane developed a clear and distinct eye . 
 Thunderstorm activity near the eye soon decreased in coverage , and Lidia began a weakening trend . Because of two troughs , one over the northern Gulf of California and another over the Southwestern United States , the weakening system began to re @-@ curve northeast . Heading towards mainland Mexico , the hurricane weakened significantly a day after its peak , in which Lidia was only a mid @-@ level Category 2 hurricane . Continuing to weaken , Lidia made landfall in Sinaloa at 1800 UTC on September 13 . Shortly after landfall , Hurricane Lidia then accelerated northeastward and then east @-@ northeastward . It weakened to a depression just after crossing the international border with Texas . Tropical Depression Lidia dissipated near Austin on September 14 . The remnants of the cyclone were absorbed by a cold front .

 A tropical storm warning was issued from Acapulco to Cabo Corrientes at 2100 UTC September 21 , but was discontinued 18 hours later . On 0300 UTC September 12 a hurricane warning was issued for areas below La Paz . Twelve hours later , a tropical storm warning was issued for the remaining portion of Baja California Sur . The same day , a hurricane warning was issued for a large area of the mainland . However , all watches and warnings were discontinued on September 13 as the system had moved inland over Mexico . 
 Although no reports of tropical storm force winds over land were received by the NHC , it is estimated that near @-@ hurricane @-@ force winds occurred near Mazatlán . The following locations received more than 8 in ( 200 mm ) of rain ; 12 @.@ 72 in ( 323 mm ) fell in La Cruz / Elota , 12 @.@ 3 inches ( 310 mm ) fell in <unk> , 8 @.@ 7 in ( 220 mm ) fell in La Cruz , and 8 @.@ 3 in ( 210 mm ) was recorded in Digue La <unk> . Seven deaths are fully attributed to the storm and 41 people perished in combination of Tropical Storm Beatriz , Hurricane Gert , and Lidia . In addition , one injury were reported . One person in Sinaloa was electrocuted , and another person died in Durango during the collapse of a dwelling . Three fishing boats were reported missing at sea . More than 10 @,@ 000 people were homeless , and damage was widespread in both of the states . Hundreds of shanty @-@ homes near Mazatlán were toppled , and 100 houses were destroyed in La Cruz . In Durango , 16 homes were destroyed and 4 @,@ 000 were damaged . In some areas of Nayarit , flooding destroyed several areas of agriculture . Near Culiacán , 1 @,@ 200 head of cattle were killed , and a 150 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) television tower was blown over . Utility poles , snapped trees and branches , and shredded billboards littered <unk> . Water , telephone , and electricity were cut off . Due to lack of power , gas <unk> were unable to pump . Many windows were smashed and widespread power and cell phone service outages were recorded . However , the hurricane avoided the more populated areas of the country , thus greatly reducing damage . About 100 @,@ 000 people were forced to evacuate their homes . During the aftermath of the storm , army troops provided blankets and food to the homeless .

 The remnants of Lidia , in combination of a cold front , prompted a tornado watch and flash flood watch for much of Texas . In Texas , six tornadoes were reported , with one of them causing over $ 8 million ( 1993 USD ) in damage . The Dallas @-@ Fort Worth area was hit hard . Strong winds , tornadoes and torrential downpours left broken trees , damaged buildings , and minor injuries in the wake of the storm . Johnson , Denton , Collin , Tarrant , and Dallas counties were the hardest hit . In northern Arlington , five people were injured when a roof was torn off of a hotel . 
 = M @-@ 54 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 54 is a north – south state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that bypasses the city of Flint . It is named Dort Highway in much of its length , in honor of Flint carriage and automobile pioneer Josiah Dallas Dort . The portion from the north end of Dort Highway to Clio Road is part of the historic Saginaw Trail , and was also part of the old Dixie Highway . The modern highway runs for 30 @.@ 276 miles ( 48 @.@ 724 km ) through Genesee and Saginaw counties from a connection with Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) near Grand Blanc on the south to Birch Run on the north . The highway serves mostly suburban and urban sections of the Flint area . Outside of the city , it also passes through agricultural areas in northern Genesee County and southeastern Saginaw County . 
 The first state highway along the general route of M @-@ 54 was M @-@ 10 , one of the original state trunklines signed in 1919 . Later , it was redesignated as part of US Highway 10 ( US 10 ) in the 1920s . After a series of realignments in the 1940s and 1960s , the roadway was given the M @-@ 54 designation in 1962 . A segment of Saginaw Road through Flint was redesignated a business route in the 1940s that became Business M @-@ 54 ( Bus . M @-@ 54 ) as well in 1962 . That business loop was decommissioned in 1974 . Previously , two other highways in Michigan bore the M @-@ 54 designation : a roadway that is now part of M @-@ 37 and one that is Bus . US 2 in Ironwood . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 54 starts at exit 109 along I @-@ 75 and follows Dort Highway northward through suburban Grand Blanc Township . The area near the southern end is mostly residential , but north of Reid Road , there is the Grand Blanc Metal Center plant for GM to the east of the highway . M @-@ 54 intersects Hill and Saginaw roads in the unincorporated community of <unk> as the trunkline passes out of the industrial area surrounding the plant . North of the Maple Road intersection , Dort Highway crosses into Burton , and the suburban residential neighborhoods give way to commercial properties along the roadway . There is a rail line owned by CSX Transportation that runs parallel to the highway about a half mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) to the east . North of Atherton Road , M @-@ 54 crosses into Flint and runs through the city 's east side . The trunkline intersects I @-@ 69 near the Amtrak station in the city , and a crossing with a line of the Canadian National Railway . Between Robert T. <unk> Boulevard and Davison Road , Dort Highway passes another industrial area . North of Leith Street , the highway turns to the northwest , and the parallel railroad , still part of the CSX line , follows suit . 
 Dort Highway crosses the Flint River on the northeast side of the city near the interchange that connects the highway to I @-@ 475 . This interchange uses the connection with Stewart Avenue on the western side of the river to provide all of the possible traffic movements between the freeway and the highway . M @-@ 54 turns due northerly past the interchange and crosses under the rail line as it heads out of Flint . The area north of the city line on Carpenter Road is dominated by industrial properties as far north as Coldwater Road . Running northward through a more rural area , M @-@ 54 passes to the east of Mount Morris . Turning northwesterly , the trunkline is dotted with commercial businesses as it continues to the Clio area . The highway runs parallel to east of the railroad , now part of the Lake State Railway . It passes the Flint Memorial Park cemetery and the Auto City Speedway , a motorsports race track in an area that is otherwise agricultural in nature away from the main highway . The Dort Highway name ends at the intersection with Saginaw Road , and the highway takes on the latter name . East of Clio , M @-@ 54 intersects M @-@ 57 in the unincorporated community of Pine Run . 
 Past the town , M @-@ 54 turns due north on Clio Road before crossing into southern Saginaw County . Over the county line , the name changes to Gera Road , and the trunkline runs through farm fields to an intersection with Birch Run Road . At that intersection , M @-@ 54 northbound turns westward and joins M @-@ 83 to run concurrently to Birch Run while M @-@ 83 continues north to Frankenmuth on Gera Road . Birch Run Road carries opposing directions of the two highways , a phenomenon called a wrong @-@ way concurrency . Running westward , the road is signed as both M @-@ 54 northbound or M @-@ 83 southbound . About two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the intersection between Gera and Birch Run roads , the two highways meet a common terminus at exit 136 on I @-@ 75 / US 23 in a commercial district that includes a large outlet mall bordering that freeway . 
 M @-@ 54 is maintained by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 54 were the 30 @,@ 145 vehicles daily north of the I @-@ 69 interchange in Flint ; the lowest counts were the 2 @,@ 880 vehicles per day along the M @-@ 83 concurrency . M @-@ 54 between I @-@ 75 in Grand Blanc Township and M @-@ 57 near Clio has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 Originally , Saginaw Road in the Flint area was a part of the Saginaw Trail , a Native American foot path in the area . In the early 20th century , the highway was a part of the Dixie Highway through the area . When the state signed its highway system in 1919 , Saginaw Road was part of M @-@ 10 ; later it was used as a section of US 10 in 1926 . In August 1926 , the Flint City Council renamed the former Western Road after <unk> Dallas Dort , a partner in GM . In 1941 , the highway was moved eastward to follow Dort Highway , and the route through the city was designated Bus . US 10 . 
 The current M @-@ 54 was designated in 1962 for a former routing of US 10 through the Flint area ; US 10 was moved after the completion of the I @-@ 75 freeway , and the M @-@ 54 designation was applied to the Saginaw Road @-@ Dort Highway routing of US 10 from I @-@ 75 in Grand Blanc to M @-@ 83 in Birch Run . At the same time , Bus . US 10 became Bus . M @-@ 54 through Flint . An extension of Dort Highway in 1987 relocated the southern end of M @-@ 54 in Grand Blanc to end at exit 109 on I @-@ 75 .

The highway connected to its parent , M @-@ 54 , in Grand Blanc Township on the south end and ran through suburban Burton northwesterly into Flint . There it ran through downtown , passing under I @-@ 475 without an interchange . Bus . M @-@ 54 ran parallel to that freeway and met I @-@ 69 at an interchange near downtown . There were intersections with both directions of M @-@ 21 ; eastbound M @-@ 21 was routed on 5th Street while westbound traffic followed Court Street one block north . The highway crossed the Flint River and turned northward . Saginaw Street continued parallel to what is now I @-@ 475 before passing out of town . In Mount Morris Township north of Flint , the business loop terminated at the intersection with M @-@ 54 ( Dort Highway ) .

 = HMS Decoy ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Decoy was a D @-@ class destroyer of the Royal Navy . Ordered in 1931 , the ship was constructed by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company , and entered naval service in 1933 . Decoy was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935 . She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis , before returning to her duty station where she remained until mid @-@ 1939 . Decoy was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before the Second World War began in September 1939 . She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 before returning to the Mediterranean . The ship participated in the Battles of Calabria without significant damage and escorted ships of the Mediterranean Fleet for most of the rest of the year . 
 Decoy assisted in the evacuations from Greece and Crete in April – May 1941 . She began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk , Libya until the ship was badly damaged in a collision in November . Repairs were not completed until February 1942 and Decoy was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean the following month . She remained there until September when she was ordered to return to Britain . The ship was refitted as an escort destroyer from November to April 1943 and transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy that same month as HMCS Kootenay . The ship was assigned to convoy escort duties in the mid @-@ Atlantic for the rest of 1943 and early 1944 . Kootenay was transferred back to British coastal waters in May to protect the build up for Operation Overlord . Together with other ships , she sank three German submarines between July and September . The ship was given a lengthy refit in Canada from October to February 1945 and returned to the English Channel in April to protect against any last @-@ gasp efforts by the Kriegsmarine to interfere with Allied supply lines to the Continent . After the end of the war in May , Kootenay served as a troop transport in Canadian waters . She was placed in reserve in October and broken up in 1946 .

 Decoy displaced 1 @,@ 375 long tons ( 1 @,@ 397 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 890 long tons ( 1 @,@ 920 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Decoy carried a maximum of 473 long tons ( 481 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 870 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 870 km ; 6 @,@ 760 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 145 officers and men . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre QF 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Decoy had a single QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt AA gun between her funnels , and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began .

 Decoy was ordered on 2 February 1931 under the 1930 Naval Estimates , and was laid down at John I Thornycroft 's yard at Woolston , Southampton on 25 June 1931 . She was launched on 7 June 1932 and completed on 17 January 1933 , at a total cost of £ 225 @,@ 236 , excluding equipment supplied by the Admiralty , such as weapons , ammunition and wireless equipment . The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September – October 1933 . New torpedo tubes were fitted at Malta after her return . 
 The ship was refitted at Devonport Dockyard between 3 September and 20 October 1934 for service on the China Station with the 8th ( later the 21st ) Destroyer Flotilla and arrived there in January 1935 . She was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in the Red Sea from September 1935 to May 1936 during the Abyssinian Crisis and made port visits in Mombasa and other East African ports before returning to Hong Kong . The ship was refitted there in October and toured Southeast Asia in the first quarter of 1937 . Decoy required further repairs and fumigation in April – May after her return . In August 1938 she sailed for Tsingtao , carrying representatives to apologise for incidents where drunken sailors had insulted the Japanese flag . She remained in the Far East until the rise in tensions before World War II began prompted her recall in August 1939 . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 With the outbreak of war , Decoy was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and assigned to contraband control duties . In December the ship began an extensive refit to repair corrosion problems , fix her boiler feedwater pumps , and replace her funnels . After completing her repairs in January 1940 , she was transferred to Freetown , joining the 20th Destroyer Flotilla , to escort convoys off the West African coast . Decoy returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in May and was assigned to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla . Together with her sister Defender , she escorted Convoy US @-@ 2 carrying Australian and New Zealand troops to the Middle East through the Red Sea from 12 to 17 May . 
 The ship and three other destroyers , escorted the French battleship Lorraine and three British cruisers as they bombarded Bardia during the night of 20 / 21 June . On 27 June 1940 , Decoy participated in the sinking of the Italian submarine Console Generale Liuzzi . Together with her sisters Dainty and Defender , the destroyer Ilex , and the Australian destroyer Voyager , the ship depth charged Console Generale Liuzzi , which was then scuttled by her own crew south @-@ east off Crete . 
 On 29 June 1940 Decoy participated , together with the same squadron , in the sinking of the Italian submarine Argonauta . The squadron patrolled the area between Alexandria , the Aegean Sea and the central Mediterranean from 27 to 30 June 1940 as part of Operation <unk> in support of British convoys from the Greek ports to Port Said and from Alexandria to Malta . Argonauta was probably sunk near Cape Ras el Hilal , Libya , at around <unk> hours by the British destroyers ; though it is also possible the Argonauta was depth charged and sunk around 1450 hours that same day by Short Sunderland <unk> of the RAF . The Historical Bureau of the Italian Navy believes the first theory to be more believable , but doubt still persists . On 9 July 1940 , she took part of the Battle of Calabria , where she was hit by splinters from a near @-@ miss from the Italian battleship Giulio Cesare . 
 While returning from Operation Hats , Decoy , Ilex and the light cruisers HMS Orion and HMAS Sydney bombarded Scarpanto during the night of 3 / 4 September . On 6 November , Decoy , together with the destroyers Defender , Hasty , Havock , Hereward , Hero , Hyperion , Ilex , Janus , Jervis , Mohawk , and Nubian screened the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet , which provided distant cover for the passage of Convoy <unk> from Egypt to Malta and Convoy ME3 from Malta as part of Operation MB8 . While in Alexandria , the ship was struck by a bomb that penetrated completely through the ship on 13 November . After temporary repairs were made , she was sent to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted until 1 February 1941 , after she was further damaged on 19 January . On 25 February , she participated in Operation Abstention ; together with Hereward and the gunboat Ladybird , Decoy landed commandos on the island of Kastelorizo , but they were overwhelmed by an Italian counter @-@ attack . Only a few survivors were taken off two days later . 
 The ship participated in Operation Demon , the evacuation of Allied troops from Greece in April , and assisted in the evacuation of troops from Crete to Egypt after the Germans invaded Crete on 22 May ( Operation Merkur ) . She spent most of the rest of the year escorting convoys to Tobruk . On 25 November , she was escorting the battleship HMS Barham when that ship was torpedoed by the German submarine U @-@ 331 . Decoy was damaged in a collision the following month and was under repair at Malta from 20 December to 8 February 1942 . After returning to Alexandria , she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean where she escorted the slow ships of Force B when the Japanese carriers attacked in March – April 1942 . The ship remained with the Eastern Fleet until she was ordered home to refit in September . En route , Decoy briefly operated from Freetown , but arrived at Greenock on 29 October , her first visit home since 1934 . 
 The ship was refitted at the Palmers shipyard at Hebburn @-@ on @-@ Tyne between 3 November and 12 April 1943 . Her armament was modified to accommodate additional depth charges by removing ' Y ' gun and her light AA armament was increased by the addition of six 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Oerlikon guns and two Parachute and Cable projectors . A Type 286 surface @-@ search radar were probably also fitted at this time , but 1944 this had been replaced by a Type 290 system . Before the war 's end this was supplemented when her director @-@ control tower and rangefinder above the bridge was replaced by a Type 271 target indication radar . Decoy was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy during the refit on 1 March and was recommissioned on 12 April with the new name of HMCS Kootenay ( the ship was gifted to the Canadians on 15 June ) . After working up , she was assigned to Escort Group C5 for convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic . 
 On 22 May 1943 Kootenay picked up 19 survivors from the Norwegian tanker <unk> , which had been torpedoed and sunk on 12 May by U @-@ 221 in the North Atlantic . She remained with the escort group until October when she began a refit in Halifax that lasted until December , Kootenay rejoined the group upon completion of the refit . The ship was reassigned to the 11th Escort Group in May 1944 in preparation for Operation Overlord . The group was tasked to protect Allied shipping in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay and Kootenay , together with the destroyer Ottawa and the corvette Statice , sank U @-@ 678 in the English Channel south of Brighton on 7 July 1944 .

 = = = Early Years ( 2002 – 2004 ) = = = 
 Sometime around 2002 , Sayanything added a space to their name to become Say Anything . In late 2002 , Bemis and Linder recorded the Menorah / Majora EP and released the album online . By this point , Say Anything 's releases had generated " a major bidding war . " Drive @-@ Thru Records pursued the band and called Max Bemis " the next Bob Dylan . " Brett Gurewitz of Epitaph Records recorded " A Boston Peace , " one of the dorm @-@ room demos , with the band . In early 2003 , Say Anything signed with Doghouse Records stating sarcastically that Doghouse " put out such obscure , borderline D.I.Y. records as The All @-@ American Rejects . " 
 After signing with the label , Bemis began writing songs for his band 's Doghouse debut . With tremendous self @-@ created pressure , he threw himself into pushing the sonic boundaries of the band and maturing their sound , incorporating elements of math @-@ rock , indie @-@ pop and theatrical pomp . He and Linder also started the search for a producer . The two met several producers but eventually decided on Tim O 'Heir and Stephen Trask . Bemis struggled with different ideas for the record and decided the album should focus on " the artistic struggle , the fact that every creative person has this sick ambition to affect some sort of change in society with their art , to be more than just a guy in a band or a poet or a sculptor . " Bemis originally intended the album to be a rock opera with a full script , narration , and a cast of characters . It was tentatively titled Zona ! Zona ! However , Bemis became overwhelmed by the entire process of writing and playing most of the instruments and had a breakdown . 
 " I literally lost my mind while we were recording , " stated Bemis regarding the breakdown . The breakdown was precipitated by a mockumentary discussed by Bemis and O 'Heir . Bemis ' condition led him to believe he was being secretly filmed for the mockumentary ; the situation culminated in him walking the streets of Brooklyn thinking he was being filmed while encountering friends ( who were actually strangers ) . After recovering , Bemis decided to focus solely on the music and dropped the idea of a script . Around July 2003 , the band began recording ... Is a Real Boy , their first album with Doghouse Records . Bemis said the two people he wanted to " outdo with ... Is a Real Boy were Andy Warhol and Jesus . " In addition to working with O 'Heir and Trask , Say Anything worked with Forrest Kline ( of power pop band Hellogoodbye ) to record the For Sale ... EP , released in 2004 . The band also worked with ECA Records to record a promotional album that was never released . 
 ... Is a Real Boy was released August 3 , 2004 . The album featured Linder on drums and Bemis on vocals , guitar , bass guitar , and keyboard . ... Is a Real Boy received positive reviews , including a 99 % from AbsolutePunk.net and four and a half stars ( out of five ) from Allmusic . When the band began touring in support of ... Is a Real Boy , they picked up Dan DeLauro , Casper Adams , and Kevin Seaton . 
 Say Anything signed with J Records in 2005 , owned by Sony BMG Music Entertainment , one of the " big four " record labels . When asked why he signed with a major label , Bemis stated , " We were looking to expand our fan base as well as have more money to tour comfortably . I also wanted enough money to work with an awesome producer for [ In Defense of the Genre ] . " In June 2005 , Say Anything was forced to cancel a six @-@ week headlining tour with Circa Survive and Emanuel on the third day of the tour due to health problems with Bemis , including " full @-@ on paranoid delusions " in Austin , Texas . At this point , Bemis ' bipolar disorder and drug addictions were wreaking havoc on the band . Bassists DeLauro and Seaton had already parted ways with the band . Andy Jackson left in September after only a few months of touring with Say Anything . Casper Adams , who was clashing personally with Bemis despite a close friendship , was fired after a show . 
 On October 3 , 2005 , Bemis had another breakdown ; this time , it involved harassing children , spitting in food at an outdoor cafe , spending a " half @-@ hour pouring a bowl of soup onto the floor , one spoonful at a time , " engaging in a street fight and finally being admitted to a mental hospital by an off @-@ duty policeman . This incident forced Say Anything to cancel another tour , this time with Bemis ' personal idols Saves the Day , along with Senses Fail and The Early November . The band was replaced by Emanuel . After returning from his stay in the hospital , Bemis ' mother and the remaining members of the band selected the Menninger clinic in Houston , Texas , to rehab Bemis . Eventually , Bemis approved of their decision , admitted himself to the Menninger clinic , and has reportedly not had a relapse since . 
 = = = ... Is a Real Boy ( 2005 – 2007 ) = = = 
 Under J Records , Say Anything re @-@ released ... Is a Real Boy with a bonus CD entitled ... Was a Real Boy on February 28 , 2006 ( although the album was originally slated for release on October 18 , 2005 and later January 17 , 2006 ) . However , copies were leaked before the release by Tower Records and His Master 's Voice , with some copies selling on eBay at inflated prices . According to the album 's liner notes , ... Was a Real Boy was originally intended as a charity album , but the band dropped the project . This charity project was to be called Vs . AIDS and was recorded in Kevin Seaton 's garage . Bemis said that " it was J Records ' idea to reissue ... Is a Real Boy . They believe it has a mainstream appeal that wasn 't really reached when Doghouse released the record . " Around this time , the band also released " Alive with the Glory of Love " as a single . 
 Alex Kent joined the band to play bass guitar after the band met him while touring with Lance 's Hero . Jake and Jeff Turner joined to play guitar and help with backup vocals after Adams and Jackson left . Parker Case completed the sextet when he joined to play guitar and keyboard after his previous band <unk> broke up . At the time , <unk> and Say Anything shared the same manager , Randy Nichols ; the band met Case while at a train station on the way to Nichols ' wedding . 
 In summer 2006 , Say Anything toured with Dashboard Confessional ; Ben Lee was with the tour in the US , while John Ralston joined the tour in Canada . The band was asked to be a part of the Warped Tour 2006 , but instead opted for the Dashboard tour . Bemis later made statements implying he did not feel he was emotionally ready for a Warped Tour . 
 Say Anything completed one of their first headlining tours in fall 2006 , when they toured with Piebald and mewithoutYou . Days Away , Brazil and Forgive Durden opened for the band on select dates . In February 2007 , Say Anything performed on Last Call with Carson Daly . The band also released their second single , " Wow , I Can Get Sexual Too , " which was from the ...

In Defense of the Genre was released on October 23 , 2007 . It was released in a dual @-@ disc format complete with 27 songs and contained many guest vocals . When asked about the name of the record , Bemis said , " Whatever ' genre ' ( or music ) one loves needs a defense , because half the world is too ignorant to really understand something before they dismiss it . " Before recording the record , Bemis stated , " I hope that [ In Defense ] will be more inspiring and uplifting . I want [ the record ] to be The Joshua Tree with balls on laughing gas . " 
 Andy Jackson , a former member of the band and close friend of Bemis , was responsible for recording many of the cameo appearances . He recorded some cameos while at the Warped Tour 2007 with Hot Rod Circuit and others in his home studio . Jackson recorded vocals from several musicians , such as Gerard Way , Adam Lazzara , Anthony <unk> , Anthony Green , Hayley Williams , Aaron Gillespie , Jordan <unk> , and Chad Gilbert . Chris Conley and several others also provided guest vocals . Alternative Press called the record " a truly magnificent sophomore effort " and gave it a 4 @.@ 5 / 5 , while Spin gave the album four stars and Corey Schmidt of <unk> said , " There are a few really great songs here .

 At about midnight EST on February 4th , 2016 Say Anything released I Don 't Think It Is without any prior announcement besides several teaser posts the day before . 
 = = Style = = 
 = = = Themes and influences = = = 
 Say Anything 's music falls into the indie rock , emo and post @-@ punk genres . They can most easily be identified by their sardonic , literary sense of humor balanced out with a sense of intense catharsis . The band , as well as certain artists within the indie scene such as Cursive , MewithoutYou , Brand New , Bright Eyes , Motion City Soundtrack , and Manchester Orchestra tend to straddle the line between older fans and a youth oriented audience . Their style incorporates pieces of hardcore , bombastic arena rock and post @-@ punk . Bemis , the primary songwriter of Say Anything , stated , " I believe that an artist should let his art be appreciated by anyone who 's interested and not ' play favourites ' . " He also said that lyrics are " based on experience . " However , due to Bemis ' bipolar disorder and strange , dark mentality , the themes of the songs are often bleak , irreverent , personal , and autobiographical . Other themes include distaste with snobbery and hypocrisy . Drugs and mankind 's relationship with drugs are also a popular subject in Say Anything 's songs , especially on In Defense of the Genre , which was written and recorded after Bemis ' several drug @-@ fueled breakdowns . Specifically , " Admit It ! ! ! " , " Yellow Cat ( Slash ) Red Cat " , " Try To Remember , Forget " , " The <unk> South " , and " Sorry , Dudes , My Bad " include references to Bemis ' drug usage . In general , Say Anything tends to draw inspiration from alienation from a flawed society but confers a sense of hope . 
 Max Bemis was raised " in a strong Jewish environment . " Many of Bemis ' lyrics borrow from his Jewish roots . While most of band 's earlier songs are free of any such inspiration , the songs of ... Is a Real Boy and In Defense of the Genre include references to Jewish heritage . " Alive with the Glory of Love , " Say Anything 's first single , has a main subject of a relationship affected by World War II and the Holocaust , based on Bemis 's grandparents , while " Wow , I Can Get Sexual Too " includes mentions of " the old shul " and a rabbi 's teachings . A strong example from In Defense comes from the lyrics of " Died a Jew " . The song includes several references to the Jewish people and its history along with mentions of " the murder of God " and Bemis ' departures from kosher . References to religion come again in " Fed to Death " on Say Anything , referring to a ' man from Nazareth ' who would one day ' spring to life to smile and clear your name ' but until then ' nail yourself upon the cross and hang your head in <unk> 
 In regards to writing songs for ... Is a Real Boy , Bemis stated , " The songs were jam packed with fairly blatant nods to bands I dig ( Queen , Saves the Day , Pavement , Faith No More , Fugazi , etc ) . " These can be considered some of Say Anything 's influences . Other influences at some point cited by the band include <unk> , Weezer , The Stooges , Neutral Milk Hotel , Sunny Day Real Estate , Wilco , and the Foo Fighters . Also of note , the band has covered songs by Ol ' Dirty Bastard ( " Got Your Money " ) , Notorious B.I.G. ( " No Soul " contains the same hook as the sample in " Juicy " although it adheres more closely to the original song " Juicy Fruit " from which the sample for the Notorious B.I.G. song was taken ) , The Four Tops ( " Sure , Baby ... Hold Back " features a chorus lifted from " Sugar Pie Honey Bunch " ) , Safety in Numbers ( " Dealer " ) , Saves the Day ( " Jessie and My Whetstone " ) , and Bob Dylan ( " The Man in Me " ) . 
 Max Bemis expounded upon the story of In Defense of the Genre as well as the differences between that album and ... Is a Real Boy in an interview with AbsolutePunk.net on June 19 , 2007 . 
 = = = Live shows = = = 
 During live shows , some members of the group ( other than Bemis ) sing backing vocals . Bemis often sings parts he wrote , but which were sung by guest vocalists on studio recordings . In recent years , Bemis has switched up the lineup of performing musicians , using some permanent members of the groups , while rotating other musicians in and out of the live lineup . Beginning on the " All My Friends Are Enemies - Rarities Tour , " Bemis added drummer Reed Murray , and bassist Garron DuPree . In summer of 2014 on the Hebrews tour , Bemis recruited ex @-@ Taking Back Sunday member Fred Mascherino , Moneen guitarist Kenny Bridges , and Moving Mountains vocalist Greg Dunn to replace the Jake and Jeff Turner and Parker Case , who were at the time performing with their band XO . The status of long time guitarists Jake and Jeff Turner is , as of yet , unclear due to their commitments to XO .

 = Resident Evil ( 2002 video game ) = 
 Resident Evil , known in Japan as biohazard , is a survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom and originally released for the GameCube video game console in 2002 . It is a remake of the 1996 game Resident Evil , the first installment in the Resident Evil video game series . The story takes place in 1998 near the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City where a series of bizarre murders have taken place . The player takes on the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine , S.T.A.R.S. agents sent in by the city to investigate the murders . 
 Resident Evil was developed over the course of one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo . It was directed by Shinji Mikami , who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil . Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well and that the GameCube 's capabilities could bring the game closer to his original vision . The game retains the same graphical presentation , with 3D models superimposed over pre @-@ rendered backgrounds . However , the quality of the graphics were vastly improved . The remake also features new gameplay mechanics , revised puzzles , additional explorable areas , a revised script , and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game . 
 Upon release , Resident Evil received critical acclaim from video game journalists , who praised its graphics and improved gameplay over the original game . It is often described as one of the best , scariest , and most visually impressive entries in the Resident Evil series . Despite this , the game sold worse than expected and led Capcom to change the direction of the series to a more action @-@ oriented approach . In 2008 , the game was ported to the Wii , featuring a new control system . A high @-@ definition version of the game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox 360 , and Xbox One in 2015 to positive critical reception and commercial success . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Resident Evil is a survival horror game where the player controls the on @-@ screen character from a third @-@ person perspective to interact with the environment . To advance through the game , the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding , outsmarting and defeating various types of monsters like zombies , undead dogs , and giant spiders . The player can open doors , push certain objects , climb obstacles , and pick up items . When an item is collected , it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time . Items in the inventory can be used , examined , and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible . The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots , and the player must often move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space . 
 Although the player can use firearms to kill monsters , Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast @-@ paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition . The player also has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by monsters . Nevertheless , players can regain their health by collecting and using herbs , which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect . Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect , which gradually depletes the player 's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs . The zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive mutated into a much faster and deadlier opponents . 
 Like in the original Resident Evil , the player can play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine and each character has advantages and disadvantages . For example , Chris can take and deal more damage than Jill but Jill can carry more items and unlock certain doors with a lock pick . Both characters can also equip defensive weapons that can save them from taking damage when seized by an enemy . These defensive weapons include a dagger and a special weapon that is exclusive to each of them : Jill can use a taser , while Chris is able to shove stun grenades into the zombies ' mouths and detonate them with a pistol shot . Defensive weapons are limited and can only be used when the player is grabbed by a monster . 
 The game features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game . Additionally , the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas . To save their progress , players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter ; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons , so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want . The story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as , and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending . Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit , the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters , bonus weapons , and special difficulty modes . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Resident Evil takes place on July 24 , 1998 , when a series of bizarre murders have occurred on the outskirts of the Midwestern town of Raccoon City . The Raccoon City Police Department 's Special Tactics And Rescue Service ( STARS ) , which is divided into Alpha Team and Bravo Team , is assigned to investigate these murders . Bravo Team is sent first , but after contact with them is lost , Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance . Alpha Team locates Bravo Team 's crashed helicopter and land at the site , where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs , one of which kills one of the team 's members . After Alpha Team 's helicopter pilot , Brad Vickers , panics and takes off alone , the remaining members of the team ( Chris Redfield , Jill Valentine , Albert Wesker and Barry Burton ) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion . 
 Depending on which character the player chooses to control , one of the members of Alpha Team is separated from the others during the chase and does not make it to the mansion ( Barry if Chris , Chris if Jill ) . In the mansion , the team decides to split up and search for clues . Over the course of the game , the player character finds several members of Bravo Team , including Kenneth J. Sullivan being eaten by a zombie , Richard Aiken , who dies after being bitten by a venomous snake , Forest Speyer , who is found dead on the balcony and then revived as a zombie , and Bravo Team leader Enrico Marini , who reveals that one of the Alpha Team members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant . Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris . The player character also learns from scattered documents found in the mansion that a series of illegal experiments were being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation . The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments , which have exposed the mansion 's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T @-@ virus . 
 Eventually , the player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella 's experiments . In the laboratory , the player finds Jill or Chris in a cell and encounters Wesker programming a Tyrant supersoldier . Wesker reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella and plans to use the Tyrant to kill the remaining STARS members . However , in the ensuing confrontation , Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant . After activating a self @-@ destruct system , the player gets up to the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction . The game features multiple endings depending on how well the player performed at key points within the game . In the best ending , the mansion is destroyed and most of the team escapes in the helicopter after defeating the Tyrant one last time . In contrast , in the worst possible ending , the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor . 
 = = Development = = 
 Resident Evil was developed by Capcom and directed by Shinji Mikami , who has designed and directed the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation video game console . The game was part of an exclusivity agreement between Capcom and Nintendo that spanned three Resident Evil titles for the GameCube , the others being Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil 4 . Mikami decided to produce a remake of the original Resident Evil because he felt that it had not aged very well , making it hard for new players to appreciate its charm . He also remarked that the GameCube 's capabilities would allow the developers to bring the Resident Evil series closer to the original vision he had for the series . According to Capcom 's marketing director Todd Thorson , the main goal in developing the remake was to " achieve motion picture quality visuals and create even more suspense and fear than the original " . 
 Production on the game started at the beginning of 2001 with a team of only four programmers . Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom 's first titles developed for the GameCube , the development team had to study the system 's performance during the first stages of development . Initially , the team considered the possibility of creating the game 's environments with computer graphic animation , but then realized that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics . As a result , the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre @-@ rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation . Despite this , the camera is more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles . The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches . Causing fear to the player was a high priority , and many of the game 's backgrounds were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly . 
 Originally , the developers planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay . However , as development was getting closer to completion , Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game . For example , the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill 's lock picking , while defense items , which were initially not going to be separated from the main inventory , were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil . The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game . However , they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life a certain amount of time after they are killed . The developers also added new areas for the player to explore , changed most of the puzzle designs , and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick . Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor , which was cut from the original game . Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels , Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one . 
 Capcom auditioned actors to be used as references by the character designers . The faces of the main protagonists were shaped and based on real people , while motion capture was used to animate their models . About 60 percent of the characters ' motions were animated based on the captured data , while the rest was created from scratch . The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation . However , Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved . Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game 's script to make the plot more convincing . The game was developed over the course of one year and two months . Final development of the game was very intense , as programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline . 
 = = Release = = 
 Resident Evil was originally released for the GameCube in March 2002 in Japan , April 2002 in North America , and September 2002 in Europe . As of January 2004 , 445 @,@ 176 copies of the game had been sold in the United States . In May 2008 , Capcom revealed that a total of 1 @.@ 35 million copies of the GameCube game were sold . In December 2008 , the game was ported to the Wii along with Resident Evil Zero . The port , titled Resident Evil Archives : Resident Evil , features a control system that supports the Wii Remote and the GameCube controller . Although Capcom originally had no plans to release the Wii version outside Japan , arguing that the game would not sell very well , the game was eventually released in North America and Europe in June 2009 due to the commercial success of Resident Evil 5 . 
 A high @-@ definition version of the game , titled Resident Evil HD Remaster , was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Xbox 360 , and Xbox One in January 2015 . The HD version supports 5 @.@ 1 surround sound as well as a resolution of 1080p and a widescreen aspect ratio of 16 : 9 . Since the original controls of the game were criticized , the remaster also includes a new control scheme which allows players to move their character in the direction of the analog stick . Although the game is a digital @-@ only release in North America and Europe , a retail edition of the PlayStation 3 version was made available exclusively in Japan and Asia . The HD version was a commercial success , breaking several sales records . It became the PlayStation Network 's biggest launch title in the service 's history and Capcom 's fastest selling digital game across both North America and Europe . As of April 2015 , more than one million copies of HD Remaster had been sold worldwide across all platforms .

 Upon its initial release , the GameCube version of Resident Evil received critical acclaim . Matt Casamassina of IGN felt that the game is " a triumph as a stand @-@ alone adventure and a major accomplishment as a remake " , calling it " the prettiest , most atmospheric and all @-@ around scariest game we 've ever played . " Similarly , GameSpot reviewer Shane Satterfield described the remake as " one amazing game that clearly stands as the best the [ Resident Evil ] series has to offer . " Jes Bickham , writing for NGC Magazine , criticized the gameplay for its limiting controls and tedious inventory management , but nevertheless judged its graphics impressive , noting that the game is " so visually rich that simply seeing the next area is an experience to be treasured . " 
 The game was widely praised for its graphics . Satterfield was impressed with the game 's attention to detail , realistic gore , volumetric fog , and Capcom 's ability to integrate real @-@ time lighting and shadows with pre @-@ rendered backgrounds , commenting that the company " has finally perfected the art of mixing prerendered scenery with ambient animations and polygonal objects , and the result is the most visually impressive video game ever released . " Bickham also remarked that , unlike in the original Resident Evil , the contrast between character models and backgrounds is seamless . Casamassina highlighted the complex geometry of the character models , stating that " close shots of Chris or Jill look almost photo @-@ realistic . " The game 's suspenseful and cinematic atmosphere received similar praise , with Game Revolution going so far as to say that the game makes the original Resident Evil look like Pong . Resident Evil was also praised for its realistic sound . AllGame reviewer Scott Alan Marriott felt that the game " [ creates ] a constant sense of dread without relying too much on obvious shock values " , while Satterfield highlighted the quality and variety of sound effects , noting that " there seem to be dozens of sound effects for footsteps alone . " However , some publications considered the voice acting to be weak due to its exaggerated delivery . 
 Changes to many aspects of the gameplay were positively viewed ; Mike Weigand of GamePro wrote that " It 's like playing Resident Evil for the first time . " Satterfield remarked that the defensive weapons add a new layer of strategy to the game . However , the controls were criticized for their lack of analog precision , a feature that was previously available in the Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil 2 . Hector Guzman of GameSpy criticized the fact that the original game 's " laborious " movement scheme , where the analog stick moves the player character in the direction they are facing , was not changed , stating that it can cause unnecessary difficulties when players try to evade monsters . Casamassina also criticized the game 's default control scheme , but considered the Type C controls to be a welcome addition . At the GameSpot 's Best and Worst of 2002 awards , Resident Evil was nominated for Best Story on GameCube , Best Graphics ( Technical ) on GameCube , and Best Action Adventure Game on GameCube . 
 The Wii version of the game received generally favorable reviews from critics , but some publications such as IGN criticized it for its outdated controls and lack of new features . Critical reception towards the HD version was mostly positive . Several critics noted that some features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well , but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Resident Evil is often regarded as one of the best and most visually impressive titles in the Resident Evil series . According to Lucas M. Thomas of IGN , the game 's graphics " became the new standard by which all future installments in the series would be compared . " Digital Spy writer Liam Martin remarked that the game is " the definitive version of a true classic " and that it still looked " fantastic " nearly 13 years after it was first released . Although the GameCube version received critical acclaim , it sold worse than expected . As a result , Mikami and Capcom decided that subsequent games in the Resident Evil series would shift away from the survival horror genre and incorporate more action @-@ based elements , starting with Resident Evil 4 in 2005 . Before that happened , Capcom developed Resident Evil Zero , a direct prequel using the same graphic engine and released in late 2002 . The commercial success of the HD version resulted in Capcom 's announcement of a similar edition of Resident Evil Zero in 2015 . A retail compilation called Resident Evil : Origins Collection that includes both Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster was released on January 22 , 2016 . 
 = USS Ozark ( 1863 ) = 
 USS Ozark was a single @-@ turreted river monitor built for the United States Navy during the American Civil War . The ship served in the Mississippi River Squadron during the war , and participated in the Red River Campaign shortly after she was commissioned in early 1864 . Ozark patrolled the Mississippi River and its tributaries after the end of the campaign for the rest of the war . She was decommissioned after the war and sold in late 1865 . 
 The ship 's activities or owner are not known after her sale , but Ozark transported Federal troops and New Orleans police attempting to apprehend the white supremacists who killed a large number of blacks during the Colfax Massacre in 1873 . She ferried witnesses back and forth to their homes on the Red River during the subsequent trials in 1874 . Her ultimate fate is unknown . 
 = = Description = = 
 The ship was 180 feet ( 54 @.@ 9 m ) long overall and had a beam of 50 feet ( 15 @.@ 2 m ) . She had a depth of hold of 7 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 2 m ) and a draft of six feet . Ozark had a tonnage of 578 tons burthen . 
 She was powered by a pair of two @-@ cylinder steam engines , each driving two four @-@ bladed , 7 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) propellers , using steam generated by four boilers . The engines were designed to reach a top speed of 9 miles per hour ( 14 km / h ) . They had a bore of 15 inches ( 381 mm ) and a stroke of 24 inches ( 610 mm ) . Ozark could carry about 100 long tons ( 102 t ) of coal . All of the machinery was built by the Franklin Foundry of St. Louis , Missouri . 
 The ship was fitted with three rudders , and the armored pilothouse was mounted on top of the gun turret . The officers ' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine , and a hurricane deck was positioned between the turret and the deckhouse , between the two funnels . The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight bulkheads . 
 Ozark 's main armament initially consisted of two smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a twin @-@ gun turret forward . The 11 @-@ inch gun weighed 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) and could fire a 136 @-@ pound ( 61 @.@ 7 kg ) shell up to a range of 1 @,@ 710 yards ( 1 @,@ 560 m ) at + 5 ° elevation . By July 1864 , her armament had been reinforced by the addition of one 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) Dahlgren gun and three 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) Dahlgrens , all on pivot mounts . One of these guns was mounted at the bow , another at the stern and the two others were abreast the deckhouse , one on each broadside . The 10 @-@ inch Dahlgren weighed 12 @,@ 500 pounds ( 5 @,@ 700 kg ) and could fire a 103 @-@ pound ( 46 @.@ 7 kg ) shell up to a range of 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) at + 19 ° elevation . The nine @-@ inch gun weighed 9 @,@ 200 pounds ( 4 @,@ 200 kg ) and could fire a 72 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 32 @.@ 9 kg ) shell to a range of 3 @,@ 357 yards ( 3 @,@ 070 m ) at an elevation of + 15 ° . Ozark was chosen as the testbed for an experimental " underwater battery " that consisted of a nine @-@ inch Dahlgren gun firing through a pipe in the side of the hull below the waterline . Cost overruns caused the project to be cancelled in January 1863 before it could be tested . 
 The cylindrical Ericsson @-@ style turret was armored with six layers of wrought iron 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates . The forward 40 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 m ) of the hull was protected by two layers of 1 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 32 mm ) plates that extended 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) below the waterline . Aft of the bow section , the hull 's armor consisted of two layers of 1 @.@ 125 @-@ inch ( 28 @.@ 6 mm ) plates . The ship 's deck was protected by iron plates one inch thick . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 The contract for Ozark , the first ship of that name in the United States Navy and named for the Ozark Tribe of the Quapaw Indians , was awarded to George C. <unk> on 14 May 1862 . He subcontracted the ship 's construction to Hambleton , Collier & Co. at their Mound City Marine Ways shipyard in Mound City , Illinois . Ozark was laid down in 1862 and launched on 18 February 1863 . She was towed to St. Louis for fitting out and arrived there on 27 February . Ozark commissioned on 18 February 1864 , with Acting Volunteer Lieutenant George W. Brown in command . She cost about $ 215 @,@ 000 . 
 Ozark spent her entire Union Navy career serving in the Mississippi River Squadron . From 12 March to 22 May 1864 , she took part in the Rear Admiral David Porter 's Red River Expedition to Alexandria , Louisiana . During the retreat down the Red River , Ozark was trapped above the falls at Alexandria , along with most of the other ironclads of the Mississippi Squadron , when the river 's water level unexpectedly began to fall . Two temporary dams , known as Bailey 's Dam , had to be built in April – May to raise the water level high enough to allow the ironclads to proceed downstream . After the end of the campaign , Ozark was assigned to the Third District , patrolling the Mississippi River between Morganza , Louisiana and Fort Adams , Mississippi . Following the end of the war , she was decommissioned at Mound City on 24 July 1865 and was sold 29 November . 
 The identity of her purchaser is not known , nor are her activities after her sale , but Ozark was still in service in late 1873 and based at New Orleans . Louisiana governor William Pitt Kellogg used the ship to transport 35 soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment and 25 mounted members of the New Orleans Metropolitan Police to Colfax , Louisiana in October to apprehend the perpetrators of the Colfax Massacre . Due to widespread resistance by local whites , only a few men were arrested and transported to New Orleans by Ozark to stand trial in December . Prosecution witnesses were transported and housed in the ship during the trials in February – March 1874 to protect them from threats made by white supremacists . Nothing further is known about the Ozark 's activities or fate .

 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge . Cambridge made the better start and were clear of Oxford within the first 90 seconds of the race . Despite a lower stroke rate , the Light Blues had extended their lead to three lengths by Hammersmith Bridge . Encountering rough water in Corney Reach , Cambridge slowed and allowed Oxford to gain on them , but as the crews passed under Barnes Bridge into smoother water , the Light Blues reasserted their dominance . They passed the finishing post three lengths ahead in a time of 21 minutes 18 seconds . It was Cambridge 's first victory since the 1876 race , and their seventh in the last ten races , taking the overall record to 18 – 17 in Oxford 's favour . 
 = Anodyne ( album ) = 
 Anodyne is the fourth and final studio album by alternative country band Uncle Tupelo , released on October 5 , 1993 . The recording of the album was preceded by the departure of the original drummer Mike Heidorn and the addition of three new band members : bassist John Stirratt , drummer Ken Coomer , and multi @-@ instrumentalist Max Johnston . The band signed with Sire Records shortly before recording the album ; Anodyne was Uncle Tupelo 's only major label release until 89 / 93 : An Anthology in 2002 . 
 Recorded in Austin , Texas , Anodyne featured a split in songwriting credits between singers Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy , plus a cover version of the Doug Sahm song " Give Back the Key to My Heart " , with Sahm on vocals . The lyrical themes were influenced by country music and — more than their preceding releases — touched on interpersonal relationships . After two promotional tours for the album , tensions between Farrar and Tweedy culminated in the breakup of Uncle Tupelo . Well @-@ received upon its initial release , Anodyne was re @-@ mastered and re @-@ released in 2003 by Rhino Entertainment including five bonus tracks . 
 = = Context = = 
 Uncle Tupelo 's third album , March 16 – 20 , 1992 , was released though Rockville Records on August 3 , 1992 . On the release , the band eschewed the growing popularity of alternative rock by playing acoustic folk and country songs " as a big ' fuck you ' to the rock scene " . Drummer Mike Heidorn had a reduced role on the album ; because it was an acoustic album , Heidorn added only brush @-@ stroke percussion on a few songs . Heidorn wanted to leave the band to spend more time with his wife and two young children . Though band manager Tony Margherita announced that several major labels were interested in signing Uncle Tupelo , Heidorn decided to permanently leave the band . 
 Rockville Records refused to pay Uncle Tupelo any royalties , even though the band 's first two albums , No Depression and Still Feel Gone , sold a combined 40 @,@ 000 copies . Consequently , Margherita was trying to find a new recording deal for the band . On a recommendation by singer Gary Louris of The Jayhawks , talent scout Joe McEwen pursued the band for a contract with Sire Records . McEwen was impressed by how the band was willing to go against trends , calling the band " an alternative to the alternative " . Executing an out @-@ clause in their contract with Rockville , Uncle Tupelo signed a seven @-@ record deal with Sire in 1992 . The deal guaranteed the release of at least two albums , with a $ 150 @,@ 000 budget for the first . 
 Before releasing their first album with Sire , Uncle Tupelo needed a drummer . Farrar and Tweedy interviewed twenty @-@ four candidates and were both impressed with Ken Coomer and Bill Belzer . Belzer was chosen and Uncle Tupelo embarked on the European segment of the promotional tour for March 16 – 20 , 1992 as the opening act for Sugar . Belzer was dismissed from the band after six months , and Coomer was hired as his permanent replacement . Coomer was not the only new member added after the tour — Uncle Tupelo sought to expand beyond a trio for the Anodyne recording sessions . They recruited multi @-@ instrumentalist Max Johnston and bassist John Stirratt — Stirratt 's presence enabled Tweedy to become a full @-@ time guitarist on the songs that he wrote . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Anodyne was recorded from May to June 1993 at Cedar Creek studio in Austin , Texas . Uncle Tupelo liked the studio because it " just seemed really kind of homey and small and cheap " . The album was produced , mixed , and engineered by Brian Paulson . The now @-@ expanded lineup inspired Tweedy to spend more time with his bandmates . After Tweedy wrote each song , he would play it to Stirratt , Coomer , and Johnston to get their opinions . Farrar interpreted these practice sessions as a sign of Tweedy 's increasing arrogance . At live shows , during this time , tensions between Tweedy and Farrar increased and led to verbal altercations . 
 The album was recorded live in the studio , and each song was recorded in only one take . As a result , the recording sessions for Anodyne were completed in two weeks . Anodyne was the only Uncle Tupelo album to completely lack overdubbing . Sire was pleased with the album ; according to McEwen , " everybody [ at the label ] considered it a step up from what they 'd done before . " Farrar wrote six of the songs on the album and Tweedy wrote five , though all the new material was credited to both songwriters . While on tour , Uncle Tupelo met Texas Tornados singer Doug Sahm at the Hotel Phoenix in Boston , Massachusetts . Farrar invited him to join the band in the studio for a cover of Sahm 's " Give Back the Key to My Heart " , which Sahm contributed lead vocals to . 
 The lyrical content of Anodyne was influenced by 1950s and 1960s country music , particularly Ernest Tubb , Buck Owens , and Lefty Frizzell . Tweedy included several songs referencing aspects of the music industry . One example was " Acuff @-@ Rose " , a paean on the music publishers of Acuff @-@ Rose Music . He also wrote " We 've Been Had " , which was intended to chastise bands such as Nirvana and The Clash who were " all just show biz " in his opinion . Tweedy was also the author of " New Madrid " , a song about Iben Browning 's erroneous prediction of an apocalyptic earthquake in New Madrid , Missouri . Farrar was less comfortable discussing the lyrics that he wrote , claiming that his songs frequently change their meanings . Like other Uncle Tupelo albums , Farrar and Tweedy wrote their own lyrics , and played them for each other a week before the recording sessions . In comparison to the rest of the Uncle Tupelo catalog , Coomer described the music of the album as " some of [ the band 's ] earlier crunch with the acoustic subtlety of March 16 – 20 , 1992 " . 
 = = Promotion and reception = = 
 Anodyne was Uncle Tupelo 's only recording to appear on the American Billboard Heatseekers chart . Despite the lack of a single to promote the album , sales eventually surpassed 150 @,@ 000 copies . A promotional tour for the album began later that year , including a sold @-@ out show at Tramps in New York City . Most shows on the tour sold over one thousand tickets . The success of the tour encouraged the label ; according to Sire executive Bill Bentley , " people here thought we were going to have platinum records from Uncle Tupelo . " 
 Despite the label 's aspirations , Jay Farrar announced his intention to leave Uncle Tupelo in January 1994 . Farrar kept his reasoning secret until fall 1995 , when he claimed in an interview that " it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren 't compatible . " As a sign of loyalty to band manager Tony Margherita , who had acquired a three thousand dollar debt on behalf of the band , Farrar agreed to do another promotional tour . Physical altercations between Tweedy and Farrar began two weeks into the tour and continued throughout — many were due to Farrar 's refusal to play on Tweedy 's songs . Despite Farrar 's reservations , Uncle Tupelo performed Tweedy 's " The Long Cut " on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien , the band 's only network television appearance . The band played their final concert on May 1 , 1994 at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis , Missouri . The remaining members of the Anodyne sessions formed Wilco a few weeks later . 
 The band re @-@ mastered and re @-@ released the album on March 11 , 2003 through Rhino Records . The new version included two previously unreleased songs : Farrar 's " Stay True " , Tweedy 's " Wherever " . It also included a cover of Waylon Jennings ' " Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way ? " , with vocals by Joe Ely , a song previously released on the 1993 compilation Trademark of Quality . Live cover versions of " Truck Drivin ' Man " and " Suzy Q " were also included on the re @-@ issue . 
 Anodyne was well received by critics domestically and internationally . Allmusic writer Jason Ankeny wrote , " Uncle Tupelo never struck a finer balance between rock and country than on Anodyne " . Mark Kemp wrote for Rolling Stone that the band " [ has ] an intuitive sense of the simplicity and dynamics of a country song . " German music periodical Spex compared the album to Neil Young and to Little Feat 's debut album . At the end of the year , Anodyne placed at number twenty @-@ eight on The Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop critics ' poll and at number nineteen on the Spex critics ' poll . Nathan Brackett praised Max Johnston 's contributions in the 2004 book The New Rolling Stone Album Guide and called the album " Tupelo 's finest effort . " Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet listed Anodyne in 1999 as one of " The Best Albums of the Century " . In 2008 , Rolling Stone critic Tom Moon listed Anodyne among the 1 @,@ 000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die . 
 Although the majority of the album 's reviews were positive , some critics disagreed . Q 's reviewer gave the album three stars out of five and noted that the band needed to " shed some of the Neil Young obsession . " Tom Moon of Rolling Stone gave the 2003 re @-@ release all five stars , but commented that the bonus tracks there were " pleasant but inconsequential . " Robert Christgau perceived the album as neither a " dud " nor worthy of " honorable mention " .

 = Battle of Assaye = 
 The Battle of Assaye was a major battle of the Second Anglo @-@ Maratha War fought between the Maratha Empire and the British East India Company . It occurred on 23 September 1803 near Assaye in western India where an outnumbered Indian and British force under the command of Major General Arthur Wellesley ( who later became the Duke of Wellington ) defeated a combined Maratha army of Daulat Scindia and the Raja of Berar . The battle was the Duke of Wellington 's first major victory and one he later described as his finest accomplishment on the battlefield . 
 From August 1803 , Wellesley 's army and a separate force under the command of his subordinate Colonel James Stevenson had been pursuing the Maratha cavalry @-@ based army which threatened to raid south into Hyderabad . After several weeks of pursuit and <unk> , Scindia reinforced the combined Maratha army with his modernized infantry and artillery as the British forces closed in on his position . 
 Wellesley received intelligence indicating the location of the Maratha encampment on 21 September and devised a plan whereby his two armies would converge on the Maratha position three days later . Wellesley 's force , however , encountered the Maratha army – which was under the command of Colonel Anthony Pohlmann , a German formerly in British service – 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) farther south than he anticipated . Although outnumbered , Wellesley resolved to attack at once , believing that the Maratha army would soon move off . Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing battle ; Maratha artillery caused large numbers of casualties among Wellesley 's troops but the vast numbers of Maratha cavalry proved largely ineffective . A combination of bayonet and cavalry charges eventually forced the Maratha army to retreat with the loss of most of their guns , but Wellesley 's army was too battered and exhausted to pursue . 
 Wellesley 's victory at Assaye , preceded by the capture of Ahmednagar and followed by victories at <unk> and <unk> , resulted in the defeat of Scindia and Berar 's armies in the Deccan . Wellesley 's progress in the Deccan was matched by Lieutenant General Gerard Lake 's successful campaigns in Northern India and led to the British becoming the dominant power in the heartlands of India . 
 = = Background = = 
 <unk> between the two dominant powers within the Maratha Empire , <unk> Rao Holkar and Daulat Rao Scindia , led to civil war at the turn of the 19th century . The hostilities culminated in the Battle of Poona in October 1802 where Holkar defeated a combined army of Scindia and Baji Rao II – the Peshwa and nominal overlord of the Maratha Empire . Scindia retreated into his dominions to the north , but Baji Rao was driven from his territory and sought refuge with the East India Company at Bassein . He appealed to the Company for assistance , offering to accept its authority if he were restored to his principality at Poona . Lord Mornington , the ambitious Governor @-@ General of British India , seized on the opportunity to extend Company influence into the Maratha Empire which he perceived as the final obstacle to British paramountcy over the Indian subcontinent . The Treaty of Bassein was signed in December 1802 whereby the Company agreed to restore Baji Rao in return for control over his foreign affairs and a garrison of 6 @,@ 000 Company troops permanently stationed in Poona . The restoration was commanded by Lord Mornington ’ s younger brother , Major General Arthur Wellesley , who in March 1803 marched on Poona from Mysore with 15 @,@ 000 Company troops and 9 @,@ 000 Hyderabad allies . Wellesley entered Poona without opposition on 20 April , and Baji Rao was formally restored to his throne on 13 May . 
 The treaty gave offence to the other Maratha leaders , who deemed that the system of subsidiary alliances with the British was an unwarranted interference into their affairs and fatal to the independent Maratha states . The Maratha leaders refused to submit to the Peshwa 's authority and tensions were raised further when Holkar raided into Hyderabad in May , claiming that the Nizam of Hyderabad ( a British ally ) owed him money . Mornington consequently engaged the various Maratha chieftains in negotiations . Lieutenant Colonel John Collins was sent to Scindia 's camp to discuss his objections and propose a defensive alliance . However , Scindia had formed a military alliance with the Rajah of Berar with a view to bringing the Maratha leaders into a coalition against the British , and had begun to mass his forces on the Nizam 's border . Wellesley , who had been given control over the Company 's military and political affairs in central India in June , demanded Scindia declare his intentions and withdraw his forces or face the prospect of war . After a protracted period of negotiations , Collins reported to Wellesley on 3 August that Scindia refused to give an answer and would not withdraw his troops . Wellesley 's response was to declare war on Scindia and Berar " in order to secure the interests of the British government and its allies " . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The East India Company attacked the two principal Maratha forces of Scindia and the Raja of Berar from the north and the south . Of the other Maratha leaders , Holkar was hesitant to enter the war in cooperation with his rival , Scindia , and remained aloof from the hostilities , and the Gaekwad of Baroda placed himself under British protection . Operations in the north were directed by Lieutenant General Gerard Lake who entered Maratha territory from Cawnpore to face Scindia 's main army which was commanded by the French mercenary , Pierre Perron . A second British force under the command of Major General Wellesley confronted a combined army of Scindia and Berar in the Deccan . Wellesley was determined to gain the initiative through offensive action and told his senior subordinate , Colonel James Stevenson , that " a long defensive war would ruin us and will answer no purpose whatever " . 
 The Maratha army in the Deccan was largely composed of fast @-@ moving cavalry able to live off the land . Consequently , Wellesley planned to work in conjunction with a separate force under Colonel Stevenson to enable his slower troops to outmanoeuvre the Maratha army and force it into a position where it could not avoid a pitched battle . Stevenson was despatched from Hyderabad with an army of some 10 @,@ 000 men to <unk> to deny Scindia and Berar the chance to raid east into the Nizam 's territory . In the meantime , Wellesley moved north from his camp near the Godavari River on 8 August with some 13 @,@ 500 troops and headed towards Scindia 's nearest stronghold – the walled town and fort at <unk> . The bulk of his forces were Company troops from Mysore : five sepoy infantry battalions of the Madras Native Infantry and three squadrons of Madras Native Cavalry . A contingent of European troops were supplied by the British Army and included cavalry from the 19th Light Dragoons and two battalions of Scottish infantry from the 74th and 78th Regiment of Foot . Irregular light cavalry were also provided by the Company 's Mysore and Maratha allies . 
 Wellesley reached <unk> later the same day after a 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) march and immediately ordered an escalade assault on the town rather than enter into a time @-@ consuming siege . The walled town , which was garrisoned by 1 @,@ 000 Arab mercenaries , upwards of 60 cannon and one of Scindia ’ s infantry battalions under the command of French officers , was captured with minimal losses after a brief action . The adjacent fort 's defenders capitulated four days later once the walls were breached by British artillery . With the fortification providing a logistics base and point of support for future operations into Maratha territory , Wellesley installed a garrison and headed north towards the Nizam 's city of Aurungabad . Along the way he captured Scindia ’ s other possessions south of the Godavari and established a series of guarded bridges and ferries along the river to maintain his communication and supply lines . 
 = = = Maratha reinforcements = = = 
 The Marathas slipped past Stevenson and advanced on Hyderabad . After receiving reports of their movement on 30 August , Wellesley hurried east down to the Godavari to intercept . Stevenson , meanwhile , marched westwards to the Maratha city of Jalna which he took by storm . Scindia learned of Wellesley 's intentions and returned to a position north of Jalna . Unable to make a clean break from the pursuing British he abandoned plans to raid into Hyderabad and instead assembled his infantry and artillery . The combined Maratha army was around 50 @,@ 000 strong , the core of which was 10 @,@ 800 well equipped regular infantry organised into three brigades , trained and commanded by European adventurer and mercenary officers . Colonel Anthony Pohlmann , a Hanoverian and former East India Company sergeant , commanded the largest brigade with eight battalions . A further brigade with five battalions was provided by Begum <unk> , and was commanded on her behalf by a Frenchman , Colonel Jean <unk> . The third brigade had four battalions and was commanded by Dutchman , Major John James Dupont . In addition , the Maratha force included 10 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 of Berar 's irregular infantry , some 30 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 irregular light cavalry and over 100 guns ranging in size from one to 18 @-@ pounders . 
 After several weeks of chasing down the Maratha army , Wellesley and Stevenson met at <unk> on 21 September and received intelligence that the Maratha army was at Borkardan , around 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the north . They agreed a plan by which their two armies – moving separately along either side of a range of hills with Wellesley to the east and Stevenson to the west – would converge on Borkardan on 24 September . Wellesley 's force reached <unk> on the afternoon of 22 September and departed camp before dawn . By noon , the army had marched 14 miles ( 23 km ) to <unk> , a small town 12 miles ( 19 km ) south of Borkardan , where they intended to rest before joining Stevenson to attack the Maratha army the next day . At this point , Wellesley received further intelligence that rather than being at Borkardan , the Maratha army was camped just 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north , but their cavalry had moved off and the infantry were about to follow . 
 At about 13 : 00 , Wellesley went forward with a cavalry escort to reconnoitre the Maratha position . The rest of his army followed closely behind apart from a battalion of sepoys left at <unk> to guard the baggage . In all , Wellesley had 4 @,@ 500 troops at his disposal plus 5 @,@ 000 Mysore and Maratha horse and 17 cannon . Aware that the British were nearby , the Maratha chiefs had positioned their army in a strong defensive position along a tongue of land stretching east from Borkardan between the Kailna River and its tributary the Juah . However , Scindia and Berar did not believe Wellesley would attack with his small force and had moved off from the area in the morning . Command of their army was given to Pohlmann , who had positioned his infantry to the east of the Maratha camp in the plains around the village of Assaye on the southern bank of the Juah . 
 To his surprise , Wellesley found the entire combined army before him . Nevertheless , he resolved to attack at once , believing that if he waited for Stevenson , the Marathas would have the chance to slip away and force the pursuit to drag on . Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself , and despite his numerical disadvantage , he was confident that the Maratha ’ s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops , and only Scindia ’ s regular infantry could be expected to stand and fight . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Initial manoeuvres = = = 
 Pohlmann struck camp and deployed his infantry battalions in a line facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front . The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar 's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear . The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position . Pohlmann 's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford into the mouth of his cannon , and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind . Wellesley 's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby , but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide . While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages , <unk> and <unk> , one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left . On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages , Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer , Captain John Johnson , who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot . Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann 's left flank . 
 At around 15 : 00 , the British crossed to the northern bank of the Kaitna unopposed apart from a distant harassing fire from the Maratha cannon which was largely inaccurate but succeeded in decapitating Wellesley 's dragoon orderly . Once across , Wellesley ordered his six infantry battalions to form into two lines , with his cavalry as a reserve in a third . His allied Maratha and Mysore cavalry were ordered to remain south of the Kaitna to keep in check a large body of Maratha cavalry which hovered around the British rear . Pohlmann soon recognised Wellesley ’ s intentions and swung his infantry and guns through 90 degrees to establish a new line spread approximately 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) across the isthmus with their right flank on the Kaitna and the left on Assaye . Although the new position secured the Maratha flanks , it restricted Pohlmann from bringing his superior numbers into action . 
 The Maratha redeployment was swifter and more efficient than Wellesley had anticipated and he immediately reacted by extending his front to deny Pohlmann the opportunity to outflank him . A battalion of pickets and the 74th Highlanders , which formed the right of the first and second lines , were ordered to move obliquely to the right . This allowed the 78th to anchor the left flank and Madras infantry battalions ( the 1 / 10th , 1 / 8th , 1 / 4th and 2 / 12th ) to form the centre of the British line . Wellesley 's intention was to force back the Marathas from their guns and then – operating by his left to avoid the heavily defended Assaye – throw them back on the Juah and complete their destruction with his cavalry . 
 = = = British infantry attack = = = 
 The Maratha cannonade intensified as the British redeployed . Although British artillery was brought forward to counter , it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through the weight of shot directed against it . British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns turned their attention to the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister , grape and round shot . Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery . He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed . 
 The Maratha cannonade punched holes in the British line , but the infantry maintained a steady pace , closing up the gaps in their ranks as they advanced . The 78th Highlanders were the first to reach the enemy in the southern sector next to the River Kailna . They paused 50 yards ( 46 m ) from the Maratha gunners and unleashed a volley of musket fire before launching into a bayonet charge . The four battalions of Madras infantry to the right of the 78th , accompanied by the Madras Pioneers , reached Pohlmann 's line shortly afterwards and attacked in the same fashion . The gunners stood by their cannon but were no match for the bayonets of the British and Madras troops who swiftly pressed on towards the Maratha infantry . However , instead of meeting the charge , the Maratha right broke and fled northwards towards the Juah , causing the rest of the southern half of the line to follow . The officers of the Madras battalions temporarily lost control as the sepoys , encouraged by their success , pushed too far in pursuit . Maratha cavalry momentarily threatened to charge but were checked by the 78th who remained in order and re @-@ formed to face the danger . 
 In the northern sector of the battlefield however , Wellesley 's right flank was in turmoil . The commander of the pickets , Lieutenant Colonel William Orrock , had mistaken his orders and continued his oblique path directly towards Assaye . Major Samuel Swinton of the 74th regiment was ordered to support the pickets and followed close behind . This created a large gap in the centre of the British line , and brought the two battalions under a barrage of cannonade from the artillery around the village and the Maratha left . The two battalions began to fall back in disarray and Pohlmann ordered his remaining infantry and cavalry forward to attack . The Marathas gave no quarter ; the pickets were virtually annihilated but the remnants of the 74th were able to form a rough square behind hastily piled bodies of dead . Realising that the destruction of his right would leave his army exposed and outflanked , Wellesley ordered a detachment of British cavalry under Colonel Patrick Maxwell consisting of the 19th Light Dragoons and elements of the 4th and 5th Madras Native Cavalry into action . From their position at the rear , the cavalry dashed directly towards the 74th 's square , crashed into the swarming attackers and routed them . Maxwell pressed his advantage and continued his charge into the Maratha infantry and guns on the left , driving them backwards and across the Juah " with great slaughter " . 
 = = = Culmination = = = 
 A number of Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British advanced over their position re @-@ manned their guns and began to pour cannon fire into the rear of the 74th and Madras infantry . Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re @-@ form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line . Wellesley , meanwhile , galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry , which had been held back in reserve to the east , and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction . The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns and this time it was ensured that all those who remained were dead . 
 While Wellesley was preoccupied with re @-@ taking the gun line , Pohlmann rallied his infantry and redeployed them into a semicircle with their backs to the Juah ; their right flank across the river and their left in Assaye . However , most of the Maratha cannon , which had inflicted heavy losses on Wellesley 's infantry , had been captured or lay abandoned on the battlefield . Reluctant to join the fray , the Maratha cavalry lingered in the distance to the west . Most were <unk> : loosely organised and lightly armed horsemen whose traditional role was to cut down fleeing enemy troops , harass convoy lines and carry out raids into enemy territory . They were not trained to attack well @-@ formed infantry or heavily armed European cavalry , and did not play a further part in the battle . 
 With the remanned Maratha artillery silenced , Wellesley turned his attention to Pohlmann 's reformed infantry . Although Maxwell had suffered heavy losses , he had rallied his cavalry and returned to the field of battle . Wellesley ordered him to charge the Maratha left flank , while the infantry moved forward as a single line to meet the centre and right . The cavalry spurred forward but were met with a volley of canister shot which struck Maxwell , killing him instantly . Their momentum lost , the cavalry did not complete their charge but veered away from the Maratha line at the last moment . The British and Madras infantry marched on against the Maratha position but Pohlmann 's men , their morale low , did not wait for the attack and instead retreated northwards across the Juah . Descriptions differ as to the manner of their departure : Maratha sources claim the line marched away from the battlefield in an orderly manner on Pohlmann 's orders but British accounts claim the Maratha infantry fled in an uncontrolled panic . Berar 's irregulars inside Assaye , now leaderless and having witnessed the fate of the regular infantry , abandoned the village and marched off northwards at around 18 : 00 , followed shortly afterwards by the Maratha cavalry . Wellesley 's troops , however , were exhausted and in no condition to pursue and the native allied cavalry which had remained on the south bank of the Kailna and had not been engaged , refused to pursue without the support of the British and Madras cavalry . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 East India Company and British Army casualties amounted to 428 killed , 1138 wounded and 18 missing ; a total of 1 @,@ 584 – over a third of the force engaged in combat . The 74th and the picket battalion were decimated ; from a strength of about 500 , the 74th lost ten officers killed and seven wounded , and 124 other ranks killed and 270 wounded . The pickets lost all their officers except their commander , Lieutenant Colonel William Orrock , and had only about 75 men remaining . Of the ten officers forming the general 's staff , eight were wounded or had their horses killed . Wellesley himself lost two horses ; the first was shot from underneath him and the second was speared as he led the charge to re @-@ capture the Maratha gun line . The number of Maratha casualties is more difficult to ascertain . Despatches from British officers give a figure of 1 @,@ 200 dead and many more wounded but some modern historians have estimated a total of 6 @,@ 000 dead and wounded . The Marathas also surrendered seven stands of colours , large amounts of stores and ammunition and 98 cannon – most of which were later taken into service by the East India Company . Although Scindia and Berar 's army was not finished as a fighting force , several of Scindia 's regular infantry battalions and artillery crews had been destroyed . Their command structure had also been damaged : many of their European officers , including Colonel Pohlmann and Major Dupont , surrendered to the Company – which had offered amnesty to Europeans in the service of the Maratha armies – or deserted and sought employment with other native chieftains . 
 The sound of the guns at Assaye was heard by Stevenson who immediately broke up his camp 10 miles ( 16 km ) miles to the west in an attempt to join the battle . However , he was misled by his guide and marched first on Borkardan before he reached the battlefield on the evening of 24 September . Suspecting that his guide had intentionally led him astray , Stevenson later had him hanged . He remained with Wellesley to assist with the wounded – troops were still being carried from the battlefield four days after the engagement – until ordered to recommence the pursuit of the Maratha army on 26 September . Wellesley remained to the south while he established a hospital at Ajanta and awaited reinforcements from Poona . Two months later , he combined with Stevenson to rout Scindia and Berar 's demoralised and weakened army at <unk> , and shortly afterwards stormed Berar 's fortress at <unk> . These victories , coupled with Lieutenant General Lake 's successful campaign in the north , induced the two Maratha chiefs to sue for peace . 
 Wellesley later told Stevenson that " I should not like to see again such a loss as I sustained on the 23rd September , even if attended by such a gain " , and in later life he referred to Assaye as " the bloodiest for the numbers that I ever saw " . Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Munro , the Company 's district collector at Mysore , was critical of the high proportion of casualties and questioned Wellesley 's decision not to wait for Stevenson . He wrote to Wellesley : " I am tempted to think that you did it with a view of sharing the glory with the smallest numbers " . In response , Wellesley politely rebuffed Munro 's accusations and defended his action as necessary because he had received and acted upon incorrect intelligence regarding the Maratha position . Assaye was 34 @-@ year @-@ old Wellesley 's first major success and despite his anguish over the heavy losses , it was a battle he always held in the highest estimation . After his retirement from active military service , the Duke of Wellington ( as he later became known ) considered Assaye the finest thing he ever did in the way of fighting even when compared to his later military career . 
 Lord Mornington and his Council lauded the battle as a " most brilliant and important victory " , and presented each of the Madras units and British regiments involved in the engagement with a set of honorary colours . The British regiments and native units were also awarded the Assaye battle honour and most were later given permission to adopt an Assaye elephant as part of their insignia . A public monument was also erected by the East India Company at Fort William , Calcutta to commemorate the victory . The 74th Regiment of foot later became known as the Assaye regiment due to their stand at the battle and their modern @-@ day successors , the Royal Highland Fusiliers ( 2 <unk> ) , still celebrate the anniversary of the battle each year . Of the native infantry battalions , only the Madras Sappers survive in their original form in the Indian Army but they no longer celebrate Assaye as it has been declared a repugnant battle honour by the Government of India .

 Cornwell , Bernard , Sharpe 's Triumph : Richard Sharpe and the Battle of Assaye , September 1803 , HarperCollins , 1998 , ISBN 0 @-@ 00 @-@ <unk> @-@ 4 . The book includes most of the important events of the battle , although mostly focusing on the British forces with Indian regiments generally in the background . Building on the real events , Wellington loses a third horse and is tipped into the enemy ranks where he is saved by Sharpe , who in doing so earns his commission as an officer . The battle is mentioned numerous times throughout the series as a personal achievement for both Sharpe and Wellington ( whose careers progress in parallel ) , and whenever characters from 78th or other highland infantry units appear , as Sharpe feels their actions at Assaye were a testament to their courage and discipline .
