 Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered , there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals . Being the first period 8 element , the undiscovered element ununennium ( element 119 ) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners ; however , it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties . Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium . This is unusual as periodic trends , ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium . This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium 's valence electron , increasing ununennium 's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii ; this effect is already seen for francium . This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal , which , although likely , may not be true due to relativistic effects . The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium 's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium ; indeed , ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it . Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the <unk> of ununennium . On the other hand , ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group , being expected to have a melting point between 0 ° C and 30 ° C. 
 The stabilisation of ununennium 's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240 pm , very close to that of rubidium ( 247 pm ) , so that the chemistry of ununennium in the + 1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium . On the other hand , the ionic radius of the Uue + ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb + , because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p @-@ orbitals of the lower shells . Ununennium may also show the + 3 oxidation state , which is not seen in any other alkali metal , in addition to the + 1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals : this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p3 / 2 spinor , causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected . Indeed , many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character , due to the involvement of the 7p3 / 2 electrons in the bonding . 
 Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium . Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169 , <unk> , under ununennium , Dirac @-@ Fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165 , unhexpentium , which is predicted to have the electron configuration [ Uuo ] <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 8p1 / 22 <unk> . Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium , having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium , and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium , having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium . However , the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron , possibly allowing oxidation states beyond + 1 and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like a boron group element or group 11 element than an alkali metal . Due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being s @-@ block elements , these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( Uhh ) . 
 The probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2015 ; in fact , it is suspected that they may not be able to exist . In periods 8 and above of the periodic table , relativistic and shell @-@ structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate . In addition , the relativistic and shell @-@ structure effects ( which stabilise the s @-@ orbitals and destabilise and expand the d- , f- , and g @-@ orbitals of higher shells ) have opposite effects , causing even larger difference between relativistic and non @-@ relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers . Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from the fact that both elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities , centered at elements 122 ( 306Ubb ) and 164 ( <unk> ) .

 = = = Hydrogen = = = 
 The element hydrogen , with one electron per neutral atom , is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience , but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal ; when it is considered to be an alkali metal , it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties . Under typical conditions , pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule ( H2 ) ; however , the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules ( such as dilithium , <unk> ) at high temperatures , when they are in the gaseous state . 
 Hydrogen , like the alkali metals , has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens but the similarities end there . Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration and not its chemical properties . It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties . 
 The first ionisation energy of hydrogen ( 1312 @.@ 0 kJ / mol ) is much higher than that of the alkali metals . As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom , hydrogen often behaves like a halogen , forming the negative hydride ion , and is sometimes considered to be a halogen . ( The alkali metals can also form negative ions , known as alkalides , but these are little more than laboratory curiosities , being unstable . ) It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties ; while this has been shown to not be the case , under extremely high pressures , such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn , hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal ; in this phase , it is known as metallic hydrogen . The electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal @-@ to @-@ metal transition . 
 The <unk> electron configuration of hydrogen , while superficially similar to that of the alkali metals ( ns1 ) , is unique because there is no 1p subshell . Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H + , or gain one to form the hydride ion H − . In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals ; in the latter case , the halogens , but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well . Group 14 is the best fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionization energy and electron affinity , but none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory . As an example of hydrogen 's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size , the hydrogen ion is very small ( radius around 150 fm compared to the 50 – 220 pm size of most other atoms and ions ) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules . Indeed , transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid @-@ base chemistry . Also unique is hydrogen 's ability to form hydrogen bonds , which are an effect of charge @-@ transfer , electrostatic , and electron correlative contributing phenomena . While analogous lithium bonds are also known , they are mostly electrostatic . Nevertheless , hydrogen can perform the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals , and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals ( especially lithium ) . 
 = = = Ammonium = = = 
 The ammonium ion ( NH + 
 4 ) has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals , acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium , and is often considered a close relative . For example , most alkali metal salts are soluble in water , a property which ammonium salts share . Ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal ( NH + 
 4 ions in a sea of electrons ) at very high pressures ( though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around , 100 GPa ) , and could possibly occur inside the ice giants Uranus and Neptune , which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields . It has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of ammonia and <unk> molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below 25 GPa . 
 = = = Thallium = = = 
 Thallium displays the + 1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display , and thallium compounds with thallium in its + 1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds <unk> due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl + ( 164 pm ) , K + ( 152 pm ) and Ag + ( 129 pm ) ions . It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe ( but not in England ) in the years immediately following its discovery , and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev 's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer 's 1868 periodic table . ( Mendeleev 's 1871 periodic table and Meyer 's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and leave the space below caesium blank . ) However , thallium also displays the oxidation state + 3 , which no known alkali metal displays ( although ununennium , the undiscovered seventh alkali metal , is predicted to possibly display the + 3 oxidation state ) . The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium . While Tl + is stabilized by the inert pair effect , this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically , so that these electrons are <unk> active in aqueous solution . Additionally , the thallium halides ( except <unk> ) are quite insoluble in water , and <unk> has an unusual structure because of the presence of the inert pair in thallium . 
 = = = Copper , silver , and gold = = = 
 The group 11 metals ( or coinage metals ) , copper , silver , and gold , are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d @-@ shells . Physically , they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with post @-@ transition metals . " The filled d subshell and free s electron of Cu , Ag , and Au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity . Transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobility . " Chemically , the group 11 metals behave like main @-@ group metals in their + 1 valence states , and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals : this is one reason for their previously being labelled as " group IB " , paralleling the alkali metals ' " group IA " . They are occasionally classified as post @-@ transition metals . Their spectra are however analogous to those of the alkali metals . 
 In Mendeleev 's 1871 periodic table , copper , silver , and gold are listed twice , once under group VIII ( with the iron triad and platinum group metals ) , and once under group IB . Group IB was nonetheless parenthesized to note that it was tentative . Mendeleev 's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element : on that basis , the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB , due to the existence of Cu ( II ) and Au ( III ) compounds being known at that time . However , eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group ( group VIII was labelled a transition group ) to lack an A – B bifurcation . Soon afterwards , a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry : this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium @-@ long 18 @-@ column periodic table , which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals . 
 The coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group , due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals ( group 1 : <unk> ; group 11 : <unk> ) . However , the similarities are largely confined to the <unk> of the + 1 compounds of both groups , and not their chemical properties . This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell , so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionization energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals . Furthermore , they have higher melting points , <unk> , and densities , and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia , as well as having more covalent character in their compounds . Finally , the alkali metals are at the top of the electrochemical series , whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom . The coinage metals ' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals ' filled p shell , so that the second and third ionization energies are lower , enabling higher oxidation states than + 1 and a richer coordination chemistry , thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character . Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium , in which it forms the auride ion ( Au − ) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution : here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its <unk> configuration has one electron less than the quasi @-@ closed shell <unk> configuration of mercury . 
 = = History = = 
 Sodium compounds have been known since ancient times ; salt ( sodium chloride ) has been an important commodity in human activities , as testified by the English word salary , referring to <unk> , money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt . While potash has been used since ancient times , it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts . Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702 , and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736 . The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds , and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium , was not known then , and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789 . 
 Pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy , who derived it from caustic potash ( KOH , potassium hydroxide ) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile . Previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium 's extreme reactivity . Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis . Later that same year , Davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda ( NaOH , lye ) by a similar technique , demonstrating the elements , and thus the salts , to be different . Later that year , the first pieces of pure molten sodium metal were similarly prepared by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of molten caustic soda ( now called sodium hydroxide ) . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist José Bonifácio de Andrada in a mine on the island of Utö , Sweden . However , it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson , then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius , detected the presence of a new element while analysing petalite ore . This new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium , though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals . Berzelius gave the unknown material the name " <unk> / <unk> " , from the Greek word <unk> ( transliterated as lithos , meaning " stone " ) , to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral , as opposed to potassium , which had been discovered in plant ashes , and sodium , which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood . He named the metal inside the material " lithium " . Lithium , sodium , and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity , as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner in 1850 as having similar properties . 
 Rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope , invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff . The next year , they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim , Germany . Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg , Germany , finding it in the mineral lepidolite . The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra : a bright red line for rubidium ( from the Latin word rubidus , meaning dark red or bright red ) , and a sky @-@ blue line for caesium ( derived from the Latin word <unk> , meaning sky @-@ blue ) . 
 Around 1865 John Newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight ; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music . His version put all the alkali metals then known ( lithium to caesium ) , as well as copper , silver , and thallium ( which show the + 1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals ) , together into a group . His table placed hydrogen with the halogens . 
 After 1869 , Dmitri Mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium , potassium , rubidium , caesium , and thallium . Two years later , Mendeleev revised his table , placing hydrogen in group 1 above lithium , and also moving thallium to the boron group . In this 1871 version , copper , silver , and gold were placed twice , once as part of group IB , and once as part of a " group VIII " encompassing today 's groups 8 to 11 . After the introduction of the 18 @-@ column table , the group IB elements were moved to their current position in the d @-@ block , while alkali metals were left in group IA . Later the group 's name was changed to group 1 in 1988 . The trivial name " alkali metals " comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water . 
 There were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris , France discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium @-@ 227 , which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 keV . However , Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV . Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product , one that was separated during purification , but emerged again out of the pure actinium @-@ 227 . Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium , radium , lead , bismuth , or thallium . The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal ( such as coprecipitating with caesium salts ) , which led Perey to believe that it was element 87 , caused by the alpha decay of actinium @-@ 227 . Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium @-@ 227 . Her first test put the alpha branching at 0 @.@ 6 % , a figure that she later revised to 1 % . It was the last element discovered in nature , rather than by synthesis . 
 The next element below francium ( eka @-@ francium ) is very likely to be ununennium ( Uue ) , element 119 , although this is not completely certain due to relativistic effects . The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium @-@ 254 with calcium @-@ 48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley , California . No atoms were identified , leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb . 
 254 
 <unk> + 48 
 20Ca → 302 
 119Uue * → no atoms 
 It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future , given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of 254Es , which is favoured for production of <unk> elements because of its large mass , relatively long half @-@ life of 270 days , and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms , to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level ; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories . However , given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table , it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions ; indeed , another attempt to synthesise ununennium by bombarding a berkelium target with titanium ions is under way at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt , Germany . Currently , none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet , and it is also possible , due to drip instabilities , that only the lower period 8 elements , up to around element 128 , are physically possible . No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals , such as unhexpentium , due to their extremely high atomic number .

 The Oddo – Harkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers , with the exception of hydrogen . This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another , thus increasing their atomic number . In elements with even atomic numbers , protons are paired , with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other , enhancing stability . All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them ( the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals ) in the Solar System . The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesized in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis . Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesized in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars : the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium , beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons , and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple @-@ alpha process , fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon , and skipping over those three elements . 
 = = = On Earth = = = 
 The Earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun , but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system . In turn , the natural history of the Earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements . The mass of the Earth is approximately 5 @.@ 98 × 1024 kg . It is composed mostly of iron ( 32 @.@ 1 % ) , oxygen ( 30 @.@ 1 % ) , silicon ( 15 @.@ 1 % ) , magnesium ( 13 @.@ 9 % ) , sulfur ( 2 @.@ 9 % ) , nickel ( 1 @.@ 8 % ) , calcium ( 1 @.@ 5 % ) , and aluminium ( 1 @.@ 4 % ) ; with the remaining 1 @.@ 2 % consisting of trace amounts of other elements . Due to mass segregation , the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron ( 88 @.@ 8 % ) , with smaller amounts of nickel ( 5 @.@ 8 % ) , sulfur ( 4 @.@ 5 % ) , and less than 1 % trace elements . 
 The alkali metals , due to their high reactivity , do not occur naturally in pure form in nature . They are <unk> and therefore remain close to the Earth 's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica , forming relatively low @-@ density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth 's core . Potassium , rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radii . 
 Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth , both being among the ten most common elements in Earth 's crust ; sodium makes up approximately 2 @.@ 6 % of the Earth 's crust measured by weight , making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal . Potassium makes up approximately 1 @.@ 5 % of the Earth 's crust and is the seventh most abundant element . Sodium is found in many different minerals , of which the most common is ordinary salt ( sodium chloride ) , which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater . Other solid deposits include halite , amphibole , cryolite , <unk> , and zeolite . Many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating , which still occurs now in places such as Utah 's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea . Despite their near @-@ equal abundance in Earth 's crust , sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean , both because potassium 's larger size makes its salts less soluble , and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium . 
 Despite its chemical similarity , lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size . Due to its relatively low reactivity , it can be found in seawater in large amounts ; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0 @.@ 14 to 0 @.@ 25 parts per million ( ppm ) or 25 micromolar . Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in <unk> minerals , where its crustal concentration is about 18 ppm , comparable to that of gallium and niobium . Commercially , the most important lithium mineral is spodumene , which occurs in large deposits worldwide . 
 Rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper . It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite , pollucite , carnallite , <unk> , and lepidolite , although none of these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals . Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements , such as antimony , cadmium , tin , and tungsten , but is much less abundant than rubidium . 
 Francium @-@ 223 , the only naturally occurring isotope of francium , is the product of the alpha decay of actinium @-@ 227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals . In a given sample of uranium , there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1018 uranium atoms . It has been calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the earth 's crust at any time , due to its extremely short half @-@ life of 22 minutes . 
 = = Production and isolation = = 
 The production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances , such as water . The alkali metals are so reactive that they cannot be displaced by other elements and must be isolated through high @-@ energy methods such as electrolysis . 
 Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs , brine pools , and brine deposits . The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride . 
 Potassium occurs in many minerals , such as sylvite ( potassium chloride ) . It is occasionally produced through separating the potassium from the chlorine in potassium chloride , but is more often produced through electrolysis of potassium hydroxide , found extensively in places such as Canada , Russia , Belarus , Germany , Israel , United States , and Jordan , in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s . It can also be produced from seawater . Sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed , but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700 ° C through the use of a Downs cell . Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide . 
 For several years in the 1950s and 1960s , a by @-@ product of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium . Alkarb contained 21 % rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium . Today the largest producers of caesium , for example the Tanco Mine , Manitoba , Canada , produce rubidium as by @-@ product from pollucite . Today , a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum ( Cs , Rb ) Al ( SO4 ) 2 · 12H2O , which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 different reactions . The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year . Caesium , however , is not produced from the above reaction . Instead , the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium , extracted from the ore mainly by three methods : acid digestion , alkaline decomposition , and direct reduction . Both metals are produced as by @-@ products of lithium production : after 1958 , when interest in lithium 's thermonuclear properties increased sharply , the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly . 
 Francium @-@ 223 , the only naturally occurring isotope of francium , is produced naturally as the product of the alpha decay of actinium @-@ 227 . Francium can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals ; it has been calculated that at most there are 30 g of francium in the earth 's crust at any given time . As a result of its extreme rarity in nature , most francium is synthesized in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n , yielding francium @-@ 209 , francium @-@ 210 , and francium @-@ 211 . The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300 @,@ 000 neutral atoms , which were synthesized using the nuclear reaction given above . 
 From their silicate ores , all the alkali metals may be obtained the same way : sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium ( III ) ions from the ore ( leaching ) , whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide . The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively ; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid . The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated through electrolysis . 
 Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides , with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture . The heavier alkali metals , however , is more typically isolated in a different way , where a reducing agent ( typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals ) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride . The liquid or gaseous product ( the alkali metal ) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Lithium , sodium , and potassium have many applications , while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet . Lithium is often used in batteries , and lithium oxide can help process silica . Lithium can also be used to make lubricating greases , air treatment , and aluminium production . 
 Pure sodium has many applications , including use in sodium @-@ vapour lamps , which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting , and can help smooth the surface of other metals . Being a strong reducing agent , it is often used to reduce many other metals , such as titanium and zirconium , from their chlorides . Sodium compounds have many applications as well , the most well @-@ known being table salt . Sodium is also used in soap as salts of fatty acids . 
 Potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition . Potassium hydroxide is a very strong base , and is used to control the pH of various substances . 
 Rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks . Caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate ; if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs , it would be off by less than four seconds ( after 80 million years ) . For that reason , caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second . Rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks , and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry . 
 Francium has no commercial applications , but because of francium 's relatively simple atomic structure , among other things , it has been used in spectroscopy experiments , leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles . Studies on the light emitted by laser @-@ trapped francium @-@ 210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels , similar to those predicted by quantum theory . 
 = = Biological role and precautions = = 
 The bioinorganic chemistry of the alkali metal ions has been extensively reviewed . Solid state crystal structures have been <unk> for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides , nucleic acid constituents , carbohydrates and <unk> complexes . 
 Lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role , but does have effects on the body when ingested . Lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder ( manic @-@ depression ) in daily doses of about 0 @.@ 5 to 2 grams , although there are side @-@ effects . Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness , slurred speech and vomiting , among other symptoms , and poisons the central nervous system , which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage . Its biochemistry , the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element , although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified . 
 Sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems , generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells . Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume , blood pressure , osmotic equilibrium and pH ; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day . Sodium chloride ( also known as common salt ) is the principal source of sodium in the diet , and is used as seasoning and preservative , such as for pickling and jerky ; most of it comes from processed foods . The DRI for sodium is 1 @.@ 5 grams per day , but most people in the United States consume more than 2 @.@ 3 grams per day , the minimum amount that promotes hypertension ; this in turn causes 7 @.@ 6 million premature deaths worldwide . 
 Potassium is the major cation ( positive ion ) inside animal cells , while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells . The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells , known as the membrane potential . The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane . The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential — a " spike " of electrical discharge . The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission , muscle contraction , and heart function . 
 Rubidium has no known biological role , but may help stimulate metabolism , and , similarly to caesium , replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency . Caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people , but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic because of chemical similarity of caesium to potassium , allowing the caesium to replace the potassium in the body , causing potassium deficiency . Exposure to large amounts of caesium compounds can cause <unk> and spasms , but as such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources , caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant . The median lethal dose ( LD50 ) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2 @.@ 3 g per kilogram , which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride . Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy , but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients , on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment . Radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions : the improper handling of caesium @-@ 137 gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries . Perhaps the best @-@ known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987 , in which an improperly @-@ disposed @-@ of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of Goiânia , Brazil , was scavenged from a junkyard , and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious , uneducated buyers . This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure . Together with caesium @-@ 134 , iodine @-@ 131 , and strontium @-@ 90 , caesium @-@ 137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health . 
 Francium has no biological role and is most likely to be toxic due to its extreme radioactivity , causing radiation poisoning , but since the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300 @,@ 000 neutral atoms , it is unlikely that most people will ever encounter francium . 
 = HMS Emerald ( 1795 ) = 
 HMS Emerald was a 36 @-@ gun Amazon @-@ class frigate that Sir William Rule designed in 1794 for the Royal Navy . The Admiralty ordered her construction towards the end of May 1794 and work began the following month at Northfleet dockyard . She was completed on 12 October 1795 and then sailed to the Mediterranean to join the fleet under Admiral John Jervis . 
 In 1797 , Emerald was one of several vessels sent to hunt down and capture the crippled <unk> Trinidad , which had managed to escape from the British victory at the Battle of Cape St Vincent . Emerald was supposed to have been present at the Battle of the Nile but in May 1798 a storm separated her from Horatio Nelson 's squadron and she arrived in Aboukir Bay nine days too late . She was part of Rear @-@ Admiral John Thomas Duckworth 's squadron during the Action of 7 April 1800 , off Cadiz . 
 Emerald served in the Caribbean throughout 1803 in Samuel Hood 's fleet , and took part in the invasion of St Lucia in July , then Surinam the following spring . Returning to home waters for repairs in 1806 , she served in the western approaches before joining a fleet under Admiral James Gambier in 1809 , and taking part in the Battle of the Basque Roads . In November 1811 she sailed to Portsmouth where she was laid up in ordinary . Fitted out as a receiving ship in 1822 , she was eventually broken up in January 1836 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Emerald was one of four Amazon @-@ class frigates built to William Rule 's design . She and her sister ship , Amazon , were ordered on 24 May 1794 and were both built to the same dimensions : 143 feet 2 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 43 @.@ 6 m ) along the gun deck , 119 feet 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 36 @.@ 4 m ) at the keel , with a beam of 38 feet 4 inches ( 11 @.@ 7 m ) and a depth in the hold of 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) . They were of 933 67 ⁄ 94 tons ( bm ) . 
 Emerald 's initial build was completed at Thomas Pitcher 's dockyard in Northfleet at a cost of £ 14 @,@ 419 and she was launched on 31 July 1795 , twenty @-@ seven days after Amazon . After launching , Emerald was immediately taken up @-@ river to Woolwich to receive coppering , which finished 12 October 1795 . She was later fitted @-@ out at a further cost of £ 9 @,@ 390 . A second pair of Amazon @-@ class ships were ordered on 24 January 1795 . They were marginally smaller at 925 87 ⁄ 94 tons ( bm ) and were built from pitch pine .

 Emerald was first commissioned in August 1795 , under <unk> Cornewall Berkeley and in January 1797 , she sailed for the Mediterranean . Although attached to Admiral John Jervis ' fleet at the time , Emerald did not take part in the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February , but was instead anchored in nearby Lagos Bay with other vessels . 
 On 16 February , the victorious British fleet and its prize ships entered the bay . Jervis ordered the three frigates , Emerald , Minerve , and Niger , of 40 and 32 guns respectively , to search for the disabled flagship , <unk> Trinidad ; previously seen being towed from the battle . Two smaller craft ; Bonne @-@ Citoyenne , a corvette of 20 guns , and the 14 @-@ gun sloop Raven , joined the three frigates . The British squadron on 20 February sighted Santissima Trinidad under tow by a large frigate and in the company of a brig , but Berkeley , considering his small squadron insufficient , declined to engage ; eventually the Spanish ships sailed from sight . The 32 @-@ gun HMS Terpsichore , whilst cruising alone , later located Santissima Trinidad and engaged her but the out @-@ gunned British frigate was forced to abandon her attack .

 Following the Battle of Cape St Vincent , the British pursued the remainder of the Spanish fleet to Cadiz , where Jervis began a long @-@ running blockade of the port . On 26 April , whilst cruising in the company of the 74 @-@ gun Irresistible , Emerald helped capture a 34 @-@ gun Spanish ship and destroy another . The two Spanish vessels were sailing close to the coast when , at around 06 : 00 , Jervis 's fleet sighted them . Jervis sent Emerald and Irresistible , under Captain George Martin , to investigate . The British discovered the ships to be the frigates Santa Elena and Ninfa . They had been carrying silver from Havana to Cadiz , but had transferred their cargo the previous night to a fishing boat that had warned them of the proximity of the British fleet . 
 Aware that the British were pursuing them , the two Spanish ships sought shelter just north of Trafalgar in Conil Bay , the entrance to which was protected by a large rocky ledge . Irresistible and Emerald successfully negotiated this obstacle at around 14 : 30 and engaged the Spanish anchored in the Bay . 
 The Spanish ships surrendered at approximately 16 : 00 . Eighteen Spaniards were killed and thirty wounded during in the fighting , with the British suffering one killed and one wounded . The remaining crew of Santa Elena avoided capture by cutting their vessel 's cables and drifting her on shore so they could flee on foot . The British subsequently managed to drag Santa Elena back off the beach , but she was badly damaged and sank at sea . 
 The British took Ninfa into service as HMS <unk> , a 36 @-@ gun frigate with a main battery of 12 @-@ pounders . The British were unable to retrieve the cargo of silver , which later arrived safely in Cadiz . 
 = = = = Second bombardment of Cadiz = = = = 
 Captain Thomas Waller took command of Emerald in mid @-@ 1797 , and was stationed with Admiral Jervis ' fleet off Cadiz . On 3 July Jervis attempted to bring the protracted blockade to an end by ordering a bombardment of the town . The action resulted in the capture of two Spanish mortar boats but achieved little else . 
 A second bombardment was decided upon and on the night of 5 July , Emerald , in the company of Terpsichore and the 74 @-@ gun Theseus , provided an escort and protection for three bomb vessels , Thunder , Terror , and <unk> . This second attack caused much damage , and the next morning , the Spanish hurriedly moved ten of their line @-@ of @-@ battle ships out of range . A third bombardment , planned for 8 July , was cancelled when the weather became unfavourable . 
 = = = = Attack on Santa Cruz = = = = 
 Later , in July 1797 , Emerald took part in the unsuccessful attack on Santa Cruz . A planned attack in April , proposed by Admiral Nelson , had been aborted as the troops required to execute it were unavailable . When Jervis was subsequently advised that the Spanish treasure fleet was anchored there , he revived Nelson 's idea . 
 For the new attack , the plan was for Nelson to take three ships of the line , three frigates , including Emerald , and 200 marines , for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold . The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north @-@ east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town . However , a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack . Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July ; although the British were able to land troops , Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal . 
 After the attack , Nelson sent Emerald with his report to Jervis , who in turn sent her on to England with dispatches . Waller arrived at the Admiralty on 1 September , with the news of the failed attacks . 
 = = = = Alexandria = = = = 
 While serving with Jervis on the Lisbon station in December 1797 , Emerald , under the temporary command of Lord William Proby , captured the 8 @-@ gun privateer , Chasseur Basque . 
 In May 1798 , Jervis dispatched a squadron of five ships , including Emerald and commanded by Nelson in the 74 @-@ gun Vanguard , to locate a large invasion fleet that had left Toulon . After receiving intelligence on 22 May , Nelson correctly guessed the French fleet 's destination and set course for Alexandria . Emerald , having previously become separated from the rest of the squadron in a storm on 21 May ; arrived at Aboukir Bay on 12 August having missed the Battle of the Nile , which occurred between 1 @-@ 3 August 1798 . 
 When Nelson left for Naples on 19 August 1798 , he left behind a squadron under Samuel Hood to patrol the waters around the port and along the coast . The squadron comprised three <unk> Zealous , Goliath , Swiftsure , three frigates Emerald , Seahorse , and Alcmene , and the corvette Bonne Citoyenne . On 2 September the squadron encountered and destroyed the French aviso <unk> . 
 Emerald and Seahorse chased Anemone inshore where she anchored in the shallow water , out of reach of the two British frigates . When the frigates launched their boats to cut @-@ out <unk> , she cut her anchor cable and drifted on to the shore . As the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast , unfriendly Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes , shooting those who resisted . A heavy surf prevented the boats that the British had lowered from landing , but a midshipman from Emerald , the young Francis Fane , swam ashore with a line and empty cask in order to rescue the commander and seven others who had escaped naked to the beach . <unk> had a crew of 60 men under the command of Enseigne de Vaisseau ( Ensign ) <unk> , and was also carrying General Camin and <unk> Valette , Aide @-@ de @-@ Camp to General Napoleon Bonaparte , with dispatches from Toulon . Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed . Emerald remained stationed off Alexandria for the rest of the year . 
 = = = = Action on 18 June 1799 = = = = 
 By the beginning of 1799 , Emerald was back under the command of Captain Waller . While cruising with HMS Minerve on 2 June , they took Caroline , a 16 @-@ gun French privateer , off the south @-@ east coast of Sardinia . Later Emerald assisted in the capture of Junon , Alceste , Courageuse , <unk> , and Alerte in the Action of 18 June 1799 . The British fleet under George Elphinstone was some 69 miles off Cape <unk> when three French frigates and two brigs were spotted . Elphinstone engaged them with three seventy @-@ fours , Centaur , Bellona and Captain , and two frigates , Emerald and Santa Teresa . The next evening , after a 28 @-@ hour chase , the French ships were forced into an action . The French squadron had become fragmented , enabling the British to attack it piecemeal . Bellona fired the first shots at 19 : 00 as she , Captain , and the two frigates closed with Junon and Alceste , both of which struck their colours immediately . Bellona then joined Centaur in chasing Courageuse . Faced with the might of two seventy @-@ fours , Courageuse also surrendered . Emerald then overhauled <unk> , and Captain took Alerte at around 23 : 30 .

 Emerald returned to blockade duty at Cadiz in April 1800 ; part of a squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral John Thomas Duckworth which included the 74 @-@ gun ships Leviathan and Swiftsure , and the fireship Incendiary . The squadron sighted a Spanish convoy on 5 April , which comprised thirteen merchant vessels and three accompanying frigates , and at once gave chase . At 03 : 00 the following day Emerald managed to overhaul and cross the bow of a 10 @-@ gun merchantman , which immediately surrendered . By daybreak the remainder of the Spanish convoy had scattered and the only ship visible was a 14 @-@ gun brig , Los <unk> . A lack of wind prevented the British vessels from approaching her . Instead , Leviathan and Emerald lowered boats that rowed towards the brig , which they captured after a short exchange of fire . 
 Other sails were now spotted in the east , west and south , forcing the British to divide their force : Swiftsure went south , Emerald east , and Leviathan west . At midday , Emerald signalled that there were six vessels to the north @-@ east , and Leviathan wore round to pursue . By dusk the two British ships had nine Spanish craft in sight . Three ships were seen at midnight to the north @-@ north @-@ west , and by 02 : 00 the following morning , two had been identified as the enemy frigates Carmen and <unk> . Duckworth ordered Emerald to take a parallel course to the enemy frigates in anticipation of a dawn attack , and at first light , the British closed with their opponents . 
 The Spaniards had assumed the approaching vessels were part of their convoy , but by daybreak they had realised their error and vainly set more sail to escape . Being close enough to hail the Spanish crews , Duckworth ordered that they surrender . When the Spaniards ignored the demand he ordered Leviathan and Emerald to open fire on the rigging of the Spanish vessels in order to disable them . Shortly afterward , both Spanish frigates surrendered . Carmen had had 11 men killed and 16 wounded ; <unk> 12 killed and 10 wounded , including her first and second captains . The two Spanish frigates were each carrying 1500 <unk> of mercury . 
 A third frigate was visible on the horizon . Emerald immediately set off in pursuit but was recalled by Duckworth and instead ordered to locate the merchant ships . This she did , securing four of the largest vessels before nightfall . Leviathan was delayed in returning to action by the need to make the two captured frigates ready to sail , and by the time this was completed the third frigate had made her escape . Leviathan then returned to rendezvous with Emerald , managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell . The following day , both British vessels sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes . On arrival they encountered Incendiary , which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own . In all , the small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates . 
 = = = Caribbean service = = = 
 Attached to Samuel Hood 's squadron in the Leeward Islands in June 1803 , Emerald was under the command of Captain James O 'Bryen . Prior to the British invasion of St Lucia on 21 June , she was employed in the disruption of supplies to the island through the harassment of enemy shipping . The invasion force left Barbados on 20 June ; it comprised Hood 's 74 @-@ gun flagship Centaur , the 74 @-@ gun Courageux , the frigates Argo and Chichester , and the sloops Hornet and Cyane . The following morning Emerald and the 18 @-@ gun sloop Osprey had joined them . By 11 : 00 , the squadron was anchored in Choc Bay . The troops were all landed by 17 : 00 and half an hour later the town of Castries was in British hands . The French troops in the island 's main fortress , Morne @-@ Fortunée , refused to surrender . The British stormed it at 04 : 00 on 22 June , and by 04 : 30 the battle for St Lucia had been won . Following this easy victory , the British sent a force to Tobago , which capitulated on 1 July . 
 Emerald was between St Lucia and Martinique on 24 June , when she captured the 16 @-@ gun French privateer , Enfant Prodigue after a 72 @-@ hour chase . The French vessel was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Victor <unk> and was carrying dispatches for Martinique . The Royal Navy took Enfant Prodigue into service as HMS St Lucia . 
 Then on 10 August , whilst in the company of the 22 @-@ gun brig HMS Heureux , Emerald intercepted and captured a Dutch merchant vessel travelling between Surinam and Amsterdam . On 5 September she captured two French schooners , then later that month took part in attacks on Berbice , Essequibo and <unk> .

 Emerald 's first lieutenant , Thomas Forest , commanded the 6 @-@ gun cutter Fort Diamond on 13 March 1804 when , with thirty of Emerald 's crew aboard , she captured a French privateer off Saint @-@ Pierre , Martinique . Contrary wind prevented the privateer , Mosambique , from entering St Pierre and she had sought shelter beneath the batteries at <unk> . Because Emerald was too far downwind , Captain O 'Bryen used boats and crew from Emerald to create a diversion and draw fire from the battery while Fort Diamond approached from the opposite direction , rounded Pearl Rock ( some two miles off the coast ) , and bore down on Mosambique . Forest put the cutter alongside with such force that a chain securing the privateer to the shore snapped . The 60 @-@ man French crew abandoned their vessel and swam ashore . The Royal Navy took Mosambique into service . 
 = = = = Capture of Surinam = = = = 
 In the spring of 1804 , Emerald and her crew took part in an invasion of Surinam . The invasion force consisted of Hood 's flagship Centaur , Emerald , the 44 @-@ gun heavy frigates Pandour and Serapis , the 28 @-@ gun sixth @-@ rate Alligator , the 12 @-@ gun schooner Unique , the 12 @-@ gun corvette Hippomenes , and the 8 @-@ gun Drake , together with 2 @,@ 000 troops under Brigadier @-@ General Sir Charles Green . The force arrived from Barbados on 25 April after a twenty @-@ two @-@ day journey . The sloop Hippomenes , a transport and a further three armed vessels ; landed Brigadier @-@ General Frederick Maitland and 700 troops at <unk> Creek on the night of 30 April . The following night , O 'Bryen was ordered to assist Brigadier @-@ general Hughes in the taking of Braam 's Point . A sandbar initially prevented Emerald from entering the Surinam River but O 'Bryen forced her across on the rising tide , with Pandour and Drake following . Anchoring close by , the three British ships quickly put the Dutch battery of 18 @-@ pounders out of action and captured the fort without loss of life . 
 Emerald , Pandour , and Drake then pushed up the river , sometimes in less water than the frigates drew , until on 5 May they arrived close to the forts Leyden and Frederici . The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away , which marching under the cover of the forests and swamps , launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts . By this time most of the squadron had managed to work its way up the river as far as Frederici , Maitland was advancing along the <unk> River , and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam , the Batavian commandant , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel <unk> , duly surrendered . 
 The vessel Augusta , which was under American colours , was captured by Emerald on 22 August and sent into Antigua with her cargo of wine , which she had been carrying from Leghorn to Guadeloupe . Emerald left Tortola on 26 October as escort to a convoy of 50 vessels for England . However , on 11 December , she put into Madeira in distress . 
 = = = Service on the Home Station = = = 
 Between February and June 1806 , Emerald underwent repairs at Deptford dockyard before being recommissioned under Captain John <unk> . The appointment was however short @-@ lived as Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland assumed command in the first quarter of 1807 . 
 While in the Basque Roads in April 1807 , Emerald captured the 14 @-@ gun privateer Austerlitz . Austerlitz was a brig from Nantes under the command of Captain Gatien Lafont , with a crew of 96 men . Emerald was escorting a Spanish polacca that she had previously taken when on the morning of 14 April she spotted the privateer , which she subsequently captured after a ten @-@ hour chase . Austerlitz had been out of port two days but had made no captures ; the polacca was the Spanish ship Prince of Asturias , which had sailed from La <unk> with a cargo of cocoa , bark and indigo . Emerald sent both prizes into Plymouth , where they arrived on 22 April . Emerald herself set off in pursuit of another vessel from La <unk> . 
 Zulema , Howard , master , arrived in Plymouth on 4 May . She had been sailing from Philadelphia to Liverpool when a French privateer had captured and plundered her before Emerald recaptured her . Then in early December Emerald detained Young Elias and sent her into Plymouth . Young Elias , <unk> , master , had been sailing from Philadelphia to Bordeaux . Towards the end of the month , on the 26th , Emerald sent into Plymouth Friendship , Seaton , master , which had been sailing from France . 
 = = = = Apropos = = = = 
 Emerald 's boats participated in a cutting @-@ out expedition in <unk> harbour on 13 March 1808 . Whilst cruising inshore at around 17 : 00 , Emerald spotted a large French schooner , the Apropos of 250 tons ( bm ) , anchored in the bay . Apropos was armed with twelve 8 @-@ <unk> , though pierced for 16 , and had a crew of more than 70 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau <unk> . 
 Although it was late in the day and despite the crew of the schooner and the men manning the harbour 's two batteries having seen Emerald , Maitland made plans to capture or destroy the schooner . Maitland soon discovered it was not possible to place Emerald so as to simultaneously engage both enemy batteries simultaneously , and instead sent landing parties to silence the guns , which had been firing on his ship since 17 : 30 . The first landing party , led by Lieutenant Bertram and accompanied by two marine lieutenants and two master mates , succeeded in storming the outer fort . Maitland then positioned Emerald close to the second battery while a boat under the command of his third lieutenant , Smith , made its landing about a mile distant along the shore . This second landing party encountered Spanish soldiers , but drove them off and then pursued them inland . By the time Smith 's party returned to the beach Emerald had already silenced the battery . In the darkness , Smith subsequently failed to locate the fort . 
 The crew of the schooner had run their vessel ashore soon after Emerald had entered the harbour . The harbour batteries having been destroyed , Captain Maitland sent a further force under Midshipman Baird to secure and refloat the French ship . The original landing party under Lieutenant Bertram , which had already encountered and dispersed sixty members of the schooner 's crew , met Baird 's party on the beach . The British then made several unsuccessful attempts to re @-@ float the schooner before being forced to set her afire and depart . British casualties were heavy . Emerald had nine men killed , and 16 wounded , including Lieutenant Bertram . Maitland estimated that French casualties too had been heavy . 
 = = = = Back in the Basque Roads = = = = 
 A French schooner <unk> arrived in Plymouth on 15 December 1808 having previously been captured and sent in by Emerald . Back in the Basque Roads on 23 February 1809 , Emerald was this time part of a squadron under Robert Stopford . Stopford 's flagship , the 80 @-@ gun Caesar was also accompanied by the seventy @-@ fours Defiance and Donegal , and the 36 @-@ gun frigates Amethyst and Naiad . At 20 : 00 , while anchored off the <unk> Lighthouse , to the north @-@ west of Ile d <unk> , the sighting of several rockets prompted Stopford to take his squadron and investigate . About an hour later , sails were seen to the east which the British followed until daylight the following morning . The sails turned out to be those of a French squadron which Stopford deduced to be out of Brest and which heaved to in the <unk> d <unk> . 
 The French force comprised eight ships of the line and two frigates , and Stopford immediately sent Naiad to apprise Admiral James Gambier of the situation . Naiad had not gone too far however when she signalled that there were three other vessels to the north @-@ west . Stopford ordered Amethyst and Emerald to remain while he and the rest of the squadron set off in pursuit . A British frigate , Amelia and a sloop , Doterel , also joined the chase . Caeser , Donegal , Defiance , and Amelia eventually drove the three French frigates ashore and destroying them . 
 Emerald and Amethyst had more success in the spring of 1809 when , on 23 March they captured the brigs Caroline and Serpent . Then in April Emerald assisted Amethyst in the chase of a large 44 @-@ gun frigate off Ushant . Emerald sighted Niemen , with a main battery of 18 @-@ pounders and under the command of Captain <unk> , at 11 : 00 on 5 April and immediately signalled Amethyst for assistance . Amethyst caught a glimpse of the French forty @-@ four just as she turned away to the south @-@ east and gave chase but by 19 : 20 had lost sight of both Niemen and Emerald . Amethyst fell in with Niemen again at around 21 : 30 and engaged her . Niemen was forced to strike when a second British frigate , Arethusa came into view and fired her broadside . The Royal Navy took Niemen into service under her existing name . 
 On 26 March , Enfant de Patria arrived at Plymouth . Patria , of 500 tons ( bm ) , 10 guns , and 60 men , had sailed from France for Île de France when Emerald and Amethyst captured her . Two days later Emerald captured a second letter of marque , the 4 @-@ gun Aventurier , bound for the relief of Guadeloupe . She had a crew of 30 men . 
 = = = = Battle of the Basque Roads = = = = 
 Emerald was part of the fleet under Admiral James Gambier that fought the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809 . The French ships were anchored under the protection of the powerful batteries on the Isle d 'Aix when on 11 April Lord Cochrane led an attacking force of fireships and explosive vessels . At this time , Emerald was employed in a passive role , providing a diversion to the east of the island with the brigs Beagle , Doterel , Conflict , and Growler . The fireships met with only partial success ; the French , having anticipated such an attack , had rigged a boom across the channel . One of the explosive vessels breached the boom , leading the French to cut their cables and drift on to the shoals . 
 The following day , after much delay , Gambier took the rest of his fleet into the Basque Roads . The British ships anchored , with springs , in a crescent around the stranded French , and exchanged fire . Emerald took up position ahead of Indefatigable and behind Aigle and Unicorn , and directed her fire mainly towards the French ships of the line , <unk> and Aquilon , both of which struck at around 17 : 30 . 
 At 20 : 00 , Emerald , along with the other British frigates and brigs , weighed and anchored with the 74 @-@ gun HMS Revenge in the <unk> passage to the south of <unk> whilst a second fireship attack was under preparation . By the time the fireships were ready in the early hours on the 13th , contrary winds prevented their deployment . The British therefore contented themselves with setting <unk> and Aquilon alight just after 03 : 00 , on the orders of Captain John Bligh , after having removed their crews in boats . Emerald , and the other vessels moored with her , were recalled at 05 : 00 but due to the lack of water , only the brigs were able to pass further up the river . Emerald therefore took no further part in the attack , which continued until 29 April when the last French ship was able to free herself from the mud and escape up the river to Rochefort .

 Two French sloops ; Deux Freres and Balance were taken by Emerald in July 1809 . Deux Freres arrived at Plymouth on 26 July . She had had left Rochelle for Guadeloupe when Emerald captured her . A week later Emerald captured the French schooner Balance , which had been sailing to France from Guadeloupe . These may have been the two letters of marque that she captured . The first , of four guns , was carrying a small reinforcement for Guadeloupe 's garrison . The second , also of four guns , had a crew of 26 men . She was carrying a cargo of coffee and other colonial produce . 
 While off the coast of Ireland , on 8 October , Emerald rescued a British brig consequent on capturing Incomparable , an 8 @-@ gun French privateer . The Frenchman was about to take the British vessel when Emerald intervened . Incomparable had a crew of 63 men and was four days out of Saint @-@ Malo , but had not yet captured any other vessel . Then on 6 November , still in Irish waters , Emerald took the 16 @-@ gun French brig Fanfaron , two days out of Brest and bound for Guadeloupe . After an all @-@ night chase , Emerald approached . Capitaine de <unk> Croquet Deschateurs of Fanfaron resisted , firing several broadsides and a final double @-@ shotted broadside at Emerald as she caught up . Unable to escape , Deschateurs prepared to board Emerald . However , Emerald evaded the <unk> and fired a broadside that dismasted Fanfaron . Deschateurs had no option but to strike . The subsequent court @-@ martial not only absolved Deschateurs of any liability for the loss of his vessel but commended him for his conduct . Four days later Emerald arrived at Cork with Fanfaron and Luna . Fanfaron , with a crew of 113 , had been carrying a cargo of flour , salt , and other provisions , as well as iron , lead , and nails , all for Guadeloupe . 
 At the beginning of February 1810 , Emerald captured Commerce , Hanson , master , which had been sailing from <unk> to Bordeaux . Emerald sent Commerce into Plymouth . Then on 22 March , Emerald captured the 350 @-@ ton ( bm ) Belle Etoile in the Bay of Biscay . Caught after a twelve @-@ hour chase during which she jettisoned much of her cargo ; Belle Etoile , out of Bayonne , was pierced for 20 guns but only carried eight . Carrying a cargo of wine , flour , oil , and other merchandise to Île de France , she was sent into Cork with her 56 man crew . Emerald captured an American ship , Wasp , in July 1810 . Wasp was carrying 91 passengers from New York to Bordeaux ; they arrived at Plymouth on 30 July . 
 Emerald was still serving on the Home Station on 11 April 1811 when she sent into Cork a French privateer . This was the 18 @-@ gun Auguste ( or Augusta ) , which had been taken on 6 April . Almost a month later , on 5 July , Emerald convoyed the outward bound East Indiamen Minerva , <unk> , William Pitt , Lord Forbes , and Lady Lushington from Madeira , where they had arrived three days earlier . Thirteen days later Emerald was in company with 13 outward bound East Indiamen and all were reported well at 3 ° 2 ′ N 24 ° 0 ′ W , in the middle of the South Atlantic .

The album 's songs were written by Guzmán and Argentinian musician José Luis Pagán . The singer stated that the album " reflects maturity and growth that has also regains my rock essence since I was pigeonholed as a balladeer but not at all , that is what I am . " A + No Poder is Guzmán 's first studio album since <unk> ( 2009 ) , a critically acclaimed effort that was commercial unsuccessful due to lack of promotion , according to Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo .

 A + No Poder is dedicated to Guzmán 's daughter Frida Sofia . The album includes twelve tracks : eleven written by Guzmán and Pagán , with additional writers for three of them . " Adiós " was co @-@ written by Carlos <unk> Reyes , " Esta Noche " was co @-@ written by <unk> and Reyli Barba , and " A Más No Poder " was co @-@ written Sarah Lenore . Another track , " Una Canción de Amor " , was entirely written by Argentinean singer @-@ songwriter Alejandro Lerner . " Adiós " features Puerto @-@ Rican reggaeton performer Farruko . " Te <unk> " is a ballad , and " <unk> " , a story about a femme fatale , has country music undertones with a harmonica that resembles Mexican band El Tri . " <unk> " and " This is Too Much Rock and Roll " are rock songs , with the latter reminds of Soy , an album released by the singer in 2001 . " Esta Noche " is a pop / funk track with reggae influences . " A Más No Poder " has sexual connotations in its lyrics and as stated by Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo , " brings back memories when Guzmán was produced by Miguel Blasco in the 90 's " . " Mi <unk> " is a pop / rock song , while " No Puedo <unk> " is a heavy metal track . " Qué Ironía " is a rock ballad that recalls Guzmán greatest hits such as " Mi <unk> Error " . About the songs included , Guzmán stated to Tabasco Hoy : " In recent years I have spent many good and bad things , so I thought , why not transform them into songs . And so it began to take shape this new album , which I think is more intelligent , mature and planned than my previous work " .

 The album was met with positive reviews by music critics . <unk> Hinojosa , of Televisa Espectáculos stated that the album " shows that despite being a rocker at heart , she has no problem recording in another genre and experiment [ ing ] with new rhythms . " Hinojosa also praised the rock song " No Puedo <unk> " , arguing that " if someone who never before had heard another song from her would believe that she [ Guzmán ] only performs in the rock genre " . Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo said that " Guzmán is back and wants to reclaim her place on the music market . " Rodríguez also reminded that Guzmán keeps trying to incorporate new or alternative rhythms to her music even if the results are not commercially successful , such as her albums Cambio de Piel ( 1996 ) produced by Spanish musician Carlos <unk> , or Lipstick ( 2004 ) , helmed by American artist Desmond Child , and A + No Poder is no exception , since the " Queen of Rock in Mexico " includes songs that " hark back to the era of the nineties , but so potentiated with harder songs where the guitars , drums and her hoarse voice come together in musical chords . " Alex <unk> of Hey Espectáculos referred to this album as a " well balance between rock and pop " that shows Guzmán 's <unk> side who opted for a rock album with some ballads and new rhythms such as reggaeton .

 A + No Poder peaked at number 12 in the Billboard Latin Pop Albums component chart in the United States , one of her worst placements in the chart , only Lipstick ( 2004 ) and Fuerza ( 2007 ) have reached lower numbers , at 15 and 16 , respectively . In Mexico , the album peaked at number six in the Mexican Albums Chart .

 To promote the album , Guzmán released three singles . Lead single " Adiós " was released on June 5 , 2015 and features guest vocals from Farruko . The track peaked at number 26 in the Billboard Latin Pop Songs and 17 in the Latin Rhythm Airplay charts , respectively , in the United States and at 15 on the Mexican Espanol Airplay chart . According to Alex <unk> of Hey Espectáculos , the song was not a success since it is not good enough to compete with other ' reggaeton ' songs and " it is far from the ballads that are surefire hits for Guzmán . " The music video for the second single , " Qué Ironía " , was filmed on Iceland and released on September 12 , 2015 . To further promote the album , the track " Esta Noche " was used as the main theme of the Mexican TV show <unk> : Noches de <unk> , and was later released as the third single on May 27 , 2016 , with a music video filmed on Campeche , Mexico .

 " The Long Bright Dark " is the series premiere of the anthology crime drama True Detective , which initially aired on HBO in the United States on January 12 , 2014 . It was directed by executive producer Cary Joji Fukunaga and written by series creator Nic Pizzolatto . The episode introduces a pair of Louisiana State Police homicide detectives , Rustin " Rust " Cohle ( Matthew McConaughey ) and Martin " Marty " Hart ( Woody Harrelson ) , as well as series regulars played by Michelle Monaghan , Michael Potts , and Tory Kittles . In " The Long Bright Dark " , Martin and Rustin are forced to recount the history of the Dora Lange murder investigation as new evidence suggests the perpetrator remains at large . 
 Pizzolatto began writing True Detective as a novel , but , as the project began taking definite form , felt it was more suitable for television . Principal photography was initially scheduled to take place in Arkansas ; however , Louisiana was ultimately preferred for its generous statewide tax incentives and unique landscape . " The Long Bright Dark " was shot entirely in 35 mm film and filming for the season lasted for 100 consecutive days . 
 Most press reviews for " The Long Bright Dark " were very positive , although some reviewers criticized the dialogue and other aspects of the program . Critics that held the episode in high regard applauded its complex narrative and sleek production , and there was a surfeit of praise for the performances of McConaughey and Harrelson . The initial broadcast of " The Long Bright Dark " drew 2 @.@ 3 million viewers , becoming HBO 's highest rated series premiere since the pilot episode of Boardwalk Empire .

 The episode opens with Martin " Marty " Hart ( Woody Harrelson ) , a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police 's Criminal Investigations Division , beginning an interview with detectives Maynard Gilbough ( Michael Potts ) and Thomas Papania ( Tory Kittles ) . His former partner , Detective Rustin " Rust " Cohle ( Matthew McConaughey ) , is being questioned separately ; they have not seen nor spoken to each other since an altercation over a decade ago . The two men are asked to recount their relationship and the history of the Dora Lange murder investigation of 1995 , the files of which were destroyed in Hurricane Rita . Martin and Rustin claim to have apprehended the killer , but the crime scene of a recently slain woman is found to closely mirror the Dora Lange murder scene , leading investigators to believe that the perpetrator is still at large . 
 = = = 1995 = = = 
 Martin and Rustin are summoned to Vermillion Parish to examine the murder scene of a young prostitute , 28 @-@ year @-@ old Dora Lange . The woman 's corpse , crowned with deer antlers and bound to a tree in a kneeling position , is surrounded by numerous twig <unk> loosely resembling Cajun bird traps . Rustin notices several stab wounds and ligature marks scattered about on the corpse , suspecting Dora to be the centerpiece of a ritual murder — the " <unk> love map " to the perpetrator 's fantasy . Martin dismisses his suspicions , and suddenly invites Rustin to dinner at his wife Maggie 's ( Michelle Monaghan ) insistence , much to Rustin 's dismay as it is his deceased daughter 's birthday . However , he reluctantly agrees to come , but infuriates Martin when he shows up to the occasion intoxicated . 
 Meanwhile , Major Ken Quesada ( Kevin Dunn ) immediately sets up a press conference and assigns Martin responsibility over the briefing session for the following day . Rustin continues the investigation at a bar that evening and asks two prostitutes — Anette ( <unk> Harmon ) and Lucy ( <unk> Ochse ) — about Dora 's whereabouts , to no avail . By the next morning , there were several breakthroughs in the investigation : Dora 's body had been successfully identified , an autopsy revealed she had been strangled , tortured , and possibly raped , and early toxicology reports found traces of lysergic acid and methamphetamine in her bloodstream . Martin , Rustin , and Quesada brief their colleagues with the new evidence . 
 The duo visit Dora 's ex @-@ husband Charlie Lange ( Brad Carter ) in prison for questioning . Charlie , incarcerated on charges of check fraud , claims to have not seen the woman since she filed for divorce a year into his prison sentence . He informs the detectives of Dora 's risky drug habits as well as the details of his final phone conversation with her . 
 The investigation takes a brief detour as Martin and Rustin direct their attention to a five @-@ year @-@ old missing @-@ persons case , a little girl named Marie Fontenot , after being mentioned by one of the locals . Authorities believe she is in the care of her father , and during a visit to see her uncle Danny Fontenot ( Christopher Berry ) , his caretaker echoed their beliefs . Rustin searches the property for potential evidence , and while in a shed , stumbles upon a twig sculpture eerily similar to those discovered at the Dora Lange murder scene .

 An accomplished writer , series creator Nic Pizzolatto delved into fiction writing and published a novel , titled Galveston ( 2010 ) , before being appointed as a screenwriter for AMC 's The Killing the following year . It was around this time that Pizzolatto was preparing to branch out into television , an endeavor that , due to a lack of capital , was never fully realized . He had already begun writing True Detective as his next novel , but later , once the project took definite form , felt it was more suitable on screen . " I 'd always had plans from the first time I 'd talked to an agent from Hollywood , I was going to ask how you break into this business , and particularly cable @-@ TV writing , because in television the writer stays in control , which is what the concept of show runner is " , he remembers . Pizzolatto pitched Galveston to several executives , and from May to July 2010 , he drafted six screenplays , including a spec script for " The Long Bright Dark " which consumed 90 pages . Shortly thereafter , he secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series . 
 Pizzolatto 's stint with The Killing provided him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry , but grew increasingly dissatisfied with the show 's creative direction , eventually leaving the writing staff two weeks into the program 's second season . " I want to be the guiding vision . I don 't do well serving someone else 's vision . I 'm not at my best there , and I don 't think I ’ m worth as much to the people who pay me . " He soon directed his attention to working on another script for the True Detective project , encouraged by Anonymous Content . 
 Alejandro González Iñárritu was initially expected to be appointed as director , but film commitments later forced him to pull out of the project . Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga , who he knew from Anonymous Content , to take up the task . Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police 's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services . Based on the officer 's own personal experiences , the director was able to develop " a nice sense of what it must be like to be a detective in Louisiana — especially in that time period in the ' 90s , which was pre @-@ cell phone , and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives . That 's what I did . I 'm not a big serial killer <unk> — I 've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I 've never really watched procedurals . Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me ; I was doing it mainly for the characters . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 McConaughey and Harrelson were among a small pool of actors considered suitable candidates for top billing . Producers contracted McConaughey , who had recently finished filming Killer Joe ( 2011 ) , well before True Detective was greenlit by HBO . Pizzolatto , impressed with the actor 's performance in The Lincoln Lawyer ( 2011 ) , originally assigned him the role of Martin Hart , but McConaughey offered " a really compelling argument " for portraying Rustin " Rust " Cohle . When asked about his decision to switch parts in a Variety interview , McConaughey replied : " I wanted to get in that dude ’ s head . The obsession , the island of a man — I ’ m always looking for a guy who monologues . It ’ s something really important as I feel I ’ m going into my better work . " To prepare , the actor studied his character through what he described the " Four Stages of Rustin Cohle " , a 450 @-@ page document he created detailing Rustin 's evolution over the course of the story . 
 Meanwhile , Harrelson was attached to the role of Martin under McConaughey 's recommendation . Having previously starred in the HBO film Game Change ( 2012 ) , Harrelson gravitated to the project due in part to his colleagues ; " I love Matthew . He 's my brother . He 's a phenomenal , amazing person . And I love Michelle [ Monaghan ] . I 've known her many , many years . Cary [ Fukunaga ] is a terrific director . And Nic [ Pizzolatto ] wrote this phenomenal script that you just couldn ’ t put down . His writing is so amazing . " Monaghan was chosen to play the female lead , Martin Hart 's wife Maggie ; the actress took an interest in True Detective as she realized her character arc and " really saw where these characters went . " Potts acted as Detective Maynard Gilbough , and Kittles played his partner Detective Thomas Papania . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The initial location for principal photography for True Detective was Arkansas ; however , Pizzolatto later opted to film in southern Louisiana to capitalize on generous statewide tax incentives and the area 's distinctive landscape , which he felt illustrated a striking paradox . " There 's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all , " the native Louisianan noted . " Everything lives under layers of concealment . The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable . On the other hand you have the beauty of it all from a distance . " " The Long Bright Dark " and subsequent episodes were shot in 35 mm film , and principal photography for the season consumed 100 consecutive days . The crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside of Erath , Louisiana which , because it was partially burned , inspired a " moody and atmospheric " backdrop for corresponding scenes . Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw , previously director of photography for Top of the Lake , as project cinematographer and employed minimalistic lighting for layering composition . Also involved in production was Alex DiGerlando , who Fukunaga had previously worked with on <unk> <unk> 's Glory at Sea ( 2008 ) . The director remarked in an interview , " I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money , how much more amazing he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 " The Long Bright Dark " was critically acclaimed by most critics . Tim Goodman from The Hollywood Reporter said Fukunaga develops " a beautiful , sprawling sense of place " in the premiere , and identified the ensemble and the writing , which he believed " undulates from effectively brash soliloquies to penetratingly nuanced moments carried by sparse prose " , as two of its other most satisfying attributes . Marshall Crook of The Wall Street Journal agreed , writing the show hits the mark with " good acting , smart writing , and lush cinematography " . Willa Paskin of Slate described the episode as " creepy , gorgeous , unsettling , and searching " and noticed " a literary quality , an accretion of meaningful detail " within the show 's narrative . The Daily Beast 's Andrew Romano said the premiere , together with the former half of the season , compose " one of the most riveting and provocative series I 've ever seen " , while Entertainment Weekly critic Jeff Jensen called it " an enthralling murder mystery about history , culture , and heroic character " . 
 Brian Lowry , reviewing for Variety , called " The Long Bright Dark " a " rich and absorbing " episode where True Detective immediately assumes a unique identity from other police procedurals , and wrote the cast ensemble consisted of " fine players on the periphery " . Writing in USA Today , Robert Bianco felt McConaughey and Harrelson not only met , but occasionally even exceeded " enormously high " performance expectations of the " golden age of TV acting " . David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle singled out the duo as being " in a class of their own " , and Los Angeles Times journalist Robert Lloyd thought the character work from the two men was of " a very high order " . Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe , though found the program 's grim tone to be occasionally excessive , opined that the two men successfully engaged audiences enough to invest in the series with their performances . Monaghan also received kudos from Rodman for her work in the episode . Additional praise for ensemble performances , chiefly for McConaughey and Harrelson , came from Time 's James Poniewozik , The New York Times critic Mike Hale , Curt Wagner in RedEye , The Independent 's Sarah Hughes , and Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian . 
 Bianco said the show avoided character stereotypes , and Alan Sepinwall in HitFix felt Cohle and Hart developed into such riveting characters " that they paper over some of the series ' weaknesses " . The Daily Telegraph critic Chris Harvey awarded " The Long Bright Dark " five out of five stars , hailing True Detective as " the most ambitious TV drama for a long time " . 
 Not all critics were as enthusiastic in their reviews of " The Long Bright Dark " . Hale , despite commending the flashback narrative , believed the dialogue devolved into " a languid character study and a vehicle for long @-@ winded exchanges about religion and responsibility that are writerly in the worst way . " Chris Cabin from Slant Magazine agreed that the writing too readily " defers to an earnest , rote view of bad religion " , but wrote that Pizzolatto and Fukunaga " smartly embrace the <unk> of their material " . Hank Stuever , writing for The Washington Post , observed " mumbly , bloodshot fatigue " in the story , and felt the series fell short of its ambitions . " In its better moments , True Detective feels like a fever dream , but mostly it ’ s just groggy , " Stuever concluded . Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker was especially critical of the show and claimed it relished in " macho nonsense " . 
 = James Whiteside McCay = 
 Lieutenant General Sir James Whiteside McCay , KCMG , KBE , CB , VD ( 21 December 1864 – 1 October 1930 ) , who often spelt his surname M ’ Cay , was an Australian general and politician . 
 A graduate of the University of Melbourne , where he earned Master of Arts and Master of Laws degrees , McCay established a successful legal practice , McCay & Thwaites . He was a member of the Victorian Parliament for Castlemaine from 1895 to 1899 , where he was a champion of women 's suffrage and federation . He lost his seat in 1899 but became a member of the first Australian Federal Parliament in 1901 . He was Minister for Defence from 1904 to 1905 , during which he implemented long @-@ lasting reforms , including the creation of the Military Board . 
 As a soldier , McCay commanded the 2nd Infantry Brigade in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 , during the Gallipoli Campaign of the Great War . He was later wounded in the Second Battle of Krithia and invalided to Australia , but returned to command the 5th Division , which he led in the Battle of Fromelles in 1916 , dubbed " the worst 24 hours in Australia 's entire history . " His failures in difficult military operations made him a controversial figure who earned the disfavour of his superiors , while his efforts to succeed in the face of insurmountable obstacles earned him the odium of troops under his command , who blamed him for high casualties . In the latter part of the war he commanded the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom . 
 After the war , McCay resumed his old job as Deputy Chairman of the State Bank of Victoria and also served on a panel that deliberated on the future structure of the Army . He was chairman of the Fair Profits Commission , the War Service Homes Scheme of the Repatriation Commission , and the Repatriation Commission 's Disposals Board . He commanded the Special Constabulary Force during the 1923 Victorian Police strike . 
 = = Education and early life = = 
 McCay was born on 21 December 1864 in <unk> , County Antrim , Ireland , the oldest of ten children to the Reverend Andrew Ross Boyd McCay , a Presbyterian minister , and his wife Lily Ann Esther Waring ( née Brown ) . The family emigrated to Australia in 1865 , settling in Castlemaine , Victoria . Boyd McCay continued his theological studies while he was a minister in Castlemaine , earning a Master of Arts ( MA ) from the University of Melbourne in 1882 and a Doctor of Divinity from the Presbyterian Theological Faculty Ireland in 1887 . Esther could speak seven languages . The two separated in 1891 . 
 James attended Castlemaine State School . At the age of twelve he won a scholarship to Scotch College , Melbourne to the value of £ 35 per annum for six years . He was dux of the school in 1880 . At Scotch College McCay first met John Monash , who would be dux the following year , and would later become a close friend . McCay entered Ormond College at the University of Melbourne in 1881 , the year that the college first opened , and commenced studying for his Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) degree . McCay left the university without completing his degree in 1883 and took a job as a teacher at Toorak Grammar School . In 1885 , he bought Castlemaine Grammar School . The school was co @-@ educational ; McCay believed that girls should have the same opportunities as boys . Among its students who attended university with McCay 's encouragement and support was <unk> Jane Williams , who later became principal of Janet Clarke Hall at the University of Melbourne , and The Women 's College at the University of Sydney . The job of running the school was soon delegated to McCay 's mother and brother Adam . 
 He returned to the university in 1892 and completed his Bachelor of Arts degree . He then embarked on a Bachelor of Laws ( LLB ) degree . In 1895 , he was awarded an MA degree , majoring in mathematics . He completed his law degree the next year , with first class honours , in spite of rarely attending the lectures due to his work , political and military commitments . In 1895 , he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria and established a legal practice in Castlemaine . His practice had the first telephone in the town . He was awarded his Master of Laws ( <unk> ) degree in 1897 . In 1898 , he went into partnership with William Thwaites , whose brother Walter married his sister . The firm 's name was then changed to McCay & Thwaites . It would later hire one of the first women to become an articled clerk in Victoria . On 8 April 1896 , McCay married Julia Mary O 'Meara , the daughter of a Roman Catholic Kyneton police magistrate . Sectarianism in Australia made such marriages uncommon , and the marriage was opposed by both their families . It produced two daughters , Margaret Mary ( " Mardi " ) and Beatrix Waring ( " <unk> " ) , born in 1897 and 1901 , respectively .

 = = = Victorian parliament = = = 
 In August 1890 , McCay was elected to the local council of the Castlemaine Borough . When the prominent local Member of the Legislative Assembly , Sir James Patterson , died in 1894 , McCay ran for his seat of Castlemaine in the resulting by @-@ election . After a hard @-@ fought campaign , McCay won by just ten votes . McCay devoted his maiden speech to what would be his defining cause as a state politician , women 's suffrage : 
 I believe the principle applies to woman by virtue of her citizenship as applies to man . As she has to bear her share of the duties of citizenship , she is entitled to vote unless good cause can be shown to the contrary ; and I submit that good cause has not been shown to the contrary . 
 On other issues , McCay supported Federation , and was one of a number of young politicians who rallied around Alfred Deakin , threatening to bring down Sir George Turner 's government if it attempted to block federation . McCay opposed sending Victorian troops to fight in the Boer War , calling war in general an " anachronism " . In 1899 , McCay was one of the young radicals who supported Allan McLean and crossed the floor to bring down the Turner government . McLean gave McCay the portfolio of Minister for Education and Customs in his new ministry . At the time it was the custom for members who had accepted a ministerial appointment to re @-@ submit themselves for election . In the subsequent by @-@ election , McCay 's opposition to the war in South Africa became an election issue . The war was now going badly for Britain . Feelings ran high and McCay lost his seat . McCay attempted to win his seat back at the general election in 1900 but lost again . 
 = = = Federal parliament = = = 
 With Federation in 1901 came the opportunity to run for the new Parliament of Australia . McCay contested the 1901 election as a Protectionist Party candidate for <unk> , the Federal electorate that encompassed the Castlemaine area . McCay , who characterised himself as a liberal , supported the widest possible enfranchisement of women , the protection of industry and revenue through tariffs , and the White Australia policy . The war in South Africa was now in its final stages and the electorate forgot or forgave McCay 's " treason " , electing him to the first Australian Parliament . 
 As a backbencher , McCay opposed amendments to the Defence Act 1903 proposed by Billy Hughes of the Australian Labor Party that called for peacetime conscription . He accepted its necessity in wartime , but only for service within Australia . McCay believed that volunteers would always be plentiful , and he feared that peacetime conscription would result in militarism . He was re @-@ elected unopposed in the 1903 election , the first in which Victorian women were eligible to vote . In 1904 , McCay moved an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 to remove the clause that empowered the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to give preference to trade unions . The debate became unexpectedly heated and resulted in the fall of Chris Watson 's Labor government . The Free Trade Party 's George Reid became Prime Minister and offered McCay the post of Minister for Defence . 
 McCay became the sixth Minister for Defence in four years . His predecessor , Senator Anderson Dawson , had chaired a committee that had produced a detailed report recommending the abolition of the post of General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces and the creation of a Council of Defence , a Naval Board and a Military Board . It fell to McCay to implement the report 's recommendations and create a five @-@ man Military Board consisting of himself , a finance member and three military officers . McCay preferred the senior member not be styled the Chief of the General Staff . This change would not be made until 1909 . At the first meeting of the Council of Defence , McCay rejected the arguments of Captain William Rooke Creswell for the majority of the defence budget to be spent on supporting the British fleet . In 1905 the Reid government collapsed and McCay became a backbencher once more . Since the Federal parliament sat in Parliament House , Melbourne , McCay lived at the Stock Exchange Club in Collins Street , Melbourne while his family remained in Castlemaine . He maintained a liaison with a married woman , Ella Gavan Duffy . 
 In the 1906 redistribution , McCay 's electorate of <unk> was abolished and its territory divided between the electorates of <unk> and Corio . McCay decided to run in Corio against the sitting member , Richard Crouch , although he was also a Protectionist , but Crouch won convincingly . In 1910 , the Commonwealth Liberal Party Senate candidate , Thomas Skene , died suddenly two days before the nomination date for the 1910 election . McCay submitted himself as candidate but lost . 
 = = Military career = = 
 McCay 's military career began in 1884 , when he enlisted in the 4th ( Castlemaine ) Battalion , Victorian Rifles . He was commissioned as a lieutenant on 29 October 1886 , and was subsequently promoted to captain on 5 March 1889 and major on 13 March 1896 . Following the forced resignation of the commander of the 8th Regiment for making a political speech touting McCay , McCay was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the regiment on 12 January 1900 . 
 = = = Director of Military Intelligence = = = 
 On 6 December 1907 , on the recommendation of the Chief of Intelligence , Colonel William Throsby Bridges , the Minister for Defence , Thomas Ewing appointed McCay as Director of Military Intelligence , with the rank of colonel . In turn , McCay turned to his former schoolmate , John Monash , whom he had appointed to the command of the Victorian section of the new Australian Army Intelligence Corps ( AIC ) , with a promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel on 28 March 1908 . The AIC set about compiling information such as the suitability of lighthouses for signalling , the availability of railway rolling stock , and the number of civilian motor vehicles suitable for military use . A concerted effort was put into creating sets of detailed maps . McCay and Monash became close friends . In 1912 , McCay & Thwaites moved into offices at 360 Collins Street , where businesses associated with the Baillieu family were located . Monash moved his offices into the same building , and the two addressed each other as " Jack " and " Jim " . On 5 March 1912 , McCay was appointed a commissioner of the State Bank of Victoria . 
 In 1911 , McCay delivered a lecture at the Victorian United Services Institution entitled " The True Principles of Australia 's Defence " . He suggested that the Australian Army should be equipped to the same standard as the British Army and should be prepared to fight an enemy overseas rather than waiting for an invasion of Australia . On 11 April 1913 , he resigned his position as Director of Military Intelligence and was placed on the unattached list .

 On 2 August 1914 , the government activated the preliminary stage of the war plan , which included the establishment of censorship . McCay was recalled to duty as Deputy Chief Censor ( Australia ) , answerable to the Chief Censor in London . McCay organised a headquarters in Melbourne , and established district offices in the other state capitals . Soon after the outbreak of the Great War on 4 August , Bridges , now a brigadier general , appointed McCay to command the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) . He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Tunbridge on 10 August , who in turn was succeeded by Colonel Monash on 17 August . 
 McCay was assigned two regular officers as his brigade major and staff captain , but was permitted to choose his four battalion commanders . All of McCay 's choices were senior Militia commanders from Victoria . Three of them proved to be too old for the <unk> of a modern campaign . The exception was his youngest appointment , Lieutenant Colonel Harold Edward Elliott of the 7th Infantry Battalion , a University of Melbourne educated lawyer like himself . The brigade assembled at Broadmeadows Camp where it commenced its training . On 21 October McCay and his brigade headquarters embarked from Melbourne on the former P & O ocean liner RMS Orvieto , which also carried Major General Bridges and the staff of his 1st Division . After sailing through the Suez Canal , it arrived at Alexandria , Egypt on 4 December 1914 . The brigade camped at Mena , on the outskirts of Cairo , where training resumed . War correspondent Charles Bean noted that McCay " trained his command with conspicuous ability . He did a great deal of detail work himself , drawing his own orders , and sometimes training his own platoons . " On 4 April 1915 , the 2nd Brigade packed its camp and moved by rail to Alexandria , from whence it embarked for Gallipoli for the landing at Anzac Cove . 
 McCay arrived off Anzac Cove on the transport SS <unk> on the morning of Anzac Day , 25 April 1915 , with his headquarters and the 5th Infantry Battalion on board . <unk> had difficulties reaching her berth and when she finally reached it there were no boats to unload her . McCay therefore did not step ashore until about 06 : 00 . There , he met Colonel Ewen Sinclair @-@ Maclagan , the commander of the 3rd Infantry Brigade , who asked him to deploy the 2nd Infantry Brigade on the right , on the 400 Plateau , instead of the left as planned . McCay did so , establishing his headquarters on what became known as McCay 's Hill . The 2nd Infantry Brigade was soon involved in " the most costly struggle of the day " . At 16 : 45 McCay telephoned Bridges at 1st Division headquarters to ask for reinforcements . 
 The reply came from Colonel White : " The General has only one battalion left ; MacLagan has been very hard pressed , and the General is loath to dispense with this battalion until other troops come ashore tonight . " 
 McCay answered that he could not manage to bridge the gap in his line ; unless reinforcements arrived , the Turks might come through it at any moment . Major Blamey , standing beside McCay , added that in his opinion the situation was very dangerous — that some of the men were giving way . A few minutes later the voice of Bridges came to McCay through the telephone . " McCay , " he said , " I want you to speak to me , not as subordinate to general , but as McCay to Bridges . I have only one battalion left . Do you assure me that your need for it is absolute ? " McCay replied that he did ; unless it were sent to him , the Turks could come in behind the right of the line . Bridges promised him the 4th Battalion , and ordered Blamey to come down and lead it up . 
 The Australian line was forced back on to the reverse slope , but did not break . 
 The commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force , General Sir Ian Hamilton , now decided to make his main effort at Cape Helles . The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps commander , Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood , was ordered to send a brigade from each of his two divisions to Helles to reinforce the British and French troops there . McCay 's brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade were chosen . They embarked for Helles on 6 May . On the evening of 8 May , during the Second Battle of Krithia , McCay was given 35 minutes notice to conduct an advance across open ground in broad daylight . McCay protested that there was insufficient time to organise this but was overruled by Hamilton . The brigade suffered heavily . McCay led his men from the front , driving them on despite the futility of the attack . All of his staff were killed or wounded , and McCay 's leg was broken by a bullet . The advance was also pointless , for it could have been conducted after dark without loss . As a result , his men regarded him as responsible for their fate . 
 McCay was evacuated to hospital in Alexandria . He rejoined his brigade at Anzac on 8 June but the wound had not fully healed and he was lame , walking with the aid of a stick . In the meantime , General Bridges had been mortally wounded on 18 May and the Australian government sent the Chief of the General Staff , Major General James Gordon Legge , to replace him as commander of the 1st Division . McCay , Monash and Colonel Harry Chauvel were all disappointed at being passed over for the command , and protested to Birdwood and the Australian government , but to no avail . However , Legge chose McCay to command the 2nd Division , then forming in Egypt . Unfortunately , on 11 July , the day before he was due to leave for Egypt , McCay 's leg snapped where the bone had been broken at Krithia . He was evacuated again , this time to Malta , and then to the United Kingdom , where he was visited by Sir George Reid , now the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom . McCay 's wife Julia died while he was in hospital . Several weeks later his father died as well . McCay was therefore sent back to Australia on compassionate leave . He arrived back in Melbourne on RMS Malwa on 11 November 1915 , accompanied by his two teenage daughters and his brother Hugh , who had joined the ship in Adelaide , to a hero 's welcome . For his service at Gallipoli , McCay was mentioned in despatches for his " great promptitude in supporting the threatened flank of the covering force " during the landing and his " conspicuous gallantry " at Krithia . He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath , and bestowed the Croix de Commander de la Légion d 'honneur by the President of France . 
 = = = = Western Front = = = = 
 The Minister for Defence , Senator George Pearce , appointed McCay to the newly created post of Inspector General of the AIF on 29 November 1915 , with the local rank of major general . McCay was involved in recruiting campaigns , and inspected AIF units and reported on their training and equipment . He proposed a new training regime , with a national syllabus that increased the number of hours per week of training and the duration of training to twelve weeks . This led to strikes at the camps at <unk> and Liverpool . Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool . As a result , new liquor laws were introduced , including six o 'clock closing . 
 Meanwhile , the Gallipoli Campaign had ended and the AIF in Egypt was in the process of doubling in size from two divisions to four . Birdwood wished to appoint two British generals to command the new divisions , but Senator Pearce opposed this , ordering that one be given to McCay . On 22 March 1916 , McCay arrived back in Egypt to assume command of the 5th Division . He found that General Headquarters , Egyptian Expeditionary Force had ordered II Anzac Corps , of which the 5th Division was a part , to replace I Anzac Corps in the defence of the Suez Canal . Owing to a shortage of rolling stock , the 4th and 5th Divisions were ordered to undertake a three @-@ day route march across the desert under service conditions , carrying their packs and weapons . This proved to be a greater test of staff and troops than anticipated , and many men dropped from thirst or exhaustion . Many of his men blamed McCay for subjecting them to such a humiliating and severe trial . 
 In June 1916 , the 5th Division moved to the Western Front . Although the last to arrive in France , it would be the first to see serious action , a part of an ill @-@ conceived plan by Lieutenant General Sir Richard <unk> , whose British XI Corps would attack a strong part of the line with inexperienced 5th Division and British 61st ( 2nd South Midland ) Division . The resulting Battle of Fromelles was an unmitigated disaster . In one night , the 5th Division sustained 5 @,@ 533 casualties , while the 61st Division lost 1 @,@ 547 . <unk> was principally responsible but McCay bore some of the blame . He made tactical errors ; his order to vacate the first trench after it was cleared " undoubtedly contributed to the causes of failure " . His refusal to permit a truce to recover wounded further damaged his popularity . For his part , McCay was mentioned in despatches a second time . 
 The 5th Division was out of action for some months . It finally moved with the rest of the I Anzac Corps to the Somme sector in October . After months of fighting and recent rain , the front line area was a devastated muddy morass . McCay was ordered to undertake an attack with the 2nd Division 's 7th Infantry Brigade at Flers , which cost 819 casualties and gained no ground . Once again , McCay 's handling of his division showed poor planning and tactics . Moreover , at Flers he showed that he had not learned from the lessons of Fromelles . His relief was now only a matter of time . Nonetheless , McCay remained in command of the 5th Division until 18 December 1916 when he was granted medical leave in the United Kingdom for treatment on his leg , which the doctors diagnosed as neuralgia . Birdwood took the opportunity of removing McCay , ostensibly on medical grounds . McCay was mentioned in despatches a third time . 
 = = = = United Kingdom = = = = 
 On the recommendation of Brigadier General Robert Anderson , the Commandant , Administrative Headquarters , AIF , and against the opposition of Birdwood , Senator Pearce appointed McCay as commander of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom . These depots received and trained reinforcements arriving from Australia , and rehabilitated and retrained convalescents who were released from hospital . McCay established his headquarters at Tidworth , in the heart of the Salisbury Plain where most of the Australian camps were located . He occupied this post for the remainder of the war , failing in bids to return to an active command at the head of the 5th Division , the Australian Corps , or the 3rd Division when Monash was promoted to corps commander . A bid to replace Birdwood as administrative commander of the AIF also came to naught . For his services in the United Kingdom , McCay was mentioned in despatches a fourth time , made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918 , and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919 . 
 On 10 March 1919 , McCay handed over command of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom to Major General Charles Rosenthal . After a farewell dinner hosted by Monash , he embarked for Australia , where his AIF appointment was terminated . In 1919 , along with George Swinburne and Generals White and Legge , he produced a report on the organisation of the post @-@ war Army . In 1920 , he joined Generals Chauvel , White , Monash , Legge , and Hobbs to produce a second report on the subject . McCay retired from the Army in 1926 with the honorary rank of lieutenant general .

 McCay resumed his old job as Deputy Chairman of the State Savings Bank of Victoria on 10 June 1919 , a few days after he returned to Melbourne . He also resumed his relationship with Ella Gavan Duffy . On 30 December 1919 , the Premier of Victoria , Harry Lawson , McCay 's successor in Legislative Assembly seat of Castlemaine and a former student at Castlemaine Grammar and Scotch College , appointed McCay as chairman of the Fair Profits Commission , a consumer protection body set up to monitor prices and profits . After his term ended in 1921 , he was appointed to the advisory board of the War Service Homes Scheme of the Repatriation Commission . He was also Chairman of its Disposals Board from 1921 to 1922 . In 1922 , the State Savings Bank of Victoria took over the construction of war service homes in Victoria . During the 1923 Victorian Police strike , Monash appointed McCay to create , and later command the Special Constabulary Force that was established to carry out police duties during the strike . McCay ran this organisation from the Melbourne Town Hall , and later the Repatriation Department offices , which were made available rent free by the Commonwealth Government . The Special Constabulary Force was wound up in May 1924 . 
 McCay 's daughter Mardi matriculated from Sacré Cœur School in 1914 and earned Master of Arts and Diploma of Education degrees from the University of Melbourne . In 1922 , she entered the Society of the Sacred Heart . She taught at <unk> @-@ Rose Bay , School of the Sacred Heart , Sydney until 1956 when she returned to Sacré Cœur as Mistress of Studies . <unk> also attended Sacré Cœur and the University of Melbourne , at Janet Clarke Hall , where she became only the third woman in Victoria to earn a Master of Laws degree , and was enrolled as a barrister on 10 June 1925 . Like Joan <unk> , she could not obtain room in the Selborne Chambers , as women were not allowed to do so , so she put up her plate in the building next door . McCay followed his daughter and became a barrister , enrolling on 8 October 1925 . In 1930 , she married George Reid , a young barrister who later became Attorney @-@ General of Victoria . 
 McCay became ill in 1930 with cancer . In his last months he destroyed all his papers . He died on 12 October 1930 . He was survived by his daughters , now Reverend Mother McCay and Mrs George Reid , and six brothers and two sisters . He was given , at his request , a non @-@ military funeral at Cairns Memorial Presbyterian Church in East Melbourne , and was buried at Box Hill Cemetery . For pallbearers he had Generals John Monash , Harold Edward Elliott , Cecil Henry <unk> , R. E. Williams , and J. Stanley , along with Sir William McBeath , the chairman of the State Savings Bank ; William Thwaites , his law partner ; and businessman A. S. Baillieu . Among the other mourners was Generals Brudenell White and John Patrick McGlinn , who had been his deputy commander of AIF Depots in the United Kingdom ; John Latham , the Leader of the Opposition ; Dr W. S. Littlejohn , the headmaster of Scotch College and Sir John MacFarland , the Chancellor of the University of Melbourne . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 McCay is a controversial figure in Australian history . Disagreement about his significance and reputation began before his death and continues to the present . General Sir Brudenell White considered McCay to be " one of the greatest soldiers that ever served Australia , greater even than Monash . " McCay 's achievements included the creation of the Military Board and the Australian Army Intelligence Corps , and the development of the Staff Corps , " laying the foundations on which the Australian Army was built . " In writing Volume III of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914 – 1918 , which covered 1916 , official historian Charles Bean exonerated McCay of blame for Fromelles . This led to a public debate in the pages of The Bulletin in 1929 between critics of McCay and his defenders , led by Elliott . A revival of interest in Australian military history and the rediscovery of graves at Fromelles in the 21st Century led to a number of books being written about the battle , which tended to be critical of McCay . 
 = Brunei at the 2004 Summer Olympics = 
 Brunei , as Brunei Darussalam , competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece , which took place between 13 to 29 August 2004 . The country 's participation in Athens marked its fourth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1988 Summer Olympics . 
 The Brunei delegation included only one track and field athlete , meaning Brunei , along with British Virgin Islands and Liechtenstein , sent the lowest number of athletes to the 2004 Summer Games at one . The athlete selected was Jimmy Anak Ahar , who was a middle @-@ distance runner that was selected via a wildcard as the nation had no athletes that met the " A " or " B " standards in any event . Ahar was also selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony . Ultimately , Ahar did not progress beyond the heats , meaning Brunei won no medals at this Summer Olympics . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although Brunei first participated in the Summer Olympic in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea , it was only represented by one official . It would not be until the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , United States that the country would send athletes to the Games . Since then , it has participated in four Summer Olympics between its debut and the 2004 Summer Olympics . No Brunei athlete had ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics before the 2004 Athens Games . 
 The Brunei National Olympic Committee ( NOC ) selected one athlete via a wildcard . Usually , a NOC would be able to enter up to three qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the " A " standard , or one athlete per event if they met the " B " standard . However , since Brunei had no athletes that met either standard , they were allowed to select an athlete as a wildcard . The one athlete that was selected to compete in the Athens Games was Jimmy Anak Ahar in the Men 's 1500 meters . Sending only one athlete to the Athens Games meant that the country , along with British Virgin Islands and Liechtenstein , was notable for sending the lowest number of athletes to the 2004 Summer Games . Ahar was flag bearer for the opening ceremony . Among officials , sports official Sofian Ibrahim represented the country . 
 = = Athletics = = 
 Making his Summer Olympic debut , Jimmy Anak Ahar was notable for becoming the youngest ever competitor to represent Brunei at the Olympics aged 22 . The age record stood until the 2012 Summer Olympics , when Anderson Chee Wei Lim surpassed it . Ahar qualified for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard , as his best time , three minutes , 59 @.@ 81 seconds at the 2003 Southeast Asian Games Men 's 1500 meters , was 21 @.@ 81 seconds slower than the " B " qualifying standard required . He competed on 20 August in the Men 's 1500 meters against thirteen other athletes in the third heat . He ran a time of 4 minutes , 14 @.@ 11 seconds , finishing 13th .

 = On Her Majesty 's Secret Service ( novel ) = 
 On Her Majesty 's Secret Service is the tenth novel in Ian Fleming 's James Bond series , first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 1 April 1963 . The initial and secondary print runs sold out , with over 60 @,@ 000 books sold in the first month . Fleming wrote the book in Jamaica whilst the first film in the Eon Productions series of films , Dr. No , was being filmed nearby . 
 On Her Majesty 's Secret Service is the second book in what is known as the " Blofeld trilogy " , which begins with Thunderball and concluded with You Only Live Twice . The story centres on Bond 's ongoing search to find Ernst Stavro Blofeld after the Thunderball incident ; through contact with the College of Arms in London Bond finds Blofeld based in Switzerland . After meeting him and discovering his latest plans , Bond attacks the centre where he is based , although Blofeld escapes in the confusion . Bond meets and falls in love with Contessa Teresa " Tracy " di Vicenzo during the story . The pair marry at the end of the story but Blofeld kills Bond 's wife , hours after the ceremony . 
 Fleming made a number of revelations about Bond 's character within the book , including showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories . In common with Fleming 's other Bond stories , he used the names and places of people he knew or had heard of and Blofeld 's research station on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss <unk> , which the Nazis had turned into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races . 
 On Her Majesty 's Secret Service received broadly good reviews in the British and American press . The novel was adapted to run as a three @-@ part story in Playboy in 1963 and then as a daily comic strip in the Daily Express newspaper in 1964 – 1965 . In 1969 the novel was adapted as the sixth film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series and was the only film to star George Lazenby as Bond . In 2014 On Her Majesty 's Secret Service was adapted as a play on BBC Radio , starring Toby Stephens . 
 = = Plot = = 
 For more than a year , James Bond , British Secret Service operative 007 , has been involved in " Operation Bedlam " : trailing the private criminal organisation SPECTRE and its leader , Ernst Stavro Blofeld . The organisation had hijacked two nuclear devices and subsequently blackmailed the western world , as described in Thunderball . Convinced SPECTRE no longer exists , Bond is frustrated by MI6 's insistence that he continue the search and his inability to find Blofeld . He composes a letter of resignation for his superior , M. 
 Whilst composing his letter , Bond encounters a beautiful , suicidal young woman named Contessa Teresa " Tracy " di Vicenzo first on the road and subsequently at the gambling table , where he saves her from a coup de <unk> by paying the gambling debt she is unable to cover . The following day Bond follows her and interrupts her attempted suicide , but they are captured by professional henchmen . They are taken to the offices of Marc @-@ Ange Draco , head of the Unione Corse , the biggest European crime syndicate . Tracy is the daughter and only child of Draco who believes the only way to save his daughter from further suicide attempts is for Bond to marry her . To facilitate this , he offers Bond a dowry of £ 1 million ( £ 20 million in 2016 pounds ) ; Bond refuses the offer , but agrees to continue romancing Tracy while her mental health improves . 
 Afterwards Draco uses his contacts to inform Bond that Blofeld is somewhere in Switzerland . Bond returns to England to be given another lead : the College of Arms in London has discovered that Blofeld has assumed the title and name Comte Balthazar de <unk> and wants formal confirmation of the title and has asked the College to declare him the reigning count . 
 On a visit to the College of Arms , Bond finds that the family motto of Sir Thomas Bond is " The World Is Not Enough " , and that he might be ( though unlikely ) Bond 's ancestor . On the pretext that a genetically @-@ inherited minor physical abnormality ( a lack of earlobes ) needs a personal confirmation , Bond impersonates a College of Arms representative , Sir Hilary Bray to visit Blofeld 's lair atop Piz Gloria , where he finally meets Blofeld . Blofeld has undergone plastic surgery partly to remove his earlobes , but also to disguise himself from the police and security services who are tracking him down . 
 Bond learns Blofeld has been curing a group of young British and Irish women of their livestock and food allergies . In truth , Blofeld and his aide , Irma Bunt , have been brainwashing them into carrying biological warfare agents back to Britain and Ireland in order to destroy the agricultural economy , upon which post @-@ World War II Britain depends . Believing himself discovered , Bond escapes by ski from Piz Gloria , chased by SPECTRE operatives , a number of whom he kills in the process . Afterward , in a state of total exhaustion , he encounters Tracy . She is in the town at the base of the mountain after being told by her father that Bond may be in the vicinity . Bond is too weak to take on Blofeld 's henchmen alone and she helps him escape to the airport . Smitten by the resourceful , headstrong woman , he proposes marriage and she accepts . Bond then returns to England and works on the plan to capture Blofeld . 
 Helped by Draco 's Union Corse , Bond mounts an air assault against the clinic and Blofeld . Whilst the clinic is destroyed , Blofeld escapes down a bobsled run and although Bond gives chase Blofeld escapes . Bond flies to Germany where he marries Tracy . The two of them drive off on honeymoon and , a few hours later , Blofeld and Bunt drive past , machine gunning them : Tracy is killed in the attack . 
 = = Characters and themes = = 
 On Her Majesty 's Secret Service contains what the author of " continuation " Bond novels Raymond Benson calls " major revelations " about Bond and his character . These start with Bond 's showing an emotional side , visiting the grave of Casino Royale 's Vesper Lynd , which he did every year . The emotional side continues with Bond asking Tracy to marry him . The character of Tracy is not as well defined as some other female leads in the Bond canon , but Benson points out that that it may be the enigmatic quality that Bond falls in love with . Benson also notes that Fleming gives relatively little information about the character , only how Bond reacts to her . 
 Academic Christoph Lindner identifies the character of Marc @-@ Ange Draco as an example of those characters who have morals closer to those of the traditional villains , but who act on the side of good in support of Bond ; others of this type include Darko Kerim ( From Russia , with Love ) , Tiger Tanaka ( You Only Live Twice ) and Enrico Colombo ( " Risico " ) . Fellow academic Jeremy Black noted the connection between Draco and World War II ; Draco wears the King 's medal for resistance fighters . The war reference is a method used by Fleming to differentiate good from evil and raises a question about " the distinction between criminality and legality " , according to Black . 
 = = Background = = 
 On Her Majesty 's Secret Service was written in Jamaica at Fleming 's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1962 , whilst the first Bond film , Dr. No was being filmed nearby . The first draft of the novel was 196 pages long and called The Belles of Hell . Fleming later changed the title after being told of a nineteenth @-@ century sailing novel called On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , seen by Fleming 's friend Nicholas Henderson in Portobello Road Market . 
 As with all his Bond books , Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing . In the 1930s , Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski ; he once deliberately set off down a slope that had been closed because of the danger of an avalanche . The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down , catching him at its end : Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond 's escape from Piz Gloria . Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club the Schloss <unk> in the Austrian Alps ; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club and turned it into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races . It was this pseudo @-@ scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld 's own centre of Piz Gloria . 
 The connection between M and the inspiration for his character , Rear Admiral John Godfrey , was made apparent with Bond visiting Quarterdeck , M 's home . He rings the ship 's @-@ bell for HMS Repulse , M 's last command : it was Godfrey 's ship too . Godfrey was Fleming 's superior officer in Naval Intelligence Division during the war and was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament . During their Christmas lunch , M tells Bond of an old naval acquaintance , a Chief Gunnery Officer named McLachlan . This was actually an old colleague of both Godfrey and Fleming 's in the NID , Donald McLachlan . 
 The name Hilary Bray was that of an old @-@ Etonian with whom Fleming worked at the stock broking firm Rowe & Pitman , whilst Sable Basilisk was based on " Rouge Dragon " in the College of Arms . Rouge Dragon was the title of heraldic researcher Robin de la <unk> @-@ Mirrlees who asked Fleming not to use the title in the book ; in a play on words , Fleming used Mirrlees 's address , a flat in Basil St and combined it with a dragon @-@ like creature , a basilisk , to come up with the name . Mirrlees had Spanish antecedents , generally born without earlobes and Fleming used this physical attribute for Blofeld . Mirrlees also discovered that the line of the Bonds of Peckham bears the family motto " The World is Not Enough " , which Fleming appropriated for Bond 's own family . 
 Fleming also used historical references for some of his names and Marc @-@ Ange Draco 's name is based upon that of El Draco , the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake , a fact also used by J. K. Rowling for the naming of her character Draco Malfoy . For Tracy 's background , Fleming used that of Muriel Wright , a married wartime lover of Fleming 's , who died in an air @-@ raid and Bond 's grief for the loss of his wife is an echo of Fleming 's at the loss of Wright . Fleming did make mistakes in the novel , however , such as Bond ordering a half @-@ bottle of Pol Roger Champagne : Fleming 's friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol Roger was the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half @-@ bottles . 
 On Her Majesty 's Secret Service is the second book in what is called " the Blofeld trilogy " , sitting between Thunderball , where SPECTRE is introduced and You Only Live Twice , where Blofeld is finally killed by Bond . Although Blofeld is present in Thunderball , he directs operations from a distance and as such he and Bond never meet and On Her Majesty 's Secret Service constitutes his and Bond 's first meeting .

 On Her Majesty 's Secret Service was published on 1 April 1963 in the UK as a hardcover edition by publishers Jonathan Cape ; it was 288 pages long and cost 16 shillings . A limited edition of 250 copies were also printed that were numbered and signed by Fleming . Artist Richard Chopping once again undertook the cover art for the first edition . There were 42 @,@ 000 advance orders for the hardback first edition and Cape did an immediate second impression of 15 @,@ 000 copies , selling over 60 @,@ 000 by the end of April 1963 .

 The novel was published in America in August by the New American Library , after Fleming changed publishers from Viking Press after The Spy Who Loved Me . The book was 299 pages long and cost $ 4 @.@ 50 and it topped The New York Times Best Seller list for over six months . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Writing in The Guardian , critic Anthony Berkeley Cox , writing under the name Francis Iles , noted that the two minor grammatical errors he spotted were " likely to spoil no one 's enjoyment " of the novel as he considered that On Her Majesty 's Secret Service was " not only up to Mr. Fleming 's usual level , but perhaps even a bit above it . " Writing in The Guardian 's sister paper , The Observer Maurice Richardson pondered if there had been " a deliberate moral reformation " of Bond . However , he notes Bond still has his harder side when needed . Richardson also thought that " in reforming Bond Mr. Fleming has reformed his own story @-@ telling which had been getting very loose " . Overall he thought that " <unk> is certainly the best Bond for several books . It is better plotted and retains its insane grip until the end " . 
 Raymond Mortimer , writing for The Sunday Times , said that " James Bond is what every man would like to be , and what every woman would like between her sheets " ; meanwhile the critic for The Times considered that after The Spy Who Loved Me , " On Her Majesty 's Secret Service constitutes a substantial , if not quite a complete , recovery . " In the view of the reviewer , it was enough of a recovery for them to point out that " it is time , perhaps , to forget the much exaggerated things which have been said about sex , sadism and snobbery , and return to the simple , indisputable fact that Mr. Fleming is a most compelling story @-@ teller . " Marghanita Laski , writing in The Times Literary Supplement thought that " the new James Bond we 've been meeting of late [ is ] somehow gentler , more sentimental , less dirty . " However , she considered that " it really is time to stop treating Ian Fleming as a Significant <unk> , and to accept him as a good , if rather vulgar thriller @-@ writer , well suited to his times and to us his readers . " 
 The New York Herald Tribune thought On Her Majesty 's Secret Service to be " solid Fleming " , while the Houston Chronicle considered the novel to be " Fleming at his <unk> murderous best , a notable chapter in the saga of James Bond " . Gene Brackley , writing in the Boston Globe wrote that Bond " needs all the quality he can muster to escape alive " from Blofeld 's clutches in the book and this gives rise to " two of the wildest chase scenes in the good guys @-@ bad guys literature " . Regarding the fantastic nature of the plots , Brackley considered that " Fleming 's accounts of the half @-@ world of the Secret Service have the ring of authenticity " because of his previous role with the NID . 
 Writing for The Washington Post , Jerry Doolittle thought that Bond is " still irresistible to women , still handsome in a menacing way , still charming . He has nerves of steel and <unk> of whipcord " , even if " he 's starting to look a little older . " Doolittle was fulsome in his praise for the novel , saying " Fleming 's new book will not disappoint his millions of fans " . Writing in The New York Times , Anthony Boucher — described by a Fleming biographer , John Pearson as " throughout an avid anti @-@ Bond and an anti @-@ Fleming man " — was again damning , although even he admitted that " you can 't argue with success " . However , he went on to say that " simply pro forma , I must set down my opinion that this is a silly and tedious novel . " Boucher went on to bemoan that although On Her Majesty 's Secret Service was better than The Spy Who Loved Me , " it is still a lazy and inadequate story " , going on to say that " my complaint is not that the adventures of James Bond are bad literature ... but that they aren 't good bad literature " . Boucher finished his review lamenting that " they just aren 't writing bad books like they used to . " 
 The opposite point of view was taken by Robert Kirsch , writing in the Los Angeles Times , who considered Fleming 's work to be a significant point in fiction , saying that the Bond novels " are harbingers of a change in emphasis in fiction which is important . " The importance , Kirsch claimed , sprung from " a revolution in taste , a return to qualities in fiction which all but submerged in the 20th @-@ century vogue of realism and naturalism " and the importance was such that they were " comparable ... only to the phenomenon of Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes stories " . Kirsch also believed that " with Fleming , ... we do not merely accept the willing suspension of disbelief , we yearn for it , we hunger for it . " The critic for Time magazine referred to previous criticism of Fleming and thought that " in Fleming 's latest Bond bombshell , there are disquieting signs that he took the critics to heart " when they complained about " the consumer snobbery of his caddish hero " . The critic mourned that even worse was to follow , however , when " Bond is threatened with what , for an international cad , would clearly be a fate worse than death : matrimony " . However , eventually a " deus ex machina ( the machine , reassuringly , is a lethal red Maserati ) ... saves James Bond from his better self . "

 = Yad Kennedy = 
 Yad Kennedy ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> ) , located in the <unk> Yehuda Region near Jerusalem , Israel , is a memorial to John F. Kennedy , the 35th President of the United States , who was assassinated in Dallas , Texas in 1963 . The 60 @-@ foot high ( 18 m ) memorial is shaped like the stump of a felled tree , symbolizing a life cut short . Inside is a bronze relief of Kennedy , with an eternal flame burning in the center . It is encircled by 51 concrete columns , one for each of the 50 states in the United States plus one for Washington , D.C. , that nation 's capital . The emblems of the states ( and of the District of Columbia ) are displayed on each of the columns , and the columns are separated by slim panels of glass . The monument measures approximately 250 feet ( 76 m ) in circumference around its base , and there is space within the memorial for approximately 100 visitors at a time . The monument was built in 1966 with funds donated by American Jewish communities . 
 Yad Kennedy and its adjoining picnic grounds are part of the John F. Kennedy Peace Forest . 
 = = Name = = 
 The Hebrew word yad , which is used for a number of memorials in Israel ( including the well @-@ known Holocaust memorial museum Yad Vashem ) , comes from the Book of Isaiah , chapter 56 , verse 5 : " And to them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name ( yad <unk> ) . " 
 = = Location = = 
 The site is located 7 miles ( 11 km ) from downtown Jerusalem , in the same general direction as Hadassah Medical Center , on top of the highest of the Jerusalem hills , at an elevation of 825 metres ( 2 @,@ 707 ft ) . The site overlooks what was at the time of the dedication the Jordanian village of <unk> ( now a part of Israel 's West Bank ) , the historic site of <unk> , famous as the last stronghold of the Jewish revolt led by Simon Bar Kochba against Roman forces in 132 – 135 CE . The view from the parking lot has been described in the Frommer 's travel guide as " breathtaking – a never @-@ ending succession of mountains and valleys . " On a clear day , the Mediterranean Sea can be seen in the direction of Tel Aviv , 40 miles ( 64 km ) away . The memorial can be reached by following the winding mountain roads past Ora and <unk> . It is approximately 45 minutes by foot from the nearest main road , where the closest Jerusalem city bus is # 20 , although special tour buses are normally utilized for group visits . 
 The monument and adjoining picnic grounds are part of the John F. Kennedy Peace Forest . The area designated as the JFK Peace Forest is part of the larger " <unk> Forest " , a 7 @,@ 000 @-@ dunam forest in Ein <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 Max Bressler of Chicago , Illinois , then president of the American Jewish National Fund , came up with the proposal for the memorial in 1964 . Bressler , for whom the Jerusalem neighborhood of Kiryat Menachem is named , had hoped to lead an American delegation to the dedication ceremony , but he died in 1966 . 
 = = = Fundraising = = = 
 On 13 January 1964 , former Pennsylvania Governor George M. Leader announced plans for the memorial , stating that he would serve as the General Chair of a State committee to raise funds . He stated that similar committees would be set up in each State , as well as some additional committees in countries overseas . On 22 November 1964 , the first anniversary of the assassination , the Jewish National Fund sponsored meetings in major Jewish communities throughout the United States . The meetings were described as tributes for the fallen President as well as symbolic dedication ceremonies for the planned memorial . 
 American communities pledged to fund the planting of trees in the forest in addition to funds for the memorial . For example , in July 1965 , the community of Los Angeles , California pledged to have 100 @,@ 000 trees planted as a result of a banquet sponsored by JNF attended by more than 1000 government , union , and management leaders . 
 = = = Dedication = = = 
 Nearly 2000 people , including many official guests representing the Israeli and United States governments , came to witness the dedication , along with hundreds of tourists , American students , and Israelis . 
 An Israeli children 's band played <unk> , the Israeli national anthem , along with the U.S. anthem , the Star Spangled Banner . The New York Times reported that the children " tried valiantly " to play the U.S. song , playing very slowly , but then many strong voices from among the crowd helped out until the music " swept the audience . " 
 Among the guests at the 4 July 1966 dedication was U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren , who had chaired the commission tasked with investigating the 1963 assassination . Among other guests were Levi Eshkol , Prime Minister of Israel , Teddy Kollek , the mayor of Jerusalem , and Walworth Barbour , the United States Ambassador to Israel . 
 Chief Justice Warren , who was reported to be so enthusiastic about the memorial after actually seeing it for the first time that he rewrote his remarks , noted : 
 " We choose to do this on the American Independence Day but also in honor of the independence of Israel and other free nations . We are all confronted here by history because this is the birthplace of the world 's three religions on which our own civilization is based and which contributed the all @-@ important principle that all people are God 's children and entitled to live in peace . " 
 Warren noted that Washington , D.C. had many memorials , but that this area , with the forest as a " living memorial , " would have " greatly pleased " Kennedy for two reasons . First , Kennedy himself had spoken of the importance of planting trees in Israel , when he had addressed a 1958 Jewish National Fund meeting while serving as a junior Senator from Massachusetts , saying , " What work could be more heartwarming or more enduring than the great forest at Jerusalem . Your children and grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument " . Second , Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice , the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate , and the second time in 1951 . Speaking in 1951 of the differences between the people he witnessed during those two visits , he said that " Perhaps the greatest change of all I found in the hearts and minds of the people , For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope . I found a revival of an ancient spirit " . Warren concluded his remarks by saying he would use the same word that President Kennedy would have used : " Shalom . " 
 Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol spoke as well , noting that Kennedy 's memory would be kept alive by this memorial " not only as a friend of Israel but also as a symbol of the lofty ideals of his country and of all humanity , " dedicating the memorial to " the man who opened new frontiers of international relations and human friendships . " 
 In remarks offered by the American ambassador to Israel , Walworth Barbour , he noted that " A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors . In thus honoring and remembering the late President Kennedy , the men and women of the Jewish National Fund honor <unk> and above the glory they have already earned in their work for Israel . " 
 Jacob <unk> , world president of the Jewish National Fund , praised the memorial as well , " conceived in the shape of a mighty trunk of a fallen tree , among the thousands of saplings which will grow one day into a great forest . " 
 = = Design = = 
 Yad Kennedy was designed by the Brazilian @-@ born Israeli architect David Resnick , who later won the 1995 Israel Prize in architecture , and the Ukrainian @-@ born Israeli sculptor Dov <unk> . <unk> created the bust of Kennedy along with a memorial wall that includes excerpts from a number of Kennedy 's speeches . Resnick said that " the entire complex is intended to symbolize the vigor of a great man whose life was tragically ended in mid @-@ growth by assassination " . 
 Resnick was awarded the contract to design the memorial after a nationwide competition . His initial vision for the memorial was a " free form " but generally circular shape , set within a reflecting pool . However , because money was being raised for the memorial by groups in all 50 states in the U.S. , as well as groups in Washington , D.C. , a vision of columns for each of those locations ultimately helped him come up with the concept of a tree trunk , linked to the idea that Kennedy 's life had been cut down like a tree that is felled in its prime . The courtyard below the memorial includes a number of plaques acknowledging contributions by individuals and groups . 
 In addition to the Kennedy relief and eternal flame , papers and photographs relating to the subject of Israel @-@ United States relations until the time of Kennedy 's assassination are kept in a small library . 
 In 1974 , a picnic site was added on the grounds of the memorial , open to visitors . The JNF announced that the site would " include rustic benches and tables , water facilities and shaded eating areas , " and would be " close to the impressive stone and metal memorial – but far enough away not to pollute the area . " 
 = = Kennedy Peace Forest = = 
 The Kennedy Peace Forest was dedicated before the memorial , with official dedication ceremonies taking place on 22 November 1964 , on the first anniversary of Kennedy 's assassination . 
 In June 1966 Jewish National Fund officials announced that 1 @.@ 5 million trees had already been planted in the forest in preparation for the memorial 's planned 4 July dedication ceremonies . The announcement noted that another 2 million trees had been planted in the adjoining " United States Freedom Forest , " with a goal of planting 5 @.@ 5 million trees in the two forests , as a number equal to the Jewish population of the United States . More than three million dollars in donations had been received at that point for the Kennedy Forest , from more than 100 @,@ 000 donors . 
 In June 1968 , the JNF announced it would plant 500 @,@ 000 trees in the Kennedy Forest in memory of John F. Kennedy 's brother , Robert F. Kennedy , assassinated on 6 June of that year . In 1999 , JNF announced that trees would also be planted in memory of John F. Kennedy , Jr . , his wife Carolyn Bessette @-@ Kennedy , and sister @-@ in @-@ law Lauren Bessette , all victims of a 16 July 1999 plane crash in the ocean off Martha 's Vineyard , Massachusetts . 
 In April 1989 a forest fire ( possibly the result of arson ) destroyed approximately 8 acres ( 3 @.@ 2 ha ) and 3000 trees in the forest . 
 = = Special events = = 
 Among the many special events that have taken place at the memorial was a visit by a number of officers and crew members from the United States aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy ( <unk> ) , named in honor of the same U.S. President memorialized by this monument , during a 1997 port visit to Haifa . 
 = = = Tree planting = = = 
 A VIP Kennedy Memorial tree planting center is included on the grounds of the memorial , where many distinguished visitors from other countries have planted trees . In May 1978 Jacqueline Kennedy , widow of the president , visited the memorial and planted a tree in the forest . Other members of the Kennedy family who have visited the memorial and planted trees include U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy ( JFK 's brother ) , on 11 December 1986 ; Joan Kennedy ( Teddy Kennedy 's first wife ) , on 24 January 1983 ; and Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. and his sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend ( JFK 's nephew and niece ; children of Robert F. Kennedy ) , on 1 January 1987 . A special " Kennedy Family Planting Circle " was established by the Jewish National Fund . In 2001 Kennedy 's daughter Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , then Lieutenant Governor of Maryland , visited Yad Kennedy during her tour of Israel with her husband and three of her four daughters . 
 Visiting American military personnel are among those who plant trees at the memorial because of its remembrance of an American president . Among those who have planted trees at the site are former Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States Army , Navy , and Air Force . 
 Israeli groups also take part in the tree planting tradition , especially on the Jewish holiday of Tu Bishvat , an occasion linked to trees . On some occasions as many as 4000 Israeli school children have come to the Kennedy Peace Forest to plant trees on that holiday . 
 In addition to individual or group tree plantings , there have been special occasions when smaller " forests " have been dedicated within the larger John F. Kennedy Peace Forest . For example , as early as January 1966 , even before the dedication of the memorial , a forest was planted in honor of Ambassador Avraham Harman , Israel 's ambassador to the United States . The " Avraham Harman Forest " was contributed by Bnai Zion , a pro @-@ Israel " fraternal group " in the U.S. , and Golda Meir , newly retired from her post as Israel 's Prime Minister , was one of the participants in the dedication ceremony . 
 Other specially designated areas within the larger John F. Kennedy Peace Forest include a " woodland " set up to memorialize the victims of the 1972 Lydda airport ( now named Ben Gurion International Airport ) terrorist attack .

 " Peter @-@ assment " was broadcast on March 21 , 2010 , as a part of an animated television night on Fox , and was preceded by The Simpsons and Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane 's spin @-@ off series The Cleveland Show . It was also followed by the short @-@ lived live @-@ action series Sons of Tucson . It was watched by 6 @.@ 65 million viewers , according to Nielsen ratings , despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on ABC , The Amazing Race on CBS and Celebrity Apprentice on NBC . The episode also acquired a 3 @.@ 5 / 8 rating in the 18 – 49 demographic , beating The Simpsons , The Cleveland Show and Sons of Tucson , in addition to significantly edging out all three shows in total viewership . The episode 's ratings decreased slightly from the previous week 's episode , " Go Stewie Go " . 
 Reviews of the episode were mostly mixed , calling the storyline " a string of poorly executed jokes with some mild successes sprinkled here and there . " Ramsey Isler of IGN also called out the episode as " a mashed together mess of two stories that would have worked much better separately , " in addition to praising actress Carrie Fisher in her returning role as Angela . In a subsequent review of Family Guy 's eighth season , Isler listed " Peter @-@ assment " as being " full of the lowest of the lowest @-@ common @-@ denominator " jokes " , with heavy reliance on toilet humor and the characteristic cutaway gags that have steadily gotten more random and less funny . " In a simultaneous review of The Simpsons episode " Stealing First Base " and The Cleveland Show episode " Once Upon a Tyne in New York " that preceded " Peter @-@ assment " , Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the storyline a " junk drawer , " criticizing the writers ' overuse of jokes , " in the hopes some of them [ would ] land . " Jason Hughes of TV Squad also criticized the storyline , saying the interaction between Peter and Angela " went to pretty uncomfortable levels , " while praising the episode for " [ showing ] us that harassment can and does go both ways .

 In reaction to the opening musical number about Terri Schiavo , Schiavo 's brother , Bobby Schindler , Jr . , said , " My family was astonished at the cruelty and bigotry towards our beloved sister , and all disabled people that we witnessed in this show . My first thought was how this attempt at satire must have been enormously difficult and painful for my mother . " He continued , " The depiction of Terri in the Family Guy episode on March 21 is not only inaccurate , it seems to take the position that certain people are simply not worthy of receiving medical care because they are viewed as burdens on the health care system . " In addition , Schindler has also stated that he hopes to soon enlist the aid of other advocacy groups to protest the episode , " and perhaps see some sponsors end support of the show . " Other pro @-@ life activists , including Jill Stanek , wrote of the opening , " Last night 's episode of Family Guy opened with a truly shocking scene [ ... ] This is the same television series that had an abortion episode canceled in August 2009 .

 = 2004 Istanbul summit = 
 The 2004 Istanbul summit was held in Istanbul , Turkey from June 28 to June 29 , 2004 . It was the 17th NATO summit in which NATO 's Heads of State and Governments met to make formal decisions about security topics . In general , the summit is seen as a continuation of the transformation process that began in the 2002 Prague summit , which hoped to create a shift from a Cold War alliance against Soviet aggression to a 21st @-@ century coalition against new and out @-@ of @-@ area security threats . The summit consisted of four meetings . 
 NATO members welcomed seven new alliance members during the North Atlantic Council meeting , decided to expand the alliance 's presence in the War in Afghanistan and to end its presence in Bosnia , agreed to assist Iraq with training , launched a new partnership initiative and adopted measures to improve NATO ’ s operational capabilities . 
 The NATO @-@ Russia Council meeting was mostly noted by the absence of both Russian president Vladimir Putin and of any progress concerning the ratification of the adapted CFE treaty or the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia and Moldova . NATO leaders further welcomed progress made by Ukraine towards membership in the NATO @-@ Ukraine Commission meeting and discussed some general and mostly symbolic topics with its non @-@ NATO counterparts during the Euro @-@ Atlantic Partnership Council meeting . 
 Due to Turkish government fears of a terrorist attack , security measures during the summit were tight . Demonstrators from around the world gathered to protest against NATO or the American foreign policy under the George W. Bush Administration , while the summit itself was blown off the front pages of the world press by the unexpected transfer of Iraqi sovereignty , coinciding with the first day of the NATO summit on June 28 . 
 = = Security measures = = 
 Unprecedented security measures were made by the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks . They especially feared a repetition of the Istanbul bombings of 2003 that killed more than 60 people . Their fear was proven by the arrest of 16 people in Bursa in early May on suspicion of planning to bomb the summit . Police seized guns , explosives , bomb @-@ making booklets and 4 @,@ 000 compact discs with training advice from Osama Bin Laden , and believed that the suspects were members of the radical Islamic group Ansar al @-@ Islam , thought to be linked with al @-@ Qaeda . On June 24 two bombs also exploded . One bomb went off in a bus in Istanbul killing 4 people ( including the bomber ) , the other outside a hotel in Ankara where US president George W. Bush would be staying . Additionally , on June 25 , explosives were found in a parked car at Istanbul 's main airport . 
 Security measures included Turkish war ships and Turkish commandos in rubber boats patrolling the Bosporus , AWACS surveillance planes and F @-@ 16 warplanes circling above the city in order to monitor a no @-@ fly zone over the city , and the assignment of 23 @,@ 000 to 24 @,@ 000 police officers , supported by police helicopters and armoured vehicles . The Bosphorus Strait was also closed to oil tankers , the underground rail system was suspended and whole city districts were sealed off . Nevertheless , a small bomb or explosive devise blew up on an empty Turkish Airlines plane on June 29 as workers were cleaning it at the main Istanbul airport . Three of the workers were slightly injured . 
 The extent of disruption caused by the security measures was criticized by several Turkish newspapers . The newspaper <unk> for instance called the situation " a total disgrace " and commented that Istanbul and Ankara looked like " ghost cities for a couple of days , imprisoning the people , emptying the streets and stopping boats from leaving . " The newspaper further added that people died because emergency services were unable to reach them . 
 = = Demonstrations = = 
 During June , there was a surge in demonstrations against the upcoming NATO summit , resulting in almost daily protests in Turkey . For instance on June 16 , Turkish riot police detained some 40 people during a demonstration and on June 21 , police used water cannon , tear gas and armoured vehicles to disperse activists who barricaded streets and threw petrol bombs . Throughout June , anti @-@ NATO protestors from around the world gathered at Istanbul to demonstrate . 
 Protests included opposition to US foreign policy ( especially opposition against the US @-@ led Afghanistan War and the Iraq War ) , opposition to NATO 's presence in the Balkans , opposition against NATO itself or against a new role for NATO , opposition against the continuing existence of nuclear weapons , and claims the USA abused NATO to support its policies in Afghanistan , Iraq and the wider Middle East . 
 A day before the summit , US president George W. Bush traveled to Ankara , the capital of Turkey for advance meetings with Turkish leaders . Then and during the summit demonstrations became larger and tens of thousands of Turks demonstrated in the streets of Istanbul . On June 28 , demonstrators tried to disrupt the NATO meeting by staging several simultaneous mass demonstrations around the city . Riot police sprayed tear gas at anti @-@ NATO demonstrators as protesters and police clashed in running street battles . At least 30 people , including five police officers , were injured when anti @-@ NATO protesters throwing stones and petrol bombs clashed with riot police . Some 20 persons were detained in these protests . The police broke up a smaller crowd , detaining at least six persons , in the <unk> area when they tried to march towards the summit about 3 km to the south . In a separate protest , Greenpeace activists , dangling from a bridge over the Bosphorus Strait , unfurled a 30 @-@ meter banner showing a dove of peace with a nuclear missile in its beak and the phrase " Nukes out of NATO " . 
 = = Summit meetings = = 
 June 2004 was arguably of the most intense months of <unk> in the history of transatlantic relations . The NATO summit followed on the D @-@ Day 's 60th anniversary celebrations in Normandy ( France ) on June 6 ; on the 30th G8 summit from June 8 until June 10 in Georgia ( United States ) ; and on the meetings with EU leaders in Dublin ( Ireland ) on June 24 . 
 The 2004 Istanbul summit consisted of four main meetings , all held in the Istanbul <unk> <unk> Convention and Exhibition Center : the North Atlantic Council ( NATO 's highest decision @-@ making body , attended by heads of state and government from each of the 26 Alliance member countries ) ; the NATO @-@ Russia Council ( which met only at the level of foreign ministers , since Russian President Vladimir Putin stayed away , reflecting ongoing tension between NATO and Russia over NATO enlargement and the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty ) ; the NATO @-@ Ukraine Commission ; and the Euro @-@ Atlantic Partnership Council ( 46 countries including many former Eastern bloc and former Soviet states ) . 
 Besides these meetings , several visits and question sessions were made on June 26 and June 27 , and several press conferences by heads of government of state or government were made after or in between the above @-@ mentioned meetings . Once the North Atlantic Council meeting on June 28 was concluded , a statement called the " Istanbul Declaration : Our security in a new era " was issued . In this statement the leaders summarized the main conclusions of the discussions . 
 Almost forgotten in coverage of the summit was that six new members from the former Warsaw Pact – Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia , Slovakia , Bulgaria and Romania – joined NATO in March 2004 and were formally welcomed into the Alliance .

 Several days before the summit , NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer described Afghanistan as " priority number one " . During the summit , NATO members officially agreed that the NATO @-@ led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) would take on command of four additional Provincial Reconstruction Teams ( PRTs ) ( one in Mazar @-@ e @-@ Sharif , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , falling short of the initial target of five . Until then ISAF only provided security in around the capital city Kabul and commanded one PRT in Kunduz . The 26 members agreed to contribute between them an additional 600 troops ( 23 @.@ 08 per country ) and three helicopters to the Afghan mission . The three helicopters came from Turkey , and had gone back within three months . NATO also vowed to beef up its Afghanistan peace force from 6 @,@ 500 to 10 @,@ 000 to help make the Afghan presidential election , 2004 secure , but no actual agreement for that many additional troops was made .

 NATO members agreed to end the NATO @-@ led Stabilisation Force ( SFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina , which began its mission in 1996 . NATO stressed that it would maintain a presence in the country to assist in certain areas such as defence reform , or the pursuit of persons indicted for war crimes . Heads of State and Government also welcomed a decision by the European Union to establish a follow @-@ on mission , which would take over the 7 @,@ 500 @-@ member mission and which will be supported by NATO under existing NATO @-@ EU agreements . 
 = = = = Middle East = = = = 
 The summit marked a shift in Alliance priorities towards greater involvement in the Middle East , a strategically important region , whose security and stability was regarded as closely linked to the Euro @-@ Atlantic security . The existing Mediterranean Dialogue ( MD ) cooperation was broadened , and two new major engagements were launched : the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative ( ICI ) and a training mission for Iraqi troops . 
 = = = = = Iraq troop training = = = = = 
 The summit was dominated by divisions over the Iraq war as NATO members were only able to agree to limited assistance in the form of training for Iraqi security forces . The NATO support given to Iraq troop training was in response to a request by the Iraqi Interim Government , and in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 , which requests international and regional organisations to contribute assistance to the multinational force . Even this limited agreement contained areas of contention , with France insisting that it would only help with training outside Iraq , while the United States favored that the training would take place inside Iraq . As a consequence , the deal was left deliberately vague and differences remained on whether NATO should train Iraqi officers inside Iraq , or limit itself to training outside the country and acting as a clearing house for national efforts . The commitment was also vague as it was not made clear what the size of the training mission would be or exactly when and where it would take place . German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder , known for his earlier opposition to the Iraq War , commented : " The engagement of NATO is reduced to training and only training . We have made clear that we don 't want to see German soldiers in Iraq . " Despite outwardly optimistic statements by the US concerning NATO 's commitment towards Iraqi troop training after the summit , France and Germany had refused to share the burden of responsibility for the situation in Iraq and did not support the US and British demand for sending NATO troops . Put differently , participation in the multinational forces in Iraq was left to the discretion of the particular alliance members and the USA <unk> consented to troop training outside Iraq . Consequently , despite an outward show of NATO unity , the split over Iraq still persisted and tensions in interstate relations within the alliance were not resolved .

 NATO 's leaders invited their Mediterranean Dialogue ( MD ) partners ( Algeria , Egypt , Israel , Jordan , Mauritania , Morocco and Tunisia ) to elevate the MD to a genuine partnership by establishing a more ambitious and expanded framework for cooperation . This cooperation would be guided by the principle of joint ownership and taking into consideration their particular interests and needs . 
 = = = = = Istanbul Cooperation Initiative = = = = = 
 NATO leaders also decided to launch the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative ( ICI ) with selected states in the Greater Middle East , thus exceeding a Mediterranean scope . The initiative was an offer to engage in practical security cooperation activities with these states and each interested country would be considered by the North Atlantic Council on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis and on its own merit . The words " country " and " countries " in the ICI document do not exclude participation of the Palestinian Authority , but such partnership would be - like any other partnership - subject to the North Atlantic Council ’ s approval . 
 This initiative stands alongside NATO 's Partnership for Peace Program and the Mediterranean Dialogue . NATO members regard these partnerships as a response to the new challenges of the 21st century and as a complement to the G8 and US @-@ EU decisions to support calls for reform from within the Broader Middle East region . The ICI offers practical cooperation with interested nations in the Greater Middle East in such areas as : counter @-@ WMD ; counterterrorism ; training and education ; participation in NATO exercises ; the promotion of military interoperability ; disaster preparedness and civil emergency planning ; tailored advice on defense reform and civil @-@ military relations ; and cooperation on border security to help prevent illicit trafficking of drugs , weapons , and people .

 NATO leaders endorsed measures to improve NATO ’ s ability to take on operations when and where necessary , committing themselves to be able at all times to deploy and sustain larger proportions of their forces on operations in order to ensure that NATO has a permanently available pool of assets and forces that can deployed . They also endorsed changes to NATO ’ s defence planning , hoping that the Alliance ’ s long @-@ term defence planning process would become more flexible , thereby helping member countries generate forces that can reach further , faster and still take on the full range of missions .

 NATO leaders hoped to boost the Alliance ’ s anti @-@ terrorism efforts with an agreement to improve intelligence sharing and to develop new , high @-@ tech defences against terrorist attacks . NATO members committed themselves to improve intelligence sharing through a Terrorist Threat Intelligence Unit . This Unit , created after the September 11 attacks , became permanent and . Its function is to analyze general terrorist threats , as well as those that are more specifically aimed at NATO . NATO also pledged itself to stand ready to assist any member country in dealing with potential or real terrorist attacks . The Alliance ’ s AWACS early warning radar aircraft and Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defence Battalion would be made available to any member that requests such assistance . Heads of State and Government also gave direction to develop a package of high @-@ tech capabilities to protect civilians and forces from terrorist attacks . 
 = = = NATO @-@ Russia Council meeting ( June 28 ) = = = 
 = = = = Linkage between the CFE ratification and the OSCE obligations = = = = 
 Discussions with Russia on NATO concessions in return for Russian President Vladimir Putin 's attendance had been underway for some months before the summit , and intensified as the summit date drew closer . On May 17 , in the run @-@ up to the NATO summit , NATO Secretary @-@ General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer indicated in a speech that Putin signalled that he might honor the summit with his presence if " the conditions will be right " . It is unclear what conditions were under discussion , but it is speculated that Putin 's conditions included an enhanced Russian role in NATO decision @-@ making through the NATO @-@ Russia Council ( NRC ) , NATO acceptance of Russia 's continued military presence in Moldova and Georgia ( the withdrawal of these troops was an obligation Russia had assumed at the Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe 's ( OSCE ) 1999 Istanbul summit ) ; a move of NATO members to ratify that same treaty and to place the three Baltic states , that joined NATO in March 2004 , under military restrictions . As Putin did not receive satisfaction in discussions ahead of the NATO summit - at least not to the extent that he hoped , he refused to attend the meeting . When NATO officials indicated that Putin would probably not attend the summit , Russia 's Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov reacted on the same day ( June 2 ) by stressing the importance that Moscow attaches to enhancing its role in NRC and that Russia had not declined the invitation to attend the NRC meeting . Due to the replacement of Putin by Lavrov , the meeting was not held at the level of the Heads of State and Government ( as normally would be the case ) , but at the level of foreign ministers . 
 On June 26 , two days before the summit , US Under Secretary of State R. Nicholas Burns and US Ambassador to Russia Alexander <unk> wrote a joint newspaper article in which they commented that the relations between NATO and Russia were good and that NATO and Russia took " a little @-@ noticed but enormous step in our maturing partnership " , referring to " Exercise Kaliningrad 2004 " which brought together some 1 @,@ 000 personnel from 22 NATO member and partner countries for a terrorism response exercise . In practice , several rifts between Russia and NATO were visible and became increasingly more so during the summit . One rift existed about NATO 's non @-@ ratification of the adapted CFE treaty and Russia 's non @-@ fulfillment of its OSCE obligations ( the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova and Georgia ) . Even before the summit commenced , the rift was visible as US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld stopped , en route to Istanbul , in Moldova where he called for the withdrawal of Russian forces from the country . Another reason for tension was the accession of seven Eastern European states to NATO in March 2004 and NATO 's increasing cooperation with other Eastern European and Caucasian states . On June 27 , Russia warned NATO to respect its security interests and expressed concern over NATO 's stepped up activity in the Caucasus and Central Asia . 
 During the NRC meeting , NATO leaders and NATO 's Secretary General made a clear linkage between their Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty ( adapted CFE treaty ) ratification and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova and Georgia , and took no notice of Russia ’ s proposals for the earliest possible entry into force of the treaty and Russia 's ratification on the eve of the summit . According to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov these withdrawal demands were incorrect , because " the political understandings did not set any time limit for physical action " . Put differently , Russia denied that it made clear commitments to withdraw its forces from Georgia and Moldova , a policy to which it adhered since 2002 , and reaffirmed its policy of seeking bilateral agreement with Georgia on the status and functioning of Russian military bases in that country . In addition , Russia argued that it faced new threats on its southern borders : the possibility of missile launches from Iran and the expansion of Islamist terrorism , which required - in the perspective of Russia - Russian military presence in Georgia and Armenia . Colonel Anatoli <unk> , Head of Russia 's Military Forecasting Center , argued that NATO took no notice of Russia 's position because NATO 's leaders still had the same mental stereotypes that took shape during the Cold War ; that a large part of the Western elite still regarded Russia as a kind of USSR , ignoring the fact that Russia has not only new borders , but also new aspirations , new international partners , and new threats . These stereotypes could have wittingly or unwittingly affected the relations in the NATO @-@ Russia Council .

 On Iraq , Lavrov proposed to hold a general conference with the participation of all Iraqi political forces ( including all opposition forces and including the " armed resistance to the occupation " ) and Iraq 's neighboring countries and the international community , including Russia . Regarding Afghanistan , Lavrov expressed the interest of Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States in suppressing terrorism and called for " establishing ties " and " developing cooperation " between NATO and the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) . Both proposals received at most a lukewarm response by NATO leaders . 
 = = = NATO @-@ Ukraine Commission meeting ( June 29 ) = = = 
 This meeting was between NATO leaders and president of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma . NATO members expressed appreciation for Ukraine ’ s contributions to NATO @-@ led and other international peace support efforts such as KFOR . Ukraine also offered to support Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean ( a naval operation of NATO which is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction ) , an offer which NATO would consider . Defence cooperation between NATO and Ukraine was reviewed and the possible launching of a Partnership for Peace Trust Fund to help Ukraine destroy the surplus munitions , small arms and light weapons was discussed . 
 NATO further welcomed Ukraine ’ s desire to achieve full integration into NATO , but stressed that this would require more than troop contributions and defence reform . This would require showing commitment to the values that underpin the Alliance ( democracy , rule of law , freedom of speech and media , and fair elections ) as was foreseen in the NATO @-@ Ukraine Action Plan , which was adopted during the 2002 Prague Summit . In particular NATO Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer criticized Kuchma 's record on freedom of press and preparations for the Ukrainian presidential election of November 2004 . 
 = = = Euro @-@ Atlantic Partnership Council meeting ( June 29 ) = = = 
 This meeting was mostly symbolic and did not have any concrete proposals or results . Nevertheless , some policies or earlier decisions were reaffirmed or emphasized . First of all , the Euro @-@ Atlantic Partnership Council ( EAPC ) Heads of State and Government met with President Hamid Karzai of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan and discussed the progress in that country , and recognized the valuable role played by both Allies and Partners who make up the ISAF , but also emphasized that much remains to be done for Afghanistan to become a peaceful and stable country , fully integrated into the international community . Secondly , the commitment of the Euro @-@ Atlantic community to peace , security and stability in the Balkans was reaffirmed . Further , the presence of the Heads of State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro at their meeting as observers was welcomed , and these leaders were urged them to meet the outstanding conditions set for Partnership for Peace membership by Allies . Thirdly , the resolve to fight terrorism was reaffirmed and some initiatives aimed at increasing the EAPC ’ s contribution in this fight were taken , thereby endorsing the further implementation of the Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism . 
 Fourthly , support for a major report on the future development of the Euro @-@ Atlantic Partnership , which outlines the core objectives of Partnership ( political dialogue and practical co @-@ operation , the promotion of democratic values across the Euro @-@ Atlantic area , preparing interested Partners for participation in NATO @-@ led operations and support Partners who wish to join the Alliance ) . Fifthly , the commitment to building a Partnership which would be tailored to the different needs of individual Partners was reaffirmed . In this respect , NATO 's intention to place a special focus on relations with the states of the Caucasus and Central Asia was welcomed , including the decision by the Alliance to appoint one liaison officer for each region . They also welcomed the launching of the Individual Partnership Action Plan process by several states of these two regions . Sixthly , NATO 's Policy on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings , which was developed in consultation with the EAPC partners , was endorsed . 
 The absence of Armenian president Robert Kocharyan drew some media attention . Kocharyan refused to join the summit in order to draw the alliance 's attention to problems in relations between the Turkey and Armenia , in particular Turkey 's refusal to consider the deaths of almost one million Armenians during World War I a genocide . 
 = = Announcement of the transfer of Iraqi sovereignty = = 
 While the transfer of Iraqi sovereignty was not decided during the summit , this transfer had some connections to the summit . First of all , the news of the unexpected transfer was made public during the summit . BBC News reports that Iraq 's foreign minister <unk> <unk> , speaking after a breakfast meeting with Blair in Istanbul on June 28 , " slipped " prematurely that the handover of sovereignty to his country was being brought forward to coincide with the meeting . Later that day , US National Security advisor Condoleezza Rice gave US president Bush during the summit the following note : " Mr. President , Iraq is sovereign . Letter was passed from [ Paul ] Bremer at 10 : 26 am Iraq time - <unk> " . Bush scribbled in the margin of this note : " Let freedom reign ! " . Bush then turned to British prime minister Tony Blair , seated next to him , whispered that the handover had happened , and the two men shook hands . Later that day , Bush and Blair held a joint press conference , in which they welcomed the transfer . Secondly , the news of the handover pushed the summit from the front pages . 
 = = Reviews = = 
 The international media reported that expectations for a successful summit were deliberately set low , because NATO leaders wanted to avoid a flare @-@ up over the Iraq War . Therefore , they agreed to meet the modest goals the Alliance had already set for itself in trying to stabilize Afghanistan , and endorsed a tepid version of the Bush administration ’ s initiative to promote modernization and democracy in the Arab world . The newspaper further commented that the summit had " a sort of " Waiting for Godot " quality about it — European leaders biding time , neither creating a crisis nor mending fences , in the hope that the American election in November will somehow spare them from the choice between having to deal with Bush and letting Iraq , and NATO , slide into further disarray . " Other analysis were even more critical : " There have been NATO summits at which neither a special occasion was acknowledged nor decisions of particular relevance made . One example is the NATO summit in Istanbul in 2004 , where the concluded measures hardly required a meeting of the heads of state and government , and the media presence was not justified by the agreed @-@ upon resolutions . " US and other government officials however emphasized that the summit was significant in terms of the alliance 's unprecedented outreach beyond its traditional North Atlantic focus and its aggressive emphasis on force planning to tackle new challenges worldwide . 
 Whether or not the summit is considered important for its content , the meeting held some symbolic importance . First of all , it was the first NATO summit between the leaders of the North @-@ American and Western European states , and Eastern European states , states that were finally , after decades of Cold War tensions , together in the same alliance . The media attention that these new members received during the summit , opened public debates about whether there was still a consensus about the purpose , the perceived threats and the future borders of NATO among its 26 members . That this was not the case , became clear in the run @-@ up to the 2006 Riga Summit . Secondly , the holding of the summit in Istanbul made it the most eastern summit in NATO 's history . It marked the increasingly key role played by Turkey as a major strategic hub due to its location close to the hotbeds of tension and conflict in the South Caucasus and the Middle East . The location of the summit made clear that NATO ’ s security concerns had shifted towards the southeastern part of the European continent . By shifting eastwards , the Alliance ’ s centre of gravity ventured into very different areas from those on which the Cold War military NATO had focused . 
 NATO 's 2004 Istanbul summit was also remarkably silent on the subject of nuclear weapons policy and non @-@ proliferation , as opposed to pre @-@ summit diplomacy and earlier post @-@ Cold War NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul . In June 2004 , shortly before the summit , NATO issued two fact sheets on nuclear policy , portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 Nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty Review Conference . In practice , no real changes since the end of the Cold War were implemented , as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged , and as Cold War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force . Additionally , no changes were made to Alliance nuclear policy since the 1999 Strategic Concept .

 In 2002 , Beyoncé went to Miami , Florida , in the United States , to work with American record producer Scott Storch for her debut solo album , Dangerously in Love . She and Storch wrote " Baby Boy " , with contributions from American songwriter Robert Waller and Beyoncé 's then @-@ boyfriend , hip hop artist Jay Z. The song also contains a lyrical interpolation of " No Fear " by hip hop group <unk> used towards the ending of the song : " We steppin ' in hotter this year " . 
 Once the track was supposedly done , Beyoncé had the idea that it would be " perfect " if Jamaican reggae artist Sean Paul contributed a vocal track . Beyoncé contacted Paul about a possible collaboration for " Baby Boy " . Sean Paul agreed , and flew in from Jamaica to join the recording sessions of the song . He contributed a toast verse , and they finished recording " Baby Boy " in March 2003 , during the later stages of the album 's recording .

Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly noted that " ' Baby Boy ' goes full @-@ tilt Bollywood ' n da hood , with Sean Paul ripping a pulsing tabla raga " . Beyoncé 's vocals are accompanied by <unk> and <unk> @-@ sounding beats , synthesized handclaps and slaps . According to Roger Friedman of Fox News Channel , " Baby Boy " is based on the 1995 reggae song " Here Comes the <unk> " , performed by Jamaican singer Ini Kamoze . 
 " Baby Boy " is considered to be a sequel in ways to " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " ; a 2002 Jay @-@ Z song featuring Beyoncé . The lyrics detail a woman 's fantasies , and in keeping with the album 's overall theme , Beyoncé 's deemed them as personal to her . Paul remarked , " She 's telling me about her fantasies and picturing me and her going here and there , all over the world ... I 'm answering back , like , ' I 'm wit it ' . " The lyrics are constructed in the toast – chorus – verse form ; Sean Paul performs the toasting while Beyoncé sings all other verses and choruses . The pattern is repeated twice ; a further chorus and verse follow , resolving at the toasting and final verse .

 = = Copyright infringement lawsuit = = 
 In 2005 , US singer @-@ songwriter Jennifer Armour filed a copyright infringement lawsuit , claiming that Beyoncé had used some lyrics and the musical hook from her song " Got a Little Bit of Love for You " . In 2003 , Armour 's former label manager had submitted a demo recordings to record labels , including Beyoncé 's Columbia Records and Sean Paul 's Atlantic Records . According to the district court , an Expert witness ( Chair , Dept. of Music Theory & Composition , Shepherd School of Music , Rice University ) determined the songs to be " substantially similar " ( a requirement for an infringement finding ) . With regard to the musical hook , the Expert stated in his report , " When the aural comparisons of the two songs are presented in the key of C Minor ( for easy comparison ) and presented back @-@ to @-@ back , in A – B – A – B fashion , even the least musically inclined listener should immediately determine that the two songs are strikingly similar ; I <unk> that many listeners may even perceive them as being the same song ! And again , transposing a song for this purpose does not alter any fundamental qualities or characteristics of the song but merely assists the ability of those unfamiliar with the technicalities of music in making a comparison . " The district court judge nonetheless ruled that she , herself , could not hear the similarities between the two songs and dismissed the case , denying the motion for the songs or case to be heard by a jury . 
 On appeal , the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court 's ruling , but ruled with different reasoning . It held that there was no infringement based on Beyoncé 's claim that Armour 's demo tape was received shortly after the writing of Beyoncé 's song had been substantially completed . However , the court did not address the issue of substantial similarity .

 = William Adam ( architect ) = 
 William Adam ( 1689 – 24 June 1748 ) was a Scottish architect , mason , and entrepreneur . He was the foremost architect of his time in Scotland , designing and building numerous country houses and public buildings , and often acting as contractor as well as architect . Among his best known works are Hopetoun House near Edinburgh , and Duff House in Banff . His individual , exuberant style built on the Palladian style , but with Baroque details inspired by Vanbrugh and Continental architecture . 
 In the 18th century , Adam was considered Scotland 's " Universal Architect " . However , since the early 20th century , architectural critics have taken a more measured view , Colin McWilliam , for instance , finding the quality of his work " varied to an extreme degree " . As well as being an architect , Adam was involved in several industrial ventures and improvement schemes , including coal mining , salt panning , stone quarries and mills . In 1731 he began to build up his own estate in Kinross @-@ shire , which he named Blair Adam . He was the father of three architects ; John , Robert and James , the last two were the developers of the " Adam style " . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 William Adam was born in Linktown of Abbotshall , now a neighbourhood of Kirkcaldy , Fife , and was baptised on 24 October 1689 . He was the only surviving child of John Adam ( d. c . 1710 ) , a mason , and Helen Cranstoun , daughter of William Cranstoun , 3rd Lord Cranstoun . His paternal grandfather was Archibald Adam , a laird in Angus . Adam probably attended the grammar school in Kirkcaldy until 1704 , when he turned 15 , and thereafter learned the craft of masonry , possibly from his father . It is often suggested that Adam was apprenticed to Sir William Bruce at Kinross House , although the dates make this unlikely . John Fleming suggests that if Adam trained under Bruce at all , it must have been at Hopetoun House which Bruce was building from 1699 – 1703 . By 1717 Adam was a fully qualified member of the Kirkcaldy masons ' guild , and before 1720 he travelled to France and the Low Countries , visiting country houses and viewing the canal at Ostend . 
 In 1714 , Adam entered into a partnership with William Robertson of Gladney , a local laird , to set up a brickworks at Linktown . The venture was successful , and Adam has been credited with introducing the manufacture of Dutch pantiles into Scotland . On 30 May 1716 , Adam married Robertson 's daughter Mary , and the couple moved into his home , Gladney House , at Abbotshall . 
 = = = Rise to fame = = = 
 It is not known how William Adam became a successful architect from these beginnings , but by 1721 he was engaged on major projects at Floors Castle , where he executed a design by Vanbrugh , and designing extensions to Hopetoun House . John Gifford links Adam 's rise with the retirement of James Smith , the most prominent architect of the early 18th century , who was in his 70s by this time . Like Smith , Adam was a trained mason , had social connections through his family , and had the financial backing of successful business ventures . It was in 1721 that Adam became a Freemason being initiated in The Lodge of Edinburgh ( Mary 's Chapel ) , No.1. 
 However , unlike the Episcopalians Smith and Bruce , Adam was a Presbyterian Whig , in a time of Whig domination of the British government . Scottish Episcopalians were associated with Jacobitism , and as such found little favour with the ruling Hanoverian regime . Sir William Bruce , for example , was imprisoned on at least three occasions between 1693 and his death in 1710 , merely on account of his principles . Adam 's beliefs were much more acceptable , although he did manage to maintain relations with the exiled Jacobite , and amateur architect , John , Earl of Mar. Adam 's political stance allowed him to acquire influential patrons such as John Dalrymple , 2nd Earl of Stair , and Sir John Clerk of Penicuik , who , besides being his clients , attempted to secure government positions and contracts for him . For example , Sir John Clerk unsuccessfully proposed Adam for city architect under the " Town of Edinburgh Bill " , which would have seen him overseeing new public works in the capital . In 1727 , Stair tried , again unsuccessfully , to have Adam appointed Surveyor of the King 's Works in Scotland , although the following year he acquired the lesser position of Clerk and Storekeeper of the King 's Works in Scotland , under the Master of Works Sir John Anstruther . In 1730 Adam was appointed principal Mason to the Board of Ordnance in North Britain . 
 In 1727 Adam and Sir John Clerk travelled to London , visiting a number of country seats along the way , including Cliveden , Wilton , and Wanstead Park . In London , Adam attempted to make further political contacts , as well as seeking out an engraver for his projected book of architectural plans , which would eventually become Vitruvius Scoticus . Also while in London , he sat to William Aikman for his portrait . 
 = = = Architect , entrepreneur , and laird = = = 
 By 1728 , Adam was firmly established as a successful architect with numerous ongoing business concerns , including coal mining , salt panning , quarrying and agricultural improvements , although in that year occurred the death of his partner and father @-@ in @-@ law William Robertson . For the same year , William Adam and Alexander McGill are called architects in the subscribers ' list to James Gibbs 's Book of Architecture . On 21 February 1728 , Adam was made a burgess of Edinburgh , and moved with his family to a property on the Cowgate , where he later built a large tenement . 
 His business activities continued to expand . Since the commission for Hopetoun in 1721 , he had leased quarries near Queensferry which provided the stone for his building contracts . Starting in 1734 , he leased lofts , granaries and warehouses in Leith , and leased coal mines and salt pans at <unk> , and later at nearby Pinkie he built a canal in 1742 – 44 , to serve the mines . Other engineering works included an aqueduct cut through a hill at Inveresk , and in 1741 , an attempt to promote a Forth and Clyde canal , a project eventually realised by others some 30 years later . His main concern from 1731 became Blair <unk> , the estate in Kinross @-@ shire , near <unk> , which he purchased that year for £ 8 @,@ 010 Scots . Renaming the estate Blair Adam , he set about expanding and improving it , planting trees , enclosing land , and setting up coal mines . He established the village of <unk> to house the miners , and built a small house , although he seldom visited for any length of time . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 In 1741 Adam was forced to initiate legal proceedings against William , Lord Braco , to retrieve unpaid fees arising from his work at Duff House . There was no formal contract , and client and architect disagreed on costs for carved stonework . Adam sued for £ 5 @,@ 796 12s 11 ⅓ d , and the matter was initially resolved in his favour . However , Braco was a stubborn opponent , and dragged out the proceedings , which were not resolved until just before Adam 's death . 
 After the Jacobite rising of 1745 , Adam 's position as Mason to the Board of Ordnance brought him a number of large military contracts in the Highlands . In 1746 , the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant , and Adam was quick to put forward his son John 's name for consideration , although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post . His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746 , James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early to join their father . 
 William Adam succumbed to illness in late 1747 , dying the following summer . He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard , Edinburgh , where John Adam designed the family mausoleum built in 1753 . This was restored by Edinburgh City Council and Historic Scotland in 1997 to mark the 250th anniversary of his death . 
 = = Architectural works = = 
 Adam used a wide variety of sources for his designs , and created an inventive personal style of decoration . His chief influences were from English Palladianism , and several of his houses have been likened to designs reproduced in Colen Campbell 's Vitruvius Britannicus , but Adam mixed these with English Baroque motifs from Gibbs and Vanbrugh . He relied greatly on a range of French , Italian and English pattern books , including Gibbs ' Book of Architecture , from which he borrowed freely with little regard for consistency of style . In addition , he took inspiration from earlier Scottish renaissance architecture , and from his predecessors Bruce and Smith . During his nearly 30 @-@ year career as an architect , Adam designed , extended or remodelled over 40 country houses , and undertook numerous public contracts . He also laid out landscape garden schemes , for instance at <unk> and Taymouth Castle . 
 = = = Country houses = = = 
 His first commission seems to have been for extensions to Hopetoun House , near Edinburgh , for Charles Hope , 1st Earl of Hopetoun . Hopetoun had been built only 20 years before by Sir William Bruce , and Adam was retained to rebuild the south @-@ east wing . These works , completed in 1725 , aimed to give the east front a bold new facade , stepping forward at the ends with curved sections . According to John Fleming , " nothing so ambitious or imaginative had ever before been attempted in Scotland " . Over the following years , Adam would return to Hopetoun , building the south colonnade from 1726 , the north wing from 1728 , and finally the pavilions from 1736 . These were not finished until 1742 , the year of the Earl 's death , and the completed scheme was finished by Adam 's sons after his own death . Adam also laid out the gardens , possibly to designs by Bruce , whose axial style they follow . 
 Other early designs included Drum House , which boasted Scotland 's first venetian window , and Mavisbank , both near Edinburgh . Mavisbank House , constructed between 1723 and 1727 , was the first Palladian villa in Scotland , a collaboration between Adam and the owner , amateur architect Sir John Clerk of Penicuik . The latter claimed much of the credit , and certainly criticised some of Adam 's suggestions , although evidence suggests Adam got his way on a number of points . As at Hopetoun , here Adam enjoyed an unusually close relationship with his client , despite their differences of opinion . His most ambitious early work was the baroque , Vanbrugh @-@ inspired house at Arniston , near Gorebridge . Built for Robert Dundas , a lawyer and politician linked to the Earl of Stair , Arniston includes extensive grounds laid out by Adam , with a parterre and cascade , and a main avenue centred on Arthur 's Seat to the north . The stucco work to the hall at Arniston is one of Adam 's finest <unk> interiors . 
 Duff House , Adam 's major work of the 1730s , demonstrates his accretion of local and foreign influences , presenting itself as " a medieval castle in baroque dress " . Built between 1735 and 1739 , Adam acted as contractor and architect to William , Lord Braco . James Gibbs had recently built another house for Lord Braco , but he declined the commission for Duff , recommending Adam for the job . The main facade of Duff House is remarkable for its height , and with the tall corner towers the impression is of a highly vertical house . This style is related to the designs produced by the exiled Jacobite Earl of Mar , an amateur architect who collaborated with Adam at the House of Dun . Charles McKean compares Duff to the 17th century Drumlanrig Castle , and places it within the Scottish architectural tradition . Like Drumlanrig , and Heriot 's Hospital ( 1620s – 1690s ) in Edinburgh before it , Duff House has a double @-@ pile block flanked by taller square corner towers . The " baroque dress " at Duff derives from Vanbrugh , and particularly Eastbury Park ( 1724 – 38 ) in Dorset . Designs for pavilions and quadrant wings were never executed due to Lord Braco 's dispute with Adam . Braco never occupied or fitted out the house for the same reason . 
 Adam 's other houses of the 1730s include House of Dun in Angus , <unk> in Dumfriesshire , Lawyers House in Perthshire , and Haddo House in Aberdeenshire . His early , unexecuted design for House of Dun , a collaboration with the Earl of Mar , is interesting , as it appears to show a traditional tall Scottish tower house , complete with spiral stairs within the walls , but externally clad in neo @-@ classical detailing ; Adam clearly took some inspiration from the Scottish vernacular . <unk> , the Duke of Hamilton 's " Dogg Kennel " and hunting lodge near Hamilton , was completed in 1743 . His redecoration of the Duke 's apartment in Holyroodhouse was Adam 's most important interior design commission . In the 1730s Adam extended Taymouth Castle and laid out gardens , although his work was largely demolished to make way for the present building in the 19th century . Adam 's approach here mirrored the work of Bruce at Balcaskie , extending a Scottish tower house to form a near @-@ symmetrical architectural composition . 
 After 1740 , Adam built only two houses , Cumbernauld House for the Earl of Wigton , and Cally House for Alexander Murray , which was not complete until 1763 . From 1746 , Adam was acting as " Intendant General " and contractor , overseeing the building of Inveraray Castle to a Gothic design by Roger Morris . His role was to correspond with the architect on behalf of the client , Archibald Campbell , 3rd Duke of Argyll , and Adam also offered Morris his own advice on detail design . He also provided an early draft for the layout of the new town at Inveraray . His last architectural work was for Lord Lovat in 1744 , for a new house at Castle <unk> . The stone was supplied , but construction never started as Lord Lovat was " out " in the Jacobite rising of 1745 , and his property was sacked by government troops . 
 = = = Public buildings = = = 
 Adam 's first public building commissions were in Aberdeen , where he built the town house , or town hall , from 1729 – 30 , since demolished , and Robert Gordon 's Hospital from 1730 – 32 , now an independent school . The original Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on Infirmary Street was an imposing building designed by Adam in 1738 , although based on a standard Ordnance Board barrack block . One of the first infirmaries in the world , it was founded by physician Alexander Monro , and was demolished in 1884 . Remnants of the building can be found on various sites in the city . Also in Edinburgh , Adam built George Watson 's Hospital from 1738 – 41 , demolished 2004 , which in the 19th century was incorporated by David Bryce as part of the new Royal Infirmary . In 1745 , work was completed on William Adam 's " New Library " for the University of Glasgow , also since demolished . Adam 's town house for Dundee has also been demolished ; that of Haddington remains but is much altered . Adam built only one church , Hamilton Old Parish Church , in 1733 while working on nearby <unk> . 
 The last Jacobite rising occurred in 1745 , when " Bonnie Prince Charlie " attempted to seize the British throne , aided by rebellious Scottish Highlanders . In the aftermath of this unsuccessful coup , the Highlands were extensively militarised by the government , and Adam 's Ordnance Board work consequently multiplied . He and his sons carried out works at Fort Augustus , Fort William , Carlisle , and the castles of Dumbarton , Stirling , Edinburgh , Blackness , and Duart . He was engaged in 1747 to provide the mason work and brickwork for Fort George near Inverness , although the project only began shortly before Adam 's death . Every summer until 1760 , one of his sons spent the summer at Fort George , supervising the works under Colonel Skinner , the chief engineer for North Britain . 
 = = = Vitruvius Scoticus = = = 
 In the 1720s Adam planned to publish a book of architectural drawings of Scottish houses , including his own work and that of others . His Vitruvius Scoticus was started and named in response to Colen Campbell 's Vitruvius Britannicus . He commissioned some engravings during his 1727 trip to London , and had begun to collect subscriptions . Further engraving were completed in Edinburgh in the 1730s by Richard Cooper . The project then stalled , possibly due to the lack of subscriptions ( only 150 were collected , compared to over 700 for Vitruvius Britannicus ) , although it may have been revived around the time of Adam 's death . In 1766 , John Adam attempted to restart the project and collect fresh subscriptions , although nothing came of this . The book was finally published in 1812 by John 's son William , and contained 160 plates , including 100 of Adam 's own designs . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 William Adam 's dominant position in Scottish architecture is reinforced by his lack of contemporaries . Colin McWilliam , in The Buildings of Scotland : Lothian , wondered " whether Scottish architecture at this period ... would have achieved very much without him . " 
 Adam 's death coincided with the final defeat of the Jacobite threat in 1746 , and the advance of the Scottish Enlightenment , which resulted in new styles of building becoming popular . The development of Neoclassicism in the late 18th century was paralleled by a revival of the " castle " form of house , which would lead to the Scottish baronial style . Neither idiom however , owed much to the work of William Adam . As a practical man rather than a theorist , Adam never developed a strong enough style to exert a direct influence on the course of building design . 
 His main bequest to architectural history were his three architect sons , and in particular Robert Adam , whose success as developer of the " Adam Style " far outran that of his father . Although Robert formed his own style through lengthy study in Rome , John Fleming detects traces of his father 's influence on all three of the brothers ' work , and suggests that the Adam principle of " movement " in architecture was partly inspired by William 's admiration for Vanbrugh . More concretely , Fleming notes that working with their father gave the brothers a solid grounding in the technical aspects of architecture , and introduced them to a set of clients which they might never otherwise have had access to . 
 = = = Critical appreciation = = = 
 Although his contemporaries acclaimed Adam 's " genius for architecture " , recent architectural historians have found his work of more variable quality . In the 18th and 19th centuries , he was accepted as Scotland 's " Universal Architect " , and at the end of the 19th century , MacGibbon and Ross suggested in The <unk> and Domestic Architecture of Scotland that William was " at least " the equal in talent of his son Robert . 
 In the 20th century , a more critical view of Adam 's work was taken . For example , Ian Hannah in The Story of Scotland in Stone ( 1934 ) found Adam to be " a rather ordinary classical architect " . Arthur T. Bolton , in the introduction to his definitive work on Robert and James Adam ( 1922 ) , dismissed the father 's work as " heavy and ordinary " , and a mere " compilation of ideas ... from Vanbrugh and Gibbs to Kent " . John Fleming lamented his " ad hoc improvisation from source books , improperly digested " , and decided that he " cannot be allowed great distinction as an architect " . John Summerson disregards Adam 's work , in Architecture in Britain , 1530 – 1830 ( 1953 ) , as it does not fit into the English Palladian orthodoxy , although John Dunbar suggests that " he could express himself convincingly enough in that idiom " , for instance at Haddo House . Dunbar found Adam 's work " as remarkable for its eclecticism as for its unevenness of quality " , and he went on to stress William Adam 's " robustness and directness " , and found these " appropriate to the artistic climate of North Britain " . Gifford also stresses Adam 's Scottish context , pointing out that Scotland was in many ways a foreign country during his working life , and indeed was a separate country to England until 1707 . Adam should , he argues , be seen not as a provincial British architect , but as " the architect of Scotland " . 
 John Fleming and Colin McWilliam are in agreement that Adam was at his best as a collaborator . Fleming 's comment that Adam " was at his best when guided by a man of taste who knew his own mind " , is echoed by McWilliam , who suggests that William Adam " always did his best , but did his best architecture ... when he was in touch not only with his source books , but with other lively minds " .

 = Imme R100 = 
 The Imme R100 was a lightweight motorcycle made by Riedel AG from 1948 to 1951 . It is noted for its simple and innovative design with many advanced features . With low cost and technical innovation , the R100 sold well , but reliability problems and low profit margins resulted in warranty costs driving Riedel AG into bankruptcy . 
 The advanced specification of the Imme R100 caused it to be highly regarded . The R100 was one of the motorcycles included in " The Art of the Motorcycle " exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1998 and is on permanent display at Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum . 
 = = Concept , design and engineering = = 
 Motorcycle engineer Norbert Riedel recognized the need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany 's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one . By the summer of 1947 , a prototype frame had been built and tested . The spine frame was made from 40 mm steel tubing , as were the steering head , the single @-@ sided front fork , and the single @-@ sided swingarm . The wheels were interchangeable , and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right . 
 Riedel developed the engine at the same time . This was a piston @-@ ported two @-@ stroke single @-@ cylinder engine of 99 cc ( 6 @.@ 0 cu in ) capacity . The engine was cast in light alloy around the cylinder liner , and had an integral cylinder head . The crankshaft was suspended on only one side . The power output of the engine was 4 @.@ 5 PS ( 3 @.@ 3 kW ; 4 @.@ 4 hp ) at 5 @,@ 800 rpm , which was considered a high output at the time . Contemporary engines of comparable size typically made about 2 @.@ 5 PS ( 1 @.@ 8 kW ; 2 @.@ 5 hp ) , and 4 @.@ 5 PS was expected from 125 cc engines such as those used in the <unk> RT 125 and the later Hoffmann Vespa . 
 The transmission had three speeds with no neutral position ; a mechanism held the clutch open when the motorcycle was at idle in first gear . First gear was positioned in the middle of the shift pattern , with second gear below and third gear above . 
 The engine and transmission were mounted together on the swingarm in front of the pivot axle at the bottom of the spine frame . The near @-@ horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a " power egg " style which would later be used by Benelli and <unk> . The tubular swingarm also served as the exhaust pipe . Behind the pivot axle , the swingarm , the reinforced rear fender , and the supports for the rear carrier formed a triangular structure which supported the rear spring . This suspension system allowed a long suspension travel and a soft spring rate . Test rides on the complete prototype began in December 1947 and showed that the combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping . Friction dampers were added . 
 = = Production , marketing and demise = = 
 Norbert Riedel registered Riedel AG in 1948 . He moved his facilities from <unk> to <unk> and began production there in June 1948 . It is widely believed that the name " Imme " came from an abbreviation of this location , and that the Imme 's " bee on wheels " logo came from " Imme " being a dialect word meaning " bee " . However , it has also been suggested that the name came from the motorcycle itself resembling a bee , or from the engine sounding like a buzzing bee . 
 The Imme R100 's light weight , relatively powerful engine , and long travel suspension made it popular in motorsport ; this , along with good marketing and low pricing , led to strong sales . The management of Riedel AG expected high sales volume to offset the low profit margin . A basic Imme sold for 775 Deutschmark without battery , tachometer , or centre stand . Passenger accommodation was an optional extra , as was a spare wheel . Initially , <unk> were all painted oxide red . 
 In 1950 , a better @-@ equipped " Export " version became available for 850 Deutschmark with a battery , an electric horn , a centre stand , a speedometer , a more comfortable seat , chrome plating , <unk> , and a choice of colours including lime green and gloss black . Production of the Imme R100 had gone up to 1 @,@ 000 per month and , by the autumn of 1950 , more than 10 @,@ 000 had been sold . 
 Imme engines were also sold to Fritz <unk> , to power his <unk> <unk> invalid carriages . These replaced the <unk> & Sachs engines used in earlier versions of the <unk> . 
 However , the Imme began to develop problems , especially with the single @-@ sided crankshaft bearings and the <unk> for the kick starter . Riedel corrected the problem beginning with the Model D version , which had a conventional crankshaft with two bearings . However , the profit from sales was not enough to cover the warranty expenses , and , by the end of 1950 , Riedel AG went bankrupt with debts of 1 @.@ 25 million Deutschmark . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 At the time of Riedel <unk> bankruptcy , three prototypes of an Imme with a 150 cc parallel twin two @-@ stroke engine had been made . Fritz Philipps , who had been a senior executive at Riedel AG , formed <unk> @-@ Motoren und <unk> GmbH ( <unk> ) to supply parts and perform repairs on Imme motorcycles . <unk> also set up to manufacture an Imme with a 175 cc straight @-@ twin two @-@ stroke engine , but made only 25 before they ended production . 
 The Imme R100 is noted for its simple and innovative design . Its advanced features include single @-@ sided suspension front and rear , interchangeable wheels front and rear with the option of a spare tyre , the complete drivetrain mounted on the swingarm , and the swingarm tube used as the exhaust pipe . Remarking on the R100 being displayed in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum exhibition " The Art of the Motorcycle " , <unk> Guilfoyle , curatorial adviser at the museum , said : " It 's my favourite unknown bike . There are ideas there that are 40 years ahead of their time . " An R100 is on permanent display at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum . 
 = Brazilian battleship São Paulo = 
 São Paulo was a dreadnought battleship designed and built by the British companies Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers , respectively , for the Brazilian Navy . She was the second of two ships in the Minas Geraes class , and was named after the state and city of São Paulo . 
 São Paulo was launched on 19 April 1909 and commissioned on 12 July 1910 . Soon after , she was involved in the Revolt of the Lash ( Revolta de Chibata ) , in which crews on four Brazilian warships mutinied over poor pay and harsh punishments for even minor offenses . After entering the First World War , Brazil offered to send São Paulo and her sister Minas Geraes to Britain for service with the Grand Fleet , but Britain declined since both vessels were in poor condition and lacked the latest fire control technology . In June 1918 Brazil sent São Paulo to the United States for a full refit that was not completed until 7 January 1920 , well after the war had ended . On 6 July 1922 , São Paulo fired her guns in anger for the first time when she attacked a fort that had been taken during the Tenente revolts . Two years later , mutineers took control of the ship and sailed her to Montevideo where they obtained asylum . 
 In the 1930s , São Paulo was passed over for modernization due to her poor condition — she could only reach a top speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , less than half her design speed . For the rest of her career , the ship was reduced to a reserve coastal defense role . When Brazil entered the Second World War , São Paulo sailed to the port of Recife and remained there as the port 's main defense for the duration of the war . Stricken in 1947 , the dreadnought remained as a training vessel until 1951 , when she was taken under tow to be scrapped in the United Kingdom . The tow lines broke during a strong gale on 6 November , when the ships were 150 nmi ( 280 km ; 170 mi ) north of the Azores , and the São Paulo was lost .

 Main articles : South American dreadnought race and Minas Geraes @-@ class battleship 
 Beginning in the late 1880s , Brazil 's navy fell into obsolescence , a situation exacerbated by and 1889 revolution , which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II , and an 1893 civil war . Despite having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile , by the end of the 19th century Brazil was lagging behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage . 
 At the turn of the 20th century , soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought prosperity to the Brazilian economy . The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth to finance a naval building program in 1904 , which authorized the construction of a large number of warships , including three battleships . The Minister of the Navy , Admiral Júlio César de Noronha , signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906 . The new dreadnought battleship design , which debuted in December 1906 with the completion of the namesake ship , rendered the Brazilian ships , and all other existing capital ships , obsolete . The money authorized for naval expansion was redirected by the new Minister of the Navy , Rear Admiral Alexandrino <unk> de Alencar , to building two dreadnoughts , with plans for a third dreadnought after the first was completed , two scout cruisers ( which became the Bahia class ) , ten destroyers ( the Pará class ) , and three submarines . The three battleships on which construction had just begun were scrapped beginning on 7 January 1907 , and the design of the new dreadnoughts was approved by the Brazilians on 20 February 1907 . In South America , the ships came as a shock and kindled a naval arms race among Brazil , Argentina , and Chile . The 1902 treaty between the latter two was canceled upon the Brazilian dreadnought order so both could be free to build their own dreadnoughts . 
 Minas Geraes , the lead ship , was laid down by Armstrong on 17 April 1907 , while São Paulo followed thirteen days later at Vickers . The news shocked Brazil 's neighbors , especially Argentina , whose Minister of Foreign Affairs remarked that either Minas Geraes or São Paulo could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets . In addition , Brazil 's order meant that they had laid down a dreadnought before many of the other major maritime powers , such as Germany , France or Russia , and the two ships made Brazil just the third country to have dreadnoughts under construction , behind the United Kingdom and the United States . Newspapers and journals around the world , particularly in Britain and Germany , speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion , as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful warships . Despite this , the United States actively attempted to court Brazil as an ally ; caught up in the spirit , U.S. naval journals began using terms like " Pan Americanism " and " Hemispheric Cooperation " .

 São Paulo was christened by Regis de Oliveira , the wife of Brazil 's minister to Great Britain , and launched at Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness on 19 April 1909 with many South American diplomats and naval officers in attendance . The ship was commissioned on 12 July , and after fitting @-@ out and sea trials , she left Greenock on 16 September 1910 . Shortly thereafter , she stopped in Cherbourg , France , to embark the Brazilian President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca . Departing on the 27th , São Paulo sailed to Lisbon , Portugal , where Fonseca was a guest of Portugal 's King Manuel II . Soon after they arrived , the 5 October 1910 revolution began , which caused the fall of the Portuguese monarchy . Although the president offered political asylum to the king and his family , the offer was refused . A rumor that the king was on board , circulated by newspapers and reported to the Brazilian legation in Paris , led revolutionaries to attempt to search the ship , but they were denied permission . They also asked for Brazil to land marines " to help in the maintenance of order " , but this request was also denied . São Paulo left Lisbon on 7 October for Rio de Janeiro , and docked there on 25 October . 
 = = = Revolt of the Lash = = = 
 Soon after São Paulo 's arrival , a major rebellion known as the Revolt of the Lash , or Revolta da Chibata , broke out on four of the newest ships in the Brazilian Navy . The initial spark was provided on 16 November 1910 when Afro @-@ Brazilian sailor Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination . Many Afro @-@ Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves , or were former slaves freed under the Lei Áurea ( abolition ) but forced to enter the navy . They had been planning a revolt for some time , and Menezes became the catalyst . Further preparations were needed , so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November . The crewmen of Minas Geraes , São Paulo , the twelve @-@ year @-@ old Deodoro , and the new Bahia quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed : two officers on Minas Geraes and one each on São Paulo and Bahia were killed . 
 The ships were well @-@ supplied with foodstuffs , ammunition , and coal , and the only demand of mutineers — led by João Cândido Felisberto — was the abolition of " slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy " . They objected to low pay , long hours , inadequate training , and punishments including bolo ( being struck on the hand with a ferrule ) and the use of whips or lashes ( chibata ) , which eventually became a symbol of the revolt . By the 23rd , the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors . Senator Ruy Barbosa , long an opponent of slavery , lent a large amount of support , and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November . The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies . 
 Humiliated by the revolt , naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty , so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships . The officers believed such an action was necessary to restore the service 's honor . The rebels , believing an attack was imminent , sailed their ships out of Guanabara Bay and spent the night of 23 – 24 November at sea , only returning during daylight . Late on the 24th , the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers . Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser Rio Grande do Sul , Bahia 's sister ship with ten 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns . They planned to attack on the morning of the 25th , when the government expected the mutineers would return to Guanabara Bay . When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies , the order was rescinded . After the bill passed 125 – 23 and the president signed it into law , the mutineers stood down on the 26th . 
 During the revolt , the ships were noted by many observers to be well handled , despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion . João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard , and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary . The 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns were often used for shots over the city , but the 12 @-@ inch guns were not , which led to a suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons . Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes ' guns were fully operational , and while São Paulo 's could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system , British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem . Still , historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 The Brazilian government declared that the country would be neutral in the First World War on 4 August 1914 . The sinking of Brazilian merchant ships by German U @-@ boats led them to revoke their neutrality , then declare war on 26 October 1917 . By this time , São Paulo was no longer one of the world 's most powerful battleships . Despite an identified need for more modern fire control , she had not been fitted with any of the advances in that technology that had appeared since her construction , and she was in poor condition . For these reasons the Royal Navy declined a Brazilian offer to send her and Minas Geraes to serve with the Grand Fleet . In an attempt to bring the battleship up to international standards , Brazil sent São Paulo to the United States in June 1918 to receive a full refit . Soon after she departed the naval base in Rio de Janeiro , fourteen of the eighteen boilers powering the dreadnought broke down . The American battleship Nebraska , which was in the area after transporting the body of the late Uruguayan Minister to the United States to Montevideo , rendered assistance in the form of temporary repairs after the ships put in at Bahia . Escorted by Nebraska and another American ship , Raleigh , São Paulo made it to the New York Naval Yard after a 42 @-@ day journey . 
 = = Major refit and the 1920s = = 
 In New York , São Paulo underwent a refit , beginning on 7 August 1918 and completing on 7 January 1920 . Many of her crewmen were assigned to American warships during this time for training . She received Sperry fire control equipment and Bausch and Lomb range @-@ finders for the two superfiring turrets fore and aft . A vertical armor bulkhead was fitted inside all six main turrets , and the secondary battery of 4 @.@ 7 in ( 120 mm ) casemate guns was reduced from twenty @-@ two to four guns . A few modern AA guns were fitted as well : two 3 " / 50 caliber guns from Bethlehem Steel were added on the aft superstructure , 37 mm guns were added near each turret , and 3 pounders were removed from the top of turrets . 
 After the refit was completed , São Paulo picked up ammunition in Gravesend and sailed to Cuba for firing trials . Seven members of the United States ' Bureau of Standards traveled with the ship from New York and observed the operations , which were conducted in the Gulf of Guacanayabo . After dropping the Americans off in Guantánamo Bay , São Paulo returned home in early 1920 . August 1920 saw the dreadnought sailing to Belgium , where King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth were embarked on 1 September to bring them to Brazil . After bringing the royals home , São Paulo traveled to Portugal to bring the remains of the former emperor Pedro II and his wife , Teresa Cristina , back to Brazil . 
 In 1922 , São Paulo and Minas Geraes helped to put down the first of the Tenente revolts . Soldiers seized Fort Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro on 5 July , but no other men joined them . As a result , some men deserted the rebels , and by the next morning only 200 people remained in the fort . São Paulo bombarded the fort , firing five salvos and obtaining at least two hits ; the fort surrendered half an hour later . The Brazilian Navy 's official history reports that one of the hits opened a hole ten meters deep . 
 Crewmen aboard São Paulo rebelled on 4 November 1924 , when First Lieutenant Hercolino Cascardo , seven second lieutenants and 260 others commandeered the ship . After the boilers were fired , São Paulo 's mutineers attempted to entice the crews of Minas Geraes and the other ships nearby to join . They were only able to sway the crew of one old torpedo boat to the cause . The battleship 's crew , angry that Minas Geraes would not join them , fired a six @-@ pounder at Minas Geraes that wounded a cook . The mutineers then sailed out of the Rio de Janeiro 's harbor , where the forts at Santa Cruz and Copacabana engaged her , damaging São Paulo 's fire control system and funnel . The forts stopped firing soon after the battleship returned fire due to concern over possible civilian casualties . The crewmen aboard São Paulo attempted to join revolutionaries in Rio Grande do Sul , but when they found that the rebel forces had moved inland , they set course for Montevideo , Uruguay . They arrived on 10 November , where the rebellious members of the crew disembarked and were granted asylum , and Minas Geraes , which had been pursuing São Paulo , escorted the wayward ship home to Rio de Janeiro , arriving on the 21st . 
 = = Late career = = 
 In the 1930s , Brazil decided to modernize both São Paulo and Minas Geraes . São Paulo 's dilapidated state made this uneconomical ; at the time she could sail at a maximum of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , less than half her design speed . As a result , while Minas Geraes was thoroughly refitted from 1931 to 1938 in the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard , São Paulo was employed as a coast @-@ defense ship , a role in which she remained for the rest of her service life . During the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution , she acted as the flagship of a naval blockade of Santos . After repairs in 1934 and 1935 , she returned to lead three naval training exercises . In the same year , accompanied by the Brazilian cruisers Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul , the Argentine battleships Rivadavia and Moreno , six Argentine cruisers , and a group of destroyers , São Paulo carried the Brazilian President Getúlio <unk> Vargas up the River Plate to Buenos Aires to meet with the presidents of Argentina and Uruguay . 
 In 1936 , the crew of São Paulo , as well as Rio Grande do Sul 's crew , played in the Liga Carioca de Football 's Open Tournament , a cup where many amateur teams had the chance to play the likes of Flamengo and Fluminense . 
 As in the First World War , Brazil stayed neutral during the opening years of the Second World War , until U @-@ boat attacks drove the country to declare war on Germany and Italy on 21 August 1942 . The age and condition of São Paulo relegated her to the role of harbor defense ship ; she set sail for Recife on 23 November 1942 with the escort of two American destroyers ( Badger and Davis ) and served as the main defense of the port for the war , only returning to Rio de Janeiro in 1945 . 
 Stricken from the naval register on 2 August 1947 , the ship remained as a training vessel until August 1951 , when she was sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain . After preparing from 5 to 18 September , São Paulo was given an eight @-@ man caretaker crew and taken under tow by two tugs , <unk> and <unk> , in Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951 for one last voyage to Greenock and the breakers . When north of the Azores in early November , the two lines snapped during a strong storm . American B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress bombers and British planes were launched to scour the Atlantic for the missing ship . The ship was reported as found on the 15th , but this proved to be false . The search was ended on 10 December without finding São Paulo or her crew .

 The Yugoslav submarine Nebojša was the second of the Hrabri @-@ class diesel @-@ electric submarines built by the Vickers @-@ Armstrong Naval Yard on the River Tyne in the United Kingdom , for the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) and was launched in 1927 . Her design was based on that of the British L @-@ class submarine of World War I , and she was built using parts originally assembled for a Royal Navy L @-@ class submarine that was never built . She was armed with six bow @-@ mounted 533 mm ( 21 in ) torpedo tubes , two 102 mm ( 4 in ) guns and one machine gun , and could dive to 60 metres ( 200 ft ) . 
 Prior to World War II Nebojša participated in cruises to several Mediterranean ports . During the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , she evaded capture by Italian forces , and joined British naval forces in the Mediterranean where she performed a training role . After the war she was taken over by the new Yugoslav government and renamed Tara . She was eventually stricken in 1954 , and scrapped in 1958 .

 Yugoslav naval policy in the interwar period lacked direction until the mid @-@ 1920s , although it was generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it . In 1926 , a modest ten @-@ year construction program was initiated to build up a force of submarines , coastal torpedo boats , torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role . The Hrabri @-@ class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge . 
 Nebojša ( Fearless ) was built in 1927 for the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) , by the Vickers @-@ Armstrong Naval Yard on the River Tyne in the United Kingdom . Her design was based on that of the British L @-@ class submarine of World War I , and she was built using parts originally assembled for HMS L @-@ 68 , which was never completed . Along with her sister submarine Hrabri , she had an overall length of 72 @.@ 05 metres ( 236 ft 5 in ) , a beam of 7 @.@ 32 m ( 24 ft 0 in ) , and a surfaced draught of 3 @.@ 96 m ( 13 ft 0 in ) . Her surfaced displacement was 975 long tons ( 991 t ) or 1 @,@ 164 long tons ( 1 @,@ 183 t ) submerged , and her crew consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men . She had an operational depth of 60 m ( 200 ft ) . 
 The Hrabri @-@ class had two shafts driven by two diesel engines ( when surfaced ) or two electric motors ( when submerged ) . Their diesel engines were rated at 2 @,@ 400 brake horsepower ( 1 @,@ 800 kW ) and the electric motors at 1 @,@ 600 shaft horsepower ( 1 @,@ 200 kW ) , and they were designed to reach a top speed of 15 @.@ 7 knots ( 29 @.@ 1 km / h ; 18 @.@ 1 mph ) under diesel power while surfaced , and 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) on their electric motors when submerged . They were armed with six bow @-@ mounted 533 mm ( 21 in ) torpedo tubes , and carried twelve torpedoes . They were also equipped with two 102 mm ( 4 in ) deck guns ( one forward and one aft of the conning tower ) , and one machine gun . Their radius of action was 3 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 000 km ; 4 @,@ 400 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) .

 Nebojša was launched in 1927 as the second submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes , which later became the Royal Yugoslav Navy . Along with her sister submarine Hrabri , she left the Tyne in late January 1928 . In company with the Yugoslav submarine tender Hvar , the two submarines arrived in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928 . In May and June 1929 , Hrabri , Nebojša , Hvar and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija on a cruise to Malta , the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea , and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia . The British naval attaché observed that the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta . On 16 May 1930 , Nebojša was exercising her crew at periscope depth near the entrance to the Bay of Kotor when she collided with a Yugoslav steamship . The damage was not serious and there were no injuries , but her forward 102 mm gun was lost overboard . The necessary repairs were carried out at the dockyard in the Bay of Kotor . 
 In June and July 1930 , Hrabri , Nebojša and the fleet auxiliary Sitnica again cruised the Mediterranean , visiting Alexandria and Beirut . In 1932 , the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises , manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets . In September 1933 , Nebojša and the submarine Osvetnik cruised the southern part of the central Mediterranean . In August 1936 , Nebojša and Osvetnik visited the Greek island of Corfu . 
 During the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , she and two Orjen @-@ class motor torpedo boats evaded capture by Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor , arriving at Suda Bay , Crete , on 23 April , after eight days at sea . Despite this , the Italians claimed that they had sunk all the Yugoslav vessels . Nebojša then sailed to Alexandria , but the Royal Navy considered her unfit for combat duties . British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested her crew might be retrained and used to operate the recently captured German Type VIIC U @-@ boat U @-@ 570 , but this idea was soon abandoned . She was based at Valletta in Malta as an anti @-@ submarine warfare training vessel , serving with the British 2nd Submarine Flotilla in 1942 and the British 3rd Submarine Flotilla in 1943 . She continued working in the Mediterranean until the end of the war , but her service with the Royal Navy appears to have been limited to a training role . 
 After the war she was towed first to Bari in Italy , then in August 1945 to the port of Split where she was overhauled , renamed Tara and given the pennant number 801 . She was then transferred to Pula on the Istrian peninsula in the northern Adriatic . Used to train the fledgling Yugoslav Navy submarine arm , she was stricken in 1954 . One of her guns was removed at the end of her career , and she was eventually scrapped in 1958 .

In the episode , Phoebe ( Lisa Kudrow ) agrees to be the surrogate mother for her brother Frank Jr . ( Giovanni Ribisi ) and his older wife Alice Knight ( Debra Jo Rupp ) . Meanwhile , a display by Chandler ( Matthew Perry ) and Joey ( Matt LeBlanc ) of how well they know Monica ( Courteney Cox ) and Rachel ( Jennifer Aniston ) by guessing the items in their shopping bag leads to a large @-@ scale bet on a quiz , for which Ross ( David Schwimmer ) acts as the gamemaster . 
 The episode was directed by Kevin S. Bright and co @-@ written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin . The idea for Kudrow 's character Phoebe becoming a surrogate mother coincided with the actress ' real @-@ time pregnancy . The producers wanted to find a way to use the pregnancy in a narrative for the fourth season and designated the task to the writers . Ribisi and Jo Rupp reprised their recurring roles of Frank Jr. and Alice respectively which was initially difficult as both had filming commitments . 
 In its original broadcast on NBC , " The One with the Embryos " acquired a 17 @.@ 3 Nielsen rating , finishing the week ranked fourth . The episode received critical acclaim is generally considered one of the best of the entire series and is a favorite amongst the cast members and producers . In 2009 , " The One with the Embryos " was ranked # 21 on TV Guide 's list of " TV 's Top 100 Episodes of All Time . "

 When Joey and Chandler ( Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry ) correctly identify the contents of Rachel 's ( Jennifer Aniston ) shopping bag , Monica ( Courteney Cox ) suggests a trivia contest to see who knows more about whom : the men or the women . They place a $ 100 bet on the outcome and Ross ( David Schwimmer ) puts together some questions and plays as host . Meanwhile , Phoebe ( Lisa Kudrow ) has agreed to be a surrogate mother for her brother Frank ( Giovanni Ribisi ) and his older wife Alice ( Debra Jo Rupp ) , but is concerned that they are paying $ 16 @,@ 000 for the IVF procedure which only has a 25 % chance of success , and is helpless to influence the results . 
 The trivia game begins , with various facts about the characters being revealed such as Joey 's space @-@ cowboy imaginary friend ( Maurice ) and Rachel 's actual favorite movie ( Weekend at Bernie 's ) . A nine @-@ to @-@ nine score leads to a lightning round . Monica raises the stakes : If the women win , Joey and Chandler must give up their birds , as the maturing Chick is crowing in the mornings and waking them up . Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica give up their apartment to them , which Monica agrees to without consulting Rachel . The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler 's job , and the boys win . 
 As the four pack up their respective apartments — Rachel , in particular , displeased about having to switch — Phoebe returns home and takes a pregnancy test , though it is too soon for a result . Later with packing complete , Rachel finally refuses to move as Frank and Alice come by with another pregnancy test . The boys and the girls begin to argue along with Ross , which is cut short when Phoebe emerges from the bathroom and joyfully announces she is pregnant , the mood turning to one of celebration .

 " The One with the Embryos " was co @-@ written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin and directed by Kevin S. Bright . In October 1997 , Lisa Kudrow announced she and her husband Michel Stern were expecting their first child . When Marta Kauffman first learned of Kudrow 's pregnancy , she was overjoyed and wanted to find a solution of incorporating it into the show without choosing to cover up . At the time of filming " The One with the Embryos " , Kudrow was four months pregnant and the writers discussed ways of narrating the pregnancy on the show , settling with Kudrow 's character carrying her brother 's embryos . 
 According to David Crane , the story arc with Phoebe carrying Frank and Alice 's baby was considered " risky " . When the plot was first discussed , the main concern was whether it was " too crazy … where 's the line with Phoebe ? " . Crane felt if it were not for the actors , the storyline would not have been believable . The producers found it difficult to get Giovanni Ribisi to reprise his role as Frank Jr. on a longer term basis because the actor had continuous filming commitments . A similar situation occurred with Debra Jo Rupp , who was named as a cast member in the upcoming period sitcom , That ' 70s Show on the Fox network . 
 The chick and the duck , who first appeared in " The One with a Chick and a Duck " as Chandler and Joey 's pets were used " as a spark " for the main plot . The animals were originally intended for one episode but because the producers believed they got " so much mileage out of them " , they made recurring appearances . As many television shows used similar fictional pets , the producers settled on a chicken and a duck as they were different . 
 In the trivia contest , the answer " Viva Las Gay @-@ gas " in response to ' What is the name of Chandler 's dad 's show in Vegas ? ' changed " about a million times " in drafts according to Crane . On the night the show was being filmed , writers continued to pitch for different answers in order to receive a better response from the audience . The staff found it difficult coming up with different points of view for each character as all wanted to win the game .

 In its original airing , " The One with the Embryos " finished fourth in ratings for the week of January 12 – January 18 , 1998 , with a Nielsen rating of 17 @.@ 3 , equivalent to approximately 16 @.@ 8 million viewing households . It was the fourth highest @-@ rated show on NBC that week , following ER , Seinfeld and Veronica 's Closet – all of which aired on the network 's Thursday night Must See TV lineup . 
 " The One with the Embryos " was Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc 's favorite episode of the series . Cox liked the episode because she enjoys playing Monica at her most competitive , while LeBlanc spoke fondly of the pace of the episode and the information about the characters that came out . He identified scenes that featured just the six core cast as the best , " because you don 't have to introduce a character – you don 't have to lay any pipeline – you just get right to the funny " . On the DVD audio commentary for the episode , Marta Kauffman cited the episode being " so much fun to do " and enjoyed the writing process . The scene involving Phoebe talking to the embryos was Kevin S. Bright 's favorite in the show 's history because of Kudrow 's ability to " draw you into the scene ... even though it 's only her talking to the dish " . David Crane highlights how the episode explores generosity ; doing a selfless act which pays off when Phoebe gives birth in " The One Hundredth " . Bright moreover felt the trivia contest was the catalyst that rejuvenated the entire fourth season and " put Friends in a different place " . 
 In a 2001 review , Entertainment Weekly rated the episode A + , stating that " Thanks to the trivia contest alone , Embryos is quite possibly Friends ' finest moment " . The article singles out Rachel 's line " He 's a <unk> @-@ <unk> ! " ( in response to the question " What is Chandler Bing 's job ? " ) as the best line of the episode . The authors of Friends Like Us : The Unofficial Guide to Friends called it a " sure @-@ fire contender for the best episode of all time … not one to be missed under any circumstances " . In 2004 , Tara Ariano of MSNBC.com wrote that the character trivia is " revealed in a manner completely organic to the plot . Beautifully written and acted , ' The One With The Embryos ' encapsulates the whole series in a single episode " . The episode was ranked # 21 on TV Guide 's list of " TV 's Top 100 Episodes of All Time " .

 = 2015 FA Community Shield = 
 The 2015 FA Community Shield ( also known as the 2015 FA Community Shield supported by McDonald 's for sponsorship reasons ) was the 93rd FA Community Shield , an annual English football match played between the winners of the previous season 's Premier League and FA Cup . The match was contested by Arsenal , the 2014 – 15 FA Cup winners , and Chelsea , champions of the 2014 – 15 Premier League . It was held at Wembley Stadium on 2 August 2015 . Watched by a crowd of 85 @,@ 437 and a television audience of over a million , Arsenal won the match 1 – 0 . 
 This was Arsenal 's 21st Shield appearance and Chelsea 's 13th . Petr Čech made his competitive debut for Arsenal against his former team , while captain Mikel Arteta and striker Olivier Giroud were named as substitutes . Gary Cahill was passed fit to start for Chelsea alongside captain John Terry , and Loïc Rémy started up @-@ front as Diego Costa was absent . 
 The only goal of the match came near the midway point of the first half ; Alex Oxlade @-@ Chamberlain collected a pass from Theo Walcott from the right and scored past Thibaut Courtois . Both managers did not shake hands after the game , which drew media attention . Arsenal 's victory was their first against Chelsea in over three years and manager Arsène Wenger 's first over José Mourinho in 14 attempts . 
 = = Background and pre @-@ match = = 
 The FA Community Shield was founded in 1908 as a successor to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield , and began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League , although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI . In 1921 , it was played by the league champions of the top division and FA Cup winners for the first time . 
 Chelsea qualified for the 2015 FA Community Shield as winners of the 2014 – 15 Premier League . It was the club 's fourth league title in ten years and third under the management of José Mourinho . The other Community Shield place went to Arsenal , who defeated Aston Villa by four goals to win the 2015 FA Cup Final and retain the trophy . In doing so , Arsenal had overtaken Manchester United to become the most successful club in the competition 's history , with 12 titles . 
 Chelsea made their eleventh appearance in the Community Shield ; prior to this they won four ( 1970 , 2000 , 2005 , 2009 ) and lost six , most recently in 2012 against Manchester City . By contrast , Arsenal made their 21st Community Shield appearance , and won 13 , including one shared in 1991 . They went into the match as holders of the Shield , having defeated Manchester City a year earlier . Both clubs had only once met before in the Shield , when Chelsea won by two goals to one in 2005 . Arsenal had failed to beat Chelsea in all competitions since 2011 , and Mourinho was undefeated against his opponent Arsène Wenger in 13 matches . Mourinho told reporters a winless run was something he would not tolerate : “ I would try to answer , not because of a mental block but because I would want to try to find solutions to help my team to do it – try to find a different way , try to find the reasons why it goes all the time against my team . " He also attempted to play down the significance of the match , given Arsenal had won the previous year 's contest but finished third in the league . 
 The match was televised live in the United Kingdom on BT Sport 2 ; the network obtained rights to the Community Shield in July 2013 and were into their second year of a deal with the BBC and the FA . The game was also the inaugural broadcast of BT Sport 's 4K ultra HD feed .

 = = = Team selection = = = 
 Chelsea were predicted to line up in a 4 – 2 – 3 – 1 formation , with Willian and Eden Hazard as wide men . Mourinho doubted the fitness of Diego Costa and Gary Cahill going into the match – the former aggravated his hamstring during a pre @-@ season game against Barcelona . Arsenal were expected to line up similarly to Chelsea , with Walcott furthest forward and Mesut Özil in his preferred position as playmaker . Midfielder Jack Wilshere was ruled out of selection , having sustained an ankle injury during training . Arsenal 's top scorer of the previous season , Alexis Sánchez , was rested , having won the 2015 Copa América with Chile earlier in the summer . The teamsheets showed Loïc Rémy starting the match for Chelsea up front and Cesc Fàbregas partnering Matic in midfield . As expected Petr Čech started in goal for Arsenal ; the goalkeeper moved from Chelsea in search of first @-@ team football .

 Chelsea , in their usual home strip of blue , kicked @-@ off the match and immediately lost possession when Walcott dispossessed Matic . Walcott sent the ball to Alex Oxlade @-@ Chamberlain , whose cross on the right forced a punch from Thibaut Courtois . Francis Coquelin conceded a free kick in the sixth minute having fouled Willian inside Chelsea 's half , though nothing came of the set piece . Fàbregas went down under the challenge of Per Mertesacker in Arsenal 's penalty area soon afterwards , but his appeal for a penalty kick was turned down by referee Anthony Taylor and play resumed . Chelsea , having settled the slower of the two teams , began to dominate ball possession and won two early corners , both of which were easily dealt with . In the 17th minute , Nacho Monreal 's charge forward was stopped by Cahill ; the Chelsea defender in the process of making that challenge had suffered a nose bleed . A free kick for Arsenal presented a chance for Walcott to score , but his header goalwards was saved . 
 Arsenal scored the game 's only goal in the 24th minute ; set @-@ up by Walcott , Oxlade @-@ Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta on the right and shoot the ball into the top @-@ left corner of Courtois 's net . It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes . Most of the action in the first half was conducted in a congested midfield , with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow . This favoured Arsenal , who had space to counter @-@ attack had Chelsea lost the ball . Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute , but his curling effort failed to creep into the bottom right @-@ hand corner . Ramires then missed another chance , heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy . Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break , when Oxlade @-@ Chamberlain 's cross found Monreal , who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over . Rémy , often a lone figure upfront , was ruled offside late on .

 Radamel Falcao replaced Rémy after the break and his long @-@ range shot in the 48th minute was blocked . Although Chelsea started the half well , it was Arsenal who fashioned the notable chances before the hour mark . In the 50th minute Santi Cazorla attempted to thread the ball through Chelsea 's defence for Walcott to reach but his pass was cleared . Two minutes later Coquelin over @-@ hit his pass which was directed to Özil , who roamed freely . Chelsea made another change , this time Oscar in place of Ramires in the 53rd minute . Seven minutes later Chelsea came close to scoring when Eden Hazard managed to evade his markers , but through on goal failed to get his shot on target , hitting over . Azpilicueta was shown the game 's first yellow card for pulling Oxlade @-@ Chamberlain back ; Mourinho made the decision to substitute him with Kurt Zouma in the 69th minute . Giroud came on for Walcott moments before , and immediately was involved in the action , shooting high and then from long range . 
 Coquelin then was booked for his foul on Oscar , which earned Chelsea a free kick . Oscar 's attempt was saved by Čech , who fisted the ball round the post . Chelsea continued to attack , though Arsenal withstood their pressure . John Terry rose highest from a corner in the 74th minute and headed the ball in Zouma 's direction , which eventually was caught by Čech . Hazard 's shot was blocked in the 79th minute and Oscar then spurned a chance , with Falcao unable to create something from it . In an effort to find an equaliser with ten minutes of normal time remaining , Mourinho brought on Moses in place of Terry and deployed a three @-@ man defence . It nearly presented Arsenal the chance to score their second of the match , but for Cazorla to have his effort blocked and Aaron Ramsey on the rebound shooting wide .
