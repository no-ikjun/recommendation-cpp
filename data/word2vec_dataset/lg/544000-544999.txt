 McLachlan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) for his " fine qualities as a fighter pilot " and " determined leadership " in the face of often " overwhelming numbers of enemy aircraft " ; the citation was promulgated in the London Gazette on 11 February 1941 under the name " Ian Duncan MacLachlan " . He was the first RAAF fighter pilot to be decorated in World War II . Promoted to wing commander , he took charge of the newly established RAF Benina , Benghazi , on 13 February , handing over No. 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey . By May 1941 , McLachlan was acting as RAAF Liaison Officer for the new Air Officer Commanding @-@ in @-@ Chief , RAF Middle East , Air Marshal Arthur Tedder . The Air Board in Melbourne , headed by the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett , was not consulted over this change of role and took exception to the RAF 's " unilateral action " in appointing McLachlan , but eventually acquiesced and permitted him to remain at the post to coordinate facilities for RAAF personnel in the region until July , when he was recalled to Australia . 
 = = = South West Pacific = = = 
 In 1942 McLachlan took command of RAAF Station Canberra , and , later in the year , RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria . Posted for action in New Guinea , he became the inaugural commander of No. 71 Wing at Milne Bay in February 1943 . The wing consisted of No. 6 Squadron ( flying Lockheed Hudsons ) , No. 75 Squadron ( P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks ) , No. 77 Squadron ( Kittyhawks ) , and No. 100 Squadron ( Bristol Beauforts ) . It came under the control of No. 9 Operational Group , the RAAF 's " premier fighting unit " in the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , whose purpose was to act as a mobile strike force in support of advancing Allied troops . In March the Beauforts took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , " the decisive aerial engagement " in the SWPA according to General Douglas MacArthur , though they were unable to score any hits against Japanese ships . 
 By June 1943 , McLachlan had been promoted group captain and given command of No. 73 Wing . He established his headquarters at Goodenough Island , where he was responsible for organising the wing into a fighter formation consisting of No. 76 Squadron ( Kittyhawks ) , No. 77 Squadron ( Kittyhawks ) and No. 79 Squadron ( Spitfires ) . As well as providing local air defence , and fighter escort for Australian bombers , the Kittyhawks were armed with incendiary and general @-@ purpose bombs so that they could engage in ground attack missions , a practice that had already been employed by Commonwealth forces in the Middle Eastern theatre . In August , the wing transferred to Kiriwina , while No. 9 Group 's other combat formation , No. 71 Wing , took over responsibility for Goodenough . Appointed senior air staff officer ( SASO ) at No. 9 Group , McLachlan handed over command of No. 73 Wing to Wing Commander Gordon Steege in October 1943 . Towards the end of his posting to No. 9 Group , McLachlan told its former commander , Air Commodore Joe Hewitt , that the USAAF was " leaping ahead " of the RAAF , which was being left to " clean up the remnants " of Japanese resistance . He feared that Australian fighter pilots especially would be " increasingly restless if the Americans took all the fighting plums " . Barely a year later , morale among senior RAAF fighter pilots had dropped to such an extent that eight of them tried to resign their commissions in the so @-@ called " Morotai Mutiny " . 
 In March 1944 , McLachlan took took charge of Southern Area Command , Melbourne , with responsibility for maritime patrol , convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine warfare in southern Australian waters ; he handed over to Group Captain Charles Eaton the following January . Mentioned in despatches on 9 March 1945 for his " gallant and distinguished service " , McLachlan returned to action in the South @-@ West Pacific as commander of No. 81 Wing , which comprised Nos. 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons , operating Kittyhawks . As part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force in the Dutch East Indies , the wing was slated to take part in Operation Oboe One , the Battle of Tarakan , in May but was unable to relocate from Noemfoor to its new base on Morotai in time . It fought in Operation Oboe Six , the invasion of Labuan , from June and was based on the island when the Pacific War ended in August 1945 . 
 = = Post @-@ war career = = 
 Following the end of hostilities , McLachlan volunteered to serve with the Allied occupation forces in Japan . He married Margaret Helen Chrystal on 5 January 1946 ; they had a son and a daughter . Promoted to acting air commodore on 1 March , he was appointed SASO of the British Commonwealth Air Group ( <unk> ) , headquartered in Kure and responsible for No. 81 Wing RAAF , as well as squadrons from the Royal Air Force , Royal New Zealand Air Force , and Indian Air Force . Returning to Australia in 1948 , he served as Air Commodore Operations at RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne , at which time the English Electric Canberra was ordered as Australia 's first jet bomber , partly for its ability to deliver nuclear weapons . He completed his term in September 1951 and took over North @-@ Eastern Area Command , based at Townsville , Queensland . Following his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year 's Honours , McLachlan was posted to Britain for three years , first attending the Imperial Defence College , London , and then serving as RAF Director of Flying Training at the Air Ministry during 1955 – 56 . Raised to air vice @-@ marshal , he returned to Australia in 1957 to become Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Training Command in Melbourne . 
 As AOC Training Command , McLachlan undertook two reviews that would have , according to the official history of the post @-@ war RAAF , " a significant effect on the Air Force of the 1960s " . In 1957 , at the instigation of the Air Member for Personnel , Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger , McLachlan formed a committee to review the effectiveness of the syllabus at RAAF College for meeting the future needs of the Air Force in an age of guided missiles and nuclear weaponry . This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees , in line with similar institutions in the other armed services ; the college was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy . The official history of the RAAF considered the result to be only partially successful ; while it turned out highly educated officers , they were educated solely in a rigid scientific discipline suited to an Air Force that never came into existence , one relying on missiles rather than manned aircraft . In 1959 , McLachlan chaired a committee to review the change in the RAAF 's command structure that had taken place in 1953 – 54 , from a geographically based " area " system to a functional system consisting of Home , Maintenance Command , and Training Commands . Concluding that this had reduced duplication and improved efficiency , he proposed further rationalisation by amalgamating Training and Maintenance Commands to form a new organisation , Support Command . His plan was duly implemented , as was his recommendation that Home Command , responsible for air operations , be renamed Operational Command . 
 McLachlan was appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1959 , before being posted to Washington , DC , as attaché heading up the Australian Joint Services Staff in 1961 . During his term in the US , Australia ordered the General Dynamics F @-@ 111C swing @-@ wing bomber as a replacement for the Canberra . Despite what was touted as a firm timetable and cost schedule for the order , McLachlan confided to a colleague that he had serious concerns about when and if the RAAF would actually get the F @-@ 111 , and what the final cost would be . According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens , " even for such a shrewd and sardonic man as McLachlan , that was to prove a painfully prescient observation " , as the new bomber was delivered six years late and massively over budget . Following his return from Washington , McLachlan became Air Member for Supply and Equipment ( AMSE ) in February 1964 . As AMSE he sat on the Air Board , the service 's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers , chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff . In this position he worked to increase the proportion of tertiary educated supply officers , following similar achievements among engineering officers in the RAAF 's Technical Branch . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1966 New Year 's Honours , the citation noting particularly his chairmanship of the two " historic " committees that reorganised RAAF College and the Air Force 's command structure in the late 1950s . The use of electronic data processing became more widespread during McLachlan 's tenure as AMSE , and by 1968 the RAAF 's supply system had been computerised . 
 = = Later life = = 
 McLachlan completed his term as Air Member for Supply and Equipment on 23 July 1968 and retired from the RAAF ; he was divorced from his wife the same year . Upon leaving the military , he became an aeronautical consultant to the Northrop Corporation , and chairman of Information Electronics Pty Ltd from 1983 , serving in both positions until 1987 . He was also chairman of <unk> Winemakers from 1970 through 1975 . In retirement he continued to exercise his interest in Australia 's defence , joining in 1975 a group of pundits , including former Chief of the Air Staff Sir Alister Murdoch , who promoted the addition of nuclear weapons to the country 's arsenal . A resident of Sydney 's Darling Point , Ian McLachlan died on 14 July 1991 . 
 = 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team = 
 The 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season . They played their home games at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor , Michigan and competed in the Big Ten Conference . The team attempted to rebound from its worst season ( loss wise ) in its 130 @-@ year football history and succeeded at first , starting the season 4 – 0 and earning a No. 20 ranking in the polls . Over the final eight games the Wolverines went 1 – 7 however , ending the season with a 5 – 7 record and failing to qualify for a bowl game for the second straight year . 2008 and 2009 were Michigan 's first back @-@ to @-@ back sub-.500 seasons since 1962 and 1963 ; they also failed to win a road game for the first time since 1962 . 
 However , several individuals excelled . Brandon Graham received numerous post @-@ season accolades including Chicago Tribune Silver Football as conference Co @-@ MVP , several first and second team 2009 College Football All @-@ America Team selections , and the 2010 Senior Bowl MVP . Graham was the national statistical champion in tackles for a loss ( TFL ) and the repeat Big Ten Champion . Zoltan Mesko also received several second team All @-@ American recognitions and was a first team Academic All @-@ American . Mesko was the Big Ten punting average statistical champion . After the season , co @-@ captains Graham , Mesko and leading tackler Stevie Brown were drafted in the 2010 NFL Draft and immediately after the draft Donovan Warren signed as an undrafted free agent .

 In 2008 the Michigan Wolverines had possibly the worst season in the history of the program . The team finished with a 3 – 9 regular season record , failing to qualify for a postseason bowl game for the first time in 33 years . The Wolverines struggled to implement first @-@ year head coach Rich Rodriguez 's spread option offense ; Michigan was last in the Big Ten in passing offense , scoring offense , total offense and turnover margin . 
 Going into 2009 , there was optimism that Michigan , led by newly recruited mobile quarterback Tate Forcier , would be able to turn things around and have a winning season , or at the very least win their opening game for the first time since 2006 . The team had 10 returning offensive starters and 5 returning defensive starters . Although to some Forcier was a foregone conclusion as the starting quarterback , the battle between him , incumbent Nick Sheridan , and Denard Robinson was anticipated to be the most competitive position battle in the Big Ten Conference according to College Football News . Although the 2008 defense had been a disappointment , Obi Ezeh and Brandon Graham were considered to be a solid nucleus to build around . The team also employed a new defensive coordinator , Greg Robinson , to help guide this defensive turnaround . The key losses for the team were S Brandon Harrison , DE Tim Jamison , DT Will Johnson , RB Sam McGuffie , DT Terrance Taylor , LB John Thompson , QB Steven <unk> , CB Morgan Trent . 
 = = Recruiting = = 
 The Wolverines received several commitments from 4 @-@ star blue chip players . Among the recruits are Anthony LaLota of the Hun School in Princeton , New Jersey who is ranked as the fourth offensive tackle in the nation by Scout.com and sixth strong side defensive end by Rivals.com. LaLota appeared in the U.S. Army All @-@ American game on January 3 , 2009 in San Antonio , Texas . Other top recruits included a top @-@ ten @-@ rated dual @-@ threat quarterback ( Tate Forcier – Rivals # 6 ) to run Rich Rodriguez 's spread offense , and Justin Turner who was rated as the No. 3 safety . 
 Michigan 's 2009 recruiting class was ranked 7th nationally by Rivals.com , and 10th by ESPN . Eight players initially committed to attend Michigan in 2009 but later decommitted and signed with a different college : Anthony <unk> – K ( PSU ) , Bryce McNeal – WR ( Clemson ) , Kevin Newsome – QB ( PSU ) , Dewayne Peace – WR ( Arizona ) , Jordan Barnes – LB ( Oklahoma State ) , <unk> Graves – DT ( Texas Tech ) , <unk> Jones – DT , and <unk> Beaver – QB ( Tulsa ) 
 Several recruits participated in the January 3 U.S. Army All @-@ American game during which William Campbell announced his re @-@ commitment to the program . Joining Campbell and LaLota in the All @-@ America game were cornerback / safety Justin Turner , kicker Brendan Gibbons , and receivers Jeremy Gallon and Je 'Ron Stokes . Several recruits began early enrollment at Michigan for the Spring 2009 semester , including quarterback Tate Forcier , five @-@ star defensive tackle Will Campbell , running back Vincent Smith , defensive end Anthony LaLota , linebacker Brandin Hawthorne , defensive back Mike Jones and safety Vlad <unk> .

 In an August 30 , 2009 Detroit Free Press article , several current and former players on the 2008 and 2009 teams speaking anonymously said Michigan frequently violated the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) off @-@ season 8 @-@ hour @-@ per @-@ week and in @-@ season 20 @-@ hour @-@ per @-@ week practice limit . Rodriguez denied all of the allegations at a press conference the next day ; The New York Times quoted him as saying " We know the rules , and we follow the rules . " The University of Michigan Athletic Department 's compliance office notified both the NCAA and the Big Ten Conference of its intentions to investigate itself . Unlike the University of Michigan basketball scandal where all of the participants had left the school by the time the investigation completed and punishment was handed down , many of the athletes involved in this scandal are still students at the University of Michigan ; failure to cooperate with the investigation might result in the NCAA revoking the athletes eligibility to participate in athletic competitions . In November , the university revealed its finding that the team failed to file the proper paperwork to document the team 's training schedule . 
 The NCAA had the right to either accept Michigan 's findings once the athletic department 's inquiry was completed or to conduct its own investigation . On October 23 , 2009 the NCAA notified the school that it had decided to begin a formal investigation into the matter ; they expected it to be completed by December 31 , 2009 . On February 22 , 2010 , the NCAA accused Michigan of failing to comply with practice time rules and " failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance within the football program " under coach Rich Rodriguez . The university had 90 days to respond and appeared at an NCAA hearing on infractions in August . Michigan issued self @-@ sanctions on May 25 , 2010 , which included cutting practice time and placing itself on two years worth of probation . Michigan did , however , dispute the claim that Coach Rodriguez " failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance . " The NCAA handed down their final verdict in the case on November 4 , 2010 , which accepted almost all of the self @-@ sanctions that Michigan provided . Michigan was docked 130 practice hours , which was twice the number of excess hours that the university had exceeded , and placed on three years probation , which was one more than originally proposed ; but the university and Rodriguez did , however , escape the most serious charge of " failing to promote an atmosphere of compliance , " as the NCAA agreed with Michigan 's statement that the cases were not deliberate and isolated . This ruling ended the NCAA 's investigation of Michigan 's football program .

 Several players excelled individually . The season began with numerous Wolverines on national award preseason watchlists . Brandon Graham led the way with five such recognitions for the Bednarik Award , Hendricks Award , Lombardi Award , Lott Trophy and Bronko Nagurski Trophy . David Molk was on both the Lombardi and Rimington Trophy preseason lists , while Brandon Minor was on both the Maxwell Award and Doak Walker Award lists . Obi Ezeh , Zoltan Mesko , and Stephen Schilling were preseason Butkus Award , Ray Guy Award and Lombardi candidates , respectively . As the season started , Michigan burst out with a 4 – 0 start and saw several players recognized as Big Ten Conference player of the week early in the season : Tate Forcier , Carlos Brown and Mesko . Also , several players earned midseason or finalist watchlist recognitions : Ezeh ( Butkus ) , Mesko ( Guy ) and Graham ( Hendrick ) . 
 During week 2 , Tate Forcier ( Offense ) and Darryl Stonum ( Special teams ) were honored by the Big Ten Conference as players of the week ( POW ) . At the same time , Forcier was also named AT & T All @-@ America Player of the Week , as well as the Davey O 'Brien National Quarterback of the Week Award and Rivals.com National Freshmen of the Week and the Rivals.com Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honor . The following week , Carlos Brown earned co @-@ offensive POW honors along with Northwestern 's Mike Kafka . Zoltan Mesko was named the special teams player of the week on October 11 . The only statistical leader for the team was Mesko who in eight conference games averaged 45 @.@ 2 yards / punt , which was the first time a Michigan punter led the Big Ten in Conference game punting average since Paul <unk> in 1970 .

Michigan was content to hold their lead ; they essentially stopped passing in the fourth quarter , with Forcier being replaced by backup David Cone midway through the period . Western Michigan finally got on the board with a fourth @-@ quarter 73 @-@ yard TD pass from Tim Hiller to Juan Nunez . 
 The win stopped a streak of two consecutive season opening losses .

 In week 2 , Michigan renewed their long @-@ time rivalry with the visiting Notre Dame Fighting Irish . On the opening drive , Notre Dame drove the field for an unsuccessful field goal attempt . Michigan scored first late in the first quarter when Brandon Minor ran in a 2 @-@ yard TD . Notre Dame responded with a field goal by Nick <unk> . Less than twenty seconds later , however , Michigan answered another touchdown on a 94 @-@ yard kickoff return by Darryl Stonum . Notre Dame came back to take the lead in the second quarter with back @-@ to @-@ back touchdown passes , 4 yards to Golden Tate and 11 yards to Michael Floyd . After another three @-@ and @-@ out by Michigan , the Irish made their way down the field but were stopped by the Wolverine defense , forcing them to kick a 42 @-@ yard field goal . Michigan got the ball back with less than 4 minutes in the half and marched down the field , but with little time left on the clock they had to settle to end the first half with a 39 @-@ yard field goal . 
 Michigan dominated the third quarter , constantly stopping the Irish and controlling the ball most of the period . The Wolverines scored the only points of the quarter on a 3 @-@ yard TD pass to Kevin Koger . Early in the fourth quarter , after another three @-@ and @-@ out by Notre Dame , Forcier ran in a TD himself from 31 yards out on 4th and 3 . Notre Dame came back later in the quarter , starting with a 21 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Tate . Following the touchdown the Irish attempted and failed to score a two @-@ point conversion , leaving themselves down five . After Michigan had an unsuccessful drive , Notre Dame took the lead with a 2 @-@ yard TD run by Armando Allen , who then scored on their second 2 @-@ point conversion attempt , putting the Irish ahead with less than 5 minutes remaining . Michigan responded by marching the length of the field , consuming most of the remaining time . They eventually found themselves 5 yards away from the goal line with 22 seconds left . Two plays later the Wolverines would score the game @-@ winning touchdown on a 5 @-@ yard pass from Forcier to Greg Mathews . 
 The victory gave the Wolverines their first 2 – 0 start since 2006 . Michigan 's all @-@ time record versus Notre Dame improved to 21 – 15 – 1 as a result of the victory . This was the highest scoring game in the history of the rivalry , with a total of 72 points between the teams .

 The game was Michigan 's third straight loss at Wisconsin . It was also Michigan 's 6th straight conference loss , the first time this has happened since the 1958 – 59 seasons . The Wolverines ' record fell to 5 – 6 ; they needed to win next week to become bowl <unk> . 
 = = = vs. Ohio State = = = 
 In the last game of the season , Michigan hosted their arch rivals the No. 9 nationally ranked Ohio State Buckeyes , in the 106th meeting between the two teams . Ohio State scored first when Michigan QB Forcier fumbled while scrambling in the end zone ; the ball was recovered by Ohio State 's Cameron Heyward for a TD . Michigan 's only score of the first half was a 46 @-@ yard field goal . Ohio State 's Brandon <unk> ran in a 29 @-@ yard TD late in the second quarter to make it 14 – 3 at halftime . 
 In the third quarter Michigan closed to within four off of Vincent Smith 's 18 @-@ yard TD catch . Ohio State re @-@ extended their lead to eleven a few minutes later with a 12 @-@ yard TD catch by Daniel Herron . Michigan attempted to come back in the fourth quarter , but all of their drives except the last were ended by interceptions . The Wolverines came closest with eight minutes left , when Forcier was intercepted in the end zone by Buckeye CB Devon Torrence . On their last play of the game , the Wolverines were penalized for being in an illegal formation with five players in the backfield ; this penalty was declined , giving the ball back to Ohio State on downs and ending the game after the Buckeyes ran out the clock . 
 It was Ohio State 's sixth straight win over Michigan , their longest winning streak of the series . QB Tate Forcier had perhaps his worst game this season , throwing four interceptions and turning over a fumble for a TD ; prior to this game he had only thrown six interceptions all year . He became just the second Michigan quarterback to throw four interceptions against Ohio State in the last 60 years . Michigan 's six @-@ game losing streak to Ohio State is the third @-@ longest streak to a single opponent in school history . The loss left Michigan 's final record at 5 – 7 , short of the six wins needed for bowl eligibility . During the game , Brandon Graham posted 5 solo tackles for a loss , to clinch the national <unk> championship .

 = Carabane = 
 Carabane , also known as Karabane , is an island and a village located in the extreme south @-@ west of Senegal , in the mouth of the Casamance River . This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the mangrove trees which cover most of the island . Along with the rest of Ziguinchor Region , Carabane has a tropical climate , cycling between a dry season and a wet season . The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow , but it now supports several types of fruit tree , the most common of which are mangos and oranges . Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and <unk> <unk> Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict , Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds . Various species of fish are plentiful around the island , but there are very few mammals . 
 The earliest known inhabitants of the island were the Jola , the ethnic group which is still the most populous on the island . The Portuguese were active in the region from the 16th century onwards ; however , they did not linger on " Mosquito Island " , the mosquitoes and black flies convincing them to establish their trading post in the town of Ziguinchor instead in 1645 . On January 22 , 1836 , the island was ceded to France by the village leader of Kagnout in return for an annual payment of 196 francs . A series of treaties between the French and the leaders of the local peoples ensued ; however , the inhabitants of Carabane did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them , resulting in lootings and abductions among French rice farmers by the Karoninka people . In 1869 , Carabane became autonomous , but it merged with Sédhiou in 1886 . Since World War II , the population of the island has gradually declined for a variety of reasons including periods of drought , the Casamance Conflict and , more recently , the sinking of the ferry Joola in 2002 . Much of the village 's ability to trade and receive tourists was lost until 2014 , when MV Aline Sitoe Diatta resumed ferry services to the island . 
 Although Carabane was once a regional capital , the village has since become so politically isolated from the rest of the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government . The Jola account for the majority of the island 's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy . The indigenous population was originally animist , but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance , the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane . The literacy rate is approximately 90 % . Students attend a primary school on the island , but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies . 
 The testimonies of explorers and colonial administrators demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation , fishery , trade , and palm wine production for a long time . The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role in the lives of the population . Palm oil and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area . The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing , which supplies the daily needs of the island 's population ; however , broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century . Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island , the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate . Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003 . 
 = = Toponymy = = 
 The etymology of Carabane remains unclear . It could be connected to the Wolof word <unk> , which means " who speaks a lot , " or possibly the Portuguese words casa and <unk> , which mean " house " and " finish , " respectively . According to this hypothesis , the name means the place " where the houses are finished , " a possible allusion to the fact that this village was the first French capital in Basse Casamance . According to other sources , the name comes from <unk> <unk> , which means " the other side of the river . " These uncertainties are augmented by the instability of the spelling : Karabane with an initial K suggests a Jola or Wolof origin , while Carabane with a C would suggest a Latin derivation , most probably through Portuguese or French . 
 = = Geography = = 
 = = = Location = = = 
 With a total area of 57 square kilometres ( 22 sq mi ) , Carabane is the last major island in the mouth of the Casamance River in south @-@ west Senegal . It is situated 12 ° 32 ' N latitude and 16 ° 43 ' W longitude and is , by way of Elinkine , nearly 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) away from Ziguinchor , the capital of the region of the same name , and a little over 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) from Dakar , the country 's capital . 
 " Il faut s <unk> de patience pour <unk> l 'île de Carabane " is a common French phrase which means " One must have patience to reach the island of Carabane " . While this adage continues to hold true , it was even more appropriate in the 19th century when , according to one traveller , a 26 @-@ hour boat trip from Rufisque ( near Dakar ) to Carabane was deemed fairly short , and was credited to a favourable wind . 
 Despite the seemingly close proximity to its neighbouring communities , a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine , the nearest village , takes about thirty minutes ; the trip once took an hour and a half by canoe . Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three @-@ hour boat trip from Ziguinchor . Travelling from Cap Skirring via <unk> is also possible , but as a detailed map of the region would make clear , the channels of salt water are not easily navigated . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 A recent geological formation , Carabane consists of a shoal and alluvium . The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal . As pointed out by early French observers , soils in the region are generally composed of sand and clay , differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors . However , Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand . The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than <unk> mud bricks . This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and <unk> . 
 In this flat and marshy area , the branches and roots of mangrove trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus . These tangles help retain soil , a process which expands the island where the power of tidal race would normally have the opposite effect . 
 Rising just over 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) , the southern portion of the island is partially flooded during the rainy season and totally submerged every few years . At low tide , mudflats are exposed so that boats with keels are forced to dock a considerable distance from the island . When arriving at Carabane , the Joola had to stop about 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) north of the village in 8 to 10 m ( 26 to 33 ft ) of water . 
 The coastal erosion and salinization affecting the west of Senegal are also a source of concern on the island ; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849 . The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice ; each time it was rebuilt , the site of the building had to be moved further and further inland . The island 's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded , even at low tide . During the dry season the river has a tide @-@ dominated delta , with tidewater reaching 200 km upstream , while it is being concentrated 50 % by evaporation . 
 Using wells , freshwater is available at a reasonable depth for irrigation and domestic purposes . Until the installation of a pump in 2006 , however , drinking water had to be sent by boat from Elinkine . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 The tropical climate of Basse Casamance cycles between a dry season and a wet season , which usually starts in June and ends in October . Because of the proximity to the ocean , the humidity of the air remains above 40 % and contributes to the abundance of vegetation . With the trade winds from the Azores High , the island enjoys a pleasant climate year @-@ round . In the north to north @-@ east , these winds are cool and always wet . Their presence is appreciated by <unk> . Agricultural activities , including rice cultivation , depend entirely on rainfall . " Wah <unk> , emit <unk> " is a Jola proverb which means " If a project will not be completed , it will be because the rain did not fall . " The invocation of fetishes when there is no rain is part of traditional animist rituals . In recent decades , there has been a general decline in rainfall , which threatens rice production , increases soil salinity , and contributes to the degradation of the mangroves . In May and June , air temperature is around 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) . In January and February , the coldest months , it is around 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) . Temperatures of below 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) are quite rare . In September , the temperature of surface seawater is 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) . 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 At one time , the island was considered an arid location , where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce . In what has become a tropical climate , vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country , especially during the wet season . Anxious to attract the attention of the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance , administrator Emmanuel Bertrand @-@ Bocandé submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island . Although this report was written in 1849 , the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century . 
 Most of Carabane is covered in mangroves , forming an impassable jungle that can only be crossed in constructed passages . Mangroves are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment , where the quantity of oxygen in the soil is low . In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent . There are various reasons for the degradation , including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood . Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance . 
 Tourists are not as attracted to the island for its mangroves as for the coconut trees which line its beaches , as featured on many of Carabane 's postcards . These palm trees are a valued resource on the island . 
 While not as plentiful as in other parts of Basse Casamance such as Mlomp , kapok trees are nonetheless present . Their grey wood is very light and easy to work , for which reasons it is used to construct many items , ranging from doors to dugouts . Jola canoes , which range from 6 to 8 metres ( 20 to 26 ft ) in length , are carved by adzes entirely out of one tree each , unlike the traditional Senegalese pirogue . 
 As for fruit trees , mangos and oranges are the most populous . Prickly pears , <unk> , and colourful <unk> brighten the scenery of hotels and camps on the island . Various organizations have contributed to the deforestation of the island . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 The wide variety of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers . While Basse Casamance National Park and <unk> <unk> Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict , Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation . A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island : African darter ( Anhinga rufa ) , Goliath heron ( Ardea goliath ) , palm @-@ nut vulture ( <unk> angolensis ) , black @-@ tailed godwit ( Limosa <unk> ) , whimbrel ( Numenius phaeopus ) , Eurasian curlew ( Numenius arquata ) , Caspian tern ( Sterna caspia ) , blue @-@ spotted wood @-@ dove ( <unk> afer ) , red @-@ eyed dove ( Streptopelia <unk> ) , white @-@ rumped swift ( Apus caffer ) , woodland kingfisher ( Halcyon senegalensis ) , grey @-@ backed <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , red @-@ bellied paradise @-@ flycatcher ( <unk> <unk> ) , pied crow ( Corvus albus ) , black @-@ rumped <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and yellow @-@ fronted canary ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island , where one may encounter <unk> ( <unk> ) , Giant African threadfins ( <unk> <unk> ) , great barracudas ( <unk> barracuda ) , or African red snappers ( Lutjanus <unk> ) . The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp ( Farfantepenaeus <unk> ) , sand fiddler crabs ( Uca <unk> ) , and molluscs . The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters ( Crassostrea <unk> ) , which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide . The red @-@ headed <unk> and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island . 
 The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets , although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835 . In 1870 , other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs . In the early 21st century , bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) are commonly sighted off the island . The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity . In this way , the nearby Basse Casamance National Park , which has been closed for years , has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles ( Crocodylus niloticus ) , Senegalese manatees ( Trichechus senegalensis ) , and breeding birds . 
 On an island called Ilha dos Mosquitos ( Portuguese for " Mosquito Island " ) , the natives and their visitors continue to protect themselves with mosquito nets and Shea butter . They must also protect themselves from other , smaller insects which are no less troublesome : black flies ( Simulium ) . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = First inhabitants = = = 
 The traditions of the local peoples are unanimous in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the <unk> people and that the left bank of the mouth of the river was first populated by the Jola . Portuguese sailors reached the west African coast in the 15th century , and in the 16th century , Portuguese traders became active in the Casamance region , mostly in search of wax , ivory , and slaves . They did not linger on " Mosquito Island " , instead founding their first trading post at Ziguinchor in 1645 . 
 In the late 1820s , a mulatto trader from Gorée , Pierre Baudin , moved to Itou and began planting rice and producing lime by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime kilns . The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island . Being wet and marshy , Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation . The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice , which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia . The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and , despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848 , slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century . 
 The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river , particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade , and also because of their competition with Saint @-@ Louis . On January 9 , 1836 , Lieutenant <unk> , who was in charge of Gorée , left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post . The tip of <unk> , on the north shore , was first considered , but at the refusal of the Jola , it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted . 
 = = = French colonization = = = 
 On January 22 , 1836 , the island was ceded to France by the village leader of Kagnout at an annual cost of 196 francs . Still , another treaty made Sédhiou the primary trading post of Casamance , and the exploitation of Carabane was left for some time in the hands of the Baudin family , first Pierre then his brother Jean . Each successively took on the title of Resident . With this official but ambiguous title , they were permitted to continue their trading operation so long as they regularly reported to France . 
 When Jean Baudin fell into disgrace due to a serious incident involving an English ship , he was replaced as Resident in October 1849 by Emmanuel Bertrand @-@ Bocandé . This multilingual , enterprising businessman and entomologist from Nantes transformed " his " island , sparking a resurgence of commercial and political activity . In 1852 , the population surpassed 1 @,@ 000 inhabitants . A cadastral map assigned tracts of 30 square metres ( 320 sq ft ) to traders and contractors . Other tracts of 15 square metres ( 160 sq ft ) were allotted for housing . Provisional concessions were granted to residents of Saint @-@ Louis and Gorée . Other than settlers , the island was mainly inhabited by animist Jola <unk> , whose practices were disconcerting to the settlers . Coexistence was not always easy . Christianity was practiced by the Europeans and some of the residents of Gorée , although the island did not yet have a church . Missionaries tried but were not permitted to settle on the island . 
 The construction of a wharf 116 metres ( 381 ft ) long allowed the berthing of larger vessels coming in from Casamance . A railed pier was built along the river in order to facilitate the transfer of goods . Carabane exported rice , but also cotton , considered to be of poor quality , which was <unk> in a factory built by Bertrand @-@ Bocandé in 1840 , owned first by Maurel & Prom and then by the Casamance Company . The factory also produced almonds and <unk> ( <unk> procera ) . 
 Bertrand @-@ Bocandé became involved in local African politics during his time as Resident . When an intertribal conflict led to an armed raid of Carabane , he mediated the conflict . In 1850 , the island 's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock raid which precipitated further incidents the following year . In response to this conflict with the former owners of Carabane , the residents of Kagnout , Bertrand @-@ Bocandé convinced the governor of Senegal to send a warship to Carabane to frighten off the raiders . This single ship failed to faze the island 's opponents , therefore Bertrand @-@ Bocandé requested a detachment of soldiers and several other ships from the governor . When these reinforcements arrived from Gorée , the conflict was successfully ended . A treaty was signed on March 25 , establishing the sovereignty of France not only in Casamance , but also in Kagnout and <unk> . For his involvement in the conflict , Bertrand @-@ Bocandé was accepted into the Légion d 'honneur and was given a land concession . Bertrand @-@ Bocandé left the island in 1857 for a leave of absence , but he abandoned his post as Resident in 1860 . His tireless activity had a lasting effect on the island . 
 Meanwhile , the inhabitants of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them . For this reason , rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the Karoninka people . Troops led by Émile <unk> @-@ Laprade attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860 , forcing them to submission . A period of calm ensued . While the Mandinka Muslims continued , illegally , to practice slavery and trade , non @-@ Muslim villages tended to come together , accepting the Resident of Carabane as the arbitrator of their disagreements . 
 In 1869 , Carabane became autonomous , but it merged with Sédhiou in 1886 . Its garrison of a dozen men was regularly stricken with tropical diseases such as malaria . In 1877 , 527 people were counted on the island , mostly Jola , but also some Wolofs , Muslims , and a few <unk> from Portuguese Guinea . 
 The first Catholic mission in Sédhiou was founded in 1875 and the first baptisms were celebrated that same year in Carabane . There were 17 people baptised in total , most of whom were residents of the island . The Holy Ghost Fathers ' mission in Carabane was founded in 1880 by Father Kieffer . On February 22 , he settled on the island , but he served for only two years . The staff of the colonial administration was small : the manager of a customs post with four employees , a gunner , a corporal , and six European tirailleurs . There were approximately 250 Christians in Carabane , mostly mulattos . The priest built his house out of Palmyra palm trunks . He visited nearby villages and sometimes went to Sédhiou . The founding of the mission in Carabane was followed by others in Ziguinchor ( 1888 ) , Elinkine ( 1891 ) , and several nearby locations in the 20th century . In 1900 , a <unk> missionary , Father <unk> , wrote the first catechism in the Jola language . 
 Temporarily transferred to Ziguinchor , the Carabane mission closed in 1888 . Missionaries returned in 1890 and , although they immediately expanded the church building , it was still not large enough to accommodate all those who wished to attend . Thanks to subsidies by the bishop , <unk> @-@ Désiré <unk> , and to donations by the parishioners , a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897 . The mission also obtained two adjacent properties , lot # 73 on the cadastral map . By the following year , the Christian community had performed 1 @,@ 100 baptisms , as well as many catechumen . 
 Competition between the French and the Portuguese began to show itself in the region during this period . Because the Portuguese @-@ operated trading posts in <unk> and <unk> asked for higher prices than the French @-@ operated trading posts in Carabane and Sédhiou , the Portuguese lost many traders to the French . This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France , which was negotiated in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain <unk> @-@ Faidherbe . 
 In 1901 , the administrative capital of Casamance was transferred from Carabane to Ziguinchor , a status which was transferred in turn to Oussouye two years later . By 1904 , Carabane had lost several of its amenities , including its customs services , which were centralized . The island 's trading houses were abandoned and the number of Christians dwindled from 1 @,@ 000 to 300 by 1907 . 
 Despite the anti @-@ clerical movement 's growth in France at the time , education in Carabane continued to be administered by the Holy Ghost Fathers for the boys and by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny for the girls . A chapel also continued to be run on the island . 
 In 1913 , just before the outbreak of World War I , Carabane suffered a fire which caused its business to decline . People gradually left the island in search of work in Ziguinchor and even Dakar . On December 1915 , Marcel de Coppet , administrator of Ziguinchor , visited the island in order to recruit tirailleurs . Six inhabitants of the island accepted the position : a Christian , a pagan , and four Muslims . 
 In the aftermath of the Great War , the Roman Catholic Church encountered great difficulties in the region . There was insufficient staffing , the cost of living was rising , and the harsh climate began to wear on the buildings . In 1920 , the diocese had , in addition to Carabane , thirteen churches and approximately thirty @-@ five chapels . The thirteen churches were located in Dakar , Saint @-@ Louis , Gorée , Rufisque , <unk> , <unk> , Joal , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Ziguinchor , Bignona and Banjul . In 1922 , the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism . While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected , some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of Islam in the country . 
 In taking leadership of the diocese , Archbishop Le <unk> noted that the island of Carabane , heavily populated when trading was concentrated there , had lost its influence and now had fewer than 500 inhabitants . He considered transferring the mission to Oussouye , which became a reality in 1927 . Starting in 1937 , the mission in Oussouye also performed baptisms and funerals in Carabane . 
 In the same year , a reform school was created on the island , operating until 1953 , when it was replaced by another in <unk> . A report submitted in 1938 by an educational advisor to Marcel de Coppet , Governor General of French West Africa , detailed the daily life of the prisoners in the school which housed up to 22 boys , mostly convicted for theft but also occasionally for murder .

 Carabane 's population continued to decline gradually after World War II . In 1950 , the construction of a seminary was planned in Carabane , but it was transferred to a new building in <unk> in 1959 . The Carabane mission closed its doors during the wet season of 1953 , 83 years after its inception . The nuns and their interns moved to Ziguinchor . 
 Senegal 's independence was declared on August 20 , 1960 , and after the dissolution of the short @-@ lived Mali Federation , Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north . Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims , they did not know the Jola country and its traditions . The periods of drought that ravaged the Sahel in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all that grew . 
 Discontent began to spread among the people , which sometimes escalated to violence . Casamance has since experienced years of conflict which put local initiatives in jeopardy , such as nature reserves and the first network of villages . In 1998 , in the middle of the conflict , the French commune of Bon @-@ <unk> committed to providing Carabane with humanitarian aid , both economically and culturally . Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict . Nonetheless , a few small incidents were reported around April 2000 . The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane 's reputation to attract media attention . 
 The ceasefire of 2004 brought relative peace , but in the meantime , the sinking of the Joola in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years . Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along with the threat of coastal erosion on the island , some fear the worst . Thus , after years of development and community outreach , Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways . 
 = = Society = = 
 = = = Administration = = = 
 Formerly an administrative district in its own right , even a regional capital , Carabane is now just one of 23 villages in the rural community of <unk> , of which <unk> , Cap Skirring , and <unk> @-@ <unk> are the largest centres . This rural community is located in the <unk> <unk> . It is part of Oussouye Department , the smallest and least central of the three departments in Ziguinchor Region . In a country which includes some 13 @,@ 000 villages , the village is considered , by a 1972 decree , the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation . Each is administered by a leader , assisted by a council . After consultation , the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect and approved by the Minister of the Interior . Under Senegalese law , the leader of the village has certain prerogatives , including law enforcement , tax collection , and keeping of vital records in the village . 
 While this administrative structure was decreed by a government anxious to deal with interlocutors , such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance . Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy . It has no leader with genuine permanent authority . Instead , there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made . According to Italian anthropologist Paolo Palmeri , the leader of the village has very little power in reality , as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration . He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions . In a society where politics are inextricably linked to religion , the real holders of power are the fetish priests . The very notion of a village is almost inappropriate in this context : it might be more appropriately considered a clan or an aggregation of kinship . Other specialists , such as Christian Sina Diatta , compare Jola communities to those of mound @-@ building termites , in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable . 
 = = = Population = = = 
 In 2003 , the village of Carabane 's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households , but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1 @,@ 750 people , according to local sources . Most of the population is Jola . The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language , egalitarian society , freedom from political hierarchy , and lack of slavery . Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation . This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90 % of the residents of Basse Casamance , but only 6 to 8 % of the total population of Senegal . They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane , followed by Wolofs , <unk> , and Serers ( including <unk> fishermen ) . <unk> also live on the island , some of whom came from Saint @-@ Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization . Two communities from neighbouring countries , one from Guinea ( the Susu people ) and the other from Guinea @-@ Bissau , have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village . There are also seasonal workers who come to fish : Ghanaians , Guineans , and <unk> . 
 The indigenous population was originally animist , but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as <unk> survive as cultural icons of Casamance , the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane . The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94 % of the population of Senegal , but only 26 @.@ 5 % of the population of Oussouye Department , where Carabane is located . Still , this department is largely rural , while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity . Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century , but the colonial administration brought with it many translators , guides , and secretaries from Dakar , many of whom were Muslim . 
 = = = Education and health = = = 
 Founded in 1892 , the Carabane school was one of the first in the region . It began as an all @-@ boys school , but in 1898 , three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls . Soon , there were 60 students . A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys ' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year , and that holidays ran from September to November , when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice . In 1903 , when Carabane lost its status as capital , the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls . In 1914 , it had only 56 boys and 26 girls , a situation similar to that in Bignona . 
 Carabane has a new primary school , École François Mendy , inaugurated on January 21 , 2006 , hosting six classes . The literacy rate is approximately 90 % . Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine , the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye , and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor . Carabane 's kindergarten is located in a community house , called " House of Women and Children , " founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor . 
 In 1895 , the government established a medical post in Carabane , but it closed the following year . In 1898 , the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls ' school . 
 As of 2010 , the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor . It provides vaccinations , family planning consultations , and prenatal information . A maternity hospital was founded in 1991 which is decorated with a fresco by Malang <unk> , one of the most famous artists in the region . 
 The Ph.D. thesis published in 2003 , La part de l 'autre : une aventure humaine en terre <unk> , meaning " Part of the Other : A Human Adventure in Jola Territory , " describes the health challenge present on the island in a more general context . 
 In particular , the location of the island does not allow easy access to serious or urgent medical assistance . There is a pirogue @-@ ambulance for the transportation of people off the island in the case of medical emergencies . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The testimonies of explorers and colonial administrators demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation , fishery , trade , and palm wine production for centuries . The island experienced a decline in the 20th century , when Ziguinchor emerged as the regional capital , and more recently because of the negative economic consequences resulting from the Casamance Conflict and the Joola tragedy . 
 = = = Transportation and energy = = = 
 From the colonizers ' perspective , Carabane 's position at the mouth of the river was an undeniable asset . In the 20th and 21st centuries , in terms of trade and tourism issues , this location is more of a disadvantage because it effectively separates the island from the rest of the country . 
 While a direct route by sea has not been available since the sinking of the Joola , the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance . Some national roads connect to Ziguinchor , down the N1 to <unk> . The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia ( both the country and the river ) , the former running through <unk> du Rip to <unk> , and the latter crossing the river to Banjul . The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor . However , traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7 p.m. and 10 a.m. , and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant demining operations . Alternatively , it is possible to travel by plane to the airport in Ziguinchor or Cap Skirring , or to travel by boat to one of these locations . Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward . 
 By boat , the distance between Dakar and Carabane is 265 kilometres ( 143 nmi ) , although Ziguinchor is only 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) away . Before the launch of the Joola , other boats , mostly well @-@ worn ones , made the connection : first Cap Skirring , then the Casamance Express , and then Island Karabane . In January 1991 , a brand new ferry went into operation . Like its predecessors , it connected Dakar to Ziguinchor , stopping near Carabane where canoes could reach the island . On September 26 , 2002 , 180 extra passengers boarded the already overloaded ship at this stop , and a few hours later , the Joola sank . For security reasons , the Joola 's successor , the Wilis , stopped calling at Carabane , to the great displeasure of the inhabitants . Tourists became rare after that , and from time to time , inhabitants of the island found it necessary to move to Dakar or Ziguinchor . Significant modifications to the MV Aline Sitoe Diatta , which replaced the Wilis in March 2008 , were considered to allow it to stop safely at the island , and the construction of a berth was announced . Souleymane <unk> <unk> , who later became Prime Minister of Senegal , laid the first stone of the berth in July 2008 , and the entire construction project was financed by the Senegalese government at an estimated cost of 12 billion West African CFA francs . On April 26 , 2014 , the MV Aline Sitoe Diatta stopped at the Carabane berth for the first time , improving transportation for locals and tourists . As of 2015 , the ferry stops at Carabane four times each week in the middle of its trips between Dakar and Ziguinchor .

 = = = = Rice cultivation = = = = 
 In Basse Casamance , the rice cycle structures the lives of the population and plays a central economic and religious role . The Jola , who constitute 80 to 90 % of the population of Basse Casamance , practice a unique form of rice cultivation . Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century , recorded by the first Portuguese explorers , show them to be similar to those still in use , particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting . Only the varieties of rice have changed . 
 The basic tool used is the <unk> , a kind of wooden spade or shovel ranging from 40 to 70 centimetres ( 16 to 28 in ) , surrounded by a sharp wrought iron blade and attached to a very long , straight , cylindrical neck . The two parts are connected by strips of torn Palmyra palm leaves . The main part is manufactured from a very hard wood measuring 2 to 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 6 ft 7 in to 8 ft 2 in ) in length . The <unk> is mainly used to plough rice fields , but is also used for other purposes , such as excavation and construction . Men perform the clearing and ploughing while the women take care of the sowing , replanting , and weeding as well as the harvesting between October and January . 
 An even checkerboard plot model dominates the green landscape during the rainy season , which becomes more austere after harvest . The rice fields differ only in terms of soil type and location . Where mangroves are populous , such as in Carabane , the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide . Rice farmers must therefore build levees , dig ditches , and create ponds . The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested at the end of the rainy season , when the basins are emptied . The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed . Several years of drainage are required to <unk> the soil . 
 Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries , rice cultivation has been threatened since the late 1960s . Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city , even though they continue to support their community . The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation . 
 = = = = Palm oil and palm wine = = = = 
 Among the agricultural activities practised during the dry season , which halts work in the rice fields , the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis ) , which provides two products which are very popular in the region : palm oil and palm wine . Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine . As a carefully preserved condiment , it is combined with plain rice on holidays . The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then <unk> , allowed to dry , crushed in a mortar , and boiled by women . 
 Palm wine ( called <unk> or <unk> in the Jola language ) is an alcoholic drink derived from the natural fermentation of palm sap , so is not strictly a wine , which is produced by the fermentation of grapes . The recent partial Islamization of the region has not challenged its consumption . Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men . Supported by a strap , the harvester climbs the tree , cuts the bud , and holds out a funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated calabash or , more recently , a bottle . The alcohol content of palm wine develops throughout the day . The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis , and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to fetishes . Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city . Many Jola proverbs attest the popularity of the drink , such as <unk> <unk> <unk> , which means " With palm wine , one never stands up , " or <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which means " Sit down , don 't spill the palm wine . " 
 = = = = Aquaculture = = = = 
 The island 's proximity to the river and the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities , yet the indigenous people , mostly land @-@ dwellers , have long been content to practise artisan fishing , just to supply their own daily needs . <unk> cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used , along with traps , nets , baskets , and fences . In the early 20th century , experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal , along with others from Mali , Guinea , and Ghana , developed deep @-@ sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment . 
 The collection of shellfish , especially oysters , is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance , which is one of three oyster @-@ producing regions in Senegal , along with Petite Côte and Sine @-@ <unk> . Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide . They are harvested during the dry season , mainly by women , who control , from harvest to distribution , an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence . Oysters are an important component of the family diet . Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C , they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish , followed by chicken , and pork . Oysters are readily associated with rice , the staple food , and in times of shortage , even replace it . Locally , oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce . Those destined for sale or preservation , however , are sun @-@ dried or smoked . In some villages , including Carabane , they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market . Oysters are also a source of income , and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone , which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island . Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar , where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers . 
 Crustaceans , such as sand fiddler crabs and shrimp , among the mangroves also occupy a significant place in the local economy . While a large number of shrimp species inhabit the <unk> area , a single family exists in Casamance : <unk> . Southern pink shrimp ( Farfantepenaeus <unk> ) are the most commonly collected . They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men , women , and children . Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s , following the establishment of European industrial units . The local fishermen switched to this method , and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas . A study in 2005 revealed the extent to which the shrimp population in the region has been depleted , citing multiple causes , including diminishing rainfall , over @-@ salinization of the estuary , and poorly controlled harvesting . Along with the mangrove degradation , the civil unrest , and the inadequate fishery regulation , Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2 @,@ 000 people . 
 Grouped into cooperatives , women play a leading role in the island 's economy . Notably through microcredit , they engage in fishing @-@ related activities , such as smoking fish and processing shrimp , oysters , and shellfish in general . As there is no industrial activity on the island ( the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor ) , the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people . They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season , but they tend to settle off the island permanently . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 The Republic of Senegal placed an emphasis on tourism early in its history . The results were promising , and developing the industry further became a priority in the country 's 4th Economic and Social Plan ( 1973 – 1977 ) . Casamance subsequently became the main tourist destination in the country . Already having been described in the 19th century by Captain <unk> @-@ Faidherbe as a kind of Brazil in Africa , Carabane seemed well @-@ placed to attract visitors in search of exoticism as well as vacationers seeking sandy beaches and kite surfing . 
 At the same time , national and even international controversy threatened the industry from the beginning . Those who opposed tourism in Senegal described it as a new form of colonialism while supporters saw it as a panacea that would cure the country of underdevelopment . The idea of alternative tourism was discussed . Several towns in Basse Casamance , including Carabane , were selected to test an integrated agritourism managed by the villagers themselves . In the early 1970s , the agritourism promoter Christian Saglio , a young French sociologist who later became the director of the Leopold <unk> Senghor French Institute in Dakar , believed in Carabane 's potential . He stated that he wanted to make the island the " Gorée of Casamance " , using it as a hub for other camps . Saglio suggested the restoration of old buildings and canopy beds . 
 Despite his fervour , Saglio 's negotiations with the local people were unsuccessful . <unk> and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach , but both failed . The inhabitants were reluctant to participate , and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages . The project was eventually abandoned , and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern , functional building . Despite the failure of Saglio 's initiative in Carabane , <unk> camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns . 
 While Carabane 's tourism sector has suffered because it has not taken part in the network of villages , tourists have avoided travelling to Casamance in general because of the civil unrest . The signing of a ceasefire in 2004 allowed tourism to resume , but not to the extent it had reached before the conflict . 
 Tour operators continue to advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers ' exotic dreams come to life , but this type of discovery tourism is not as popular as traditional beach @-@ related tourism . Thus , visitors from France , Spain , and Italy often combine tours of the cases á <unk> in <unk> or Mlomp with a few days of relaxation in Carabane . The area is also very conducive to the interests of fishing enthusiasts . Along the beach , small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes at prices lower than those in Cap Skirring or Saly . <unk> Malang , a local painter , potter , sculptor , and poet , has created a camp in the area . 
 Although remaining separate from the local tourism network , Carabane has demonstrated its support for social solidarity and holism by joining <unk> ( Global Ecovillage Network Senegal ) , a network of Senegalese ecovillages . 
 = = = Historic sites = = = 
 Carabane has many historic sites , such as the Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since been turned into a hotel , a Brittany @-@ style church building which is no longer in use , and a former slave @-@ trade building . There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine @-@ Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing up in front of the sea , according to his last wishes . Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet , the founder of the city of Dakar , but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb 's plaque . 
 Near the beach are ruins of buildings , pontoons , and wells , with a large tree in the center . A huge piece of metal in its midst bears the inscription CEO Forrester & Co . Vauxhall Foundry . 18 Liverpool S3 . 
 Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003 . An application for Carabane to become a World Heritage Site was filed with UNESCO on November 18 , 2005 . 
 Inspired by Gorée 's example , Carabane is attempting to pay homage to victims of slavery by starting a small museum like the House of Slaves . Like Gorée and Saint @-@ Louis , Carabane places great importance on its cultural heritage . The architectural reminders of this heritage require significant restoration as they have experienced considerable degradation . In 1964 , French anthropologist Louis @-@ Vincent Thomas posed the question of whether Carabane should be preserved , and this question continues to be relevant . The local people suggest that the entire <unk> – <unk> – Carabane area needs saving .

 Andha Naal ( English : That Day ) is a 1954 Indian Tamil @-@ language mystery @-@ thriller film produced by A. V. Meiyappan and directed by Sundaram Balachander . It is the first film noir in Tamil cinema , and the first Tamil film to be made without songs , dance and stunt scenes . The story , which is set in the milieu of World War II , is about the murder of a radio engineer Rajan ( Sivaji Ganesan ) . The suspects are Rajan 's wife Usha ( Pandari Bai ) , the neighbour <unk> Pillai ( P. D. Sambandam ) , Rajan 's brother Pattabi ( T. K. Balachandran ) , Rajan 's sister @-@ in @-@ law Hema ( Menaka ) , and Rajan 's mistress Ambujam ( Suryakala ) . Each one 's account of the incident points to a new suspect . 
 Before the casting of Ganesan , S. V. Sahasranamam and N. Viswanathan were chosen for the lead role but were later dismissed because they were unconvincing to the filmmakers . The story and dialogue were written by Javar Seetharaman , who also played a prominent role as an investigation officer in the film . Cinematography was handled by S. Maruti Rao and the background score was composed by AVM Productions ' own music troupe , " Saraswathy Stores Orchestra " . The film 's length of 12 @,@ 500 feet ( 3 @,@ 800 m ) was shorter than most contemporaneous Tamil films . 
 Andha Naal was released on 13 April 1954 , a <unk> ( Tamil New Year ) release . It was critically acclaimed and was awarded the " Best Film Award " by the Madras Filmfans ' Association and a Certificate of Merit for Second Best Feature Film in Tamil at the 2nd National Film Awards in 1955 . Despite being a commercial failure during its release , the film has acquired a cult status over the years and is regarded as a milestone in Tamil cinema . In 2013 , Andha Naal was included in CNN @-@ News18 's list of the " 100 greatest Indian films of all time " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On the night of 11 October 1943 , the Japanese bomb the Indian city of Madras ( now Chennai ) . The next morning in Triplicane , Rajan , a radio engineer and communications researcher , is found murdered with his own hand gun . His neighbour <unk> Pillai hears the gunshot and makes a complaint to the police . <unk> Naidu , a local police inspector , arrives at Rajan 's house and starts investigating the murder . In the meantime , Crime Investigation Department ( C.I.D. ) officer Sivanandam joins Naidu to help the investigation . Naidu suggests that the killer could be a thief who must have killed Rajan for the money found at the crime scene . However , Sivanandam is unconvinced with Naidu 's idea because the sum of money present matches the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room . Rajan was about leave Madras in anticipation of the bombings . 
 The two policemen question five people in and around Rajan 's house , most of whom are family members or friends of Rajan . The first person to be questioned is Rajan 's wife Usha , who is unable to speak due to grief . Sivanandam and Naidu feel embarrassed and are reluctant to question her further . They begin interrogating Pillai , who reported the murder . Pillai proposes that the killer is probably Pattabi , Rajan 's younger brother , and recalls a confrontation between Pattabi and Rajan . Pattabi asked for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him . Rajan refused to give Pattabi his share , feeling that he and his wife would squander it . Pillai concludes that this may have prompted Pattabi to kill Rajan . 
 Sivanandam and Naidu decide to interrogate Pattabi , who feels remorse for Rajan 's death and states that he did not treat his brother well and failed to understand his good intentions . He recounts an incident in which his wife Hema had fought with Rajan for not apportioning the property . Pattabi states that Hema could have killed Rajan for the money as she loses sanity when overpowered by anger . Sivanandam briefly leaves Naidu to interrogate Hema . She is initially impudent and refuses to give a statement about the crime , but she later yields when threatened that her husband will be arrested . She reveals Rajan 's extramarital affair with a dancer named Ambujam , who is pregnant with Rajan 's child . As Rajan treated the news with a reckless attitude , Hema proposes that Ambujam could have killed Rajan . When questioned , Ambujam accuses Pillai of the murder , saying that he was her foster father who wanted her to stay away from Rajan , after the three met during a picnic . As their relationship continued , Pillai became infuriated and wanted to end the affair . 
 Sivanandam inquires Usha , who tells him how she and Rajan fell in love . Sivanandam tricks Usha using a leaky fountain pen to collect her fingerprints . That evening , Sivanandam meets all the suspects along with Naidu at Rajan 's house and carries out an exercise in which the suspects — including Usha — must shoot Sivanandam as though he is Rajan using revolvers loaded with fake bullets . All the suspects shoot , but Usha bursts into tears and fails to shoot . Sivanandam then orders an apparent arrest of Pattabi and Hema . Unable to bear the torture , Usha reveals the truth : Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price . Unable to get any support from the government , he went to Japan where his work was appreciated . He became a spy working for Japan , selling India 's military secrets to the Japanese . Usha learnt about this and tried to reform him . But , Rajan does not mind betraying India . Usha could not stop Rajan and tries to shoot him . She changes her decision but pulls the trigger accidentally , killing Rajan . After revealing the truth , Usha commits suicide .

 Sundaram Balachander , a " multi @-@ faceted " film personality entered films as an actor in 1934 and apprenticed under director Krishna Gopal for the film Idhu <unk> ( 1948 ) , a supernatural thriller . Following the success of Idhu <unk> , Balachander directed En <unk> ( 1948 ) and <unk> ( 1951 ) , both made on similar themes . After acting in a few more films , he decided to make a film based on his own story . Balachander wrote a play in in the narrative style of Akira Kurosawa 's Japanese film Rashomon ( 1950 ) , and showed it to <unk> of All India Radio , who rejected it . Balachander then approached AVM Productions founder A. V. Meiyappan and told him the story ; the latter agreed to adapt the story into a film . When Balachander told Meiyappan that he wanted no scenes featuring songs or stunts , the latter was opposed ; he wanted to include at least one song . However , Balachander responded by saying that even a solitary song in the film would " ruin the tempo " . Meiyappan eventually agreed to finance the film because he liked the story , and had trust in Balachander 's talent . Andha Naal thus became the first Tamil film that did not have any songs or dance sequences , and remained AVM Productions ' only film directed by Balachander . 
 The lead role of the radio engineer Rajan was initially offered to S. V. Sahasranamam , who was removed after some days of shooting because Balachander and Meiyappan were not satisfied with his performance and felt he looked " too old " to play the role . The filmmakers then engaged newcomer N. Viswanathan , a Tamil professor from Calcutta . After some footage featuring him was shot , the makers were again unconvinced with Viswanathan 's work ; they dismissed him and replaced him with Sivaji Ganesan . Meiyappan had introduced Ganesan in Parasakthi ( 1952 ) , and was very keen to have him play the lead role . Balachander was initially hesitant to approach Ganesan because he was unsure whether the latter would accept a negative role . In his autobiography , Ganesan stated that the film was almost completed before he was approached . He agreed to be a part of the film because he found the story interesting and thought portraying a variety of characters would interest the audience . Ganesan initially charged ₹ 40 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to ₹ 2 @.@ 8 million or US $ 42 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) which Meiyappan could not afford to pay . He offered Ganesan ₹ 25 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to ₹ 1 @.@ 8 million or US $ 26 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) , but Ganesan refused . Balachander , however , told Ganesan that Meiyappan would pay him ₹ 1 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to ₹ 71 @,@ 000 or US $ 1 @,@ 100 in 2016 ) for every day they shot the film , and Ganesan obliged , believing the film would take long to complete To his dismay , Balachander completed the shoot in 17 days . Andha Naal was one of the earliest films in which Ganesan portrays an antihero . The screenplay and dialogue were written by Javar Seetharaman , who also appeared in the film as a C.I.D. officer , and gave a voiceover in the beginning of the film in the scene before Rajan is shot dead . Pandari Bai was selected to play Rajan 's wife . Malayalam actor T. K. Balachandran , actresses Suryakala and Menaka , and P. D. Sambandam formed the rest of the cast . 
 <unk> Srinivasan , who would later become one of Tamil cinema 's established directors , assisted Balachander with this film . Cinematography was handled by S. Maruti Rao , and the editor was S. Surya . The background score was performed by Saraswathy Stores Orchestra , AVM Productions ' music troupe . No credit to the story is given in the introduction credits . The photography of the film was markedly different from most earlier films in Tamil cinema . Rao used the " painting with light " technique , which captures the shadow of the actors to reflect their " mood and character " . Meiyappan was initially dissatisfied with Ganesan 's performance and wanted the scenes to be reshot . When Balachander refused , Meiyappan demanded that the footage canned be burnt , but Balachander again refused , and instead reshot Ganesan 's scenes . The film 's final cut was less than 12 @,@ 500 feet ( 3 @,@ 800 m ) — shorter than most contemporaneous Tamil films . 
 = = Themes and influences = = 
 Regarded as the first film noir in Tamil cinema , Andha Naal is set in the milieu of South @-@ East Asian theatre of World War II where the Japanese bombed the Indian city of Madras in 1943 . Residents of the city moved to nearby hill stations to protect themselves from further bombings and invasions . Though various sources , including Ganesan , have stated that the film was inspired by Rashomon , film historian Randor Guy notes that this notion is erroneous , that Andha Naal was actually adapted from the 1950 British film The Woman in Question directed by Anthony Asquith , and that there was only a " thematic resemblance " between Andha Naal and Rashomon . According to Jason P. Vest , in his book Spike Lee : Finding the Story and Forcing the Issue , the three films follow a nonlinear narrative by presenting diverging accounts of the same incident . In his 2015 book Madras Studios , film historian Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai notes that Andha Naal has nothing to do with Rashomon except for its whodunit plot , where the murder is explored in various angles . He also notes that Andha Naal ends with the mystery being solved , unlike Rashomon . According to B. Vijayakumar of The Hindu , Andha Naal is " probably " the first spy film in South India . 
 The main theme of Andha Naal is patriotism . It tells how unemployment and desolation of youngsters will lead to them becoming traitors . If a country does not appreciate talented young men for their efforts , they could turn against the nation . Ganesan 's character Rajan turns into a traitor by selling military secrets to Japan because his idea was rejected by the Indian government . This role was influenced from T. S. Balaiah 's character in the 1946 Tamil film Chitra . Pillai compared Pandari Bai 's character Usha in Andha Naal to her character in Parasakthi ( 1952 ) because in both films she is ideologically driven , but in the former , " it is the idea of the Indian nation that she pledges her allegiance to . " The Times of India compared Andha Naal to Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) for its similar lighting and camera angles . 
 The film uses a Tamil saying " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( a virtuous wife may even kill her own husband ) as a clue to the identity of the culprit . The story of the blind men and an elephant is referenced in the narrative , when Sivanandam notes how each suspects ' account of Rajan 's death contradicts that of the others . Usha is depicted as a virtuous wife and a patriot who loves her country . When she discovers that her husband has betrayed India , she does not hesitate to kill him . The Directorate of Film Festivals describes Naidu as a conscientious officer , and Sivanandam as a " brilliant , eccentric but not so serious " man . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Andha Naal was released on 13 April 1954 , a <unk> ( Tamil New Year ) release , to critical acclaim , but did not succeed commercially because the audience were not impressed with a film without songs . The film was considered " revolutionary " for taking this move . In theatres , the viewers were disappointed after the first scene in which Ganesan is shot dead , and many even walked out . The theatre owners had to persuade them to watch the entire film . Its commercial failure led Meiyappan to avoid making any more films without song sequences . The film was later re @-@ released after the announcement of the 2nd National Film Awards and became a box @-@ office success . Moser Baer and AP International have released the film on home video . 
 Andha Naal won critical praise , in spite of its poor performance at the box @-@ office . At the 2nd National Film Awards , the film won a Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film in Tamil , and a " Best Film " Award from the Madras Filmfans ' Association in 1955 . Contemporary critics lauded Meiyappan and Balachander for the experimental film . Ganesan 's role as an antihero won critical acclaim ; many critics said that Pandari Bai 's role as his patriotic wife " overshadowed " Ganesan 's performance . Many contemporary critics expected the film to be a " trendsetter " but it failed to inspire many thematically similar films in Tamil . Several years later , Balachander 's wife Shanta recalled that he was not affected by the film 's failure as he was " delighted that he pulled it off " , with the performances of Ganesan , Pandari Bai and the other actors being praised . 
 In a review dated 1 May 1954 , the magazine Kumudam praised Meiyappan 's courage in trusting the potential of " young talents like S. Balachandar and Javert Seetharaman who are redefining Tamil cinema " . It noted that if AVM had publicised the film as a thriller , " the warning that there are no songs or dances in the film would not have been so terrifying " . The magazine gave the verdict , " Success of art ; failure of narrative " . In the same month , a meeting was organised by the " Film Fans Association " in Madras to congratulate Meiyappan , Balachander , the actors and other crew members of the film . V. C. <unk> , the president of the association , said that Meiyappan " had displayed his pioneering spirit and zeal in producing a novel type of Tamil picture , without either songs or dances , relying for its success purely on the story and the portrayal of characters " . The magazine Gundoosi encouraged fans to see Andha Naal if they " really want Tamil cinema to progress " . In June 2008 , The Times of India gave the film a rating of four out of five , stating that it had a " timeless feel both in terms of story telling and presentation . " The reviewer praised the performances of Ganesan and Pandari Bai , and concluded , " Javar Seetharaman 's brilliant screenplay coupled with S Balachander 's subtle direction make this one of Tamil cinema 's finest offering so far . " Writing for Deccan Chronicle , <unk> Balachandran said , " [ Pandari Bai 's ] role as a patriotic woman in Andha Naal ... will always be memorable . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Andha Naal has been described by French film historian Yves Thoraval as a revolution in Tamil cinema for the absence of songs and dances . Though largely ignored during its release , it has since attained cult status in Tamil cinema , and in addition to becoming a trendsetter for Tamil films without songs , it set the benchmark in Tamil cinema for its noir @-@ style lighting in some of its dramatic sequences . In 2001 , journalist S. Muthiah called Andha Naal the " best film " produced by Meiyappan . He noted that it " proved that a song @-@ and @-@ <unk> film could also be a hit . " In July 2007 , S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu asked eight Tamil film directors to list their all @-@ time favourite Tamil films ; three of them — K. Balachander , Mani Ratnam and Ameer — named Andha Naal . Malaysian author Devika Bai , writing for New Straits Times , described Andha Naal as Balachander 's magnum opus , and Balachander as " Tamil cinema ’ s Father of Film Noir " . 
 The film is regarded by many critics as Balachander 's best work . Encouraged by the film 's critical success , Balachander went on to direct and act in several more films of the same genre — Avana Ivan ( 1962 ) , <unk> ( 1964 ) and Nadu <unk> ( 1965 ) . Andha Naal inspired several later whodunit films — including Puthiya Paravai ( 1964 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 1965 ) , Sigappu Rojakkal ( 1978 ) , Moodu Pani ( 1980 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 1990 ) , and several <unk> Tamil films such as <unk> Oruvan ( 1965 ) , <unk> ( 1979 ) , Veedu ( 1988 ) and Uchi <unk> ( 1990 ) . Researcher and ethnographer Preeti <unk> compared Ratha Kanneer ( 1954 ) to Andha Naal because in both films , " the sin of foreignness is [ neutralised ] by a chaste Tamil woman , the virtuous wife " . Director Chimbu Deven acknowledged Andha Naal as an influence on his 2014 film Oru <unk> <unk> <unk> in its end credits . 
 The film was screened in the " Tamil Retrospective Section " of the 14th International Film Festival of India in 1991 . In 2008 , Randor Guy praised Andha Naal for " being the first Tamil film which had no dance , song or stunt sequence and for Balachandar ’ s impressive direction and fine performances by Sivaji Ganesan and Pandari Bai " . In March 2012 , film historian Mohan V. Raman told The Times of India that Andha Naal , being the first film noir in Tamil cinema , was " among the significant black and white films of yore " , along with Mayabazar ( 1957 ) and Uthama Puthiran ( 1940 ) . In a 2013 interview with the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan , Malayalam filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan listed Andha Naal as one of his earliest favourites in Tamil cinema . In April 2013 , Andha Naal was included in CNN @-@ News18 's list of " 100 greatest Indian films of all time " . In mid @-@ April 2014 , the film was screened at the Russian Cultural Centre , Chennai , to mark its diamond jubilee anniversary . 
 Film Heritage Foundation announced in March 2015 that they would be restoring Andha Naal along with a few other Indian films from 1931 to 1965 as a part of their restoration projects carried out in India and abroad in accordance to international parameters . The foundation , however , stated that they would not <unk> any of the films as they " believe in the original repair as the way the master or the creator had seen it . " Filmmaker <unk> Singh <unk> also believes that the film requires restoration on a " priority basis " . A 30 @-@ minute play adaptation of the film was staged in April 2016 and was directed by Balachander 's son Raman . In the same month , Balachander 's daughter @-@ in @-@ law Dharma Raman wrote for The Hindu , " The few films he produced , directed , acted , sang and composed music for , stand the test of time and are worth celebrating .

 = Kanae Yamamoto ( artist ) = 
 Kanae Yamamoto ( <unk> <unk> , Japanese : [ <unk> ] , 24 October 1882 – 8 October 1946 ) was a Japanese artist , known primarily for his prints and yōga Western @-@ style paintings . He is credited with originating the sōsaku @-@ hanga ( " creative prints " ) movement , which aimed at self @-@ expressive printmaking , in contrast to the commercial studio systems of ukiyo @-@ e and shin @-@ hanga . He initiated movements in folk arts and children 's art education that continue to be influential in Japan . 
 Kanae trained as a wood engraver in the Western style before studying Western @-@ style painting . While at art school he executed a two @-@ colour print of a fisherman he had sketched on a trip to Chiba . Its publication ignited an interest in the expressive potential of prints that developed into the sōsaku @-@ hanga movement . Kanae spent 1912 to 1916 in Europe and brought ideas back to Japan gleaned from exhibitions of peasant crafts and children 's art in Russia . In the late 1910s he founded movements the promotion of creative peasant crafts and in children 's art education ; the latter quickly gained adherents but was suppressed under Japan 's growing militarism . These ideas experienced a revival after World War II . 
 Though always a supporter , Kanae left behind printmaking in the 1920s and devoted his artistic output to painting until he suffered a stroke in 1942 . He spent his remaining years in mountainous Nagano in the city of Ueda , where the Kanae Yamamoto Memorial Museum was erected in 1962 . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 = = = Early life and training ( 1882 – 1907 ) = = = 
 Kanae Yamamoto descended from the Irie clan of hatamoto — samurai in the direct service of the Tokugawa shogunate of feudal Japan in Edo ( modern Tokyo ) . His grandfather died 1868 in the Battle of Ueno , during the Boshin War which led to the fall of the Shogunate and the Meiji Restoration which returned power to the Emperor . This orphaned Kanae 's father Ichirō , and thereafter he grew up in Okazaki in Aichi Prefecture ; how he got there is a matter of speculation . The specialist in Chinese medicine 
 <unk> Yamamoto , from line of specialists in traditional Chinese medicine took in Ichirō with the intention of raising him to marry his daughter Take , the eldest of the family 's nine children . 
 Kanae was born 24 October 1882 in the Tenma @-@ <unk> 1 @-@ <unk> neighbourhood of Okazaki . <unk> intended Ichirō to continue the family profession , but when the Meiji government announced it would grant medical licenses only to those who practised Western medicine , Ichirō moved to Tokyo to study it shortly after Kanae 's birth . He lodged in the household of Mori Ōgai 's father , where he performed household duties to earn his keep . To advance his studies he took part the clandestine digging up of fresh graves to find bodies for dissection . 
 When he was five Kanae and his mother joined Ichirō in Tokyo and settled in a tenement house in the San 'ya area . His mother did sewing work to help support the family , and with her sister Tama provided maid service to the Mori household , and thus Kanae often met his younger cousin , <unk> Murayama , who like Kanae was to make a career in art . The painter Harada <unk> , whom Ōgai had befriended when the two were studying in Germany , asked Kanae 's mother , whom he had seen at the Mori household , to model for the painting Kannon Bodhisattva Riding the Dragon of 1890 . Such occurrences may have contributed to attracting Kanae to art . 
 Ichirō raised his son under the influence of the liberal educational principles of <unk> <unk> . Ichirō was responsible for the welfare of five of his wife 's siblings , and so at age 11 , after four years of primary school , the family finances did not permit Kanae 's schooling to continue . He became an apprentice wood engraver and mastered Western techniques of tonal gradation in the workshop of Sakurai <unk> in Shiba . His training focused on book and newspaper illustration , and included letterpress printing and photoengraving . His skill developed quickly and soon won praise from those he worked with . During this time printing technology underwent rapid change , brought to the forefront by the First Sino @-@ Japanese War , which was reported in a variety of media , from paintings and woodblock prints to photographs . Kanae completed his apprenticeship at 18 , followed by an obligatory year of service with Sakurai . By 1896 Ichirō had earned his medical license and set up a practice in <unk> ( now part of Ueda ) , a village in Nagano Prefecture . 
 The rapid change in printing technology led Kanae to doubt his future prospects in wood engraving . He aspired to become a painter but knew his yet @-@ indebted father was not in a position to pay for art school . He secretly enrolled at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1902 , where he studied yōga Western @-@ style painting . His instructors there included Masaki Naohiko , Tōru Iwamura , and Kuroda Seiki . 
 To pay for school Kanae worked odd printing jobs for employers such as the Hochi Shimbun newspaper , and from February 1903 lodged at the home of his friend Hakutei Ishii , the eldest son of the artist Ishii <unk> . Kanae and the other aspiring artists lodged there talked into the night about art and hired a model for life drawing once a month . 
 = = = Prints and sōsaku hanga ( 1904 – 1911 ) = = = 
 Kanae joined a group of friends in July 1904 on a trip to Chōshi in Chiba Prefecture where they stayed near the mouth of the Tone River . There he made a sketch of a fisherman dressed in ceremonial clothing overlooking a harbour . When he returned , he used the sketch as the basis of a wood engraving . He engraved on both sides of a single piece of wood : the one side he printed in ochre , which filled in all the spaces except the towel on the fisherman 's head ; the other he printed in black , which provided outlines and details . At the time , the art establishment saw woodblock printing as a commercial venture beneath the station of an aspiring fine artist . 
 Hakutei noticed the print and had it published in the July issue of the literary magazine <unk> . In a column in the issue Ishii promoted the print as revolutionary , as it had been done as a means of painterly spontaneous self @-@ expression , and used methods Ishii associated with ukiyo @-@ e traditions . Soon the style Ishii dubbed tōga became a popular topic within <unk> circles . This was to grow into the sōsaku @-@ hanga ( " creative prints " ) movement . 
 Early works by Kanae Yamamoto 
 In summer 1905 Kanae visited his parents in Nagano , where he produced the oil painting Mosquito Net , the earliest of his oil paintings to be made public . That September Kanae , Hakutei and <unk> Ishii , and some other friends founded the short @-@ lived magazine <unk> in which they published a number of their prints . It was in <unk> that the word hanga first appeared . The word was used interchangeably with tōga until the magazine came to an end in April 1906 ; thereafter tōga fell out of use and hanga went on to become the modern Japanese word for prints in general . 
 Kanae learned in 1906 of the <unk> strain his parents still faced with their continuing responsibility for his mother 's siblings . He moved out of the <unk> ' home on 8 March 1906 and rented a residence in Morikawa @-@ chō in <unk> Ward of Tokyo determined to pursue financial independence . He graduated on 2 April 1906 from the Tokyo School of Fine Arts , and in his graduation yearbook declared the French painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes his favourite artist . He took work at Rakuten Kitazawa 's Tokyo Puck , a cartoon humour magazine patterned after the American Puck . 
 Kanae felt disappointed at hand @-@ printing 's gradual loss of prestige in Japan ; to revive interest he wrote a four @-@ part series of articles in 1907 for the art magazine Mizu @-@ e <unk> a wide variety of printing media and techniques . Kanae , Hakutei , and a former art @-@ school classmate of Kanae 's , Morita <unk> , founded the monthly magazine <unk> whose first issue appeared 15 May 1907 . It was patterned on such European magazines as <unk> , Jugend , Simplicissimus . The contents were primarily literature , criticism , and art cartoons , and its publishers paid fine attention to details of graphic design . They printed the magazine on fine paper at an unusually large size and mixed colour reproduction with black @-@ and @-@ white . Kanae 's contributions included his own prints , haiku poetry , and the carving of printing blocks for the designs of others . Kanae 's former engraving teacher Sakurai <unk> furnished the photographic printing plates . The first issue was eight pages and included a supplementary print of Shiba Park by Kanae . The young artists distributed the issue themselves to bookstores . It sold well , and the circle of contributors grew , as did the page count , which expanded to sixteen . 
 Tokyo during the Meiji period ( 1868 – 1912 ) had a great openness to foreign — especially European — influence , and Western trends in art were quickly replacing traditional Japanese ones until word spread of the impact exported ukiyo @-@ e had had on art in the West . Artists who had all but abandoned the culture of the Edo period began to reconsider it and mix elements of it with Western approaches . Kanae took part in meetings of the Pan no Kai group of writers and artists whose goal was to replicate the atmosphere of Parisian cafés such as Café <unk> of the Impressionists . At one of these rowdy bohemian meetings , a drunken Kanae fell through a window and landed in the garden below , wrapped in a <unk> paper screen ; he returned to the gathering as if nothing had happened . The police kept watch over these meetings whose members they suspected of having socialist sympathies and held grudges over caricatures some of the members had published . Pan no Kai waned and came to and end in 1911 . 
 Kanae wanted to revive the spirit of Edo @-@ period ukiyo @-@ e in his prints , and to this end in 1911 he founded the Tokyo Print Club to produce and distribute such prints . He advertised for members in Hōsun , but after the magazine 's demise most of the associated artists left Tokyo and the only member he could recruit was <unk> Sakamoto . The pair began a series titled <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ( " Stage Figure Sketches " ) of portraits of kabuki actors in the vein of the yakusha @-@ e genre of ukiyo @-@ e . The subjects were sketched from performances at the just @-@ built Imperial Theatre and were captioned in French on the front and on the back in Japanese . Though Kanae had announced that prints were to come from thirty @-@ four theatre pieces only three sets of four prints — two by each artist in each set — appeared in June , July , and September that year . The work represents a major turning point in his career as he turned away from the Western techniques that had defined his work toward a more Japanese approach such as the use of flat areas of colour . The prints failed to sell at first but began to find buyers only after he had left for France the following year . As Kanae was away the printer was not able to issue a second printing to meet the demand . 
 Kanae had come to neglect Hōsun as he devoted himself to <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> . Hakutei and <unk> had left Tokyo , and that July the magazine came to an end after thirty @-@ five issues . 
 = = = Europe ( 1912 – 1916 ) = = = 
 Kanae had wanted to marry Mitsu Ishii , but her family forbade it — especially her mother and brother Hakutei . This rejection embittered him and he broke his friendship with Hakutei , though he remained friends with <unk> . Kanae wished to study painting in Paris , so his father organized the distribution and sale of his son 's work to raise funds for it while he was away . He set off on the Tango Maru from Kobe on 6 July 1912 , and fifty @-@ three days later landed in Marseilles . While on board he made what was likely the first of the prints he father was to sell for him by subscription : titled Wild Chickens , it depicted three Chinese prostitutes with bound feet inspired by prostitutes he saw when he passed through Shanghai . He printed it in Paris , where in his first few months he studied etching at the École des Beaux @-@ Arts . 
 Upon arrival Kanae contacted the painter <unk> Wada , who had been in Paris since 1907 . Wada introduced him to <unk> <unk> , and Kanae soon moved into a studio next to <unk> 's . He found French difficult to master and associated mostly with expatriate Japanese artists such as <unk> Umehara and <unk> Yasui . His closest friend there was <unk> Kosugi , a contributor to Hōsun who arrived in March 1913 to spend a year travelling Europe . 
 In 1913 the writer Tōson Shimazaki visited Kanae , whom he had known from Ueda . The two shared the recent experience of having been denied a marriage . Tōson wrote of the print On the Deck that Kanae was finding difficult to finish : a print of a long @-@ haired woman on the deck of the Tango Maru as it was in Singapore . It was made with six cherry woodblocks on mulberry <unk> paper , materials Kanae had brought from Japan . The print was sent to Japan that May . The pair went to seaside Brittany for six weeks from that July , and soon were joined by a number of other artists , all of whom were drawn there by the tales of the beauty of the region Kuroda Seiki had written in the 19th century . Kanae was particularly productive of prints while in Brittany . 
 Kanae felt isolated from the culture and found little art there that he appreciated . He disliked the paintings of van Gogh , Monet , and Édouard Manet . He liked the works of Renoir and Sisley , and Puvis de Chavannes , admired the paintings of Cézanne , but denied any connection between them and those of the Cubists whose works he denigrated ; he wrote that only one in three thousand paintings of Matisse were good . 
 Kanae imagined himself a realist and was distressed at the avant @-@ garde that was coming to dominate the European art world ; he found it difficult to comprehend and reconcile it with his understanding of a realist ideal in Western art . His disappointment and confusion impacted his productivity ; he produced few of the prints that were supposed to fund his stay , and the language barrier made it difficult to find buyers . A Tokyo agent of his committed suicide after appropriating money from Kanae and other clients . He could not bring himself to reveal his and his parents ' financial situation , so he had another agent , <unk> Watanabe , send money to Paris just so he could send it back to his parents , who were under pressure from a loan shark . Along with his disappointment in the Western art world , Kanae witnessed first @-@ hand the impact Japanese art had had there . Though he kept such thoughts to himself he began to feel a sense of the superiority of Japanese art — of the same traditions he had denied himself during his years of training . 
 Kanae managed to acquire funds from connections and refused to return early to Japan despite the urgings of friends and associates . Troubles thickened in mid @-@ 1914 when World War I broke out and he learned that Mitsu Ishii had married . The war drove him from Paris to London where he stayed for four months , much of it sick with bronchitis . He returned to Paris on 11 January 1915 , but work was scarce and the museums were closed . He resolved to return to Japan the following spring , but first moved with a group of Japanese compatriots to Lyon where he found work that brought in enough money for a trip to Italy in March 1916 to see the Renaissance masterpieces . Upon returning to Lyon he learned of the death of Sakurai and finally prepared to go back to Japan . 
 The least expensive route for Kanae to Japan was through Russia . He set off from Paris on 30 June 1916 via England , Norway , and Sweden . In Moscow he met the Japanese consul and the social critic <unk> <unk> ; the latter introduced him to proletarian art and encouraged him to visit <unk> Polyana , Leo Tolstoy 's home which he had made into a farmers ' school . The experienced moved Kanae , who later was to write , " While I was staying in Moscow in the summer of 1916 , I felt that I had two important missions . One was promotion of children 's free painting and the other was establishment of farmers ' art . " Kanae visited the Moscow <unk> ' Museum , which had exhibited peasant arts and crafts since 1885 . He praised its sturdy quality and ethnic design , and lamented that industrialization had brought about a degradation in its perceived value and was threatening its survival . An exhibition of children 's art impressed Kanae with its free expressiveness . 
 Towards the end of 1916 Kanae made the long rail trip across Siberia . Along the way he received a telegram from the poet <unk> Kitahara . The two had been negotiating the hand of Kitahara 's sister <unk> and had finally reached an agreement . 
 = = = Return to Japan and later career ( 1916 – 1935 ) = = = 
 Kanae returned to Japan in December 1916 and took over Sakurai 's struggling printing company , which he renamed <unk> . In autumn 1917 he had seventeen yōga oil paintings displayed at the Nihon <unk> 's <unk> exhibition . The same year he married <unk> Kitahara , had an instruction book on oil painting published , and finished a number of prints whose subscriptions had been paid for . 
 Kanae aimed at putting together a creative prints association . In June 1918 Kanae co @-@ founded the Nihon Sōsaku @-@ Hanga Kyōkai ( " Japan Creative Print Cooperative Society " ) with lithographer Kazuma Oda , etcher Takeo <unk> , and woodblock artist Kogan <unk> ; this last had been a member of the Pan no Kai and had also recently returned from several years in Europe . The group held its first exhibition at the art gallery in the Mitsukoshi building in Nihonbashi on 15 – 20 January 1919 . It represented 277 works by 26 artists , including seventeen woodblock prints and two etchings by Kanae . The show drew twenty thousand visitors and was widely reported in the media , including a special sōsaku @-@ hanga issue that March of the prominent art magazine Mizu @-@ e which included an article in which Kanae outlined the principles of the artform and the goals of the Nihon Sōsaku @-@ Hanga Kyōkai . That May the show was repeated at the Mitsukoshi location in Osaka . 
 In 1919 Kanae founded the Japan Children 's Free Drawing Association and held its first exhibition . The public was impressed by its democratic ideals , as the idea of democratic education was gaining momentum in Japan during the Taishō period ( 1912 – 26 ) . Kanae propounded the importance of teaching students freedom , without which they cannot grow , and denigrated the tradition of teaching drawing through copying . He promoted this ideas in 1921 with the book Free Drawing Education and the monthly magazine Education of Arts and Freedom . Kanae 's methods were widely adopted , and it became common for teachers to take students outdoors to draw from nature . These ideas did not escape criticism , and the rise of militarism in Japan put an end to Kanae 's movement in 1928 ; it was not to be revived until after World War II . 
 Later in 1919 Kanae moved to Ueda , the mountainous Nagano village where his parents lived . He secured funding from the Ministry of Education , Ministry of Agriculture , and Mitsubishi to set up a school that December to teach to the rural population arts and crafts skills they could use to augment their incomes during the long winter months as part of a peasant art movement that combined creativity and utility , inspired by the peasant crafts he had seen in Russia . 
 In 1921 , brothers @-@ in @-@ law <unk> Satake and <unk> Sasaki consulted with Kanae to develop a pastel crayon with an oil binder ; development took three years and resulted in the world 's first oil pastel , marketed under the name Cray @-@ Pas through the Sakura Color Products Corporation . 
 The peasant art movement had success in intellectual and government circles . A show at Mitsukoshi of works by sixteen youths was well received . In 1923 Kanae established the Japan Peasant Art Institute which expanded throughout the country with the help of increased government funding in 1925 . Critics of the movement saw it as an anachronism or of stripping rural handicrafts of their original charm through commercialism ; Kanae saw movement as motivated by a desire to keep creative vitality alive , and not by a sense of nostalgia or desire to preserve older ways . 
 The police suspected Kanae of socialist sympathies as he had brought the idea from Russia . The police so harassed him that he asked Un 'ichi Hiratsuka , who was teaching frame @-@ making there , to give up wearing his Russian @-@ style jacket and to cut his long hair . Kanae 's initial enthusiasm dwindled over the next five years — funding shrank , finding other patrons was wearying , the village mayor went bankrupt , and his attempts to find ways for the farmers to make money off their artwork found little success . After five years the venture went bankrupt . 
 Kanae turned his focus from printmaking to painting . He was a founding member in 1922 of the <unk> association for painters who wished to maintain connections with Japanese traditions in the face of the Westernization of academic painting in Japan . He was editor of the association 's members ' magazine <unk> . He continued to promote the work of print artists and the legitimacy of prints as art . In 1928 the magazine devoted an issue to sōsaku hanga , and from the same year <unk> included a prize in the print category in its annual exhibitions . 
 In 1924 Kanae travelled to Taiwan for a month to observe local folk craft and advise the government on how to develop the industry . The utilitarian craftwork of the aboriginal Taiwanese people impressed him beyond his expectations . Taiwanese authorities thought to promote the production of bamboo and rattan craftwork , but Kanae thought they could not compete with similar products from Japan and promoted instead the production of products both traditional and new with a distinctive local flavour using traditional designs for sale as souvenirs and exports . 
 After the 1919 show , Kanae passed the leadership of the Nihon Sōsaku @-@ Hanga Kyōkai to Kōshirō Onchi . In 1931 it became the more comprehensive Nihon Hanga Kyōkai ( " Japan Print Cooperative Society " ) . The same year the <unk> printing company went out of business . 
 = = = Return to painting and final years ( 1935 – 1946 ) = = = 
 In 1935 Kanae settled in Tokyo and returned to painting full @-@ time . He produced a number of oils and watercolours that were exhibited in January 1940 at the Mitsukoshi gallery . The show was well received and attended , and in a dinner that followed Kanae proclaimed , " I shall live until May of my eighty @-@ fifth year . Therefore , I am going to sit back now , and drink sake , and paint to my heart 's content . " 
 While at by Lake Haruna in Gunma Prefecture in 1942 Kanae suffered a cerebral hemorrhage which partially paralyzed him and hindered his ability to paint . He continued to paint as much as he could for the rest of his life , hindered by war shortages , and turned to watercolour when oil painting was too demanding under his disability . In spring 1943 he moved to Ueda in Nagano where he spent his remaining years . He died on 8 October 1946 undergoing surgery for a volvulus at the <unk> hospital in Ueda .

 In his prints , Kanae 's primary tool was a curved @-@ blade chisel ; in ukiyo @-@ e this tool was normally for clean up and a straight chisel for the main carving . His carving followed the Western approach of carving out planes and lines to appear in white , whereas the traditional Japanese technique was to carve around the lines to be printed .

 When an idea excited him he would bury himself in it . Sacrifice meant nothing . It was the same with creative hanga , his school , and his free @-@ art movement . He was a selfless man , a passionate man , a man of great sensitivity . I guess if I had to describe him in one word it would be — artist . 
 Kanae 's European work had an immediate effect on artists of his generation . In them Kōshirō Onchi saw the potential of the woodcut medium , though his style owes more to European artists . Un 'ichi Hiratsuka came to believe " a real artist ... must cut his own blocks and do his own printing " as " Dürer and Bewick worked " . Sōsaku @-@ hanga artists followed Kanae 's lead in using a curved chisel to carve out planes rather than to define lines as in Japanese tradition . 
 The dating of most of Kanae 's work is uncertain . It is believed that the works he signed in Roman characters were made after he returned to Japan from Europe . The number of copies of Kanae 's prints is unknown ; it is supposed the subscription prints he made in Europe numbered around 25 to 50 . Kanae made few printings of the Fisherman print — perhaps only one or two — and none have survived . The <unk> discovered the block in their house decades later , and Oliver Statler had Hashimoto <unk> make forty copies of a commemorative edition in 1960 . 
 Modern Japanese thought on art education begins with Kanae 's Free Drawing Education approach . His stature in the history of child art and art education is similar to that of Franz <unk> 's in the West . Elementary schools teachers took to his ideas quickly in the wake of their dissatisfaction with the New Textbooks of Drawing textbooks the government had mandated in 1910 that emphasized copying and neglected personal expression . Yamamoto 's was the first public criticism of the textbooks , and his methods led to a sharp decline in their use in the 1920s . Yamamoto encouraged teachers to take children outdoors to sketch , a practice that continues to be common in Japanese elementary schools . Though Japanese militarism put his ideas on hold from the late 1920s educators revived and expanded them beginning in the 1950s . 
 The municipal Kanae Yamamoto Memorial Museum in Ueda in Nagano Prefecture dates from 1962 . It houses 1 @,@ 800 items , including artwork and documents by Kanae and early examples of peasant crafts and children 's artwork done under his instruction . 
 = Tropical Storm Bertha ( 2002 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Bertha was a minimal tropical storm that made landfall twice along the Gulf Coast of the United States in August 2002 . The second tropical storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season , Bertha developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico out of a trough of low pressure that extended into the Atlantic on August 4 . It quickly organized and reached tropical storm strength before making landfall on southeastern Louisiana . Bertha turned to the southwest over the state , and re @-@ entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 7 . It remained disorganized due to proximity to land , and after making landfall on south Texas , Bertha dissipated on August 9 . 
 Bertha was one of only three tropical cyclones to make landfall on both Louisiana and Texas ; the others being Allison in 2001 and Fern in 1971 . Heavy surf killed one person in Florida . The storm dropped moderate amounts of rainfall along its path , peaking at over 10 inches ( 250 mm ) in eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi . Damage was light , totaling to only $ 200 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD , $ 240 @,@ 000 2008 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A non @-@ tropical trough at the surface extended from the northern Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean . On August 3 , the western portion developed into a low pressure area . The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Cristobal . The low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized , and late on August 4 the circulation was organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40 miles ( 65 km ) east of Port Eads , Louisiana . <unk> wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern , though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed . 
 Outflow became much better organized as Bertha became a tropical storm , and well @-@ defined banding features persisted to the north of the storm . Though convection waned , forecasters predicted the friction between land and the warm atmosphere to redevelop more deep convection , potentially resulting in further strengthening . However , the storm failed to intensify , and Bertha made landfall near Boothville , Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm early on August 5 . It slowly weakened over the swampy portions of southeastern Louisiana , and degenerated to a tropical depression later on the 5th after crossing Lake Ponchartrain . Initially it was expected that a ridge of high pressure to its north would keep Bertha moving to the west and result in it slowly dissipating . However , it turned to the southwest , and reached the Gulf of Mexico again on August 7 . The circulation persisted over land , and Tropical Depression Bertha quickly redeveloped convection . Though the environment was not unfavorable , its proximity to land prevented re @-@ strengthening to tropical storm status . Though the system showed periods of increased organization as it moved southwestward , Bertha remained a weak tropical depression until making landfall on south Texas to the east of Kingsville on August 9 . Bertha weakened quickly over land , and dissipated over southern Texas ten hours after making landfall . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Pascagoula , Mississippi to the mouth of the Mississippi River as Bertha became a tropical storm . The warning occurred 90 minutes before the storm made landfall . All warnings were discontinued when Bertha weakened to a tropical depression over Louisiana . No watches or warnings were required for Texas , due to the improbability of it re @-@ intensifying . 
 The National Weather Service advised boats along the Gulf coast to remain at port . The service also issued a coastal flood watch from Alabama through the Florida Panhandle . A flood watch was issued for portions of eastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The area of low pressure preceding the development of Bertha produced rough surf and rip currents along the Florida coastline . In Perdido Key State Recreation Area , two children were swimming in an unguarded area when they swept away by the currents . Their grandfather attempted to rescue them , but drowned in the rough waters . Another family rescued the two children . The large circulation of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida , with Pensacola and Destin reporting 2 @.@ 75 inches . Extreme southern portions of Alabama received over 3 inches ( 75 mm ) of rain from the storm , while western Dauphin Island reported over 5 inches ( 125 mm ) . 
 Upon making landfall , Waveland , Mississippi recorded a peak storm surge of 4 @.@ 12 feet ( 1 @.@ 26 m ) . Sustained winds there peaked at 31 mph ( 50 km / h ) , and a peak gust of 41 mph ( 66 km / h ) . Tropical Storm Bertha produced moderate to heavy precipitation across southern Mississippi , including a total of 10 @.@ 25 inches ( 260 @.@ 35 mm ) in Pascagoula . In Moss Point , the rainfall resulted in flooding which entered 15 to 20 houses and several cars . The rainfall also flooded roadways and streets . Damage in Mississippi totaled to $ 50 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD , $ 60 @,@ 000 2008 USD ) . 
 The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Louisiana , which peaked at 10 @.@ 25 inches in Norwood . Storm tides were generally 1 to 2 feet ( .3 to .6 m ) above normal , while the mouth of the Bayou Dupre recorded a storm tide of 3 @.@ 79 feet ( 1 @.@ 16 m ) . The rainfall led to flash flooding in places , and also a few overflowed rivers in St. Tammany Parish . The flooding covered several roadways and bridges , and entered a few businesses and houses in East Feliciana Parish . Damage in Louisiana totaled to $ 150 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD , $ 180 @,@ 000 2008 USD ) . 
 In Texas , Bertha produced a storm tide of 3 feet ( .9 m ) at Baffin Bay . Only light rainfall occurred in the state , with a few isolated areas receiving over 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of precipitation . 
 = SMS Kaiser Barbarossa = 
 SMS Kaiser Barbarossa ( His Majesty 's Ship Emperor Barbarossa ) was a German pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Kaiser Friedrich III class . The ship was built for the Imperial Navy , which had begun a program of expansion at the direction of Kaiser Wilhelm II . She was constructed at Schichau , in Danzig . Kaiser Barbarossa was laid down in August 1898 , launched on 24 April 1900 , and commissioned in June 1901 , at the cost of 20 @,@ 301 @,@ 000 Marks . The ship was armed with a main battery of four 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in two twin gun turrets . 
 Kaiser Barbarossa served with the German navy from her commissioning in 1901 , though her active career was limited by two lengthy stays in dry @-@ dock . The first was for repairs following damage to her rudder in 1903 , which lasted until early 1905 , and the second for a major modernization , which began immediately after the conclusion of repair work in 1905 and lasted until late 1907 . She returned to service for another two years , before being decommissioned in 1909 and placed in the reserve division . She continued to participate in fleet training exercises for the next three years . 
 Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters were mobilized as coastal defense ships in the V Battle Squadron and assigned to the North and Baltic Seas . She saw no combat during the war , and due to a shortage of crews , the ships were withdrawn from active duty in February 1915 and relegated to secondary duties . Kaiser Barbarossa was briefly used as a torpedo target ship for most of 1915 and thereafter spent the remainder of the war as a prison ship in Wilhelmshaven . Following the end of the war in 1918 , Kaiser Barbarossa was decommissioned and sold for scrap metal . The ship was broken up in 1919 – 20 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Kaiser Barbarossa was 125 @.@ 3 m ( 411 ft 1 in ) long overall and had a beam of 20 @.@ 4 m ( 66 ft 11 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 89 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 25 m ( 27 ft 1 in ) aft . She displaced up to 11 @,@ 785 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 599 long tons ) at full load . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one screw propeller . Steam was provided by four Thornycroft boilers and eight cylindrical boilers , all of which burned coal . Kaiser Barbarossa 's powerplant was rated at 13 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 12 @,@ 820 ihp ; 9 @,@ 560 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . The ship had a cruising radius of 3 @,@ 420 nmi ( 6 @,@ 330 km ; 3 @,@ 940 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a normal crew of 39 officers and 612 enlisted men . 
 The ship 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure .

 = = Service history = = 
 Kaiser Wilhelm II , the Emperor of Germany , believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe . As a result , he initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s ; the first battleships built under this program were the four Brandenburg @-@ class ships . These were immediately followed by the five Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships , of which Kaiser Barbarossa was a member . Kaiser Barbarossa 's keel was laid down on 3 August 1898 , at the Schichau @-@ Werke in Danzig , under construction number 640 . She was ordered under the contract name " A " as an addition to the fleet . Kaiser Barbarossa was launched on 21 April 1900 . The then @-@ Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) Alfred von Tirpitz , the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt ( RMA — Imperial Navy Office ) , gave the launching speech , and the new battleship was christened by Princess Luise Sofie of Prussia , Wilhelm II 's sister @-@ in @-@ law . Sea trials began on 4 May 1901 , during which two tests were recorded : a 50 @-@ hour endurance test and a 6 @-@ hour speed test . The former produced a sustained speed of 15 @.@ 5 knots ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) , while the latter saw a maximum speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) , and on 10 June she was commissioned into the fleet in Kiel . The final cost of the vessel was 20 @,@ 301 @,@ 000 marks . 
 Following her commissioning , Kaiser Barbarossa was assigned to the I Squadron of the Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) , which shortly thereafter went on a cruise to Spain . While moored in Cadiz , the ships met the four Brandenburg @-@ class ships , which were returning from their expedition to suppress the Boxer Rebellion in China . From 22 August to 21 September , Kaiser Barbarossa participated in the annual autumn maneuvers of the entire fleet . While in the Danzig Bay , the fleet conducted a naval review for the visiting Tsar Nicholas II of Russia . The winter cruise in December went to southern Norway . In April and May 1902 , the squadron went on a training cruise to Britain , followed by a tour of the Kiel Week sailing regatta in late June . The ships then took part in another training cruise to Norway in July and then the autumn maneuvers , which began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade . During the exercise , which lasted from 17 August to 18 September , Kaiser Barbarossa and the rest of I Squadron were assigned to play the roles of both the German fleet and hostile forces . The usual winter cruise went to Bergen , Norway , that year . 
 In 1903 , the fleet , which was composed of only one squadron of modern battleships , was reorganized as the " Active Battle Fleet . " Kaiser Barbarossa remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest Wittelsbach @-@ class battleships , while the older Brandenburg @-@ class ships were placed in reserve in order to be rebuilt . The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises . The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic , followed by a voyage to Spain that lasted from 7 May to 10 June . The ship suffered some damage to her rudder , which necessitated temporary repairs at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Kiel from the end of July to 21 August . She thereafter took part in the autumn maneuvers and the winter cruise in the eastern Baltic and the Skagerrak . The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea , a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September , and finally a mock attack on Kiel . The exercises concluded on 12 September . The winter training cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak in early December . On 15 December , Kaiser Barbarossa was decommissioned for permanent repairs to her rudder , which lasted until January 1905 . She did not return to service , however , and instead began a major reconstruction . 
 During the modernization , four of her 15 cm guns were removed and two 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were added . All twelve 1 @-@ pounder guns were removed , as was the ship 's stern @-@ mounted torpedo tube . Kaiser Barbarossa 's superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship 's tendency to roll excessively and her military masts were replaced with lighter pole masts . The ship 's funnels were also lengthened . Kaiser Barbarossa 's modernization was completed by 1 October 1907 , when she was recommissioned for service . By that time , the newest Deutschland @-@ class battleships were coming into service ; along with the Braunschweig @-@ class battleships , these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons . Consequently , the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . Kaiser Barbarossa returned to her place in the I Squadron and she participated in the normal routine of divisional , squadron , and fleet maneuvers and cruises without incident over the next year . The summer fleet cruise in May that year went to the Azores and returned to Kiel on 13 August . The autumn maneuvers lasted from 27 August to 7 September . Divisional exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September . 
 On 17 September 1909 , Kaiser Barbarossa was decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic Sea . By that time , the new dreadnought battleships , which rendered Kaiser Barbarossa and her sister ships thoroughly obsolete , were beginning to come into service with the fleet . In early 1910 , Kaiser Barbarossa was assigned to the Training Squadron , which operated in the Baltic in April . She was reactivated to participate in the autumn maneuvers that year in the provisional III Squadron ; after the conclusion of the exercises on 10 September , she was placed back in reserve . More modernization work was done at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel . From 31 July to 15 September , she was reactivated again to take part in the autumn maneuvers in the III Squadron . She thereafter returned to the Reserve Division in early 1912 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 As a result of the outbreak of World War I , Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914 . The ships were prepared for war very slowly , and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August . They were initially tasked with coastal defense , though they served in this capacity for a very short time . In mid @-@ September , the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic , under the command of Prince Heinrich . He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau , but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan . Instead , the V Squadron was to carry the landing force , but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September . Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day , disembarked the landing force , and then proceeded to the North Sea , where they resumed guard ship duties . Before the end of the year , the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic . 
 After returning to the Baltic , Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland . On 26 December 1914 , the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie . Two days later , the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag , and was back in Kiel by 30 December . The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties , but was withdrawn from frontline service in February 1915 . Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet , coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime , necessitated the deactivation of Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters . Her crew was reduced on 5 March , only to be replaced on 11 April so the ship could be used as a torpedo target ship ; this service lasted until 9 November . Ten days later , she was decommissioned for the last time , and in 1916 she was disarmed . Kaiser Barbarossa was thereafter employed as a floating prison for prisoners of war in Wilhelmshaven . In November 1918 , Germany sought an end to the war and signed the First Armistice at Compiègne , which temporarily ended hostilities so a peace treaty could be negotiated . Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , which formally ended the war and was signed on 28 June 1919 , Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the " Deutschland or Lothringen types . " Accordingly , the ship was struck from the naval list on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship @-@ breakers . Kaiser Barbarossa was broken up for scrap metal in Rüstringen in 1919 and 1920 . 
 = Robert Howe ( Continental Army officer ) = 
 Robert Howe ( 1732 – December 14 , 1786 ) was a Continental Army general from North Carolina during the American Revolutionary War . The descendant of a prominent family in North Carolina , Howe was one of five generals , and the only major general , in the Continental Army from that state . He also played a role in the colonial and state governments of North Carolina , serving in the legislative bodies of both . 
 Howe served in the colonial militia during the French and Indian War and commanded Fort Johnston at the mouth of the Cape Fear River . He also served as a colonel of Royal Governor William Tryon 's artillery during the War of the Regulation . Howe suffered greatly when Tryon , a personal friend , became Governor of New York , and he staunchly opposed Tryon 's successor . He became active in organizing efforts within North Carolina and among the American colonies between 1773 and 1775 and was an active member of the North Carolina Provincial Congress . At the outset of the Revolutionary War , Howe was promoted to brigadier general and was heavily involved in actions in the Southern Department , commanding the Continental Army and Patriot militia forces in defeat in the First Battle of Savannah . 
 Howe 's career as a military commander was contentious and consumed primarily by conflict with political and military leaders in Georgia and South Carolina . In 1778 , he fought a duel with Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina which was spurred in part by Howe 's conflict with South Carolina 's state government . Political and personal confrontations , combined with Howe 's reputation as a womanizer among those who disfavored him , eventually led to the Continental Congress stripping him of his command over the Southern Department . He was then sent to New York , where he served under General George Washington in the Hudson Highlands , although Howe did not have a successful or significant career in that theater . He sat as a senior officer on the court @-@ martial board that sentenced to death John André , a British officer accused of assisting Benedict Arnold in the latter 's plot to change allegiance and deliver West Point to the British . Howe himself was accused of attempting to defect to the British , but the accusations were cast aside at the time as having been based in a British attempt to cause further discord in the Continental Army . Howe also played a role in putting down several late @-@ war mutinies by members of the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Lines in New Jersey and Philadelphia and returned home to North Carolina in 1783 . He again became active in state politics , but died in December 1786 while en route to a session of the North Carolina House of Commons . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Howe was born in 1732 to Job Howe ( also spelled " Howes " ) , the grandson of colonial Governor James Moore , who presided over the southern portion of the Province of Carolina . Job was also a descendant of Governor John Yeamans . Howe 's mother may have been Job 's first wife Martha , who was the daughter of colonial North Carolina jurist Frederick Jones . Job Howe 's ancestors had been planters and political figures in South Carolina during the late 17th and early 18th centuries . Prior to Howe 's birth , his family left Charleston to settle on the banks of the Cape Fear River in the Province of North Carolina . Howe 's father was a member of the extended Moore family , formerly of South Carolina , who settled the lower Cape Fear River and collectively owned more than 80 @,@ 000 acres ( 32 @,@ 000 ha ; 120 sq mi ) of farmland on it by the 1730s . Job Howe died in 1748 , leaving his estate and the wealth of his parents to Robert . Robert had two brothers and two sisters , all of whom were mentioned in Job 's will . 
 As a young boy , Howe may have been sent to England to obtain an education , although several sources doubt that Howe made the journey . At some point between 1751 and 1754 , after completing his education , Howe married Sarah Grange , who was heiress to a large fortune . Howe had numerous affairs , fathering an unknown number of children in and out of wedlock , including a son , Robert ; two daughters , Mary and Ann ; and up to four additional daughters whose mothers ' names are not recorded . Howe was widely considered a womanizer by contemporaries ; by 1772 he became estranged from Grange , and the two separated . In the year of their formal separation , Howe recorded a deed for the support of his wife . 
 Loyalist sympathizer and diarist Janet Schaw described Howe prior to the revolution : 
 ... very like a Gentleman , much more so indeed than any thing I have seen in the Country . He is deemed a horrid animal , a sort of a woman @-@ eater that devours every thing that comes in his way , and that no woman can withstand him . But be not in pain for your friend , I do assure you they <unk> his merits , and as I am certain it would be in the power of mortal women to withstand him , so am I convinced he is not so voracious as he is represented . 
 Howe inherited a large amount of assets from his grandmother and , upon the death of his father , became the owner of " Howe 's Point " , a rice plantation near what was formerly known as Barren Inlet ( now called Mason Inlet ) . The site of the former plantation is located on the mainland directly across from Figure Eight Island . Howe also owned a plantation called " Mount Misery " in what was Bladen County . His grandmother had provided Howe with slaves and money with which Howe was intended to build his fortune . 
 = = Colonial political and military service = = 
 Around 1755 , Howe captained a militia company in Bladen County , and was appointed a justice of the peace for that county in 1756 . Howe was elected to the colonial Assembly from Bladen County in 1760 and served until 1762 . In 1764 , the Assembly created Brunswick County , and Howe was both appointed its justice of the peace and re @-@ elected to the Assembly from the new county . Howe would be re @-@ elected six more times from Brunswick County . In 1765 , Howe worked with other colonial leaders such as Hugh Waddell , Abner Nash , and Cornelius Harnett to found the Wilmington Sons of Liberty organization , which was active in protesting the Stamp Act 1765 that taxed most printed materials . At the time , the members of the Sons of Liberty did not consider their resistance to be rebellion , as it was based on the idea that government officials who performed acts in opposition to the will of the people were not acting with full authority . After the resolution of the Stamp Act Crisis , Howe was made an officer of the provincial exchequer . Despite the Cape Fear River area being the epicenter of Stamp Act protests in North Carolina , Howe took no substantial part in the active confrontations with Governor William Tryon , due in large part to their personal friendship and the patronage provided by the Governor for Howe 's political ambitions . 
 During the French and Indian War , Howe served alongside provincial soldiers from Virginia . In 1766 , he was commissioned as a captain of militia and was given command of Fort Johnston , located at the entrance of the Cape Fear River in present @-@ day Southport , North Carolina . Howe served in this capacity between 1766 and 1767 , and again between 1769 and 1773 . Although satisfied with this position , Howe ultimately desired to obtain a commission in the regular British Army , which was traditionally a prerequisite for the commander of Fort Johnston . Howe was never granted this commission , despite Tryon 's support . In the 1768 session of the colonial assembly , Howe played a prominent role by introducing a bill to remedy a currency shortage in the colony . His bill would have led to the acceptance of commodities as legal tender in the province , but it was not passed . The Regulator movement was in part based on the grievances farmers in the North Carolina backcountry had about back taxes and pressure from private creditors , both of which Howe 's 1768 bill had attempted to address . 
 Despite his efforts to reform the province 's policies , Howe was made a colonel of artillery by Governor Tryon and served under the Governor against armed protesters in the piedmont during the War of the Regulation . Howe was among the Governor 's entourage when he confronted the Regulators in Hillsborough in 1768 , and in 1771 , at the Battle of Alamance , Howe served in a dual role as a commander of artillery and quartermaster general . In early 1773 , when Josiah Quincy II visited North Carolina to foster cooperation between Southern activists and those in Boston , he investigated the causes of the War of the Regulation to which he had been sympathetic . Howe served as Quincy 's guide and with the assistance of Cornelius Harnett and William Hooper convinced Quincy that the Regulator movement had been unjustified and wrong to take up arms against Tryon . Quincy found Howe to be a " most happy compound of the man of sense , the sword , the Senate , and the buck ... a favorite of the man of sense and the female world " , continuing to say that " [ Howe ] has faults and vice – but alas who is without them . " More importantly , however , Quincy 's visit with Howe , Hooper , and Harnett engendered a desire among those present to open up inter @-@ colonial lines of communication in order to coordinate responses to future impositions by the British government . 
 Howe 's private fortunes were never stable , and between 1766 and 1775 , he was forced to mortgage land and sell slaves to generate funds . In 1770 , Howe was able to purchase Kendal Plantation on the Cape Fear River , a 400 @-@ acre ( 160 ha ; 0 @.@ 63 sq mi ) rice plantation , but in 1775 , he mortgaged it for around ₤ 214 . While the causes of Howe 's financial misfortunes are unknown , several contemporary critics held that the cause was Howe 's need to keep up appearances among the ruling elite , while Josiah Martin , Tryon 's successor as Royal Governor , believed Howe 's misfortunes were evidence of his potential for malfeasance with the public money . In particular , Martin believed that Howe was intentionally under @-@ staffing Fort Johnston in order to pocket excess funds the colonial assembly had appropriated for the garrison there , which was a common form of embezzlement among previous commanders and other royal officials . Howe , as a legislator and public official , had a poor working relationship with Martin , and Martin deprived him of his appointed offices – the captaincy of Fort Johnston and his position with the provincial exchequer – shortly after the new governor 's arrival . A legislative confrontation in 1770 over the Provincial Assembly 's attempts to pass a law authorizing attachment of real property in North Carolina owned by persons living in England placed Howe in direct confrontation with Martin , who preferred a requirement that colonial subjects seek relief from courts in England rather than in North Carolina . Martin believed that Howe 's virulent opposition to the new governor 's policies was driven by Howe 's anger at being deprived of his valuable appointed positions . 
 = = Revolutionary political and militia service = = 
 In December 1773 , the North Carolina colonial assembly created a committee of correspondence , to which Howe , as well as Richard Caswell , John Harvey , John Ashe , Joseph Hewes , and Samuel Johnston were appointed . That committee was tasked with corresponding with other colonies to coordinate plans of resistance to British attempts to tax or otherwise burden the colonists . Beginning in 1774 , Howe was a member of the Wilmington and Brunswick County Committees of Safety , and in August of that year , served as a member of a committee that organized the collection of corn , flour , and pork to be sent to Boston . At the time , the Port of Boston had been closed by one of the Intolerable Acts , specifically the Boston Port Act , which was in reaction to the Boston Tea Party and other protests against the Tea Act . 
 When the First Provincial Congress convened on August 25 , 1774 , Howe served as a member of that body representing Brunswick County . The First Provincial Congress quickly passed a bill banning the exportation of all pitch , tobacco , tar , and other trade goods to England and banned the importation of British tea into North Carolina . Also in 1774 , Howe penned several documents expressing what would become known as Patriot or " <unk> " sympathies , including an address demanding reforms from Royal Governor Josiah Martin . On April 7 , 1775 , Howe delivered an address to the colonial assembly formally rebuffing Governor Martin 's demands that the extra @-@ legal Second Provincial Congress be dissolved . Howe 's response as adopted by the assembly led to Martin proroguing the colonial legislative body . In 1775 , when Howe received news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord , the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War , he began to drill the local militia , using the unusual combination of drums and fiddles as opposed to the standard fifes and drums . 
 On July 15 , 1775 , Howe led 500 militiamen from Brunswick Town on a raid on the governor 's mansion with the intent of kidnapping Governor Martin . The plot failed when Martin made an early @-@ morning escape from Fort Johnston , fleeing to HMS Cruizer on July 19 . Howe ordered the militia to put the fort 's structures to the torch , starting with the home of its commanding officer and Howe 's successor , Captain John Collet , who had previously been accused of corruption by the Committee of Safety . After fleeing , Martin made a proclamation on August 8 , 1775 , that attributed the growing unrest in North Carolina to what he termed " ' the basest and most scandalous Seditious and inflammatory falsehoods ' " propagated by the Committee of Safety in Wilmington . 
 Howe once again represented Brunswick County in the Third Provincial Congress in Hillsborough beginning on August 20 , 1775 , and was appointed to the committee charged with developing a test oath for members of the legislative body . The oath declared allegiance to the King of England but denied the power of Parliament to tax to American colonies . During the Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress in 1776 , Howe was noted to have proclaimed that " ' Independence seems to be the word . I know not one of the dissenting voice . ' "

 On September 1 , 1775 , the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress appointed Howe to lead the newly created Second North Carolina Regiment of the Continental Army as its colonel . Initially , Howe headquartered his command in New Bern during the fall of 1775 and was charged by the Provincial Congress with protecting the northern half of North Carolina up to the border with Virginia . At the time , British forces under the command of John Murray , 4th Earl of Dunmore , the last Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia , were ravaging the tidewater region of Virginia . Howe , of his own initiative , brought his North Carolina troops into Virginia , arriving shortly after the Battle of Great Bridge . Howe then directed the occupation of Norfolk , Virginia , which had recently been abandoned by Loyalist forces , and assumed command of the various North Carolina and Virginia units there . The region around Norfolk was being occupied by Loyalist militia units under Dunmore 's command . 
 Howe , as senior officer chosen over the more junior William Woodford of Virginia , engaged in contentious negotiations over access to supplies with the captains of British ships anchored off Norfolk , which were by that time overcrowded with Loyalist refugees . The situation deteriorated , and Norfolk was burned on January 1 , 1776 , in an action started by British marines and a bombardment by Royal Navy vessels and completed by Patriot forces . The fire raged on for two more days , and Howe ordered most of the buildings that remained standing to be razed before he withdrew , to further render the location useless to the British . During Howe 's time in command at Norfolk , Woodford described the North Carolinian as a " brave , prudent & spirited commander " . On December 22 , 1775 , Howe was formally thanked by the Virginia Convention , and on April 27 , 1776 , he received the same honor from the Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress . 
 = = = Charleston , 1776 – 1777 = = = 
 In March 1776 , Howe was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General by the Second Continental Congress along with fellow North Carolinian James Moore . Howe and Moore were two of five North Carolinians to be given a general 's commission in the Continental Army . Initially , Howe was given command of all Continental forces in Virginia , but soon both he and Moore were ordered to South Carolina . Howe arrived first as the presence of the British Army and Royal Navy under the command of General Henry Clinton at the mouth of the Cape Fear River delayed Moore 's descent . When Clinton arrived off the coast of North Carolina , he issued a proclamation offering a pardon to anyone who had taken up arms against the crown with the explicit exception of Howe and fellow revolutionary Cornelius Harnett , then serving as president of the North Carolina Provincial Council , the executive body in the revolutionary state . Howe 's plantation , Kendal , was sacked by the British during their maneuvers around Wilmington . 
 Upon arriving in Charleston , Howe acted as an adjutant to Major General Charles Lee , who had been appointed Commander of the Southern Department of the Continental Army . Howe directly commanded the South Carolina militia during the First Siege of Charleston in June 1776 and was assigned command over the defenses of the city proper . Lee was recalled to the North to assist General George Washington , and in his absence , James Moore was appointed Commander of the Southern Department . Howe was left in command of Charleston and Savannah , Georgia in Lee 's absence , and in September 1776 , he became embroiled in a controversy involving the provincial assembly of South Carolina allowing its officers to recruit soldiers from North Carolina 's continental line units . Howe pleaded with the Provincial Congress of North Carolina to allow South Carolina to recruit within the former state 's borders because of the greater number of white males in that state . Eventually , North Carolina acceded to that request but only after ordering Howe to reclaim the North Carolinians who had already been lured away by the South Carolinians . The South Carolina Council took offense and demanded that Howe pay the recruitment bonuses for the men if he wished to have them back . With James Moore 's death on April 15 , 1777 , Howe assumed command of the Southern Department . 
 = = = Florida and political conflict 1777 – 1778 = = = 
 Howe 's style of command was quick to cause discontent , and on August 20 , 1777 , the South Carolina Assembly protested against Howe 's right to command soldiers within the borders of South Carolina . He was nonetheless promoted to the rank of major general on October 20 , 1777 , the only North Carolinian to reach that rank in the Continental Army . Howe often deferred to the civil leadership of the various states that made up his command , often referring conflicts with state officials to the Continental Congress to resolve . Of particular note was an early conflict with Georgia 's state government , which insisted that the governor of that state retain command of the state 's militia during military engagements . When asked for an official opinion , Congress sided with Howe , who believed that command of the militia should be relinquished to him during such engagements . Complicating matters , however , was the fact that Congressional funding for military expenditures was given over to the states rather than the army officers , forcing Howe to rely on state governments for funding . 
 In 1778 , he was ordered to act on a plan developed by General Charles Lee to assault British West Florida – a plan that Howe disfavored . A previous expedition in 1777 , in which Howe did not directly participate , had ended quickly in failure . Congress overrode Howe 's concerns about the expedition and directed him to proceed in conjunction with Georgia 's militia into Florida . The combined Army 's progress into Florida was made slow by a lack of provisions and particularly by a lack of slaves who Howe requested be made available to build roads and perform pioneering functions for the march southward . 
 On June 29 , 1778 , Howe captured Fort <unk> on the St. Marys River , which forms a portion of the border between Georgia and Florida . Georgia Governor John Houstoun refused to give up command of his militia to the Continental Army general and declined to participate in Howe 's council . To make matters worse , when South Carolina militia units arrived in Georgia under the command of Colonel Andrew Williamson , their commander also refused to allow Howe to command that state 's militia units . Shortly after this minor incursion , the British received reinforcements and pressed toward Savannah . By July 14 , 1778 , Howe was forced to pull his units back north and returned to Charleston . The general received much of the blame for the expedition 's failure , as Georgia officials were quick to cast aspersions on the Continental command , which was compounded by Congress ' failure to understand Howe 's inability to control the Georgia militia despite their prior determination of his command authority over militia units . 
 = = = Duel with Christopher Gadsden , 1778 = = = 
 Howe 's squabbles with local political and militia leaders were not his sole difficulties . On August 30 , 1778 , Howe engaged in a pistol duel with Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina over an offense Gadsden perceived stemming from his resignation in 1777 while under Howe 's command . This controversy , like many in which Howe was involved , centered on the conflict between the Continental Army and state governments ' desires to retain local control over their officers and soldiers . Gadsden responded to the perceived offense by drafting and circulating a letter attacking Howe 's intelligence and ability as a commander and questioning Howe 's legal authority to issue orders to South Carolina Continentals . Howe took offense and demanded satisfaction from Gadsden on August 17 , 1778 . 
 During the duel , Colonel Charles Pinckney , father of South Carolina Governor Charles Pinckney , served as Howe 's second , while Colonel Barnard Elliot served as second to Gadsden . Howe , shooting first , missed his shot at eight paces , although the ball grazed Gadsden 's ear . Gadsden then intentionally fired above his own left shoulder and demanded Howe fire again , a demand Howe refused . At the conclusion of the duel , the participants made amends and parted ways . The affair did not end privately , as the South Carolinian and American Gazette published a full story covering the duel on September 3 , 1778 , and in the same month , the ill @-@ fated Major John André , the British officer who would later serve as a facilitator for Benedict Arnold 's change of allegiance , published an 18 @-@ stanza satirical poem about the duel set to the tune of Yankee Doodle . 
 = = = Removal from command and the Battle of Savannah , 1778 = = = 
 After allegations circulated in South Carolina about Howe 's dalliances with a woman , the Continental Congress finally removed him from command of the Southern Department on September 25 , 1778 , replacing him with Major General Benjamin Lincoln . Howe remained with the Southern army and commanded it from Savannah . While awaiting Lincoln 's arrival in Savannah with reinforcements , Howe set up defenses around that city , preparing for an imminent attack . Governor Houstoun sparred again with Howe , refusing to grant him more than meager militia support . 
 During the First Battle of Savannah on December 29 , 1778 , the British landed near the city , and under the command of Archibald Campbell , managed to flank Howe 's army , which was drawn up in the open for battle , by taking a path through a marshy area Howe believed was impassable . Howe had previously ordered a scout to look for any paths through the swamp , but Campbell 's route , which was shown to the British commander by a slave , remained unknown to the Patriots . Howe 's position was otherwise strong and defensible , but the appearance of the British in the Patriot rear caused a panic . The militia under Howe 's command fled instantly , and more than 500 Patriots and Continental Army soldiers were killed or captured . The ensuing defeat gave Savannah to the British , for which Howe received much blame . On January 3 , 1779 , Howe formally relinquished his command to Lincoln . 
 Howe 's failure at Savannah led to criticism from Georgia state officials , who believed he had abandoned the state to the British , as well as from fellow Continental Army generals , such as William Moultrie , who criticized Howe for even attempting to resist the British while being so greatly outnumbered . During his testimony before a later court – martial , Howe claimed that he knew about the pathway through the swamp taken by the British , but stated that he did not defend it because he believed the chance of an attack along the path was " so remote " . This contradicted earlier testimony from Georgia militia officer George Walton , who stated that Howe did not know about the path prior to the battle and that Howe told Walton that he was mistaken in believing a path through the swamps existed . 
 = = = Hudson Valley and Connecticut , 1779 = = = 
 After Lincoln 's arrival , Howe was ordered to join the Continental Army in the North , which he rejoined on May 19 , 1779 . Suffering from injuries caused by a fall , Howe was unable to undertake any duties for a month after his arrival . Initially , Howe was charged with defending Connecticut from British raids , such as those conducted by his former mentor , William Tryon , and Tryon 's adjutant , Edmund Fanning . Howe 's headquarters were in Ridgefield , Connecticut . 
 On June 18 , 1779 , shortly after the Battle of Stony Point , Howe was ordered to assist General Israel Putnam in assaulting a British fortification at Verplanck 's Point , which sat across the Hudson River from Stony Point . Howe was charged with commanding the artillery barrage and infantry assault of that position , but was given too few field pieces , entrenching tools , provisions , and little ammunition to make a serious attempt at taking the fortification . He advised Washington that an assault would be unfeasible and called off the siege with Washington 's consent . Historians have noted that Howe 's inability to take the British fortifications damaged his career and that he was never again given a major command . Contemporaries such as General William Irvine criticized Howe as " having a talent ... of finding many supposed obstructions , and barely plausible pretences for his delay " in assaulting Verplanck 's Point . 
 After Stony Point , Howe was assigned first to the command of the left wing of Washington 's army composed of Massachusetts brigades under Generals John Nixon and John Glover , with his command again in Ridgefield , Connecticut . While military action was infrequent in Howe 's region of control , he was integral in the recruitment and cultivation of a substantial spy network which provided the Patriots with information about British positions on Manhattan and along the Long Island Sound . 
 = = = West Point and Benedict Arnold conspiracy , 1779 – 1780 = = = 
 As part of his command duties , Howe was chosen by Washington as president of the court – martial convened to determine the propriety of General Benedict Arnold 's conduct while serving as the commandant of Philadelphia in 1778 and 1779 . During that time , Arnold was alleged to have conducted business with British merchants and to have undertaken private business transactions that were inappropriate given his position , among other improprieties . The tribunal , which met at Howe 's headquarters in Middletown , Connecticut , adjourned for several months due to a threatened British attack but reconvened in December 1779 and closed in January 1780 . During the interlude in the fall of 1779 , Howe was ordered by Washington to move into position to attack the British in conjunction with an expected combined French naval and land @-@ based assault , although the French assault in New York never materialized . The court @-@ martial rendered its decision on January 26 , 1780 , finding Arnold guilty of breaching the articles of war by permitting a vessel from an enemy port into Philadelphia and recommended that he be reprimanded by Washington . 
 Howe was made commandant of the Continental Army fortifications at West Point on February 21 , 1780 . He held that command immediately prior to Benedict Arnold 's conspiracy to turn over control of that stronghold to the British . Arnold and several supporters in Congress had eventually convinced Washington to give him command of the fortifications on August 3 , 1780 . Howe remained active in the upper Hudson River valley during the remainder of the war , particularly in overseeing his network of spies in the area , including double agent Joshua Hett Smith , who would later play a key role in Arnold 's treason and prosecution . During this time , evidence arose implicating Howe in discussions with the British , though the evidence was dismissed by Washington as merely rumors stirred up by British General Henry Clinton . Howe served on the court @-@ martial board that convicted of espionage and sentenced to death Major John André , the British officer tasked with facilitating Arnold 's conspiracy . 
 = = = Pennsylvania mutinies and war 's end , 1781 – 1783 = = = 
 In 1781 , Howe assisted in putting down the Pompton Mutiny in New Jersey , which was inspired by the slightly earlier Pennsylvania Line Mutiny . Washington ordered Howe to surround the camp and arrange for the court @-@ martial and execution of two of its ringleaders . In the fall of 1781 , Howe requested permission to go with Washington to Virginia for what was anticipated to be the final campaign against the British , but Washington refused . Instead , Howe was required to appear before a court – martial in Philadelphia which was opened to inquire into Howe 's actions in the defense of Savannah in 1778 . The tribunal , led by Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben , opened on December 7 , 1781 , and closed on January 23 , 1782 , acquitting Howe of any wrongdoing at Savannah with " the Highest Honor " . Assistant Adjutant General John Carlisle ordered Howe to convene a court – martial to investigate the conduct of General Alexander McDougall in the spring of 1782 . McDougall was a personal friend of Howe 's , but the tribunal convicted him of the minor offense of releasing confidential details from a council of war meeting in 1776 to persons who were not permitted to have such information . Again in 1783 , Howe was called on to put down the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 , which had caused the Continental Congress to flee Philadelphia . 
 = = Post @-@ war career and death = = 
 After putting down the second Pennsylvania mutiny in 1783 , Howe participated in the establishment of the Society of the Cincinnati and was the second officer to sign the national charter , with his signature appearing directly below that of von Steuben . Howe thereafter returned to his North Carolina plantation , Kendal , which was upriver from the more famous Orton Plantation owned by Howe 's distant relatives . Also in 1783 , Howe became a founding member of the North Carolina Society of the Cincinnati and was a signatory to its " Institution " or charter . During much of 1783 and 1784 , Howe returned frequently to Philadelphia , New York , and other cities in the northeast in an attempt to settle accounts and obtain back payments he claimed he was owed by Congress . He was again forced to mortgage his plantation but eventually received a monetary settlement from Congress of $ 7 @,@ 000 in 1785 . 
 During 1785 , Howe was appointed by the Congress of the Confederation to establish treaties with several western Indian tribes but did not actually travel with commissioners George Rogers Clark , Richard Butler , and Samuel Holden Parsons , who finalized the Treaty of Fort Finney without Howe in 1786 . Howe assisted Benjamin Smith in planning for the construction of Bald Head Light and actively worked to assist former Loyalists who sought to return to their prior lives in North Carolina by defending them against the judiciary of the state . 
 In the summer of 1786 , he was elected a member of the North Carolina House of Commons . On his way to a meeting of the legislative body , Howe fell ill , and died on December 14 , 1786 , in Bladen County . Howe 's remains were buried on property he owned in what later became Columbus County , North Carolina , although the exact location of his burial has not been discovered . A cenotaph was placed in Southport 's Old Smithville Burying Ground honoring him and wife Sara . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Howe has been remembered primarily in a negative light based on his lack of military successes and reputation , although North Carolina historian Hugh Rankin noted in a biographical sketch that " his opportunities came at times when he did not have proper field strength to gain favorable recognition . " During the 1903 session of the United States House of Representatives , Congressman John Dillard Bellamy introduced a bill to erect an equestrian statue of Howe in Wilmington in order to commemorate the general 's service ; this bill was not passed . In 1940 , the State of North Carolina cast and erected a highway historical marker to commemorate Howe 's service . The marker stands on North Carolina Highway 133 in Belville , North Carolina . The 1955 film The Scarlet Coat featured a performance by actor John McIntire as Howe during the height of the Benedict Arnold conspiracy . 
 = = = Evidence of attempted treason = = = 
 Several scholars have raised questions regarding Howe 's actions as the unofficial spymaster of the Hudson Valley , all of which center on evidence that suggests Howe attempted to bargain with the British in exchange for a commission as an officer in the regular British Army , similar to the bargain struck by Benedict Arnold in 1780 . As early as 1776 , after Howe was appointed a brigadier general , a Loyalist merchant named Henry Kelly advised Secretary of State for the Colonies George Germain , 1st Viscount Sackville that Howe could be easily tempted to join the British , and further claimed that Howe could offer a great deal to the British in their war effort . 
 In 1780 , after Benedict Arnold 's attempted treason had been exposed , Captain Beesly Edgar Joel , a British defector and former officer in the British Army , claimed that another officer besides Arnold had attempted to defect , and after interrogation Joel named Howe as that officer . Joel cited Edmund Fanning , William Tryon 's secretary , as the source for his information . Joel further described Howe 's method of communicating with the British , which was by means of a frequently imprisoned @-@ and @-@ exchanged prisoner who would convey messages between the parties . While neither Washington or the Congressional Board of War believed Joel 's story due to their suspicion of Joel as a British spy , Joel was later commissioned by Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia government to lead a Patriot militia unit against Loyalists in that state . Furthermore , William Smith , a New York Loyalist and the brother of Howe 's agent and Arnold 's co @-@ conspirator Joshua Hett Smith , noted in his diary on April 29 , 1780 , that his brother , Thomas Smith , had been informed that a commissary had come over to the British with " information " from the Patriots in much the same manner as Joel had described . On September 28 , 1780 , William Smith told Henry Clinton that he believed " Bob " Howe would be willing to turn on the Patriots . 
 Later historians , including Douglas Southall Freeman , have frequently dismissed allegations that Howe attempted to defect , believing them to have been fabrications used by Joel to ingratiate himself with the Patriot government . The only full @-@ length book treatment of Howe 's life discusses the allegations of attempted treason in a single page . On the other hand , Freeman 's judgment was based primarily on Washington 's assessment of the allegations , but Washington did not have access to the potentially corroborating evidence in William Smith 's diary . Another possibility is that Howe had merely attempted to spread word among the British of his possible treason in order to conceal his management of the vast spy network at his control ; this tactic was utilized by other <unk> in Continental employ such as Philip Schuyler . Philip <unk> , an American historian who studied Howe 's career and motivations , has contrasted Schuyler 's otherwise shining reputation with Howe 's record of failures and draws the conclusion that Howe likely was attempting to defect . To date , no firm evidence exists which either absolves Howe or proves him guilty of attempted treason . 
 = Ali 's Smile : Naked Scientology = 
 Ali 's Smile : Naked Scientology is a collection of essays and a short story by American Beat writer William S. Burroughs ( 1914 – 97 ) . First published in 1971 as the short story " Ali 's Smile " , the book eventually contained a group of previously published newspaper articles as well , all of which address Scientology . Burroughs had been interested in Scientology throughout the 1960s , believing that its methods might help combat a controlling society . He joined the Church of Scientology later in the decade . However , he became disenchanted with the authoritarian nature of the organization . In 1970 Burroughs had published a " considered statement " on Scientology 's methods because he felt they were significant enough to warrant commentary . These pieces were later gathered together into Ali 's Smile : Naked Scientology , which religious studies scholar Hugh B. Urban describes as a " <unk> popular exposé of Scientology " . Burroughs 's texts argue that while some of Scientology 's therapies are worthwhile , the dogmatic nature of the group and its secrecy are harmful . 
 = = Background = = 
 Beat Generation writer William S. Burroughs was an avant @-@ garde author whom several important critics consider the most important American writer since World War II . Sometimes called the " Godfather of Punk literature " , he adopted a persona that Matt <unk> , a scholar of the Beats , describes as " a tormented but supremely curious person who explored the dark side of the human consciousness . " Burroughs often probed contentious social and political problems with " a cold @-@ blooded , almost <unk> presence " that influenced popular culture as well as literature . 
 Burroughs believed that readers needed to take an active part in reshaping their own reality through reading . For example , works such as the controversial novel Naked Lunch ( 1959 ) dealt with his concerns regarding " the battle against control , " and Burroughs wrote that others " might see the control that governments , religions , greedy human beings , and their own cravings for drugs , sex , or power often hold over them " . <unk> writes that Burroughs saw words as " instruments of control that allow evil forces to impose their will over people " , and he attempted to use words themselves to combat this problem . He wrote in a way that would allow both him and his readers to redefine words and to create new levels of meaning , thereby liberating them from social control . 
 His concerns about social control and language led Burroughs to write at length about Scientology . He had been interested in Scientology since the early 1960s , having been introduced to the concepts of its founder L. Ron Hubbard by artist Brion Gysin . Burroughs 's early novels emphasized the power of Scientology to combat a controlling society . For example , in both The Ticket That Exploded ( 1962 ) and Nova Express ( 1964 ) , Scientology , along with the cut @-@ up technique , silence , and apomorphine ( which he believed was an extremely effective treatment for heroin addiction ) , allows the characters to resist social control . These works reflected Burroughs 's initial belief that Scientology could be an instrument of liberation from social control , much as he used his own cut @-@ up style of writing . He sought to use cut @-@ ups " to expose the arbitrary nature and manipulative power of all linguistic systems , " and connected cut @-@ ups to the theories of the self expounded by Hubbard 's Dianetics . As religious studies scholar John <unk> explains , " the cut @-@ up method was the evangelical counterpart of Scientology in that it was intended to alter a reader 's consciousness " . 
 In 1967 Burroughs became a more serious devotee to Scientology , taking several courses and in 1968 becoming what the Church of Scientology calls a " clear " — a person who has eradicated the harmful influence of their reactive mind by removing engrams , traumatic mental images , from their subconscious through Scientology 's auditing process . In his works , Burroughs represented the process that Scientologists refer to as " clearing " memories as a step towards becoming an active rather than passive member of society . Scientology thus appealed to Burroughs because it " confirmed his belief that consciousness is akin to a tape recording that can be rewound , fast @-@ forwarded , or even erased " . Burroughs believed that Scientology 's practice of auditing had helped him resolve some traumatic life experiences , and " came to regard the E @-@ Meter as a useful device for <unk> " . However , he had " growing doubts about some of the other Scientology technology , and grave reservations about their policy as an organisation " . He became frustrated by the authoritarian nature of the organization , and as biographer Ted Morgan writes , " ... had hoped to find a method of personal emancipation and had found instead another control system . " In a similar vein , Burroughs was both intrigued by Scientology 's study of language , but felt distaste for the way it was being utilized : 
 They [ the Church of Scientology ] have a great deal of very precise data on words and the effects produced by words – a real science of communication . But I feel that their presentation has been often deplorable and that as a science , a body of knowledge , it is definitely being vitiated by a dogmatic policy . 
 By 1970 , Burroughs had severed connections with the Church of Scientology . He was eventually expelled from the organization and declared to be in " Condition of Treason " . He became increasingly disenchanted with the group and wrote a series of critical articles published in Mayfair . Burroughs also forced one of their headquarters to relocate by publicizing photos of it .

 Ali 's Smile , Burroughs 's short story on Scientology , was originally published in a limited @-@ edition run of 99 copies by Unicorn in 1971 . A recording of Burroughs reading the story was simultaneously released . Two years later , Expanded Media Editions issued a revised and enlarged version titled Ali 's Smile : Naked Scientology , which contained a series of articles , most of which had been previously published in newspapers and magazines . In 1970 Burroughs had published a " considered statement " on Scientology 's methods because he felt that they were significant enough to warrant commentary . This statement articulates what he calls the group 's " precise and efficient " therapeutic methods , however he also criticizes the authoritarian nature of the institution , describing Hubbard 's statements as fascistic and comparing their internal surveillance methods to that of the FBI and CIA . He also condemns the " unquestioning acceptance " demanded of Scientologists as well as the institution 's secrecy . These pieces were later gathered together into Ali 's Smile : Naked Scientology , which religious studies scholar Hugh Urban describes as a " <unk> popular exposé of Scientology " . In 1985 , Expanded Media Editions published a bilingual German and English edition . 
 " Burroughs on Scientology " is an opinion piece originally published in the Los Angeles Free Press on 6 March 1970 . It begins " In view of the fact that my articles and statements on Scientology may have influenced young people to associate themselves with the so called Church of Scientology , I feel an obligation to make my present views on the subject quite clear . " Burroughs states that some Scientology practices have value : " Some of the techniques are highly valuable and warrant further study and experimentation . " He is critical of the Church of Scientology 's organizational policy and organizations in general , and Scientology 's attempts to keep many of its counseling methods secret , and writes " On the other hand I am in flat disagreement with the organizational policy . " 
 " William Burroughs : Open Letter to Mr. Garden Mustain " was originally published in the East Village Other on 7 July 1970 . The East Village Other introduction to Burroughs ' piece notes that the open letter " is Mr. Burroughs ' final answer to his critics and to Mister Gorden Mustain who attacked him for his position on Scientology in the pages of the L.A. FREE <unk> . In it he asks the inevitable question to be faced by us all , whether we be in a professional status or not : ' We would like to know where Scientology and Mr. Hubbard stand on the Vietnam war , on sexual freedom , militant students , Black Power , pot , Red China , the politics of the American Narcotics department and the CIA . If it comes to a revolution : which side would you fight on ? ' " 
 " William Burroughs on ' Inside Scientology ' by Robert Kaufman " was originally published in Rolling Stone on 26 October 1972 . It is a book review of Inside Scientology , which was embroiled in a legal controversy . In the review , Burroughs relates his personal experiences as a Scientologist and describes himself as an anthropologist . Burroughs begins by praising Kaufman 's decision to reveal confidential upper @-@ level Scientology teachings in the book : " Mr. Kaufman has shown real courage in publishing Hubbard 's so @-@ called confidential materials for the first time in Inside Scientology . " 
 " Letter to Rolling Stone " by R. Sorrell ( Church of Scientology ) was originally published in Rolling Stone on 5 December 1972 . Sorrell wrote on behalf of the Church of Scientology to Rolling Stone , asserting that statements made by Burroughs in his review of Inside Scientology were inaccurate . Sorrell noted that the book had been involved in legal controversy and commented : " I have included here an <unk> of these inaccuracies with documentation to show that Mr. Burroughs may be a writer but cannot always be trusted to be an accurate one . " 
 " Answer to R. Sorrell 's Letter " by William Burroughs is a point @-@ by @-@ point response to Sorrell 's letter in Rolling Stone . In total , Burroughs addresses 28 issues , including " Scientology 's security checks " , Fair Gaming , excommunication , the financial dealings of Scientology , Scientology terminology such as " Wog " , and the efficacy of the E @-@ meter as a lie detector . 
 " Ali 's Smile " by William Burroughs is a short story originally published by Unicorn in 1971 and later republished in Burroughs 's collection of short stories , Exterminator ! ( 1973 ) . At the opening of the story , Clinch Smith , a former colonial official , is living in an English town overshadowed by a giant slag heap . He is upset when he receives a letter from a Scientologist friend saying that he will " disconnect " from Smith , describing him as a " suppressive person " . A kris hanging on the wall of his room reminds Smith of Ali , whom he had met 30 years ago in Malaya . Ali had been put under a <unk> spell by an old woman , forcing him to dance in the marketplace . Smith rescued Ali , making the young man his houseboy . Ali returned to the market , however , and ran amok , killing several of the women with the kris . Smith was forced to shoot Ali , and kept the kris as a souvenir . Back in the present , Smith feels compelled to take the kris from the wall and goes to town , where there is a fight going on between hippies and locals , with members of Scientology 's Sea Org in the crowd as well . Smith goes on a killing spree with the kris , which seems to have a life of its own . He stabs Lord Westfield , a Home Office official who has asked a private investigator to infiltrate a Scientology organization , a woman , and several Sea Org members , and then a bystander shoots him dead . Police and more combatants prepare to join the fight . As they do so , the slag heap collapses and buries everyone . At the end , the " ghost face " of Ali smiles over all .

 US Highway 33 ( US 33 ) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that was once located in Berrien County , Michigan . At the time it was removed from the state , it was only about 2 @.@ 8 miles ( 4 @.@ 5 km ) long running north from the Indiana state line to an intersection with US 12 south of Niles . The highway was not originally part of the US Highway System in the state ; it was added in 1937 as a second designation for part of US 31 between the state line and St. Joseph . It was later extended further north to the community of Lake Michigan Beach . This extension became the only section of US 33 that was routed independent of another highway until it was truncated to Niles . In 1997 , US 33 was officially removed from the state . 
 = = Route description = = 
 At the time it last existed in Michigan , US 33 started at the Indiana state line at an intersection with State Line Road . From there it ran due north along 11th Street through a residential neighborhood parallel to the St. Joseph River . Just past an intersection with Fulkerson Road , the highway curved briefly to the northeast as it approached Bell Road . US 33 terminated at a five @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with US 12 ( Pulaski Highway ) south of the city of Niles in Bertrand Township . According to the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , the agency that maintained the roadway , in 1998 , the last year it was US 33 , the highway carried between 17 @,@ 192 and 24 @,@ 669 vehicles on average , daily . Additionally , the roadway that carried the highway designation is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13 , 1913 , by an act of the Michigan Legislature ; at the time , one of the system 's divisions corresponded to US 33 . Division 5 followed a course from Niles northward to Mackinaw City . In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) signposted the highway system for the first time , and the future US 33 corridor was assigned the original M @-@ 58 designation from the state line northward through Niles to St. Joseph . When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , the corridor received the US 31 designation . The US 33 designation was later added to US 31 from the state line northward to St. Joseph in 1937 . 
 In November 1960 , the US 33 designation was extended northward along US 31 from St. Joseph through Benton Harbor to Lake Michigan Beach Two years later , a segment of freeway opened east of Benton Harbor , and US 31 was rerouted to follow it , leaving US 33 to its own alignment between Scottdale and Lake Michigan Beach . This was the first time that US 33 had a section of its routing in Michigan that was not concurrent with another highway . Also , the northernmost 1 ⁄ 2 mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) of US 33 overlapped part of US 31 between the freeway and its old routing , resulting in a wrong @-@ way concurrency . This concurrency was removed the next year when another freeway section for I @-@ 196 / US 31 opened north of the previous endpoint , removing US 31 from Hagar Shores Road . Additional freeway for US 31 was built in the late 1970s into the 1980s . Called the St. Joseph Valley Parkway , the first section of this freeway through Berrien County was completed in 1979 and ran from the Indiana state line north to US 12 ; after its completion , US 33 had a second independent routing from the state line north to US 12 where US 31 merged back in from its new freeway routing . 
 US 33 was all but eliminated in Michigan on June 9 , 1986 , when the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) approved a request by MDOT to truncate the designation to the intersection with US 12 south of Niles . A year later , construction of the Niles Bypass was finished , bringing the parkway north to Walton Road northwest of Niles . Signage was updated for US 33 at the same time , and the M @-@ 63 designation was assigned to US 33 from Scottdale to Lake Michigan Beach , while the US 31 designation ran solo on the highway between Scottdale and the Niles Bypass . Business US 31 ( Bus . US 31 ) was created along the former routing of US 31 / US 33 between the bypass and Niles while the remainder of US 33 through downtown became part of Bus . US 12 or M @-@ 51 . The last segment of US 33 between US 12 and the state line was removed on April 25 , 1997 , when AASHTO approved a joint request by MDOT and its counterpart in Indiana to truncate the highway designate to an intersection with US 20 in Elkhart , Indiana . This remaining segment in Michigan became part of an extended M @-@ 51 when the signage was changed a year later . 
 On March 5 , 2010 , a segment of Bus . US 12 previously used by US 33 in downtown Niles was transferred back to city control . Otherwise , all of US 33 at its greatest extent from 1961 through 1987 remains part of a state highway in Michigan . From the state line into Niles , it is M @-@ 51 . From the west side of downtown Niles , it is M @-@ 139 to Scottdale , and from there north , it is M @-@ 63

 " Box Cutter " is the fourth season premiere of the American television drama series Breaking Bad , and its 34th episode overall . Written by series creator Vince Gilligan and directed by Adam Bernstein , " Box Cutter " originally aired on AMC in the United States on July 17 , 2011 . The narrative follows protagonist Walter White ( Bryan Cranston ) and his partner Jesse Pinkman ( Aaron Paul ) as they face repercussions from drug kingpin Gustavo <unk> ( Giancarlo Esposito ) for killing Gale during the previous season . Meanwhile , Skyler White ( Anna Gunn ) breaks into her husband Walter 's condominium to investigate his sudden disappearance , and Marie Schrader ( Betsy Brandt ) struggles to help Hank Schrader ( Dean Norris ) recover from his injuries . 
 The episode marked the final regular performances of actors David Costabile and Jeremiah Bitsui as Gale and Victor . Gilligan considered changing the episode based on audience responses to the third @-@ season finale , " Full Measure " , on whether Gale would be killed or not , but ultimately decided against it . During a twist scene in " Box Cutter " , Gus slices his loyal henchman Victor 's throat with a utility knife right before Walt and Jesse 's eyes . Esposito said he was concerned about filming the scene " without really hurting my spirit and my soul " , and he concentrated so hard that he remained silent and focused during filming , rarely speaking to others on set . The scene was so bloody it made Cranston 's daughter faint during a screening . 
 A major theme of " Box Cutter " , and the entire fourth season , involved Walter 's gradual change into a darker character who becomes more proactively violent and dangerous . The episode also illustrates Jesse 's moral decline and feelings of guilt over his killing of Gale , and Skyler 's growing involvement in Walter 's illegal activities . The episode received positive reviews , and was watched by 2 @.@ 58 million households , according to Nielsen Media Research . Until the fifth season premiere , " Box Cutter " was the most watched Breaking Bad episode in the series ' history and the third @-@ highest @-@ rated season premiere for any AMC show , after the first two seasons ' premieres of The Walking Dead . In 2012 , Gilligan received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Episodic Drama for his work on this episode . This marked his second win for individual work on Breaking Bad , along with his award from the pilot episode in 2009 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 During a pre @-@ credits flashback sequence , methamphetamine manufacturer Gale Boetticher ( David Costabile ) excitedly sets up equipment in an underground meth <unk> for drug kingpin Gus <unk> ( Giancarlo Esposito ) . Gale asks Gus about the blue meth being produced by chemist Walter White ( Bryan Cranston ) , who at this point is not yet working for Gus . Gus explains he has reservations about hiring Walter , but Gale insists Gus hire him because of his superior product . 
 In the present day , Walt 's partner Jesse Pinkman ( Aaron Paul ) has just shot Gale to death on orders from Walt to foil Gus ' plot to kill and replace them . Gus ' henchman Victor ( Jeremiah Bitsui ) arrives at Gale 's apartment and finds him dead , surrounded by neighbors who have just called the police . Victor finds a stunned Jesse sitting in his car outside and forces him at gunpoint to return to the meth lab , where Gus ' employee Mike ( Jonathan Banks ) is holding Walt hostage . Mike , who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders at the murder scene , calls to inform Gus of the events . Victor , who has often watched Walt work , starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse . Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected . 
 Meanwhile , Walt 's wife Skyler ( Anna Gunn ) observes his car in her driveway and , not wishing her son Walter Jr . ( RJ Mitte ) to see it , drives it a few blocks away to conceal it . Concerned about Walt 's apparent disappearance , she calls their lawyer Saul Goodman ( Bob Odenkirk ) , but he has become paranoid from Walt 's falling out with Gus and is too busy checking his office for listening devices . Skyler hires a locksmith to break into Walt 's condo for her , claiming it belongs to her . When he hesitates to do so without identification , Skyler claims her purse was stolen and fakes a panic attack until he finally agrees . She finds little of interest inside the condo . Elsewhere , Skyler 's sister Marie ( Betsy Brandt ) struggles to maintain her composure while caring for her belligerent husband Hank ( Dean Norris ) , who is still bedridden after the attempt on his life . 
 Gus arrives at the <unk> but says nothing . Walt launches into a nervous , rambling monologue of excuses and justifications , trying to convince Gus he needs him and Jesse alive . He claims it is Gus who is ultimately responsible for Gale 's death , not they , and insists Victor cannot produce the meth Gus needs . Gus maintains his silence , even while changing into hazmat gear and selecting a box cutter , while Victor grins in anticipation . Never changing his demeanor , Gus suddenly slices Victor 's throat , startling the others . Through the killing , Gus simultaneously punishes Victor while delivering a stern message to Walt and Jesse . Gus drops the body to the floor and coldly eyes the duo to ensure his message was received . Gus quietly returns to his street clothes , then walks out of the lab , pausing only to say , " Well , get back to work . " 
 Later , Walt and Jesse dispose of Victor 's body , the gun that killed Gale , and the box cutter in a barrel of hydrofluoric acid . During breakfast later , Walt insists to Jesse that Gale 's death was necessary , but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity . Jesse doubts this , believing it will be too much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer , and that both they and Gus understand the situation : neither can kill the other , so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead . The episode ends with police investigating Gale 's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered .

 " Box Cutter " , the fourth season premiere of Breaking Bad , was directed by Adam Bernstein and written by series creator Vince Gilligan . Filmed in January 2011 , the episode was edited by Skip MacDonald , one of a handful of editors who have regularly worked on the series . It was broadcast on July 17 , 2011 , and was the first original Breaking Bad episode in 13 months , since the third season finale episode " Full Measure " aired in June 2010 . AMC officials delayed the fourth season premiere until July because they felt the Nielsen ratings would be better during the summer . While Breaking Bad scripts are generally 50 pages long , the screenplay to " Box Cutter " was 43 pages long , and Gilligan was originally concerned because he did not want to stretch out the episode simply to pad the running time . " Full Measure " ended with Jesse 's pulling a gun on Gale and firing directly into the screen , with Gale 's death not visibly revealed on @-@ screen . This led to wide speculation among fans and reviewers that Jesse did not actually kill Gale , but rather aimed away from him and fired the gun . This speculation continued up until the original broadcast of " Box Cutter " , which confirmed Jesse indeed killed Gale . Gilligan said he never intended for that scene to be a cliffhanger and he thought it clearly conveyed that Gale had died . 
 " Box Cutter " featured the final regular appearances of recurring Breaking Bad characters David Costabile and Jeremiah Bitsui who , respectively , played Gale Boetticher and Victor . Stand @-@ up comedian Lavell Crawford also made his first of several guest appearances in " Box Cutter " as Huell , Saul 's new bodyguard . Gilligan stated that he named the episode " Box Cutter " mainly because " it just sounded like a cool title " , but also because he was concerned that the climax of the episode took so long to build to that , by calling it " Box Cutter " , " Perhaps I was thinking on some level , ' We 'd better let the audience know that there 's something at the end of this . ' " Although the Breaking Bad staff always intended for Gale to be killed , the audience reaction to " Full Measure " made Gilligan and the Breaking Bad writing staff reconsider whether their plans were the best ones . However , Gilligan said they instead decided to follow their original plan , saying " At the end of the day , the choice we made for how to press forward was the choice we felt was the most honest , and the one that would best continue the story . " 
 Giancarlo Esposito said that when he first read the script for " Box Cutter " , he was so shocked that he had to put it down and walk away from it . Esposito said he did not want to " take any of [ the scene ] home with me " and had " some deep concern about being able to do it and coming out of it unscathed , without really hurting my spirit and my soul " . He worked through these concerns by justifying Gus ' actions in that , by killing Victor , he was protecting everyone else who works for him . Nevertheless , he said it was " a difficult moment for me " to slit Victor 's throat , and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly . That scene took two days to film , and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming , rarely speaking to the others on set . The boots he was originally given were too large and he was concerned that he would slip , which would be out of character for Gus , who was otherwise completely calm and in control . A costume designer quickly procured the right @-@ sized boots for him . 
 In writing the script , the Breaking Bad staff decided early on that Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more dramatic that way and more appropriate for his character . Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character , but for Gus ' relationship with Walter , and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus ' way or risk death . Regarding his character 's murder of Victor , Esposito said : " This had to be done . Someone did something , they got seen . ... It was about survival . This had to be done , but I could do it in a way that also sent a message to the people who weren 't listening . " Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did . He called the scene " painful , but beautifully crafted , and reasonably so " , and commented on the contrast between Gus ' calm demeanor and Walter 's " tap @-@ dancing to stay alive " . Cranston said of Esposito 's performance , " When he plays that bad character , his eyes go dead , and all it takes is to look into his eyes . " Gilligan said although Gus ' actions in the scene were scripted , " You 'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts . " 
 A major theme of " Box Cutter " involves Walter 's gradual change from an unwitting participant in a drug @-@ dealing enterprise into a man more comfortable with a life of crime who embraces his darker side and becomes more proactively violent and dangerous . This development began during the latter episodes of the third season and would continue to be a major theme throughout the fourth season . The episode also introduced the ongoing theme of Jesse 's moral decline and self guilt over his killing of Gale . Aaron Paul said of this , " Jesse 's much more raw this season . He 's very distant , and he 's turned to just utter chaos and destruction to keep his mind busy . When he 's left alone in his own thoughts , that 's when things can get kind of dangerous and scary for Jesse . " 
 The scene when Walter pleads with Gus demonstrates the paternal sense of protectiveness Walter has developed for Jesse . During that scene , Walter tells Gus , " You kill me , you have nothing . You kill Jesse , you don 't have me . " Jesse is visibly moved by the statement , which Aaron Paul described as " the first moment that Jesse realizes that Walt 's loyalty is to Jesse . " " Box Cutter " also illustrated Skyler 's growing involvement in Walter 's illegal activities through the subplot in which she lies to a locksmith to break into Walter 's house , going so far as to use her baby as a prop in her facade . After Skyler breaks in to Walter 's apartment , she finds the plastic eyeball of a teddy bear that has been part of the series since the second season . The eye has long been used as a symbol to identify Walter 's gradual descent into a life of crime , and Skyler 's discovery of it symbolizes her own similar descent . 
 Jeremiah Bitsui sprained his ankle during filming of the scene when Walter and Jesse shoved his corpse into a barrel to dispose of it with hydrofluoric acid . Following that scene , Jesse lifts the barrel with a forklift and it is lit in a way that the barrel can be seen through . This was accomplished by back @-@ lighting the barrel and tying monofilament to the bottom of it , which staff members then moved and twisted outside of the view of the camera to create the lighting effect . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 During a scene when Gale 's neighbor calls police to report his murder , a clock in Gale 's apartment reads 10 : 13 . This is a deliberate reference to the number 1013 , which frequently appeared in The X @-@ Files , where Vince Gilligan worked as a writer and producer and Bryan Cranston as an actor . It refers to the name of X @-@ Files creator Chris Carter 's production company Ten Thirteen Productions , which in turn is a reference to Chris Carter 's birthday , October 13 . A copy of Everything 's Eventual , a collection of short stories by Stephen King , can be seen in Gale 's apartment . After Walter and Jesse are released by Gus , they eat lunch at Denny 's , a coffee shop and family restaurant chain . During this scene , they are wearing matching T @-@ shirts with country music singer Kenny Rogers on them . The T @-@ shirts are deliberately not explained in the episode , but Vince Gilligan said he believed Mike simply bought the first articles of clean clothing he could find for Walter and Jesse after their clothes were soaked with Victor 's blood . During the final scene of " Box Cutter " , when Walter walks back to his condominium , the Alex Ebert song " Truth " plays in the background .

 " Box Cutter " was first publicly shown on June 28 , 2011 , at the Grauman 's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . During the scene when Gus killed Victor , Bryan Cranston 's daughter Taylor fainted in her seat inside the theater at the sight of all the blood . This prompted theater officials to briefly interrupt the screening and ask for a doctor in the audience , causing a brief panic among the crowd . The violent scenes in " Box Cutter " proved so bloody that AMC included a disclaimer warning about the violence at the start of the episode and after the commercial break halfway through the episode . 
 In its original American broadcast , " Box Cutter " was seen by an estimated 2 @.@ 58 million household viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research . It was the most watched Breaking Bad episode in the series and the second highest rated season premiere for any AMC show , falling behind only the series premiere of The Walking Dead , which drew 5 @.@ 3 million household viewers . It was also a 32 percent increase in viewership compared to the third season premiere , " No Mas " . " Box Cutter " performed especially strong with men between ages 18 and 34 , among whom viewership was up 67 percent compared to the third season premiere . The episode was seen by 1 @.@ 4 million household viewers in both the 18 to 49 and the 25 to 54 age groups , a 21 percent increase in the former group and a 26 percent increase in the latter .

 " Box Cutter " received critical acclaim . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said the episode demonstrated how effective the creators of Breaking Bad are at manipulating the emotions of their viewers . Sepinwall described the story as " remarkably simple " but the execution as extremely effective , and he called the amount of screen time dedicated to Gus calmly changing his clothes before and after killing Victor " a move so ballsy and so brilliant I actually started giggling the second time they did it " . Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the episode demonstrated how effective Breaking Bad can be even with a minimal amount of dialogue , such as Gus ' silence during his scene in the lab , and Jesse 's <unk> throughout the episode as he processed what he had done to Gale . He also praised the color scheme of the blood @-@ red meth lab as an illustrator of Walter and Jesse 's descent into hell . Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker said of the episode , " Its eloquent silences , its breath @-@ taking pictorial compositions ... these are pleasures that transcend 98 % of television 's usual attempts at dirty realism or fashionable pessimism " . Kim Potts of TV Squad called Gus ' killing of Victor " one of the more jarring scenes in Breaking Bad history " . The Faster Times writer Craig McQuinn called it " one of the most intense episodes I 've ever seen " , and said it solidified Gus ' standing as " one of the greatest TV antagonists I 've ever seen " . Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon.com compared the filmmaking in " Box Cutter " to that of works by Alfred Hitchcock and the Coen brothers , and called the best example of television 's ability to " take an elastic approach to narrative and let certain incidents or moments expand to fill up most or all of an episode " since " The Suitcase " , an episode of the television series Mad Men . 
 Seth Amitin of IGN called it a minimalist , deliberately paced episode but said it was never boring due to the excellent acting , dialogue and suspense which illustrates " just how quickly this show lost its innocence " . He also said the subplots involving Skyler , Hank and Marie kept the episode 's pace well . Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff praised the performance of Aaron Paul despite his almost complete lack of dialogue throughout the episode , and felt the script raised interesting contrasts between Walt , who acts impulsively and rash while captured , and Gus , who seems calm and in control . However , he said it felt like Victor was killed rather than Walter or Jesse simply because the writers could not kill the two main protagonists . Michael Arbeiter of Hollywood.com called it a " great and intriguing way to start the season " and particularly praised Aaron Paul , who he said was " phenomenal " despite barely speaking any dialogue in the episode . However , he had " mixed feelings " about the Gus character 's evolution from a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes criminal to a hands @-@ on killer . Jessica Johnson of Time Out Chicago called it an " exquisite exercise in tension " that builds a " slow crescendo of what looks to be an impressively strong season " . Andy <unk> of the Bucks County Courier Times called it " a great start for a show that just keeps getting better " . He praised the dark humor that kept the tension of the show balanced , and particularly complimented the pre @-@ credits scene and the ramifications it had for the show and its characters . RedEye writer Curt Wagner found that the cinematography , pacing and tension were so effective in " Box Cutter " , that " I think I broke a sweat just watching " . Paste magazine writer Brent Koepp praised the transformation of Walter , and said few other shows would risk making their protagonist so unlikeable . Koepp called the climactic scene with Gus " brilliant " and complimented the script for taking its time in building the tension . 
 Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised the episode for its effectiveness in scenes featuring little dialogue , particularly with Jesse and Gus , claiming , " No show does silence like Breaking Bad . " He also complimented Cranston 's desperate monologue while trying to convince Gus not to kill him , claiming it provided a deep insight into Walt 's character and his inability to accept responsibility for his actions . Zap2it writer Rick Porter called the scene with Gus killing Victor a " master class in building tension " due to the strong writing , direction and acting , particularly by Esposito . Scott Wampler of Collider.com called it " a fantastic , bloody , shocking season premiere , one of the best in the show 's history " . He particularly praised Esposito 's performance and suggested it could make the actor worthy of contention for an Emmy Award . BlackBook magazine writer Chris Mohney strongly praised Esposito 's performance , and described his silence and calm during the climactic scene as " one of the great recent moments of TV menace " . June Thomas of Slate magazine called it a " fine opening episode " that did not advance the plot significantly but " served as an artful reminder of where the characters stand psychologically " . Thomas said she believed the episode demonstrated that Walter is in fact a weak man , comparing his useless pleas to Gus to his ineffective attempts to mislead Skyler about his drug @-@ manufacturing activities in earlier seasons . Not all reviews were positive . Jessica Grose , also of Slate magazine , said while she prefers episodes that mixed its darker aspects with black humor , " Box Cutter " was " all claustrophobia and fear " . The Philadelphia Inquirer columnist David Hiltbrand condemned the violent scene with Victor 's death , which he called " totally gratuitous ... serv [ ing ] no plot or character purpose " .

 Walker was a right @-@ handed batsman and right @-@ arm underarm bowler . One of Tasmania 's leading cricketers of his time , his score of 60 in an 1860 North versus South Tasmania game set a record of being the highest individual score in such matches . In his profile of Walker for ESPNcricinfo , the sports writer Thomas Rose said : " He impressed in representative games and was often the shining light of a rather dismal Tasmanian side ... " 
 After moving to Launceston , Walker made cricket famous in the city , captaining the Northern Tasmania cricket team . During the 1860s and 1870s , Walker also played for two clubs – Derwent and Wellington – under the then Tasmanian Cricket Association , standing out by scoring a century in one of his appearances . 
 Walker 's first @-@ class cricketing career spanned six years , from 1872 to 1878 . He played two first @-@ class cricket matches as captain of the Tasmanian cricket team during that period , scoring 73 runs and taking five wickets . During Cricket Tasmania 's 150th anniversary celebrations , Walker was named as a member of the Cricket Tasmania Premier League 's Team of the Decade for the decade 1866 / 67 – 1875 / 76 for having scored one of the only two centuries in Tasmania by any cricketer for the decade 1866 – 1875 . 
 Walker took 60 wickets in the 1875 – 76 domestic season at an average of 8 @.@ 47 runs per wicket , the best for all bowlers of the season . Walker was also a highly skilled wicket @-@ keeper . Despite his all @-@ round capabilities , Walker was best recognised and remembered for his impressive contributions as an inspirational captain , coming out as the best player in many matches irrespective of his team 's performance . 
 = = Death = = 
 At the age of 50 , after suffering a very short illness , Walker died on 14 June 1886 , at <unk> House , Hobart , Tasmania , with his funeral being held two days later . The Mercury wrote in its obituary on 15 June 1886 : " Cricketers will learn with regret of the death , after a very short illness , of Mr. William Holden Walker , one of the oldest votaries of this thoroughly English game in the colony ... Mr. Walker , who previous to his departure from England , was a member of the well @-@ known Walker Team , brought cricketing into great prominence in Launceston ... His efforts in the cause of cricket are so well known that they require no comment , but his sudden demise will cause a pang among the many friends who admired his genial and gentlemanly temperament . " 
 Around a month after his death , on 13 July 1886 , an amount of £ 590 from his estate was issued over as probate . 
 = Nafaanra = 
 Nafaanra ( sometimes written <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> ] ) is a Senufo language spoken in northwest Ghana , along the border with Ivory Coast , east of <unk> . It is spoken by approximately 61 @,@ 000 people . Its speakers call themselves Nafana ; others call them Banda or <unk> . Like other Senufo languages , Nafaanra is a tonal language . It is somewhat of an outlier in the Senufo language group , with the geographically closest relatives , the Southern Senufo Tagwana – Djimini languages , approximately 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) to the west , on the other side of Comoé National Park . 
 The basic word order is subject – object – verb , similar to Latin and Japanese . Like other Niger – Congo languages it has a noun class system where nouns are classified according to five different genders , which also affects pronouns , adjectives and <unk> . The phonology features a distinction between the length of vowels and whether they are oral or nasal ( as in French or Portuguese ) . There are also three distinct tones , a feature shared with the other Senufo languages . Nafaanra grammar features both tense and aspect which are marked with particles . Numbers are mainly formed by adding cardinal numbers to the number 5 and by multiplying the numbers 10 , 20 and 100 . 
 = = Geography and demography = = 
 Nafaanra is bordered by <unk> languages to the west , while <unk> ( a Gur language ) and Gonja ( Kwa ) are found to the north and east . The closest eastern neighbour is the <unk> language Ligbi , whose speakers are also called Banda ) which , like Nafaanra , is an outlier to its own family . Southeast and south of Nafaanra and Ligbi , the Akan language <unk> ( also Bron or Brong ) is spoken . 
 The Nafana people live in the north @-@ west corner of the Brong @-@ <unk> Region of Ghana , concentrated mainly in Sampa ( capital of the Jaman North district ) and Banda . There are two dialectal variants of Nafaanra : Pantera of Banda , and Fantera of Sampa . Bendor @-@ Samuel gives a 79 % cognate relationship on the Swadesh list between the two dialects , meaning that they have many basic words in common . The Banda dialect is considered central . The terms " Fantera " and " Pantera " come from other peoples and are considered pejorative by the Nafana . 
 The Nafana people say that they come from a village called <unk> in Ivory Coast . Their oral history says that some of their people are still there , and if they go back they will not be allowed to leave again . They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people , who came from <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) to the area in the early 17th century . 
 Many Nafana are bilingual in Twi , the regional lingua franca , to some extent . According to SIL , 50 % of the people are able to " satisfy routine social demands and limited requirements in other domains " , while 20 % are able to speak Twi " with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical , social , and occupational topics " . The remaining 30 % are either able to maintain only very simple face @-@ to @-@ face conversations on familiar topics ( 15 % ) or unable to speak Twi at all ( 15 % ) . 15 – 25 % of the Nafana people are literate in Twi , whereas only 1 – 5 % are literate in Nafaanra . 
 Nafaanra is the second language of the approximately 70 Dompo people living in the close vicinity of Banda . Dompo is their first language , thought to be extinct until a field work trip of <unk> in 1998 proved the contrary . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 Maurice <unk> was the first linguist to mention Nafaanra , calling it " a much dispersed Senufo tribe " in 1904 . Westermann in his classification of West @-@ African languages , also grouped Nafaanra with Senufo , apparently based on the word list found in Rapp . This classification is confirmed by Bendor @-@ Samuel , who bases his internal Senufo classification on the comparative word lists in Swadesh et al . 
 It is less clear which particular Senufo branch Nafaanra is related to most closely . Bendor @-@ Samuel gives a 60 % cognate relationship on the Swadesh list with " <unk> " ( a western Senari dialect ) , 59 % with " Central Senari " ( the Senari dialect spoken around <unk> ) , and 43 % with the non @-@ Senufo languages Mo ( or <unk> ) , <unk> ( or <unk> ) , and Dogon . The relatively low scores of about 60 % point to a rather distant relationship . Likewise , Mensah and <unk> establish an <unk> factor of 38 % with " <unk> " ( Senari ) , concluding that Nafaanra is only distantly related to this dialect . Nafaanra has been tentatively linked to <unk> ( <unk> ) by <unk> , whereas Mills suggests a relation with the southern Tagwana – Djimini branch . 
 = = Sounds = = 
 = = = Vowels = = = 
 Nafaanra has seven oral and five nasalized vowels . A difference in vowel length can make a difference in meaning , as in sɛ , " to go " , vs. <unk> , " fetish " or o , " we " vs. oo , " we will " . Similarly , the phonemic <unk> of nasalization can be seen in <unk> , " to be giving birth , " vs. <unk> , " to build " . The vowel system closely resembles that of other Senufo languages . It is like the two Northern Senufo languages Supyire and <unk> in having only five nasal against seven oral vowels . In the orthography , nasalization of vowels is marked by adding the letter " n " after the vowel . 
 = = = Consonants = = = 
 In the table below , orthographic symbols are included between brackets if they differ from the IPA symbols . Note especially the use of " j " for IPA [ ɟ ] and the use of " y " for IPA [ j ] , common in African orthographies . 
 The consonant system of Nafaanra is fairly similar to that of other Senufo languages . Nafaanra has only one attested palatal fricative , / ç / , occupying an intermediate position between the Northern Senufo languages ( <unk> , Supyire ) that have both / ç / and its voiced counterpart / ʝ / , and the Central and Southern Senufo languages ( e.g. <unk> , Senari , Djimini ) that have no palatal fricatives at all . 
 = = = Tone = = = 
 Like the other Senufo languages , Nafaanra has three contrastive tones : High , Mid and Low . Tone is normally not marked in the Nafaanra orthography . Examples are : 
 <unk> ̀ " yam " ( High @-@ Low ) 
 dama " two <unk> ( coin ) " ( Mid ) 
 <unk> " rope " ( Low ) 
 The Mid tone sometimes has a rising feature , the High tone sometimes is subject to downstep ( a tonal process resulting in a High tone being realised lower than a preceding High tone ) , and an <unk> is also found . The " rising feature " of Mid may be related to the fact that two different Mid tones are found in some other Senufo languages ( e.g. <unk> and Supyire ) . The High tone downstep ( signified by a raised exclamation mark ) occurs in the following context : 
 we ! sɛ ( he <unk> go ) " he will go " . 
 It is likely that the tonal lowering seen in this particular example is related to the low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages . In fact , Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object ( in other future tense constructions , a low tone nasal is found ) . In general however , downstep is more widespread than in Supyire ; a similar phenomenon is found in <unk> , Tagwana , and Djimini . 
 An <unk> is found in the imperative tense of high tone verbs : 
 ki <unk> ( it close ) " close it ! " 
 = = Grammar = = 
 The Nafaanra syllable comprises a vowel and a maximum of three consonants . A nasal consonant may occur as a syllable on its own , in which case it is called a syllabic nasal . The basic syllable structure can be rendered as ( C1 ) ( C2 ) V ( C3 ) , with a preference for CV and <unk> . Position C1 may contain any consonant , although word @-@ initial / r / does not occur . Position C2 may contain only trills ( / r / ) or approximants ( / w , l , j / ) . Position C3 may contain only nasals ( / m n ɲ ŋ / ) , in which case the syllable as a whole is nasalized . 
 Senufo languages have a typical Niger – Congo noun class ( or gender ) system . Suffixes on nouns mark membership of one of the five noun genders . Pronouns , adjectives and <unk> reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to . Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details , it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages . 
 The basic word order in Nafaanra is subject – object – verb , as can be seen in the following sentence : 
 <unk> ná pé nya ( boys PAST them see ) " The boys saw them " 
 = = = Personal pronouns = = = 
 Jordan lists the following list of pronouns , commenting , " Although the pronoun system appears quite simple , it becomes complicated because all the tenses are shown by a combination of pronoun plus particle . " 
 = = = Tense and aspect = = = 
 Tense and aspect in Nafaanra are generally encoded in two places : in preverbal particles and on the verb form . Nafaanra has past , recent past , and future tenses and continuative aspect . In a simple sentence , the order of the various constituents can be rendered as follows : <unk> • ( <unk> ) • ( <unk> ) • ( <unk> ) • <unk> . When the negative suffix -n is present , no fusing of preverbal particles takes place . Nafaanra additionally expresses some tense / aspect matters by use of certain time adverbs and auxiliary verbs . 
 Past tense is marked by the preverbal particle ná ( high tone , as opposed to the low tone continuative particle ) . Future tense is marked by the particle wè . Simple sentences without a preverbal tense particle are interpreted as recent past ( sometimes called immediate ) . If aspect marking is absent , simple sentences are generally interpreted as completive . 
 kòfí ná sɛ ́ ( Kofi PAST go @-@ completive ) " Kofi went " — PAST 
 kòfí wè sɛ ́ ( Kofi FUTURE go @-@ completive ) " Kofi will go " — FUTURE 
 kòfí sɛ ́ ( Kofi go @-@ completive ) " Kofi just went " — RECENT PAST ( no marking ) 
 <unk> aspect ( sometimes called progressive ) denotes an action that is ongoing or repetitive . <unk> aspect is usually marked both by a preverbal particle nà ( low tone ) and by a change of the verb form . The verb sɛ ́ , " go " used in the sentences below has the continuative form síé . In sentences where both past tense particle ná and continuative particle nà are present , they combine to give the fused particle <unk> . In sentences in the recent past tense , the preverbal continuative particle is omitted and continuative aspect is shown only on the verb . 
 kòfí <unk> síé ( Kofi PAST + CONT go @-@ CONT ) " Kofi was going " — CONT + PAST 
 kòfí wè nà síé ( Kofi <unk> CONT go @-@ CONT ) " Kofi will be going " — CONT + FUTURE 
 kòfí síé ( Kofi go @-@ CONT ) " Kofi is going " — CONT + RECENT PAST 
 Two classes of verbs can be differentiated on the basis of their behaviour in <unk> marked sentences . One class of verbs has two <unk> distinct forms , as seen in the above example sentences . Another class of verbs does not distinguish aspect — one and the same form shows up in both completive and continuative aspect . In sentences in the recent past tense , this gives rise to ambiguity since the preverbal continuative particle is omitted there . Thus , the sentence kòfí blú can be interpreted in the following two ways : 
 kòfí blú ( Kofi swim @-@ CONT ) " Kofi is swimming " — CONT + RECENT PAST 
 kòfí blú ( Kofi swim @-@ completive ) " Kofi just swam " — RECENT PAST ( no marking ) 
 Considerable fusion takes place between pronominal subjects and the preverbal particles . For example , ná " PAST " fuses with pé , " they " , to produce <unk> sɛ ́ ( they @-@ PAST go @-@ completive ) , " they went " , and wè " FUTURE " fuses with pé in <unk> sɛ ́ ( they @-@ FUTURE go @-@ completive ) , " they will go " . 
 = = = Questions = = = 
 Questions can be formed in several ways in Nafaanra . Basic yes – no questions are constructed by adding a sentence @-@ final question marker <unk> . Constituent questions ( sometimes called Wh @-@ questions or question word questions ) are doubly marked . They contain a sentence @-@ initial question word and are marked with a sentence @-@ final question marker hin . 
 u pan <unk> ( he come Q ) " Has he come ? " — basic yes – no @-@ question 
 <unk> <unk> nya hin ( what he + PAST see Q ) " What did he see ? " — constituent question 
 = = = Numbers = = = 
 The cardinal numbers without tonal marking are presented below ; where possible , the tone pattern is added based on the list in Rapp . Some Supyire correlates are given for comparison . Numbers six to nine are derived by adding the numbers one to four to <unk> , " five " , by means of the conjunction na . 
 The numbers 11 – 19 are formed by adding 1 – 9 to 10 by means of the conjunction <unk> , e.g. <unk> , " eleven " , <unk> , " fifteen " . In the tens and higher , the Nafaanra and Supyire systems diverge . Multiplication of <unk> , " twenty , " and addition of <unk> , " ten " , ( by means of the conjunction ná ) is used to form the 30 – 90 tens . Perhaps surprisingly , there are considerable differences between Rapp ( 1933 ) and Jordan ( 1980 ) here . In Rapp 's 60 , 70 and 80 , <unk> seems to be used to mark ten , which conjoined with 6 , 7 and 8 forms 60 , 70 and 80 . 
 Rapp ( 1933 ) compares the Nafaanra numerals for three ( <unk> ) and hundred ( lafaa ) with eta and ke @-@ lafa from Mpre , a hitherto unclassified language from Ghana . It should be noted however that Mpre eta is Kwa @-@ like ( cf . Brong <unk> , Ga <unk> ) , whereas the Nafaanra form <unk> is transparently related to the forms found in the other ( non @-@ Kwa ) Senufo languages ( e.g. Supyire <unk> ) . Nafaanra lafaa " hundred " is a typical Kwa numeral and is most probably borrowed from one of the surrounding Kwa languages ( cf . <unk> <unk> , Gonja <unk> @-@ <unk> , Ewe <unk> ) . Rapp 's implication of affinity between Mpre and Nafaanra seems therefore unwarranted at this level . 
 <unk> alternations occur here and there , most notably the reduction of <unk> , " five " to kɔ ́ ɔ ̀ ( preserving the tone pattern ) and the change from lafaa to <unk> in the hundreds . 
 = = = Colour words = = = 
 The three basic colour words of Nafaanra are : <unk> , " black " , <unk> , " white " , and <unk> , " red " . As with adjectives in Senufo languages , the form of the colour words reflects the noun class of the noun that is modified . 
 <unk> — ki <unk> " it is black " 
 <unk> — ki <unk> " it is white " 
 <unk> — ki <unk> " it is red " 
 The cognate forms in closely related Supyire are <unk> , " red ; warm colored " , and <unk> , " white ; light colored " , in Supyire . These adjectives are related to the respective verbs <unk> ́ , " be white ; <unk> " and <unk> , " be red ; redden " , which in turn are causative forms of the now defunct verbs fini , " be white " and <unk> , " be red " .

 There is relatively little published on or in the Nafaanra language . The first linguistic publication to mention Nafaanra is <unk> ( 1904 ) , containing some notes on the Nafana people and a fairly extensive comparative Senufo word list , though it lacked any proper tonal marking . Rapp ( 1933 ) is an appendix to an article on the <unk> language containing a German @-@ Nafaanra ( Nafana @-@ <unk> ) word list of around 100 items , gathered during a stay of four hours at Sampa . Rapp notes in passing that special attention was paid to the marking of the tones . 
 After a period of silence on Nafaanra , Painter ( 1966 ) appeared , consisting of basic word lists of the Pantera and Fantera dialects . The SIL linguist Dean Jordan published an article on Nafaanra discourse in 1978 , and together with his wife Carol Jordan has produced a translation of the New Testament , which appeared in 1984 . <unk> @-@ <unk> 's 1980 West African language data sheets vol II contains a few pages on Nafaanra put together in the late seventies by Dean and Carol Jordan , including a phonology , a list of nouns , a list of pronouns , a list of numbers , and some example sentences ; tones are not marked . A more detailed phonology of Nafaanra by Jordan , also containing a Swadesh list , appeared in 1980 . Several books of Nafana folk tales have been published by the Summer Institute of Linguistics . Mensah and <unk> in their 1983 linguistic atlas of Ivory Coast include a comparative Senufo word list of about 120 items ; Nafaanra is present under the name " <unk> of <unk> " . An orthography of Nafaanra , lacking tonal marking , is included in <unk> ( 1993 ) . The area where Nafaanra is spoken has been the subject of recent archaeological @-@ anthropological studies ( Stahl 2004 ) . 
 = Women 's health in India = 
 Women 's health in India can be examined in terms of multiple indicators , which vary by geography , socioeconomic standing and culture . To adequately improve the health of women in India multiple dimensions of wellbeing must be analysed in relation to global health averages and also in comparison to men in India . Health is an important factor that contributes to human wellbeing and economic growth . 
 Currently , women in India face a multitude of health problems , which ultimately affect the aggregate economy ’ s output . Addressing the gender , class or ethnic disparities that exist in healthcare and improving the health outcomes can contribute to economic gain through the creation of quality human capital and increased levels of savings and investment . 
 = = Gender bias in access to healthcare = = 
 The United Nations ranks India as a middle @-@ income country . Findings from the World Economic Forum indicate that India is one of the worst countries in the world in terms of gender inequality . The 2011 United Nations Development Programme 's Human Development Report ranked India 132 out of 187 in terms of gender inequality . The value of this multidimensional indicator , Gender Inequality Index ( GII ) is determined by numerous factors including maternal mortality rate , adolescent fertility rate , educational achievement and labour force participation rate . Gender inequality in India is exemplified by women ’ s lower likelihood of being literate , continuing their education and participating in the labour force . 
 Gender is one of many social determinants of health — which include social , economic , and political factors — that play a major role in the health outcomes of women in India . Therefore , the high level of gender inequality in India negatively impacts the health of women . 
 The role that gender plays in health care access can be determined by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere . Gender discrimination begins before birth ; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India . If a female fetus is not aborted , the mother ’ s pregnancy can be a stressful experience , due to her family ’ s preference for a son . Once born , daughters are prone to being fed less than sons , especially when there are multiple girls already in the household . As women mature into adulthood , many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society , particularly in the rural and poverty @-@ affected areas . 
 The low status of — and subsequent discrimination against — women in India can be attributed to many cultural norms . Societal forces of patriarchy , hierarchy and multigenerational families contribute to Indian gender roles . Men use greater privileges and superior rights to create an unequal society that leaves women with little to no power . This societal structure is exemplified with women ’ s low participation within India ’ s national parliament and the labour force . 
 Women are also seen as less valuable to a family due to marriage obligations . Although illegal , Indian cultural norms often force payment of a dowry to the husband ’ s family . The higher future financial burden of daughters creates a power structure that favours sons in household formation . Additionally , women are often perceived as being incapable of taking care of parents in old age , which creates even greater preference for sons over daughters . 
 Taken together , women are oftentimes seen less valuable than men . With lower involvement in the public sphere — as exemplified by the labour and political participation rates — and the stigma of being less valuable within a family , women face a unique form of gender discrimination . 
 Gender inequalities , in turn , are directly related to poor health outcomes for women . Numerous studies have found that the rates of admission to hospitals vary dramatically with gender , with men visiting hospitals more frequently than women . Differential access to healthcare occurs because women typically are entitled to a lower share of household resources and thus utilise healthcare resources to a lesser degree than men . 
 Amartya Sen has attributed access to fewer household resources to their weaker bargaining power within the household . Furthermore , it has also been found that Indian women frequently underreport illnesses . The underreporting of illness may be contributed to these cultural norms and gender expectations within the household . Gender also dramatically influences the use of antenatal care and utilisation of <unk> . 
 A study by Choi in 2006 found that boys are more likely to receive <unk> than girls in rural areas . This finding has led researchers to believe that the sex of a child leads to different levels of health care being administered in rural areas . There is also a gender component associated with mobility . Indian women are more likely to have difficulty traveling in public spaces than men , resulting in greater difficulty to access services . 
 = = = Cooperative conflicts approach to gender biases = = = 
 Amartya Sen ’ s cooperative conflicts approach to gender biases frames women ’ s gender disadvantage through three different responses : breakdown wellbeing , perceived interest and perceived contribution responses . The breakdown well @-@ being response — derived from the Nash equilibrium — describes breakdown positions between individuals during cooperative decisions . When the breakdown position of one individual is less than the other person , the solution to any conflict will ultimately result in less favourable conditions for the first individual . In terms of women ’ s health in India , the overall gender disadvantage facing women — represented by cultural and societal factors that favour men over women — negatively impacts their ability to make decisions with regards to seeking out healthcare . 
 The perceived interest response describes the outcome of a bargained decision when one individual attaches less value to his or her well @-@ being . Any bargaining solution derived between the aforementioned individual and another individual will always result in a less favourable outcome for the person who attaches less value to their well @-@ being . The health status of women in India relates to the perceived interest response because of the societal and cultural practices that create an environment where the self @-@ worth of women is marginalised compared to men . Therefore , outcomes relating to healthcare decisions within households will favour the men , due to greater self @-@ worth . 
 The perceived contribution response describes the more favourable position of an individual when the individual ’ s contribution is perceived as contributing more to a group than other individuals . The more favourable perception gives the individual a better outcome in a bargaining solution . In terms of women ’ s health in India , males ’ perceived contribution to household productivity is higher than that of women , which ultimately affects the bargaining power that women have with regards to accessing healthcare . 
 = = Problems with India ’ s healthcare system = = 
 At the turn of the 21st Century India ’ s health care system is strained in terms of the number of healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses . The health care system is also highly concentrated in urban areas . This results in many individuals in rural areas seeking care from unqualified providers with varying results . It has also been found that many individuals who claim to be physicians actually lack formal training . Nearly 25 percent of physicians classified as allopathic providers actually had no medical training ; this phenomenon varies geographically . 
 Women are negatively affected by the geographic bias within implementation of the current healthcare system in India . Of all health workers in the country , nearly two thirds are men . This especially affects rural areas where it has been found that out of all doctors , only 6 percent are women . This translates into approximately 0 @.@ 5 female allopathic physicians per 10 @,@ 000 individuals in rural areas . 
 A disparity in access to maternal care between rural and urban populations is one of the ramifications of a highly concentrated urban medical system . According to Government of India National Family Health Survey ( NFHS II , 1998 @-@ 1999 ) the maternal mortality in rural areas is approximately 132 percent the number of maternal mortality in urban areas . 
 The Indian government has taken steps to alleviate some of the current gender inequalities . In 1992 , the government of India established the National Commission for Women . The Commission was meant to address many of the inequalities women face , specifically rape , family and guardianship . However , the slow pace of change in the judicial system and the aforementioned cultural norms have prevented the full adoption of policies meant to promote equality between men and women . 
 In 2005 India enacted the National Rural Health Mission ( NHRM ) . Some of its primary goals were to reduce infant mortality and also the maternal mortality ratio . Additionally , the NHRM aimed to create universal access to public health services and also balance the gender ratio . However , a 2011 research study conducted by Nair and Panda found that although India was able to improve some measures of maternal health since the enactment of the NHRM in 2005 , the country was still far behind most emerging economies .

 = = = Malnutrition and morbidity = = = 
 Nutrition plays a major role in and individual ’ s overall health ; psychological and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition . India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries . A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non @-@ pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron @-@ deficiency . One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources . 
 A 2012 study by <unk> have found the nutritional intake of early adolescents to be approximately equal . However , the rate of malnutrition increases for women as they enter adulthood . Furthermore , Jose et al. found that malnutrition increased for ever @-@ married women compared to non @-@ married women . 
 Maternal malnutrition has been associated with an increased risk of maternal mortality and also child birth defects . Addressing the problem of malnutrition would lead to beneficial outcomes for women and children . 
 = = = Breast cancer = = = 
 India is facing a growing cancer epidemic , with a large increase in the number of women with breast cancer . By the year 2020 nearly 70 percent of the world ’ s cancer cases will come from developing countries , with a fifth of those cases coming from India . 
 Much of the sudden increase in breast cancer cases is attributed to the rise in Westernisation of the country . This includes , but is not limited to , westernised diet , greater urban concentrations of women , and later child bearing . Additionally , problems with India ’ s health care infrastructure prevent adequate screenings and access for women , ultimately leading to lower health outcomes compared to more developed countries . As of 2012 , India has a shortage of trained oncologists and cancer centres , further straining the health care system . 
 = = = Reproductive health = = = 
 The lack of maternal health contributes to future economic disparities for mothers and their children . Poor maternal health often affects a child ’ s health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman ’ s ability to participate in economic activities . Therefore , national health programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission ( <unk> ) and the Family Welfare Programme have been created to address the maternal health care needs of women across India . 
 Although India has witnessed dramatic growth over the last two decades , maternal mortality remains stubbornly high in comparison to many developing nations As a nation , India contributed nearly 20 percent of all maternal deaths worldwide between 1992 and 2006 . The primary reasons for the high levels of maternal mortality are directly related to socioeconomic conditions and cultural constraints limiting access to care . 
 However , maternal mortality is not identical across all of India or even a particular state ; urban areas often have lower overall maternal mortality due to the availability of adequate medical resources . For example , states with higher literacy and growth rates tend to have greater maternal health and also lower infant mortality . 
 = = = = HIV / AIDS = = = = 
 As of July 2005 , women represent approximately 40 percent of the HIV / AIDS cases in India . The number of infections is rising in many locations in India ; the rise can be attributed to cultural norms , lack of education , and lack of access to contraceptives such as condoms . The government public health system does not provide adequate measures such as free HIV testing , only further worsening the problem . 
 Cultural aspects also increase the prevalence of HIV infection . The insistence of a woman for a man to use a condom could imply promiscuity on her part , and thus may hamper the usage of protective barriers during sex . Furthermore , one of the primary methods of contraception among women has historically been sterilisation , which does not protect against the transmission of HIV . 
 The current mortality rate of HIV / AIDS is higher for women than it is for men . As with other forms of women ’ s health in India the reason for the disparity is multidimensional . Due to higher rates of illiteracy and economic dependence on men , women are less likely to be taken to a hospital or receive medical care for health needs in comparison to men . This creates a greater risk for women to suffer from complications associated with HIV . There is also evidence to suggest that the presence of HIV / AIDS infection in a woman could result in lower or no marriage prospects , which creates greater stigma for women suffering from HIV / AIDS . 
 = = = = Reproductive rights = = = = 
 India legalised abortion through legislation in the early 1970s . However , access remains limited to cities . Less than 20 percent of health care centres are able to provide the necessary services for an abortion . The current lack of access is attributed to a shortage of physicians and lack of equipment to perform the procedure . 
 The most common foetus that is aborted in India is a female one . Numerous factors contribute to the abortion of female foetuses . For example , women who are highly educated and had a first @-@ born female child are the most likely to abort a female . The act of sex @-@ selective abortion has contributed to a skewed male to female ratio . As of the 2011 census , the sex ratio among children aged 0 – 6 continued a long trend towards more males . 
 The preference for sons over daughters in India is rooted in social , economic and religious reasons . Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non @-@ breadwinner status . Financial support , old age security , property inheritance , dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters . One of the main reasons behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters . Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter , which increases the cost associated with having a daughter . 
 = = = Cardiovascular health = = = 
 Cardiovascular disease is a major contributor to female mortality in India . Indians account for 60 % of the world 's heart disease burden , despite accounting for less than 20 % of the world 's population . Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue . Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes . One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care . For example , it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease , women were less likely to be operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable . 
 Furthermore , it was found that families failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories . A study conducted by <unk> et al. in 2011 found that out of 100 boys and girls with congenital heart disease , 70 boys would have an operation while only 22 girls will receive similar treatment . 
 The primary driver of this difference is due to cultural standards that give women little leverage in the selection of their partner . Elder family members must find suitable husbands for young females in the households . If women are known to have adverse previous medical histories , their ability to find a partner is significantly reduced . This difference leads to diverging health outcomes for men and women . 
 = = = Mental health = = = 
 Mental health consists of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression , stress and measurements of self @-@ worth . Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India , including older age , low educational attainment , fewer children in the home , lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use . There is also evidence to suggest that disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders . Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men . In turn , this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders . 
 One of the most common disorders that disproportionately affect women in low @-@ income countries is depression . Indian women suffer from depression at higher rates than Indian men . Indian women who are faced with greater degrees of poverty and gender disadvantage show a higher rate of depression . The difficulties associated with interpersonal relationships — most often marital relationships — and economic disparities have been cited as the main social drivers of depression . 
 It was found that Indian women typically describe the somatic symptoms rather than the emotional and psychological stressors that trigger the symptoms of depression . This often makes it difficult to accurately assess depression among women in India in light of no admonition of depression . Gender plays a major role in postnatal depression among Indian women . Mothers are often blamed for the birth of a female child . Furthermore , women who already have a female child often face additional pressures to have male children that add to their overall stress level . 
 Women in India have a lower onset of schizophrenia than men . However , women and men differ in the associated stigmas they must face . While men tend to suffer from occupational functioning , while women suffer in their marital functioning . The time of onset also plays a role in the stigmatisation of schizophrenia . Women tend to be diagnosed with schizophrenia later in life , oftentimes following the birth of their children . The children are often removed from the care of the ill mother , which may cause further distress . 
 = = = = Suicide = = = = 
 Indian women have higher rates of suicide than women in most developed countries . Women in India also have a higher rate of suicide compared to men . The most common reasons cited for women 's suicide are directly related to depression , anxiety , gender disadvantage and anguish related to domestic violence . 
 Many of the high rates of suicide found across India and much of south Asia have been correlated with gender disadvantage . Gender disadvantage is often expressed through domestic violence towards women . The suicide rate is particularly high among female sex workers in India , who face numerous forms of discrimination for their gender and line of work . 
 = = = Domestic violence = = = 
 Domestic violence is a major problem in India . Domestic violence — acts of physical , psychological , and sexual violence against women — is found across the world and is currently viewed as a hidden epidemic by the World Health Organisation . The effects of domestic violence go beyond the victim ; generational and economic effects influence entire societies . Economies of countries where domestic violence is prevalent tend to have lower female labour participation rate , in addition to higher medical expenses and higher rates of disability . 
 The prevalence of domestic violence in India is associated with the cultural norms of patriarchy , hierarchy , and multigenerational families . Patriarchal domination occurs when males use superior rights , privileges and power to create a social order that gives women and men differential gender roles . The resultant power structure leaves women as powerless targets of domestic violence . Men use domestic violence as a way of controlling behaviour . 
 In a response to the 2005 @-@ 2006 India National Family Health Survey III , 31 percent of all women reported having been the victims of physical violence in the 12 months preceding the survey . However , the actual number of victims may be much higher . Women who are victimised by domestic violence may underreport or fail to report instances . This may be due to a sense of shame or embarrassment stemming from cultural norms associated with women being subservient to their husbands . Furthermore , underreporting by women may occur in order to protect family honour . 
 A 2012 study conducted by <unk> , using data from the 2005 @-@ 2006 India National Family Health Survey III , found that domestic violence rates vary across numerous sociological , geographical and economic measures . The study found that the poorest women faired worst among middle and high @-@ income women . Researchers believe that the reason for higher rates of domestic violence come from greater familial pressures resulting from poverty . Additionally the study found that women who were part of the labour force faced greater domestic violence . According to the researchers , working women may be upsetting the patriarchal power system within Indian households . 
 Men may feel threatened by the earning potential and independence of women and react violently to shift the gender power structure back in their favour . One of the largest factors associated with domestic violence against women was the prevalence of alcohol use by men within the households . A 2005 study conducted by Pradeep Panda and Bina Agarwal found that the incidence of domestic violence against women dropped dramatically with women 's ownership of immovable property , which includes land and housing . 
 = John Frusciante = 
 John Anthony Frusciante ( / <unk> / ; born March 5 , 1970 ) is an American guitarist , singer , producer and composer . He is best known as the former guitarist of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers , from 1988 until 1992 , and again from 1998 until 2009 . He recorded five studio albums with them . 
 Frusciante has an active solo career , having released eleven solo albums and five EPs ; his recordings include elements ranging from experimental rock and ambient music to new wave and electronica . In 2015 , Frusciante released his debut acid house album under his alias , Trickfinger . He has also recorded with numerous other artists , including The Mars Volta , for whom he was a studio guitarist ( and occasional live performer ) from 2002 until 2008 ; Josh Klinghoffer and Joe Lally , with whom he released two albums as Ataxia ; and various collaborations with both Klinghoffer and Omar Rodríguez @-@ López . 
 At the age of eighteen , he joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers , first appearing on the band 's 1989 album , Mother 's Milk . The group 's follow @-@ up album , Blood Sugar Sex Magik ( 1991 ) , was a breakthrough success . Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band 's new popularity and quit in 1992 . He became a recluse and entered a long period of drug addiction , during which he released his first solo recordings : Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T @-@ Shirt ( 1994 ) and Smile from the Streets You Hold ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers . Their next album , Californication ( 1999 ) would eventually go on to sell 16 million copies . His album To Record Only Water for Ten Days was made in 2001 . A fourth album with the Chili Peppers , By the Way was released in 2002 . On a creative spree , Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004 ; each album explored different recording techniques and genres . 2006 saw the release of his fifth and final album with the Chili Peppers , Stadium Arcadium . In 2009 , Frusciante released The Empyrean , which features Flea and Josh Klinghoffer , and announced he had again parted ways with the Chili Peppers . 
 He has produced and / or recorded with Duran Duran , Wu @-@ Tang Clan , The Mars Volta and Omar Rodriguez Lopez , Swahili Blonde , Black Knights , The Bicycle Thief , Glenn Hughes , Ziggy Marley , Johnny Cash , George Clinton , and others . 
 Frusciante has received critical recognition for his guitar playing , ranking at number 18 on Rolling Stone 's list of " The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time " in 2003 ; and again in a second list published in 2011 , where he ranked at number 72 . He was ranked as number 42 in Gibson 's list of the " 50 Best Guitarists of All Time " . He was voted " The Best Guitarist of the Last 30 Years " in a 2010 BBC poll called " The Axe Factor " . Frusciante was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14 , 2012 although he did not attend the ceremony . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = 1970 – 1987 : Childhood and early life = = = 
 Frusciante was born in Queens , New York on March 5 , 1970 . His father , John Sr. , is a Juilliard @-@ trained pianist , and his mother Gail was a promising vocalist who gave up her career to be a stay @-@ at @-@ home mother . Frusciante 's family moved to Tucson , Arizona , and then Florida , where his father served as a Broward County judge until October 2010 . His parents separated , and he and his mother moved to Santa Monica , California . Frusciante is of Italian descent ; his paternal great @-@ grandfather <unk> Frusciante emigrated from Benevento . 
 A year later , Frusciante and his mother moved to Mar Vista , Los Angeles with his new stepfather who , he says , " really supported me and made me feel good about being an artist . " Like many young people in the area , he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene . At nine he was infatuated with the Germs , wearing out several copies of their record ( GI ) . By ten , he had taught himself how to play most of ( GI ) ' s songs . He has stated that he did not really know what he was doing , and that he would play every chord with a single @-@ finger barre . 
 Frusciante began studying guitarists like Jeff Beck , Jimmy Page , David Gilmour and Jimi Hendrix at eleven . He discovered Frank Zappa , whose work he would study for hours . Frusciante first heard of the Red Hot Chili Peppers around 1984 when his guitar instructor was auditioning as a guitarist for that band . He dropped out of high school at sixteen with the permission of his parents and completion of a proficiency test . With their support , he moved to Los Angeles in order to develop his musical proficiency . He began taking classes at the Guitar Institute of Technology , but turned to punching in without actually attending and left shortly thereafter . 
 = = = 1988 – 1992 : First term with the Red Hot Chili Peppers = = = 
 Frusciante first attended a Red Hot Chili Peppers performance at fifteen and he rapidly became a devoted fan . He idolized guitarist Hillel Slovak — familiarizing himself with virtually all the guitar and bass parts from the Chili Peppers ' first three records . He became acquainted with Slovak ; the two spoke months before Slovak 's death and Frusciante 's subsequent joining : 
 ... Hillel asked me , ' Would you still like the <unk> if they got so popular they played the Forum ? ' I said , ' No . It would ruin the whole thing . That 's great about the band , the audience feels no different from the band at all . ' There was this real kind of historical vibe at their shows , none of the frustration that runs through the audience when they jump around and can 't get out of their seat . I didn 't even watch the shows . I 'd get so excited that I 'd flip around the slam pit the whole time . I really felt like a part of the band , and all the sensitive people in the audience did too . 
 Frusciante became friends with former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro in early 1988 . They often jammed together , and Peligro invited his friend Flea ( bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers ) to join . Frusciante and Flea developed a musical chemistry immediately , with Flea later acknowledging that might have been the day he first played the bass riff to " Nobody Weird Like Me " . Around the same time , Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa 's band , but changed his mind before the final try @-@ out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use . Frusciante said , " I realized that I wanted to be a rock star , do drugs and get girls , and that I wouldn 't be able to do that if I was in Zappa 's band . " 
 Slovak died of a heroin overdose in 1988 , and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons , incapable of coping with Slovak 's death , left the group . Remaining members Flea and vocalist Anthony Kiedis regrouped , determined to persevere . The pair added Peligro on drums and DeWayne " <unk> " McKnight , formerly of P @-@ Funk , on guitar . McKnight , however , failed to connect musically within the group . Flea proposed auditioning Frusciante , whose intimate knowledge of the Chili Peppers ' repertoire impressed him . Flea and Kiedis auditioned him and agreed that he would be a suitable replacement for McKnight , who was promptly fired . When Flea called Frusciante with the news of his acceptance into the Chili Peppers , Frusciante was elated ; he ran through his house screaming with joy , and jumped on a wall , leaving permanent boot marks . He was considering a contract with Thelonious Monster at the time — and had actually been playing with the act for two weeks — but his unanticipated reception into the Chili Peppers prompted him to change his plans . 
 However , Frusciante was not familiar with the funk genre of Red Hot Chili Peppers ' sound : " I wasn 't really a funk player before I joined the band . I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [ Slovak 's ] playing and I just took it sideways from there . " Several weeks into the band 's new lineup , Peligro , whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse , was fired . Soon after , Chad Smith was added as the group 's new drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album , 1989 's Mother 's Milk . Frusciante focused on emulating Slovak 's signature style , rather than imposing his own personal style on the group . Producer Michael Beinhorn disagreed , and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic heavy metal tone , largely absent from the band 's three preceding records . Frusciante and Beinhorn fought frequently over guitar tone and layering , and Beinhorn 's idea ultimately prevailed as Frusciante felt pressured by the producer 's much greater knowledge of the studio . Kiedis recalls that " [ Beinhorn ] wanted John to have a big , crunching , almost metal @-@ sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid @-@ rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky , sexy , funky guitar tones . " 
 The Chili Peppers collaborated with producer Rick Rubin for their second record with Frusciante , Blood Sugar Sex Magik . Rubin felt that it was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting , so he suggested an old Hollywood Hills mansion , and the band agreed . Frusciante , Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording . Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside , and spent most of their time smoking marijuana . Around this time , Frusciante started a side collaboration with Flea and Jane 's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins called The Three <unk> . They recorded roughly ten to fifteen hours of material , none of which has ever been released . 
 Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely successful upon its release on September 24 , 1991 . It peaked at number three on the Billboard charts , and went on to sell thirteen million copies worldwide . The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars . Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame , and struggled to cope with it . Soon after the album 's release , he began to develop a dislike for the band 's popularity . Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts : " John would say , ' We 're too popular . I don 't need to be at this level of success . I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago . ' " Frusciante later said that the band 's rise to popularity was " too high , too far , too soon . Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn 't cope with it . " He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band . When the Chili Peppers began their world tour , he started to hear voices in his head telling him " you won 't make it during the tour , you have to go now . " Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism ; however , " by the age of twenty , I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls . To balance it out , I had to be extra @-@ humble , extra @-@ anti @-@ rock star . " He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo 's Club Quattro on May 7 , 1992 , telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band . He was persuaded to perform , but left for California the next morning ; according to the guitarist , " it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer . It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band , it felt like I was forced out of the band . Not by any members in particular or management in particular , but just the direction it was going . " He was replaced by former Jane 's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro . 
 In a 2015 interview , Cris Kirkwood said that following Frusciante 's departure from the Chili Peppers in 1992 he auditioned for his band the Meat Puppets . Kirkwood said " “ He showed up with his guitar out of its case and barefoot . We were on a major label then , we just got signed , and those guys had blown up to where they were at and John needed to get out . John gets to our pad and we started getting ready to play and I said , ‘ You want to use my tuner ? ’ He said , ‘ No , I ’ ll bend it in . ’ It was so far out . Then we jammed but it didn ’ t come to anything . Maybe he wasn ’ t in the right place and we were a tight little unit . It just didn ’ t quite happen but it could have worked . " 
 = = = 1992 – 1997 : Drug addiction = = = 
 Frusciante developed serious drug habits while touring with the band during the previous four years . He said that when he " found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show , that inspired me to be a pothead " . Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana , but he began to use heroin and was on the verge of full @-@ scale addiction . Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992 , Frusciante entered a deep depression , feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar . For a long time , he focused on painting , producing 4 @-@ track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik , and writing short stories and screenplays . To cope with his worsening depression , Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life @-@ threatening dependency . His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision : " I was very sad , and I was always happy when I was on drugs ; therefore , I should be on drugs all the time . I was never guilty — I was always really proud to be an addict . " Frusciante openly admitted to being a " junkie " , believing that drugs were the only way of " making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul . " 
 In October 1993 , River Phoenix came to stay with Frusciante and the duo went on a long drug binge together , doing a lot of drugs and barely sleeping . According to Bob Forrest , the two arrived at The Viper Room together on October 31 , 1993 and continued to do drugs . Shortly after their arrival , Phoenix went into seizures and was rushed by ambulance ( accompanied by Flea ) to the hospital where he died of a drug overdose . 
 Frusciante released his first solo album Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T @-@ Shirt , on March 8 , 1994 . Despite the common belief that most of the tracks were recorded while he was strung out on heroin in his home in the Hollywood Hills , Frusciante has said that " That album was not recorded when I was a heroin addict . It was released when I was a heroin addict . " 
 The first half of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T @-@ Shirt was recorded shortly after the completion of Blood Sugar Sex Magik ; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992 , during the album 's tour . " Running Away Into You " is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers . The album is a heavily experimental avant @-@ garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression : " I wrote [ the record ] because I was in a really big place in my head — it was a huge , spiritual place telling me what to do . As long as I 'm obeying those forces , it 's always going to be meaningful . I could be playing guitar and I could say ' Play something that sucks , ' and if I 'm in that place , it 's gonna be great . And it has nothing to do with me , except in ways that can 't be understood . " Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs . Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T @-@ Shirt was released on Rick Rubin 's label American Recordings . Warner Bros. , the Chili Peppers ' label , owned rights to the album because of the leaving @-@ artist clause in Frusciante 's Chili Peppers contract . However , because he was reclusive , the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin , who released the album at the urging of Frusciante 's friends . 
 An article in the New Times LA described Frusciante as " a skeleton covered in thin skin " who at the nadir of his addictions nearly died from a blood infection . His arms became fiercely scarred from improperly shooting heroin and cocaine , leaving permanent abscesses . He spent the next three years holed up in his Hollywood Hills home , the walls of which were badly damaged and covered in graffiti . During this time , his friends Johnny Depp and Gibby Haynes went to his house and filmed a documentary short called Stuff , depicting the squalor in which he was living . The house was eventually destroyed by a fire that claimed his vintage guitar collection along with several recorded tapes of music . 
 Frusciante released his second solo album , Smile from the Streets You Hold , in 1997 . The album 's first track , " Enter a Uh " , was largely characterized by cryptic lyrics and hysterical screeches . Frusciante also coughs throughout the track , showcasing his deteriorating health . By his own admission , the album was released in order to get " drug money " ; he withdrew it from the market in 1999 . The album is also notable for including a recording called " Height Down " which features River Phoenix . 
 = = = 1998 – 2002 : Rehabilitation and return to the Chili Peppers = = = 
 In late 1996 , after more than five years of addiction to heroin , Frusciante quit it cold turkey . However , months later he was still unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol . In January 1998 , urged by longtime friend Bob Forrest , Frusciante checked into Las <unk> , a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena , to begin a full recovery . Upon arrival , he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection , which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants . He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms . About a month later , Frusciante checked out of Las <unk> and re @-@ entered society . 
 Fully recovered and once again healthy , Frusciante began living a more spiritual , ascetic lifestyle . He changed his diet , becoming more health @-@ conscious and eating mostly unprocessed foods . Through regular practice of <unk> and yoga , he discovered the effect that self @-@ discipline has on the body . To maintain his increased spiritual awareness and reduce distraction from his music , Frusciante decided to abstain from sexual activity stating : " I 'm very well without it . " All of these changes in his life have led him to a complete change in his attitude toward drugs : 
 I don 't need to take drugs . I feel so much more high all the time right now because of the type of momentum that a person can get going when you really dedicate yourself to something that you really love . I don 't even consider doing them , they 're completely silly . Between my dedication to trying to constantly be a better musician and eating my health foods and doing yoga , I feel so much more high than I did for the last few years of doing drugs . 
 At this point I 'm the happiest person in the world . These things do not fuck with me at all , and I 'm so proud of that — you don 't know how proud I am . It 's such a beautiful thing to be able to face life , to face yourself , without hiding behind drugs ; without having to have anger towards people who love you . There are people who are scared of losing stuff , but you don 't lose anything for any other reason than if you just give up on yourself . 
 Despite his experience as an addict , Frusciante does not view his drug use as a " dark period " in his life . He considers it a period of rebirth , during which he found himself and cleared his mind . Frusciante has since stopped practicing yoga , due to its effects on his back , but he still tries to meditate daily . 
 In early 1998 , the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro and were on the verge of breaking up . Flea told Kiedis , " the only way I could imagine carrying on [ with the Red Hot Chili Peppers ] is if we got John back in the band . " With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments , Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back . When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band , Frusciante began sobbing and said " nothing would make me happier in the world . " With Frusciante back on guitar , the Chili Peppers began recording their next album , Californication , released in 1999 . Frusciante 's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers ' sound , as well as a healthy morale . He brought with him his deep devotion to music , which had an impact on the band 's recording style during the album . Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite . 
 During the Californication world tour , Frusciante continued to compose his own songs , many of which would be released in 2001 on his third solo album To Record Only Water for Ten Days . The album was stylistically unlike his previous records , less markedly stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness or avant @-@ garde . However , the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down . The songwriting and production of To Record Only Water for Ten Days were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings . The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on Californication , focusing more on electronic and new wave elements . In addition to his guitar work , Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers , a distinctive feature of the record . 
 In 2001 , Frusciante began recording his fourth album with Red Hot Chili Peppers , By the Way ( 2002 ) ; he considered the time to be among the happiest in his life . He relished the chance the album gave him to " keep writing better songs " . While working on By the Way , he also composed most of what would become Shadows Collide with People , as well as the songs created for the movie The Brown Bunny . His goal to improve his guitar playing on the album was largely driven by a desire to emulate guitar players such as Andy Partridge , Johnny Marr and John McGeoch ; or as he put it , " people who used good chords " . The album marked Frusciante 's shift to a more group @-@ minded mentality within the Chili Peppers , viewing the band as a cohesive unit rather than as four separate entities . 
 = = = 2002 – 2007 : The Mars Volta , 2004 recordings and Stadium Arcadium = = = 
 Frusciante wrote and recorded a plethora of songs during and after the By the Way tour . In February 2004 , he started a side project with Joe Lally of Fugazi and Josh Klinghoffer , called Ataxia . The group was together for about two weeks , during which they recorded about ninety minutes of material . After two days in the recording studio , they played two shows at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood , and spent two more days in the studio before disbanding . Later that year , five songs provided by Frusciante appeared on The Brown Bunny soundtrack . 
 Frusciante released his fourth full @-@ length solo album Shadows Collide with People on February 24 , 2004 . This featured guest appearances from some of his friends , including Klinghoffer , and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea . In June 2004 , he announced that he would be releasing six records over six months : The Will to Death , Ataxia 's Automatic Writing , DC EP , Inside of Emptiness , A Sphere in the Heart of Silence and Curtains . With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004 , for the track " The Past <unk> " . He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape , avoiding modern studio and computer @-@ assisted recording processes . Frusciante noted , " These six records were recorded in a period of six months after coming home from touring with the Chili Peppers for one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years . I made a list of all the songs I had and they totaled about seventy . My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that I had . In the midst of doing that , I was writing some of my best songs , so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs . It was definitely the most productive time of my life . " 
 In early 2005 , Frusciante entered the studio to work on his fifth and final studio album with the Chili Peppers , Stadium Arcadium . His guitar playing is dominant throughout the album , and he provides backing vocals on most of the tracks . Although usually following a " less is more " style of guitar playing , he began using a full twenty @-@ four track mixer for maximum effect . In the arrangements , he incorporates a wide array of sounds and playing styles , similar to the funk @-@ influenced Blood Sugar Sex Magik or the more melodic By the Way . He also changed his approach to his playing , opting to contribute solos and allow songs to be formed from jam sessions . In an interview from Guitar World , Frusciante explained how he approached his guitar solos for their album Stadium Arcadium completely differently from those for their previous albums . On Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication , Frusciante had a general idea how he wanted his guitar solos to sound . For Stadium Arcadium , almost every guitar solo was completely improvised by Frusciante on the spot . Several reviews have stressed that the influence of Hendrix is evident in his solos on the album , with Frusciante himself backing this up . He also expanded the use of guitar effects throughout the album , and used various other instruments such as the synthesizer and mellotron . He worked continuously with Rubin over @-@ dubbing guitar progressions , changing harmonies and using all his technical resources . 
 Frusciante began a series of collaborations with friend Omar Rodríguez @-@ López and his band The Mars Volta , by contributing guitar and electronic instrumentation to song " <unk> ESP " off their album De @-@ <unk> in the <unk> . He also contributed guitar solos on their 2005 album Frances the Mute . In 2006 , he helped The Mars Volta complete their third album <unk> by playing guitar on seven of its eight tracks . In return , Rodriguez @-@ Lopez has played on several of Frusciante 's solo albums , as well as making a guest appearance on Stadium Arcadium .

 Ataxia released its second and final studio album , AW II in 2007 . Following the Stadium Arcadium tour ( early May 2006 to late August 2007 ) , the Red Hot Chili Peppers agreed to a hiatus of indefinite length . In early 2008 , Anthony Kiedis finally confirmed this , citing exhaustion from constant work since Californication as the main reason . Frusciante quit the group on July 29 , 2009 , but did not publicly announce his departure until December 2009 , two months after the band ended their hiatus in October 2009 and began work on their next album with Josh Klinghoffer as their new guitarist . 
 Frusciante 's tenth solo album , The Empyrean , was released on January 20 , 2009 through Record Collection . The record — a concept album — was in production between December 2006 and March 2008 .

Frusciante stated : " I 'm really happy with [ the record ] and I 've listened to it a lot for the psychedelic experience it provides , " suggesting the album is " to be played as loud as possible and is suited to dark living rooms late at night . "

I can ’ t imagine that he would , but it ’ s a ' you never know ' kind of thing . I haven ’ t talked to him in quite a while . I don ’ t know where he ’ s at these days . He ’ ll obviously be more than welcome , and embraced if he does . If he doesn ’ t , that ’ s cool too . " Flea also spoke about Frusciante by saying " He left us so many great gifts .

 After his departure from the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Frusciante became more serious about his longtime dream to make electronic music . As he explained on his blog , " I started to learn how to program all the instruments we associate with Acid House music and some other hardware . [ ... ] Then I started recording , playing 10 or so synced machines through a small mixer into a CD burner . This was all experimental Acid House , my skills at making rock music playing no part in it whatsoever . I had lost interest in traditional songwriting and I was excited about finding new methods for creating music . " During that time Frusciante began an electronic trio with Aaron Funk and Chris McDonald under the name Speed Dealer Moms . Their first EP was released in December 2010 on Planet Mu Records . 
 In an interview with Blare Magazine Omar Rodriguez @-@ Lopez , when asked about possible future collaborations with John , stated : " Maybe in the future , but John ’ s in a different place right now . He ’ s in a place where he couldn ’ t care less about putting things out or about something being a product . He ’ s living by different standards right now with a different philosophy , so he doesn ’ t want to be a part of anything that he knows is going to end up being a product . A Mars Volta record definitely ends up being a product " . 
 Frusciante released a new EP on July 17 , 2012 , entitled Letur @-@ Lefr . As with his previous solo releases , it was released through Record Collection Music . Recorded in 2010 , Letur @-@ Lefr marked a clear departure from guitar @-@ driven sound of Frusciante 's previous albums and combined elements of abstract electronica , pop and hip hop .

Prior to that , on the 16th of August , he also released a free download of the non @-@ album song " Walls and Doors " . 
 Frusciante 's new musical approach met a mixed response from fans and critics . AllMusic 's Fred Thomas in his review of PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone stated : " The ever @-@ winding path of John Frusciante 's solo career is a confusing one to say the least . [ ... ] The thing is , there 's no doubt that Frusciante is sincere in his expression with this incredibly warped music . There 's no easy explanation for these sounds , no context for a lot of the choices he makes with the rapid @-@ fire style changes and jarring production choices that come one after another after another on almost every song here . " 
 Frusciante released an instrumental song named " Wayne " on April 7 , 2013 through his website which was written and dedicated to the memory of his late friend , former Red Hot Chili Peppers ' tour chef Wayne Forman . <unk> , his fifth EP , was released on August 14 , 2013 in Japan , and on August 27 , 2013 worldwide .
