 Herbert Jeffrey " Jeff " Wooller ( born 6 March 1940 ) is an English accountant and educationalist . He is noted for his accountancy tuition initiatives , and for campaigning for reform of his professional institute , the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales . The institute eventually excluded him from its membership because of his association with the Irish International University , Irish University Business School and International University Business School . Wooller has founded several educational institutions such as the Jeff Wooller College , Institute of Professional Financial Managers and Irish University Business School . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Born in Yorkshire , Wooller attended <unk> Upper School and <unk> Grammar School . He began his career as a banker , which took him to Bangladesh and Pakistan . When he returned to Yorkshire , he took a job with Peat Marwick , an accounting firm . In 1970 , Wooller attended the London School of Economics to take a two @-@ year Master of Science in accounting and finance . After the course ended in 1972 , he went to Cass Business School and received a Doctor of Philosophy . At Cass Business School , Wooller together with Dr Peter Grinyer conducted extensive research into the corporate models of projects sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales . 
 In January 1974 , he was appointed technical editor of Accountancy , with special responsibilities in industry and commerce . He created the " Students forum " section of Accountancy and also edited the " Students ask " section . He is also a former editor of The Treasurer , the monthly journal of the Association of Corporate Treasurers and contributed to Accounting and Business Research . He has previously worked as a management accountant with Tate & Lyle plc and Imperial Chemical Industries . On 2 November 1987 , Wooller was appointed editor of The Accountant . 
 In the 1980s , Wooller set up referral courses in the United Kingdom costing £ 500 , which were offered on a " no pass no fee " basis provided the student had completed a 200 @-@ hour work programme and a minimum of 10 tests . In 1985 , Wooller called for an appeals procedure to be implemented for students who were unsuccessful in getting an extension to the normal time limit for completing examinations . 
 In 2007 , Wooller lost his membership as an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Financial Accountants after appearing on television . He had made statements that discredited the professional body and accountancy . 
 = = Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales = = 
 Wooller was a dissident member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales ( ICAEW ) . In 1991 , Wooller accused the ICAEW of having built @-@ in bias when it marked examinations during a recession , and used PE II ( Professional Education II ) results to show the bias . Wooller was fined by the ICAEW in 1995 for promoting unaccredited MBA courses . Wooller formed a ginger group when the ICAEW tried to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants ( CIMA ) in 1995 . Wooller 's ginger group opposed many of the actions of the ICAEW . The merger was shelved after the majority of the ICAEW members voted against it . The ginger group decided to keep fighting for democratic reforms and in June 1996 , demanded that the executive of the ICAEW be elected directly by the 109 @,@ 000 members of the body , instead of by the ICAEW 's council of seventy members . A year later , Wooller demanded that members of the ICAEW be allowed to vote on Peter Gerrard 's key constitutional reform proposals , and Wooller 's motion failed by 1 @,@ 400 votes , including proxies . 
 In April 1998 , Wooller claimed that the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his campaign to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998 . Wooller 's first motion was about electing the president of the ICAEW democratically by ballot . The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report . The second motion said the district societies should be self @-@ financing and the third motion was on reducing the number of council members to fifty @-@ three . The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison , and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison 's quotation after he objected to being quoted . The ICAEW asked members to vote on an increase in the number of council members from seventy @-@ five after requests made in the Gerrard report . Wooller asked members to reduce the number of council members to fifty @-@ three , which was recommended by the Gerrard report as the ideal council quota . A 54 % majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller 's motion to reduce the number . 
 Another merger was proposed , this time between the ICAEW , CIMA , and <unk> . Wooller said that his ginger group was " on full alert to mobilise against any proposed merger . " He also said that " we have all made huge sacrifices to become ICAEW members . We could all easily have taken CIMA or <unk> without having to make any sacrifices " , believing that differing standards of education were the greatest obstacle . Wooller also said that if the merger was to go ahead , the council of the super @-@ institute could change the accounting examinations system and qualifications . The merger between the three institutes never took place . 
 The ICAEW received praise from Wooller for its efforts to promote the ACA ( ICAEW Chartered Accountant ) qualification in China in 2007 . In a letter to Accountancy Age , Wooller went on to say that " there is also huge potential for our qualification in India and Eastern Europe . " Wooller was excluded from the ICAEW in October 2009 after acting as the vice @-@ chancellor of the Irish International University , Irish University Business School and International University Business School and not stopping it from confusing students or employers . He was not present at his disciplinary tribunal and had made no final written submissions to the tribunal .

 = Portrait of Madame Cézanne = 
 Portrait of Madame Cézanne ( sometimes Portrait of Mrs. Cézanne ) is a 1962 Pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein . It is a quotation of Erle Loran 's diagram of a Cézanne painting of the same name . It was one of the works exhibited at Lichtenstein 's first solo exhibition in Los Angeles . The work became controversial in that it led to a reconsideration of what constitutes art . 
 Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press , and art critics were intrigued by the viewpoints of the two . Loran 's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work , and at one point filed suit . Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram . The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein 's work , but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word . 
 = = Background = = 
 Portrait of Madame Cézanne was exhibited along with works such as Man with Folded Arms at <unk> 's first Pop exhibition in Los Angeles . The linear twice @-@ removed black @-@ and @-@ white ( along with Man with Folded Arms ) is regarded as a quotation of Erle Loran 's outline diagram of Cézanne 's compositional methods published in a diagram book called Cézanne 's Composition . The book was popular in the academic community . Loran 's representation in a " harsh black outline " depicted the axes of the composition without representing the " texture and expressiveness of Cézanne 's original . " In fact , Loran stated that " this diagrammatic approach may seem coldly analytical to those who like vagueness and poetry in art criticism . " Loran 's diagrammatic techniques were standard at the time ; redrawn outlines of the figure were illustrated with alphabetized arrows to identify areas and directions . The diagram highlighted body part positioning without studying the painted surface . 
 According to John <unk> 's Roy Lichtenstein , the artist was fascinated by the drawings : " isolating the woman out of the context of the painting seemed to Lichtenstein to be such an oversimplification of a complex issue as to be ironical in itself " ; the oversimplification referred to was Loran 's representing Cézanne 's work with nothing more than black lines . The work marked the first of Lichtenstein 's " artistic appropriations of the canonical works of Modernism " that resulted from his realization of the interrelation " between avant @-@ garde and kitsch " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The two images garnered attention among critics by highlighting the nuances between copying and creating art , between real and fake art . As Andy Warhol challenged the status quo by " humanizing mass @-@ produced product " , Lichtenstein dehumanized masterpieces . This demonstrates " that the quotation of popular culture was not the sign of intelligence suspended but rather the shape of thought . " 
 The publication of this work was considered by some observers as more sacrilegious than Duchamp 's revisions to the Mona Lisa . Loran wrote two hot @-@ tempered letters in response . In September 1963 issues of ARTnews and Artforum , His articles were written after Lichtenstein 's first Pop exhibition in Los Angeles , which featured the two life @-@ sized works depicting Loran 's images . Loran , whose text was by this time over twenty years old , even attempted to sue Lichtenstein . According to David <unk> , " The angrier of the two tracts appeared in Art News , where Loran openly expressed his contempt for Lichtenstein 's work and hinted at his desire to sue . " : 
 In a recent sell @-@ out exhibition at the Ferus Gallery , Los Angeles , he [ Lichtenstein ] gave the title of Portrait of Mme. Cézanne to the black and white line drawing on bare canvas reproduced here . Sale price : $ 2000 , or more . I suppose I should be flattered that a diagrammatic sketch of mine should be worth so much . But then , no one has paid me anything — so far . 
 One critic noted that although Loran was making instructive points with his diagram , Lichtenstein 's was an artistic statement . However , Loran was joined by Brian O 'Doherty , a critic with The New York Times , in ridiculing the defense of Pop art as transformative rather than <unk> art . In 1963 , O 'Doherty wrote his belief that Lichtenstein 's work was not art in The New York Times saying , he was " one of the worst artists in America " who " briskly went about making a sow 's ear out of a sow 's ear . " Loran felt Pop art paled in comparison to the aesthetics of Abstract Expressionism . Lichtenstein did not accept the transformation defense . Other critics got involved in the matter , with Gene Swenson querying Lichtenstein " about the charges of antagonistic critics ' that Pop Art does not transform its models . " Lichtenstein responded that art forms but does not transform . Max <unk> opined that Loran was being mocked and that while Lichtenstein 's product had didactic content , its purpose and need was questionable . <unk> worried in The Nation that Lichtenstein 's work may lead to the values that modern art held being rejected moving forward . 
 The painting is regarded as " another of his comments on the way in which we view art . " The work , along with his Femme au <unk> from 1962 mark the beginnings of Lichtenstein 's presentations of art about art because it was among his first paintings that drew upon a predecessor artist . Lichtenstein noted his objection to the attempt to reduce art diagrammatically : " I wasn 't trying to berate Erle Loran ... but it is such an oversimplification trying to explain a painting by A , B , C. " He also noted that " The Cézanne is such a complex painting . Taking an outline and calling it Madame Cézanne is in itself humorous , particularly the idea of <unk> a Cézanne when Cézanne said , ' ... the outline escaped me . ' " 
 Lichtenstein obtained legal validation that his work was original when Loran 's lawsuit was dismissed , clearing the way for artists to elaborate on images produced by others .

 Richard L. Rice married Helen Hart in 1932 and the couple began rock collecting in 1938 after finding agates along the Oregon Coast . In 1952 the Rices built a new home north of Hillsboro on 30 acres ( 12 @.@ 1 ha ) that would later house the museum . The Rices founded a museum in 1953 to display their collections . Their collections won them the Woodruff Trophy three years in a row at the Tucson Gem & Mineral Show , which led to that trophy 's retirement . Helen served as president of the American Federation of Mineralogical Societies from 1959 to 1960 . 
 In 1996 the Rices established the non @-@ profit museum . Richard and Helen Rice both died in 1997 with the home passing to the non @-@ profit museum as part of their estate . In 1997 the Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals officially opened . In June 2000 , 94 pieces from the F. John Barlow collection of crystallized gold were added to the museum . The facility opened an exhibit in 2001 dedicated to the lapidary arts , and by that time the museum had grown to more than 4 @,@ 000 items .

That year it was honored by PlanSponsor Magazine with the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Global Pensions magazine Currency Manager of the Year award and the Money Management Letters , Public Pension Fund Award for Excellence and the Alternatives Manager of the Year award . 
 By 2007 , the firm 's total assets under management grew to US $ 50 billion ( from US $ 33 billion in the year 2000 ) . According to a 2007 article in Barron 's magazine , " nobody was better prepared for the global market crash " than its clients and subscribers to its Daily Observations . The company " began sounding alarms .. in the spring of 2007 about the dangers of excessive financial leverage " . The company 's researchers reviewed the public accounts of most of the major financial institutions around the globe and found that estimated future losses due to bad debts totaled US $ 839 billion . In December , these conclusions were reported to the U.S. Treasury Department when company founder Ray Dalio met with U.S. Treasury Secretary staff and other White House economic advisers . Bridgewater 's Pure Alpha fund " spared its investors " from most of the stock market 's " meltdown " in 2008 . However , this strategy was not successful in 2009 when economic growth responded faster than anticipated and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 19 % while the company ’ s Pure Alpha fund reportedly gained a mere 2 % to 4 % . Senator John McCain visited the firm and addressed company employees during his 2008 presidential campaign . The Teacher Retirement System of Texas ( TRS ) invested in $ 250 million in a stake in Bridgewater Associates Intermediate Holdings , LP . 
 Ray Dalio , the company 's founder , began using the term " d @-@ process " in February 2009 , to describe the deleveraging and deflationary process of the subprime mortgage industry as distinct from a recession . That year , the company was termed the largest hedge fund in the U.S. and it received the Alternative Investment News 7th Annual Hedge Fund Industry 's Lifetime Achievement award and PlanSponsor 's Hedge Fund Manager of the year award . When the U.S. gross domestic product faltered in 2010 , the firm had significant gains on their investments in Treasury bonds and other securities , and in November founded the US $ 10 billion , Pure Alpha Major Markets fund which brought the company 's total assets under management to more than US $ 100 billion . In 2011 the firm received several honors . It was ranked number one on Institutional Investor 's " world 's top 100 hedge funds " list . It received the Macro @-@ Focused Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award and the <unk> Hedge Fund Industry Innovation Award . Absolute Return + Alpha ( AR ) ranked the company number one in its Hedge Fund Report Card and Billion Dollar Club categories . 
 Connecticut is expected to approve a plan at the end of May , 2016 , which will give Bridgewater Associates $ 22 million in grants and loans in exchange for job training , job creation , and building renovations . The company also must agree to retain 1 @,@ 402 jobs they already support in Connecticut . The company could also become eligible for as much as $ 30 million in urban tax credits . 
 = = Investment philosophy = = 
 According to Ray Dalio , Bridgewater Associates is a " global macro firm " . It uses " quantitative " investment methods to identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models . Its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations , rather than asset allocations . Additionally , the company is reported to only accept funds from institutional clients such as pension funds , foundations , endowments , and central banks rather than private investors . 
 = = = Separation of alpha and beta = = = 
 The company divides its investments into two basic categories : ( 1 ) Beta investments , whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk , and ( 2 ) Alpha investments , whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed . The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year 2000 . The firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each . 
 = = = Systematic diversification = = = 
 According to Bloomberg Bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with " wager [ s ] on or against markets around the world " and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not " move in lock step " with each other . To guide its investment strategies , the company 's top executives have compiled hundreds of " decision rules " , which are the financial corollary to the firm 's employee handbook , Principles , and these investment guidelines have been incorporated into the firm 's computer 's analysis .

 The firm offers three hedge funds to its clients : the Pure Alpha fund , the All Weather fund and the Pure Alpha Major Markets fund . It also publishes a white paper , called the Daily Observations , which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis . 
 = = = Pure Alpha = = = 
 Bridgewater Associates launched its flagship fund , Pure Alpha , in 1989 . The fund is described as a " diversified alpha source " that invests across a group of asset classes . It was designed to balance risk among a variety of non @-@ correlated assets through active management . It includes 30 or 40 simultaneous trading positions in bonds , currencies , stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area . After placing some of the company 's excess cash into the Pure Alpha hedge fund to increase its " investing discretion " . The fund was closed to new investors in 2006 when it reached its pre @-@ determined , maximum funds level . As of 2011 , the fund is reported to have lost money in only three of its 20 years of existence and had an average annualized return of 18 % . The success of Pure Alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes . 
 = = = All Weather = = = 
 A second fund , called All Weather , was launched in 1996 and highlighted low fees , global inflation @-@ linked bonds and global fixed @-@ income investments . The fund began as the founder 's personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients . The goal of the fund was to create " high , risk adjusted returns " that exceeded the return of the general market . The All Weather fund contains more than US $ 46 billion and is one of the largest funds in the U.S. as of 2011 . In April 2009 , after the collapse of Lehman Brothers , the fund moved into " safe portfolio " mode which included nominal and inflation @-@ linked bonds and gold instead of equities , emerging market debt , and commodities . The fund is reported to contain : 30 % Stocks ( for instance , the S & P 500 or other indexes for further diversification in this basket ) 15 % Intermediate Term Treasuries <unk> ( 7- to 10 @-@ year Treasuries ) 40 % Long Term Treasuries TLT [ 20- to 25 @-@ year Treasuries ] 7 @.@ 5 % Gold IAU 7 @.@ 5 % Commodities

 Under the guidance of co @-@ CEO , Jensen , the firm created the Pure Alpha Major Markets in 2011 with US $ 2 @.@ 4 billion from existing clients . In the summer of 2011 the fund was opened to a group of outside investors who had made a total advance commitment of US $ 7 @.@ 5 billion . At that time , it was reported to be the largest hedge fund launch . The fund was established to provide an investment vehicle similar to the company 's Pure Alpha fund but with enhanced liquidity by focusing on the major markets such as European bonds . The launch of this fund in 2011 brought the company ’ s total assets under management to more than US $ 100 billion .

 The company 's " Daily Observations " is a subscription white paper and was the flagship product and service offered by the company . It has been characterized as comprehensive , with some editions being up to 43 pages in length and is reported to be " one of the most widely forwarded pieces of market analysis " in the industry . It has been read by leaders of central banks , managers of global pension funds as well as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy <unk> and President Barack Obama .

 In 1981 , the company moved its headquarters 50 miles north of New York City to Wilton , Connecticut , and in the late 1990s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in Westport , Connecticut . As the company continued to expand , it became the sole tenant at the 22 @-@ acre campus . The firm 's headquarters is described as retreat @-@ like and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve . The campus contains three buildings made of " midcentury modern fieldstone and glass " . Since 2000 its staff has grown from 100 to 1200 employees and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area . In an effort to consolidate its offices , the company made plans to build a 750 @,@ 000 square foot headquarters in Stamford , CT about 15 miles from its present location in Westport , but cancelled the project in 2014 . 
 = = = Employees = = = 
 Bridgewater Associates grew from 100 employees in 2003 to 1 @,@ 200 employees in 2011 . The company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from Ivy League schools such as Yale University , Harvard University , Princeton University , Cornell University , Brown University , Columbia University , Dartmouth College , and the University of Pennsylvania . Employees are transported daily in a " fancy " bus that ferries them from Manhattan to the company 's Westport offices . According to an article in Bloomberg , " about a quarter of all new hires " leave within the first two years . Those that remain are reported to receive " generous " compensation and form bonds with fellow employees that are " like family " and the company 's founder helps to pay for any employees that wish to learn the Transcendental Meditation technique . 
 Dalio , the founder , relinquished his chief executive officer ( CEO ) title in July 2011 to take on the role of " mentor " . The company 's administration consists of three co @-@ CEO 's ; Greg Jensen , Eileen Murray and David McCormick ; the former undersecretary of the Treasury Department . The company also has three co @-@ CIO 's ( chief investment officers ) ; Dalio , Bob Prince and Jensen ( who is also co @-@ CEO ) . Jensen , the 37 @-@ year @-@ old co @-@ CEO , oversees the research programs at the firm and came to the company as a Dartmouth College intern about 15 years earlier . Britt Harris , formerly of Verizon Investment Management , joined Bridgewater as co @-@ CEO in November 2004 but left six months later . According to Dalio , the cultural fit was a problem but Harris " is a superstar , with an absolutely fabulous character " . From 2010 until early 2013 , Bridgewater 's general counsel was James Comey , former United States Deputy Attorney General and current Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . 
 = = = Corporate culture = = = 
 In 2005 , Dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called Principles , which was distributed to all employees . The publication is said to be part self @-@ help book , part management manual , and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting . According to one trade journal , six years after the publication of Principles , the firm 's rapid expansion led to the institution of a " bizarre culture of criticism " . The company acknowledges that employees " often encounter culture shock " when they begin working there and Dalio admits : " it 's not for everyone " . According to the company 's web site , employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the company 's culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress . 
 A 2011 article in New York Magazine described the company as the " largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund " because of its unwavering commitment to " total honesty and accountability " and minute detail in its corporate culture . For example , Dalio encourages employees to do " whatever it takes to make the company great " and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes . All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee , as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary . In addition , Dalio says that he fosters " an extreme meritocracy of ideas " , and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy . He says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return . The company 's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms , and qualities like <unk> and risk @-@ aversion are discouraged . 
 The company has been likened to a cult , but Dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated “ community ” . An article in the New Yorker by John Cassidy says that " the word cult clearly has connotations that don 't apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment " . Cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a " strong @-@ willed leader " and that employees use a " unique vocabulary " . One client , Bob <unk> , chief executive officer of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board , said of the firm : " Every investment manager has its own culture [ and ] some are more unique than others " .

 In 2016 , the Wall Street Journal reported that Dalio and Greg Jensen called for votes on each other 's conduct . Dalio asked the firm 's management and stakeholders committees if they believe Jensen has " integrity . " 
 = Johann Mickl = 
 Johann Mickl ( 18 April 1893 – 10 April 1945 ) was an Austrian @-@ born Generalleutnant and division commander in the German Army during World War II , and was one of only 882 recipients of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves . He was commissioned shortly before the outbreak of World War I , and served with Austro @-@ Hungarian forces on the Eastern and Italian Fronts as company commander in the Imperial @-@ Royal Mountain Troops . During World War I he was decorated several times for bravery and leadership , and was wounded on several occasions , finishing the war as an Oberleutnant . 
 Immediately after the war , Mikl served in the <unk> militia which was formed to resist the incorporation of his home town of Radkersburg into the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes . He served with the Austrian Army from 1920 until the <unk> in 1938 , when it was absorbed by the Wehrmacht , and he transferred to the German Army as an Oberstleutnant . He commanded an anti @-@ tank battalion during the invasion of Poland and Battle of France , during which he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd and 1st Class , and was promoted to Oberst . Through the intervention of a friend , the adjutant of Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel , under whose command he had served in France , Mickl was transferred to North Africa to command a rifle regiment . He was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for his leadership of a kampfgruppe during the Battle of Sidi Rezegh , during which he and 800 of his soldiers were captured by New Zealand troops . Two days later he precipitated a successful mass escape from a prisoner of war collection point . 
 He briefly commanded the 90th Light Division Afrika in late 1941 before being wounded . After he recovered he was sent to the Eastern Front . Mickl commanded the 12th Rifle Brigade of the 12th Panzer Division in the east , taking over the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment when his brigade headquarters was disestablished . Transferred to the Führerreserve , he was promoted to Generalmajor , and received the Oak Leaves to his Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for his outstanding commitment and leadership during the Soviet 1942 – 43 winter offensives around Rzhev . He then commanded the 11th Panzer Division during the Battle of Kursk . Later in 1943 , he was appointed to train and command the 392nd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division , and led it in fighting against the Yugoslav Partisans before dying of wounds inflicted in the last month of the war . In 1967 , the Austrian Bundesheer barracks in Bad Radkersburg were named after him . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Mickl was born Johann Mikl in <unk> , Radkersburg , which was part of the Duchy of Styria within the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire . His father Mathias was a German farmer from <unk> , and his mother Maria ( née <unk> ) , was from <unk> , and of at least partially Slovene heritage . Mikl had a twin brother , Alois , who was killed in action in 1915 in Galicia near Lemberg , present @-@ day Lviv in the Ukraine . As a child , Mikl spoke German , Slovene and Hungarian , and remained fluent in all three throughout his life . 
 After entering a cadet school in Vienna in the Imperial @-@ Royal Landwehr in 1908 , he was accepted at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in 1911 . Described as slim , muscular , and 1 @.@ 92 metres ( 6 ft 4 in ) tall , Leutnant Mikl graduated on 1 August 1914 and was posted to the recently mobilised 4th Imperial @-@ Royal Landwehr Infantry Regiment ( LIR 4 ) , which formed part of the Imperial @-@ Royal Mountain Troops . 
 = = World War I = = 
 = = = Galicia = = = 
 LIR 4 was a purely Carinthian regiment , and wore the mountain cap ( German : <unk> ) and the Edelweiss badge . As part of the 22nd Rifle Division of the III Corps , Mikl 's regiment entrained for the Eastern Front , were offloaded in <unk> in Galicia and marched into the area of Złoczów to take up a position on the Złota Lipa River . Its baptism of fire was an attack on the Russians on 26 August 1914 , during which it received inadequate artillery support and suffered heavy casualties . One of those wounded was Mikl , who was shot in the chest . He spent time in a military hospital and was then employed in the regimental replacement battalion as an instructor until 15 April 1915 . Nothing is known about Mikl 's activities during that period , although LIR 4 was involved in heavy fighting in Galicia throughout the winter , in temperatures that dropped below − 20 ° C ( − 4 ° F ) . 
 On 1 June 1915 , LIR 4 received orders to be transferred to the Southern Front , as Italy had entered the war against the Central Powers the previous month . This order was countermanded the following morning when the Russians launched an offensive in the <unk> region and the Austrians suffered serious reverses . LIR 4 was immediately committed to the battle . The army commander , General der Kavallerie ( lieutenant general ) Karl von <unk> @-@ Baltin later stated that it was the courage of LIR 4 that had stopped the Russians . Mikl had led from the front during the fighting , especially when his company formed the regimental rear guard during the withdrawal from the Pruth river on 3 June . At one point , Mikl used parts of a damaged train to build a defensive position . He was wounded several times during the fighting , but remained with his soldiers . For his actions and " demonstrated personal bravery " , Mikl was awarded the Military Merit Cross 3rd Class with War Decoration ( German : <unk> III . Klasse und <unk> ) . 
 = = = Italian front = = = 
 By late September 1915 , LIR 4 had been transferred to the Flitsch valley in the Julian Alps on the Southern Front , and Mikl had been promoted to Oberleutnant ( first lieutenant ) and placed in command of the 2nd Company . A fairly quiet winter followed , during which the Austrians undertook reconnaissance of Italian positions , took prisoners , and captured weapons . In August 1915 , Italian Alpini troops had captured an advanced position about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) southwest of the 2 @,@ 208 metres ( 7 @,@ 244 ft ) <unk> peak , on a rocky outcrop called Cuklahöhe . From this position the Italians overlooked the positions of the 44th Rifle Division and its rear areas , which made movement almost impossible . The group commander , Oberst ( colonel ) Artur von Schuschnigg tasked Mikl and his company to capture the Cuklahöhe , and allowed him to determine the best way to complete his mission . Between 30 January and 8 February 1916 , Mikl and Fähnrich ( cadet sergeant ) <unk> reconnoitred the Italian position each night . It dominated the ground around it , and was protected by barbed wire entanglements . On 8 February , they located a narrow channel that they considered could be used to approach the Cuklahöhe without exposing the assault force to Italian fire . Mickl 's plan involved a silent attack by his company using the channel , foregoing artillery preparation , as this would warn the Italians of the impending assault . 
 After a few days delay caused by heavy snowfalls , the attack commenced at 02 : 45 on 12 February . During the approach march to the foot of the Cuklahöhe , some men disappeared up to their neck in snow due to the many snow @-@ filled depressions and the depth of the snow . This meant that the march to the bottom of the channel took two hours instead of the thirty minutes Mikl had estimated . When they reached the bottom of the channel , they had to climb a 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) high smooth ice wall to enter the gutter , which even highly experienced climbers were unable to scale . Around 06 : 00 , the whole company had assembled at the bottom of the channel , but dawn was beginning to break , threatening to expose the assembled force to flanking Italian positions . <unk> then came forward , carrying the trunk of an <unk> , a shrub that grows just above the tree @-@ line in the Alps . He used the trunk to reach the channel ledge , and the troops were able to enter the gutter with his help . The troops could now see the glow of the candles in the Italian position . The assault took the Italians completely by surprise , and three officers and 84 soldiers surrendered , for the loss of four dead , including one officer , and four wounded . The Italian response was to concentrate all available artillery fire on the position . The dugout was exposed to direct Italian fire , and was therefore unusable . The Austrians were in an exposed position in deep snow and with extremely cold winds at an altitude of 1 @,@ 700 metres ( 5 @,@ 600 ft ) , and during the first day Mikl 's company lost 20 dead and 60 seriously wounded . On the night of 15 February , the Italians commenced two days of unsuccessful counterattacks , some carried out in four or five consecutive waves . For several weeks starting on 17 February , Benito Mussolini , then a member of the Italian 11th Bersaglieri Regiment , was on the front line near the Cuklahöhe , and described some of his experiences in his diary . On 5 March , prior to the withdrawal of his company from the Cuklahöhe , Mikl was wounded in the face by an Italian hand grenade . When his company was relieved on the Cuklahöhe on 12 April , it had shrunk to just 44 men . For his leadership of the assault on the Cuklahöhe , Mikl was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown 3rd Class . On 10 May , the Cuklahöhe was retaken by the Italians from three companies of Bosnian @-@ Herzegovinian Infantry , who lost 250 men . The assault force , consisting of four battalions of the Italian 24th Infantry Division lost 18 officers and 516 men . 
 In April 1916 , Mikl 's regiment was deployed to South Tyrol to take part in the Austrian spring offensive , during which he was awarded the bronze Military Merit Medal on the ribbon of the Bravery Medal with War Decoration ( German : <unk> <unk> am Bande der <unk> mit <unk> ) , for leading a successful attack on an Italian position on Monte <unk> . At the end of June , his regiment was transported back to Galicia by rail to reinforce the Austro @-@ Hungarian forces being hard @-@ pressed by the Russian Brusilov Offensive . In July , Mikl 's regiment was used as a " fire brigade " within the Army Group , and helped prevent the penetration of the Russian offensive through the <unk> Pass . Their task completed , Mikl 's regiment was promptly transferred back to fight the Italians on the Southern Front . Mikl 's regiment arrived on the Isonzo Front on 20 August , and remained there until late autumn 1917 , fighting in the 8th , 9th , 10th and 11th Battles of the Isonzo . During the Eighth Battle of the Isonzo on 10 October 1916 , Mikl was wounded once again , and was hospitalised . When he recovered , he was assigned to the regimental replacement battalion until spring 1917 . For three months during the summer of 1917 , Mikl was employed as an instructor at the VII Corps Reserve Officer 's School , preparing young officers for service at the front . In January 1917 , he was awarded the silver Military Merit Medal on the ribbon of the Bravery Medal with War Decoration . In August 1917 , Mikl was appointed to command a machine gun company , and served in the Battle of Caporetto and the subsequent advance to the Piave river . On 12 November 1917 , Mikl 's regiment was the first to establish a bridgehead over the Piave at Zenson di Piave , and he was instrumental in rallying the troops of his regiment when they came under heavy fire as they landed on the Italian side of river . For his leadership at this crucial stage of the river crossing , he was awarded a bar to his silver Military Merit Medal . On 15 May 1918 , Mikl began a preparatory course for future attendance at the War College ( German : Kriegsschule ) in Vienna , and when the war ended he was posted to the 54th Rifle Division in Galicia . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 Before the war , nationalism had been largely absent in officers of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army , but this changed during the war , and by the end of the war , the propaganda of the Entente had combined with wider aspirations to encourage nationalist sentiment . In some cases , this resulted in mutiny among units of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army in the last months of the war . The states that would succeed Austria @-@ Hungary were approved by the Allies on 28 October 1918 , and the dual monarchy of Austria @-@ Hungary was dissolved three days later . Many new nation states emerged in the territory formerly belonging to the realm , as nationalist movements called for greater autonomy or full independence . The Duchy of Styria was divided between the new states of German @-@ Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes , but the exact line of the new border was unclear . In November 1918 , Mikl had returned to his hometown of Radkersburg , an important railway junction point , which was of economic importance to both sides . The Slovenes occupied the city on 1 December 1918 . In 1919 , Mikl served as adjutant in the 1st Battalion of the <unk> militia , which used arms provided by the provincial government of Carinthia to make an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Radkersburg from forces of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes to ensure it remained part of German @-@ Austria . The provincial government of Styria , which had not supported these actions , subsequently issued a warrant ordering Mikl 's arrest for treason . Despite his failure , his actions were very important in demonstrating to those negotiating the final border that towns along the northern bank of the Mura river were German . When the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye was signed later in 1919 , Radkersburg was retained within what became the First Austrian Republic . 
 In 1920 , Mikl was accepted by the new Austrian Army ( German : Bundesheer ) , joining the 11th <unk> Regiment . During 1920 – 21 he was rapidly promoted to Hauptmann ( captain ) , and on 20 October 1920 he was posted to the 5th Cyclist Battalion in Villach , Carinthia . In 1921 , his battalion was deployed to Burgenland to assist in the transfer of that region from Hungary to Austria . In 1922 , he changed his name to the more <unk> Mickl . According to his biographers Richter and Kobe , at this time the Austrian police wanted to speak to Mikl regarding alleged arms trafficking offences , and his decision to change his name may have related to the police inquiries . On 2 May 1922 , Mickl married Helene <unk> in Klagenfurt ; their only child , Manfred , was born in 1923 . That same year , he was promoted to the rank of Major , having worked on the frontier with Italy , trained border guards and proving an accomplished mountaineer . 
 In 1925 , Mickl passed the examinations for the general staff . On 26 July 1930 , Mickl was appointed an honorary citizen ( German : <unk> ) of the town of Radkersburg . During fifteen years with the 5th Cyclist Battalion , Mickl had attended ski courses and mountain leadership courses , and had also developed an interest in automotive technology . In 1934 , he briefly served on the military headquarters for Carinthia in Klagenfurt . In February of the following year , he was placed on the general staff officer list , and posted to the headquarters of the 3rd Brigade at St. Pölten . His promotion to Oberstleutnant ( lieutenant colonel ) followed in 1936 . In the same year , Mickl 's son Manfred entered the military cadet school at Enns . On 14 March 1938 , following the Anschluss , Mickl was absorbed at his rank into the German Army , but as a troop officer , not a general staff officer . From 12 May to mid @-@ August 1938 , he attended training at the <unk> II ( Armoured Troops School No. 2 ) in <unk> south of Berlin , before being given command of the 42nd Panzerjäger ( Anti @-@ tank ) Battalion of the 2nd Light Division . Helene soon moved to Gera in Thuringia to join Mickl , leaving the 15 @-@ year @-@ old Manfred at the cadet school until his graduation .

 Mickl commanded the 42nd Panzerjäger Battalion of Generalmajor ( brigadier ) Georg Stumme 's 2nd Light Division during the September 1939 invasion of Poland , during which the division was involved in difficult fighting through Kielce and Radom in central Poland to Modlin on the Vistula . The following month , Mickl was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class . During the winter of 1939 / 40 , the 2nd Light Division was reclassified and converted into the 7th Panzer Division , in preparation for the invasion of France and the Low Countries . In February 1940 , Generalmajor Erwin Rommel arrived to take command of the division . 
 Mickl remained in charge of the 42nd Panzerjäger Battalion during the invasion . He got along well with Rommel , and his battalion fought well but suffered serious casualties during the Battle of Arras on 21 May while trying to stop the heavily armoured tanks of the British 1st Army Tank Brigade with its 37 mm anti @-@ tank guns . His soldiers derided their guns as <unk> ( tank @-@ door knocker ) , due to their failure to penetrate the British Matilda I and Matilda II tanks . Mickl 's battalion tried to protect the exposed flank of the division , but was overrun . The situation was saved by anti @-@ aircraft guns and field artillery which were able to knock out the British tanks with direct fire . 
 Rommel received reports of Mickl 's personal courage during the battle , and recognised aspects of his subordinate 's leadership style that mirrored his own . On 1 June , he promoted Mickl to Oberst and on 21 June awarded him the Iron Cross 1st Class . After the French surrender , Mickl was attached to the division 's 25th Panzer Regiment to gain more knowledge about armoured tactics , and on 10 December 1940 was appointed to command the 7th Rifle Regiment of the division . Rommel did not remain with the division long , being transferred to command the Afrika Corps . He was replaced by Generalmajor Hans Freiherr von Funck , with whom Mickl had some difficulty working . Mickl remained in command of the 7th Rifle Regiment during occupation duties in southwestern France , redeployment to Germany , and during the division 's preparation for the invasion of the Soviet Union . In May 1941 , through the intervention of Rommel 's adjutant Major Hans @-@ Joachim Schraepler , Mickl was posted to a new role in Germany , raising the headquarters of the 155th Rifle Regiment for service in North Africa . Despite the difference in age and rank , Mickl , Schraepler and their wives had become firm friends . The 155th Rifle Regiment was to be a motorised formation of three battalions , one drawn from each of the 106th , 112th and 113th Infantry Divisions . 
 = = = North Africa = = = 
 In August 1941 , Panzergruppe Afrika was raised , and the newly promoted General der Panzertruppe Rommel was placed in command . The Afrikakorps was handed over to Generalleutnant Ludwig Crüwell . Soon after , Mickl followed the battalions of his regiment to North Africa , arriving there in early September 1941 . He found them to be under @-@ equipped , having been furnished with only a few vehicles and only two 37 mm anti @-@ tank guns per battalion . He considered that this would be sufficient for an attack on defensive positions , but completely inadequate for mobile operations . On 6 September , his regiment joined the Siege of Tobruk taking up positions at Ras el <unk> until the end of October , when it became part of the composite Afrika ( Special Purpose ) Division and prepared for an attack on the fortress . When a strong British reconnaissance force was reported far to the south , moving west from the Egyptian border at Sidi Omar , Mickl was placed in command of a kampfgruppe which was sent to meet the British . The force consisted of Mickl 's regiment , along with the 361st Afrika Regiment and the 605th Panzerjäger Battalion . The Afrika Regiment had only just arrived in theatre , and had no heavy weapons , insufficient ammunition and almost no vehicles . 
 By the following day , Mickl 's kampfgruppe was deployed on the high ground on either side of the airfield at Sidi Rezegh . That afternoon , British armoured cars and tanks appeared , and Mickl 's force was hard @-@ pressed to hold its positions barring the British approach to Tobruk from the south and south @-@ east , as little tank support was available . In the face of a superior force , Mickl 's kampfgruppe fought hard in what became known as the Battle of Sidi Rezegh , with their commander often forward rallying his troops , and in the thick of counter @-@ attacks launched to regain ground . Mickl and around 800 of his troops were captured by elements of the New Zealand Division on 26 November 1941 , the captured troops being mainly from the Afrika Regiment . 
 After two days under guard at a temporary collection point , Mickl observed elements of the 15th Panzer Division travelling on the Trigh Capuzzo ( Capuzzo Track ) , returning from their sortie against the rear of the British assault . The prisoners of war were surrounded by a largely " symbolic " barbed wire fence , and in addition to the small guard force , the makeshift camp was surrounded by scattered British headquarters and logistic units . Mickl approached the officer in charge , who was watching the progress of the German tanks through binoculars , and knocked him to the ground . Seeing this , the German soldiers subdued the guards and took off on foot towards the nearby German column . Taking the keys to a vehicle , Mickl drove towards the distant German tanks to warn them of his approaching men . Rommel 's staff were soon apprised of Mickl 's actions by Crüwell . The British soon lifted the siege , and Mickl 's regiment acted as rearguard during the withdrawal of Axis forces to El Agheila , where on 11 December , his previously 2 @,@ 000 @-@ strong regiment could only muster seven officers and 492 men . During the withdrawal , his ally and friend Schraepler was killed in a vehicle accident . 
 When the commander of the newly renamed 90th Light Afrika Division , Generalmajor Max <unk> , was killed in an Allied air raid on 10 December 1941 , Mickl was appointed to temporarily command the division . During December , Mickl was wounded in the head and hand , but remained at his post . Rommel recommended Mickl for the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross , for his leadership at Sidi Rezegh , and it was duly awarded on 13 December 1941 . The harsh conditions of desert warfare had begun to affect Mickl 's health , so at the end of December he was sent home on convalescent leave .

 = = = = 12th Rifle Brigade = = = = 
 On 25 March 1942 , Mickl was appointed to command the 12th Rifle Brigade of Generalmajor Walter Wessel 's 12th Panzer Division on the Eastern Front . The division was the main reserve formation of Army Group North , and when Mickl joined his brigade headquarters it was located on the coast near Narva west of Leningrad . The 12th Rifle Brigade consisted of the 5th and 25th Motorised Infantry Regiments . As a subordinate formation of General der Kavallerie Georg Lindemann 's 18th Army , during the Red Army Winter Campaign of 1941 – 42 it had fought on the Volkhov Front , during which the <unk> Offensive Operation had penetrated deep into its area of operations in an attempt to relieve Leningrad . When Mickl arrived to take command , elements of his command were fighting as part of a total of twenty 18th Army <unk> engaged in encircling and destroying cut @-@ off Soviet units . It was not until May that Mickl was able to start gather his brigade together . At the end of June , Mickl was still collecting and re @-@ organising his brigade when he received news that his son Manfred had been seriously wounded in the leg during the Axis capture of Tobruk . Manfred was a Leutnant in the Pioneers , and had already been decorated with the Iron Cross 1st Class . 
 By 17 July , the 12th Panzer Division was finally concentrating near <unk> , 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) south @-@ east of Leningrad , and Mickl 's brigade was reclassified as a Panzergrenadier brigade . Mickl found this change mildly amusing , noting that his transport consisted mainly of peasant carts and train carriages . He nevertheless attacked the task of retraining his regiments and battalions with vigour , conducting a series of tank @-@ infantry co @-@ operation exercises . Between 25 August and 16 September , Mickl visited Manfred in hospital in Naples while on leave , but he returned to find that his brigade had again been parceled out in <unk> used as " fire brigades " along the Neva River . Frustrated , he complained that he and his staff did not appear to have a purpose , as they were usually bypassed by the division commander and staff . It was not until 17 October that he was able to collect his scattered troops and arrange for them to be transported south to an area west of Nevel near the boundary with Army Group Centre . By this time , it had become apparent that Mickl 's brigade headquarters was being not employed as originally intended , and along with the brigade staff of all Panzer divisions , it was disestablished . 
 = = = = 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment = = = = 
 Without a command , Mickl remained with the 12th Panzer Division , taking over the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment , whose commander had fallen ill . In the new area , Mickl concentrated on training and getting to know his men , before conducting an anti @-@ partisan operation named <unk> ( Monkey Cage ) between 11 and 14 November 1942 . Lacking experience in counter @-@ insurgency , the regiment achieved little . Mickl then concentrated his troops ' efforts on securing winter quarters and building shelters for the regiment 's vehicles . On the frontlines , 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) east of Nevel , Soviet forces were threatening to break through around the Rzhev salient and encircle the German 9th Army , and on 21 November the 12th Panzer Division received orders to march for the front . The march east , undertaken in freezing conditions and heavy snow , was very difficult . The men lit small stoves in the rear of the trucks to keep warm , and often had to clear the snow @-@ clogged roads with shovels . 
 Initially they were ordered to Roslavl , south @-@ east of Smolensk , but this was soon changed to Yelnya , east of Smolensk . When they reached Smolensk , they marched on through <unk> to <unk> before being ordered to turn north towards Bely to help stop a Soviet breakthrough south of Rzhev . At the head of the division , the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment attacked off the route of march towards elements of the 1st Panzer Division holding out around the village of <unk> . The fighting continued in snowstorms and extreme cold until 16 December , with Mickl forward directing the battle , which ended with the destruction of eight Soviet tank and rifle brigades in the Bely area . After a few days rest , on 23 December Mickl 's regiment marched to the north @-@ east of Bely to stop Soviet forces moving into the <unk> river valley . In the difficult terrain and weather conditions , the regiment was exhausted from constant fighting over hamlets that often changed hands . On 30 December , the fighting escalated as the Red Army forces in the sector were reinforced , and Mickl 's II Battalion was forced to temporarily withdraw into the surrounding forest . Fierce fighting continued until the 12th Panzer Division was detached at short notice on 14 January 1943 , but not before the divisional staff had reported Mickl 's brave leadership in the fighting to the Oberkommando des Heeres ( German Army High Command ) . On 16 January 1943 , the division was on the move , this time headed north @-@ west to Velikiye Luki , but its move to the front was countermanded . 
 = = = = Führerreserve = = = = 
 On 26 January 1943 , Mickl received orders to report to Berlin on 2 February , although Wessel was reluctant to lose his outstanding regimental commander . In a formal assessment on 20 November 1942 , Wessel had assessed Mickl as having the aptitude to command a Panzer division , and he supplemented this on 28 January , extolling his " almost unparalleled bravery and boldness " in command of the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment . On 30 January , Mickl arrived in Gera on leave to visit his wife Helene , and spent the next three months in the Army Headquarters officers ' reserve pool ( German : Oberkommando des Heeres Führerreserve ' ) . 
 On 1 March he was promoted to Generalmajor , and five days later he became the 205th recipient of the Oak Leaves to the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross , in recognition of his outstanding commitment as the commander of the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment during winter 1942 – 43 . Of modest habits , Mickl had rarely worn the Knight 's Cross itself , usually wearing only the ribbon around his neck , and now he merely added the Oak Leaves device to the ribbon . During his time in the Führerreserve , he also had the opportunity to meet with his mentor Rommel , now a Generalfeldmarschall , and he also attended a course for divisional commanders , which he referred to as a " fool 's course " . In early May , Mickl was summoned to Berlin and advised that he was to be entrusted with the command of the 11th Panzer Division during the absence of Generalleutnant Dietrich von Choltitz , who had been suffering with heart problems . Despite the good news of being appointed to a divisional command , Mickl expressed his disappointment that he was being allocated a division in need of re @-@ organisation , rather than a fully equipped and full @-@ strength modern division . 
 = = = = 11th Panzer Division = = = = 
 When Mickl took command , the 11th Panzer Division had not yet finished rebuilding after suffering serious losses during the attempted relief of Stalingrad in December 1942 and during the Third Battle of Kharkov in February and March 1943 . The 11th Panzer Division formed part of General der Panzertruppe Otto von Knobelsdorff 's XLVIII Panzer Corps under the operation control of Generaloberst Hermann Hoth 's 4th Panzer Army , which was itself a component of Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein 's Army Group South . Prior to the launching of Operation Citadel targeting the Soviet salient at Kursk , the XLVIII Panzer Corps was quartered southwest of a line between <unk> and <unk> . 
 For the main assault , Army Group South was the southern pincer of a <unk> aimed at cutting off all Red Army forces within the Kursk salient . It was to attack north out of the areas west of Belgorod , and link up with Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge 's Army Group Centre , which was to attack south from the Orel region . On the afternoon of 4 July , the 4th Panzer Army successfully conducted a preliminary operation to breach minefields and secure the heights overlooking the nearly 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) deep Soviet defensive positions near Kursk , which were essentially a series of staggered defensive positions and minefields reinforced with anti @-@ tank weapons . 
 Mickl 's division achieved its objectives during the preliminary operation , and commenced its main assault at 06 : 00 on 5 July . The 11th Panzer Division advanced on the right flank of the XLVIII Panzer Corps , and on the left of the powerful Panzergrenadier Division Großdeutschland . Its progress was hampered by minimal air support , difficult terrain and constant Soviet counterattacks . Fighting alongside a <unk> of the Großdeutschland Division led by Oberst Theodor Graf <unk> von <unk> , it had captured the heavily fortified village of <unk> . By the evening of 6 July , XLVIII Panzer Corps had breached the first belt of the formidable Soviet defences , and Mickl 's division had reached the Pena river north and northeast of <unk> . This was 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) short of the objective Hoth had set for 6 July , the bridge over the Psel River at Oboyan . 
 XLVIII Panzer Corps regrouped during the night of 6 / 7 July , and the 11th Panzer Division continued its advance towards Oboyan on 7 July , alongside the Großdeutschland Division . Over the next few days , the two divisions overcame resistance from a series of Soviet strongpoints , along with their desperate counterattacks . By 10 July they had reached a position east of the Kursk @-@ Kharkov road , on the heights 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) south of Oboyan , having defeated advanced elements of the Soviet 10th Tank Corps . At this point the previously rough terrain opened up , and with the aid of binoculars the men of the division could see the vast plain behind Oboyan in which the two pincers of Operation Citadel were planned to meet . But the northern pincer had been stalled north of Kursk in heavy fighting , and the 11th Panzer Division had gained the most northern penetration into the Soviet salient achieved by Army Group South during the operation . 
 Twice in the next few days , XLVIII Panzer Corps attempted to punch through the Soviet defences to the north , while to the east the II SS Panzer Corps and German Army Detachment Kempf fought the tanks of the Soviet Steppe Front . The 11th Panzer Division was then ordered to attack towards the upper reaches of the Psel , some 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) to the east , followed by the Großdeutschland Division once it had captured Oboyan . The two divisions were then to link up with the II SS Panzer Corps and defeat the Soviet forces concentrated around Prokhorovka . On 17 July , these orders were cancelled , and over the next week , Mickl 's division fought defensive battles against the Red Army , and conflict arose with his subordinate commanders and his key staff , who did not support his style of leadership , which was modelled on that of his mentor Rommel . For nearly that whole week , Mickl 's division bore the brunt of the Soviet attacks on the XLVIII Panzer Corps . 
 On 21 July , Mickl wrote a letter in which he stated that he wished to again be a battalion or regimental commander , so as to not have to deal with such a large frontline . That day he had been told that the next day he should expect Choltitz to return and take over command , but instead he spent a further three weeks commanding the 11th Panzer Division in heavy fighting against Soviet attacks . Finally , on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor <unk> von <unk> , who arrived that same day . Four days later , Mickl returned to Gera , disappointed and resentful about the demotion , as he felt that he had made a good enough impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division . The reason behind his relief is unclear . His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles , and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting insurgents in his native Balkans , especially given his fluency in several local languages . 
 = = = Yugoslavia = = = 
 = = = = A new division = = = = 
 After three weeks leave , Mickl was sent to Austria to train and command the 392nd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division . He was appointed to this command on 13 August 1943 , and according to his biographers Richter and Kobe , he must have been aware of this eventuality when he was appointed to temporarily command the 11th Panzer Division earlier that year , although he never got over his disappointment at not being given permanent command of a Panzer division . Commencing from 17 August , the 392nd was assembled and trained in Austria as the third and last Croatian division raised for service in the Wehrmacht , following its sister divisions the 369th and the 373rd . One infantry regiment and the divisional artillery regiment formed in Döllersheim , the other infantry regiment in Zwettl , the signals battalion in Stockerau and the pioneer battalion in Krems . It was built around a cadre of 3 @,@ 500 German officers , NCOs and specialists , and 8 @,@ 500 soldiers of the Croatian Home Guard , the regular army of the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) . The former Home Guard troops included a few young officers and NCOs , but the division was commanded by Germans down to battalion and even company level in nearly all cases , and was commonly referred to as a " legionnaire division " . The division wore Wehrmacht uniform with the shield chequy argent et gules of the NDH on the upper right sleeve and right side of the steel helmet . Although originally intended for use on the Eastern Front , not long after its formation the Germans decided that the division would not be utilised outside the NDH . Richter and Kobe observed that , given his experience and fluency in Balkan languages , no @-@ one would have been more suitable to command the division than Mickl . Mickl had four months to whip the division into shape , and ensure that it was equipped , staffed and resourced to do the tasks that lay ahead . Soon the Croatian soldiers became familiar with the tall frame of their commander , whose Austro @-@ Hungarian decorations were familiar to them , but who also wore the Oakleaves and spoke their language . During the training , Mickl once remarked to the assembled officers : 
 " Gentlemen , I know that you have been discussing whether or not we can still win this war . All of you have fought on several fronts and some have come from the battlefields of Russia . It should therefore be clear to you that there will be no victory for us . But I will not tolerate such discussions . Most of us are career officers . When we joined , no @-@ one guaranteed that we would win any war . We fight not only when victory is guaranteed , but we do our duty and fight where we are , even if that means our inevitable doom . To fight on without a chance of victory is not pointless , because it serves to avert as much damage as possible to Germany . Preventing the advance of Tito 's communist @-@ oriented partisans to the north is part of this struggle . 
 These comments were extremely dangerous , as Mickl did not know all his officers or their allegiances , and many officers and men had been court @-@ martialled and shot for similar pronouncements that revealed the speaker did not believe in " ultimate victory " . Mickl recognised the difficulties he faced , with " volunteers " who were really conscripts , and the Croats ' allegiance divided between the Ustaše regime and the Partisans . As a young officer in World War I , Mickl had commanded Croatian soldiers , and knew them to be brave fighters . In that war , Croats had served in a multi @-@ ethnic army under Austrian officers , and they all spoke German well enough to understand and be understood . In contrast , his new command consisted of Croatian soldiers who hardly understood German , and whose patriotism could not be assumed . Mickl saw that instilling German discipline and standards was a second order of business , and that the main role of his officers was to " awaken and maintain their will to fight " . Despite an understaffed headquarters , he was fortunate to have Hauptmann der Reserve Bransch as the commander of the divisional reconnaissance battalion . Bransch had served with Mickl since Africa . Mickl decided that he needed a reliable , proven officer as his divisional chief of operations , so he arranged for Bransch to be promoted to Major , and appointed him to lead his operations staff . However , a few days later , Major im Generalstab Gerd Kobe arrived fresh from the Eastern Front . Kobe had served in the operations departments at both corps and army @-@ level , and had experience in working for brave but difficult commanders . 
 Kobe 's introduction to Mickl was abrupt , as the general was very angry at having been left without a chief of operations for so long . Mickl encapsulated his approach to command in this way : 
 My place is with the guns ! You will maintain the division for me . From time to time we will speak by telephone or radio . If we have an understanding on this , everything will be good . If not , then you will have to go . 
 Mickl 's first order to Kobe was to contact the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , Haj Amin al @-@ Husseini , who lived in Berlin , to request an imam for the division , as the division included a company of infantry and a battery of artillery staffed by Bosnian Muslims . Soon after Kobe arrived , Mickl departed on leave for the Christmas and New Year period , leaving Kobe to arrange the rail transport of the division to its initial deployment area , 50 km ( 31 mi ) southwest of Zagreb . 
 = = = = Initial clearing operations = = = = 
 The division was deployed to the NDH by rail between 5 and 10 January 1944 , to combat the Partisans in the western parts of the puppet state . It became known as the " Blue Division " ( German : Blaue Division , Croatian : Plava divizija ) , as its first deployment was within view of the Adriatic . Mickl 's task was well known to the Partisans , and focused on securing the Adriatic coastline along the Croatian Littoral between Rijeka and Karlobag ( including all islands except Krk ) and about 60 km ( 37 mi ) inland . This task included securing the crucial supply route between Karlovac and Senj . These areas , and in particular the port of Senj , had been largely dominated by the Partisans since the Italian capitulation in autumn 1943 . Mickl 's division was placed under the command of the XV Mountain Corps as part of the 2nd Panzer Army , with its headquarters to be established in Karlovac . The division was also to take over responsibility for the security of the Zagreb – Karlovac railway line from the 1st Cossack Division . Before the division had completed <unk> at Zagreb , its lead elements had been pressed into service to clear the Partisans from the nearby village of Žumberak . 
 When Mickl arrived by train in Zagreb on 12 January , Kobe met him at the station and informed him that he was ready for Mickl to decide the time that an attack against Partisan forces besieging the NDH garrison at Ogulin near Karlovac should be launched . In response , Mickl grinned and shook Kobe 's hand , and according to Kobe , " the spell was broken " , and from that time on , Mickl and his chief of operations had a very good working relationship . The operation involved a drive southwest from Karlovac between 13 and 16 January 1944 initially led by the 847th Infantry Regiment . In their first engagements with the Partisan 8th Division , the Croatian soldiers panicked and their German leaders were quickly wounded or killed , but Mickl went forward and ensured that his troops pressed home their attacks . On 16 January , Ogulin was relieved , but the advance was continued south to <unk> , and villages in that area were also secured . When the bodies of those that had been killed were recovered , they were often found stripped of equipment and some were even found naked . This success in their first operation gave the inexperienced Croat soldiers greater confidence in themselves and their commanders . 
 This was followed by Operation Drežnica , a push through to the coast , forcing passes through the Velika Kapela mountain range , part of the Dinaric Alps . Both passes were more than 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) above sea level and the snow was often knee or thigh @-@ deep . Delayed by mines and roadblocks , the division captured the Kapela and Vratnik passes with Mickl ensuring that his troops worked carefully in order to minimise casualties . After the first few days of fighting , XV Mountain Corps and 2nd Panzer Army began to urge Mickl to advance faster , but he resisted this , knowing that his division was inexperienced . This was followed by a series of engagements along the road to the coast , and after some close quarter fighting with the Partisan 13th Division , they captured and destroyed most of that division 's supply dump northwest of Lokve and secured Senj . The 847th Infantry Regiment was then allocated the task of securing the coastline up the coast as far as Bakar , and southward to the village of <unk> , and the 846th Infantry Regiment was directed to secure the divisional supply route from Senj to Generalski Stol . They started improving bases along the road , including Italian forts that had been established in the Kapela and Vratnik passes . The 847th Infantry Regiment then spread out along the coastline between Karlobag and Crikvenica , and supported by elements of the divisional artillery and pioneers they began building fortifications against a feared Allied invasion . The troops in Karlobag linked up with the 264th Infantry Division who were responsible for the coast further to the southeast . The supply situation quickly became difficult due to Partisan interdiction of the route from Karlovac , and Allied bombing of coastal shipping and Senj harbour . 
 = = = = Fighting during 1944 = = = = 
 In late February or early March the 847th Infantry Regiment , supported by an Ustaše battalion , advanced on Plaški ( south of Ogulin ) when they were stopped by deep snow . Partisans then attacked their supply lines , killing 30 soldiers . Some of the bodies of the dead soldiers were looted or mutilated . After Plaški was captured , the Ustaše battalion independently pursued the Partisans and returned to Plaški with many of the looted items . In March , the 847th Regiment occupied the Adriatic islands of Rab and Pag without encountering any Partisan resistance . In the same month , the 846th Regiment conducted an operation in the Gacka river valley around Otočac , and assisted the Croatian Home Guard in enforcing conscription orders on their own population in the divisional area . Through the spring of 1944 , the 846th Regiment used jadgkommandos , lightly armed and mobile " hunter teams " of company or battalion strength , to conduct follow @-@ up of sightings of Partisans , and transport moving through the Kapela Pass had to travel in convoy for security . The division was able to restore a land connection with the NDH garrison of Gospić which had been reliant on supply from the sea since the Italian surrender , and drove three Partisan battalions out of the outskirts of Otočac . One of the difficulties faced by the division in fighting in the mountains was the lack of mountain artillery which could accompany the battalions in the field . The divisional artillery was equipped with field howitzers with a range of 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) which seriously limited the artillery cover that could be provided during mobile operations .

The divisional artillery was equipped with field howitzers with a range of 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) which seriously limited the artillery cover that could be provided during mobile operations . 
 On 1 April 1944 , Mickl was promoted to Generalleutnant . He identified that the Partisan 13th Division was using the Drežnica valley as a huge armoury , hiding captured Italian arms and ammunition in villages , basements , and even in fake graves in cemeteries . This was of major concern if the feared Allied landing eventuated . In mid @-@ April , Mickl ordered Operation <unk> ( Mace Blow ) to clear the area , using the 846th Infantry Regiment and parts of the 847th Infantry Regiment , supported by the divisional artillery and flak battalion . Over the next two weeks , the division pushed the Partisan 13th Division north to the area of <unk> and Delnice , and captured sufficient material to equip two divisions , including 30 tons of small arms ammunition and 15 tons of artillery ammunition . 
 The Partisan 35th Division attacked from the Plitvice Lakes area on 5 May and captured the village of <unk> . Partisans also interdicted the Otočac @-@ Gospić road . In response , Mickl planned Operation Morgenstern ( Morning Star ) to clear Partisan forces from the Krbavsko Polje region around Udbina . From 7 to 16 May 1944 , along with elements of the 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division , the 92nd Motorised Regiment , a battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division , and Ustaše units , were involved in Operation Morgenstern . According to German sources , Operation Morgenstern resulted in significant Partisan losses , including 438 killed , 56 captured , and 18 defectors , as well as capturing weapons , ammunition , vehicles , animals and large amounts of equipment . For its efforts in this operation , the division received its first mention in the Wehrmachtbericht ( armed forces daily radio broadcast ) . Also in May , the division received 500 German reinforcements , and formed a field replacement battalion . 
 The population of some areas secured by the division had a high proportion of Serbs , a situation that had arisen when the area was part of the Military Frontier between the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire . Once the division had secured its area of responsibility , it became clear to the members of the division that a fratricidal war had been raging between Croats and Serbs . Both Roman Catholic and Serbian Orthodox churches had been destroyed , and elements of the division would observe smoke in the valleys occupied by Serbs , and upon investigation , would find burned houses and dead and wounded Serb civilians . Mickl was indignant about these attacks , and summoned all the Croatian civil and military leadership in the divisional area to his headquarters . In the meantime , he ordered two battalions of the division away from their positions on the eastern side of Otočac . When the Croatian officials arrived at his headquarters , they protested that he had exposed Otočac to attack . Incensed , Mickl shouted at them , " Are you officers and soldiers , or robbers and murderers ? " , and threatened to withdraw the whole division to the coast , leaving the whole area undefended . The Croatian functionaries swore that the perpetrators of the attacks had been punished and that they would ensure that they would not occur in future . Nevertheless , Mickl kept garrisons in the Serb @-@ populated valleys for many weeks in order to protect the Serbs from their Croat neighbours . 
 The division saw action against the Partisans until the end of the war , often fighting alongside a grouping of Ustaše units that numbered up to 12 @,@ 000 troops . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 During the last few months of the war , the division was engaged in the defence of the northern Adriatic coast and Lika . On 8 April 1945 , the city of Senj fell to the Partisans . The following day , during desperate fighting to control the Vratnik pass through the mountains from Senj to Brinje , Mickl personally took part in the fighting and was shot in the head around noon . He was transported to hospital in Rijeka on a tank , but died the following day . 
 Oberstleutnant Kobe , the chief operations officer of the 392nd Division , described Mickl as " a giant in stature , lean and muscular despite his 50 years " , a very demanding commander who was also very demanding of himself . Kobe stated that Mickl was frequently at the forefront of the fighting , carrying a Gewehr 43 carbine . In 1967 , the Austrian Armed Forces barracks ( Mickl @-@ Kaserne ) in Bad Radkersburg were named after him , and they were used continuously by the Austrian Armed Forces for 44 years until 30 September 2008 .

 The Ambrose Channel pilot cable , also called the Ambrose Channel leader cable , was a cable laid in Ambrose Channel at the entrance to the Port of New York and New Jersey that provided an audio tone for guiding ships in and out of port at times of low visibility . The cable was laid during 1919 and 1920 ; it had been removed from the Channel and replaced by wireless technology by the end of the 1920s . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ambrose Channel is the main shipping channel in and out of the Port of New York and New Jersey , making it the only means of accessing an important commercial port . Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to New York City , and bad weather could close the Channel for days . Ships were forced to wait at the Harbor 's entrance for conditions to clear . These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money , with each ship costing between $ 500 and $ 4000 per hour it was stopped ( roughly $ 5 @,@ 700 to $ 46 @,@ 000 in 2013 dollars ) . 
 = = Description and operation = = 
 The Ambrose leader cable was an armored cable with a single internal conductor ( see picture ) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the Channel floor . It originated at Fort Lafayette ( near the present day Verrazano @-@ Narrows Bridge ) , then extended 16 miles down the Ambrose Channel to the vicinity of Lightship Ambrose offshore . It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500 Hz ( cycles per second ) current at 400 volts , resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field along the length of the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away . The current was mechanically keyed to send the word " NAVY " in Morse Code . 
 A ship received by a pair of induction coils hung on opposite sides of the ship , and fed through an amplifier into a headset ( see diagram , below ) . By switching between coils , the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared . The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant . 
 = = Research and development = = 
 The pilot cable required a series of prior discoveries and inventions . In 1882 , A. R. Sennett patented the use of a submerged electrical cable to communicate with a ship at a fixed location . Around the same time Charles Stevenson patented a means of navigating ships over an electrically charge cable using a <unk> . The method became practical when Earl Hanson adapted early vacuum tube circuits to amplify the signal . 
 Robert H. Marriott was a radio pioneer employed by the Navy in Puget Sound , where he conducted early experiments with underwater pilot cables . His results were sufficiently promising that he recommended further development to Commander Stanford C. Hooper . In October , 1919 Commander Hooper instructed A. Crossley , an expert radio aid , to develop and test the concept on a larger scale at the New London Naval Base . Crossley installed a longer version of the cable that Marriott had designed . He used a wooden hulled launch for the first round of tests before moving to a steel @-@ hulled submarine for later tests . Both types of vessel picked up the signal and followed the underwater test cable without problem . 
 = = Installation and testing = = 
 Following the successful tests at New London , the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919 . The minelayer Ord laid a pilot cable composed of 2 @,@ 000 feet of leaded and armored cable , 2 @,@ 000 feet of leaded cable , and 83 @,@ 000 feet of standard rubber @-@ insulated cable . The USS O 'Brien was fitted with receiving equipment and attempted to follow the cable out of the Channel . Unfortunately , it was unable to detect a signal past the 1 @,@ 000 foot mark , where a break in the cable prevented the signal from continuing . The break in the cable was repaired , but over the course of the winter of 1919 @-@ 1920 , crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty @-@ two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid . The damage was irreparable . Going back to the drawing board , engineers tested 150 @-@ foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full @-@ size pilot cable . The Navy ordered 87 @,@ 000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston . 
 Once complete , the cable was loaded onto the USS Pequot in the Boston Navy Yard . The ship arrived in New York on July 31 , 1920 . Ambrose Channel was already crossed by three telegraph cables owned respectively by Western Union , the Army , and the police , all of which had to be raised to the surface so the pilot cable could be laid underneath them . The installation of the cable was completed on August 6 , 1920 , and by August 28 , electrical tests showed that both the sending and receiving circuits were functioning properly . The Navy tested the cable using the seagoing tug USS <unk> . It then invited " representatives of various radio companies , shipping interests , pilots ' associations , governmental bureaus , naval attaches , and others " for a public demonstration on board the destroyer USS Semmes from October 6 through October 9 . The ship 's windows were covered with canvas and the captains took turns navigating using only the audio cues from the cable . 
 The cable was well received . Even before the New London tests , the Washington Post called it " the greatest development in marine travel since the invention of the steam turbine " and the Los Angeles Times declared the technology to be " one of the greatest peacetime gifts that science has devised . " Once operational , the latter newspaper called it " the greatest safeguard devised for shipping in modern history " . According to a 1921 trade magazine , leader cables had five functions : " to enable a ship to make a good landfall in thick weather , to lead a ship up the harbor , to lead a ship from open water through a restricted channel to open water on the far side , to give warning of outlying dangers , and to assist a vessel to keep a straight course from port to port and thus save fuel . " In 1922 , the publication Radio World stated that the cable 's first two years of operation had been successful . Also in 1922 , Radio Broadcast boasted about the money saved by the cable as well as the ease of using it . The cable itself was paid for using public funds , but it was the responsibility of ship owners to outfit their vessels with receiving equipment . Installation of the cable cost roughly $ 50 @,@ 000 and the listening apparatus installed on each ship using the channel cost $ 1 @,@ 200 , compared with hourly costs of delays that ranged from $ 500 to $ 4 @,@ 000 . Radio Broadcast expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft : " ... there is a future for the audio cable ... Its fullest usefulness at American ports and elsewhere waits , however , on that large appreciation of radio devices for sea as well as air navigation which pilots , both on the sea and in the air , expect , but do not as yet demand . " 
 = = Obsolescence and legacy = = 
 Despite the media hype described above , it appears that the Ambrose Channel pilot cable never met with large scale commercial success . Initially , some contemporaries of the cable proposed that it be extended several miles past the Ambrose light . Such plans never came to fruition , as advances in technology rendered the pilot cable obsolete . By 1929 the Baltimore Sun reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable . In that year , Marriott publicly complained that navigation cables still had unrealized potential for guiding ships . Leader cable systems appear to have been obsoleted by the refinement of radio direction finding and the placement of radio beacons ( low @-@ power radios broadcasting an identifiable signal ) at strategic locations . They are analogous to lighthouses , but can be " seen " in all weather , and are used for navigation in the same way as regular lighthouses . The first successful application of these radio beacons as " radio fog signals " were three stations installed near New York in 1921 . In 1924 , there were eleven stations in operation in the United States and nearly three hundred ships suitably equipped . By 1930 , an article in the Journal of the Royal Society of Arts declared that " wireless aids and echo sounding have superseded [ the leader cable ] " . Today , more modern navigation tools such as radar , GPS , and lighted buoys help ships navigate Ambrose Channel . 
 Writing for Popular Mechanics , one of the key players in designing the Ambrose Channel cable viewed it as a step toward applying radio cable technology in vast swaths of everyday life , including guiding aircraft and navigating and powering automobiles . The Ambrose Channel cable was removed from the Channel and used in testing an early system of <unk> . The cable found no more success in that role than it did in guiding ships . The Blind Landing Experimental Unit later tried a similar system briefly before also abandoning it in favor of wireless . 
 = Thunderball ( film ) = 
 Thunderball ( 1965 ) is the fourth spy film in the James Bond series starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . It is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming , which in turn was based on an original screenplay by Jack Whittingham . It was directed by Terence Young with its screenplay by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins . 
 The film follows Bond 's mission to find two NATO atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE , which holds the world to ransom for £ 100 million in diamonds , in exchange for not destroying an unspecified major city in either England or the United States ( later revealed to be Miami ) . The search leads Bond to the Bahamas , where he encounters Emilio Largo , the card @-@ playing , eye patch @-@ wearing SPECTRE Number Two . Backed by CIA agent Felix Leiter and Largo 's mistress , Domino Derval , Bond 's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo 's henchmen . The film had a complex production , with four different units and about a quarter of the film consisting of underwater scenes . Thunderball was the first Bond film shot in widescreen Panavision and the first to have running time of over two hours . 
 Thunderball was associated with a legal dispute in 1961 when former Ian Fleming collaborators Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham sued him shortly after the 1961 publication of the novel , claiming he based it upon the screenplay the trio had earlier written in a failed cinematic translation of James Bond . The lawsuit was settled out of court and Bond film series producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman , fearing a rival McClory film , allowed him to retain certain screen rights to the novel 's story , plot , and characters , and for McClory to receive sole producer credit on this film ; Broccoli and Salzman were instead credited as Executive Producers . 
 The film was a success , earning a total of $ 141 @.@ 2 million worldwide , exceeding the earnings of the three previous Bond films . In 1966 , John Stears won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and production designer Ken Adam was also nominated for a BAFTA award . Thunderball is the most financially successful film of the series after adjusting for inflation . Some critics and viewers showered praise on the film and branded it a welcome addition to the series , while others complained of the repetitively monotonous aquatic action and prolonged length . In 1983 , Warner Bros. released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title Never Say Never Again , with McClory as executive producer . 
 = = Plot = = 
 James Bond — MI6 agent 007 and sometimes simply " 007 " — attends the funeral of Colonel Jacques Bouvar , a SPECTRE operative ( Number 6 ) . Bouvar is alive and disguised as his own widow , but Bond identifies him . Following him to a château , Bond fights and kills him , escaping using a jetpack and his Aston Martin DB5 . 
 Bond is sent by M to the Shrublands clinic to improve his health . While being massaged by physiotherapist Patricia Fearing , he notices Count Lippe , a suspicious man with a criminal tattoo ( from a Tong ) . He searches Lippe 's room , but is seen leaving by Lippe 's clinic neighbour who is bandaged after plastic surgery . Lippe tries to murder Bond with a spinal traction machine , but is foiled by Fearing , whom Bond then seduces . Bond finds a dead bandaged man , François Derval . Derval was a French NATO pilot deployed to fly aboard an Avro Vulcan loaded with two atomic bombs for a training mission . He had been murdered by Angelo , a SPECTRE henchman surgically altered to match his appearance . 
 Angelo takes Derval 's place on the flight , sabotaging the plane and sinking it near the Bahamas . He is then killed by Emilio Largo ( SPECTRE No. 2 ) for trying to extort more money than offered to him . Largo and his henchmen retrieve the stolen atomic bombs from the seabed . After leaving the clinic for a conference , Bond is pursued by Count Lippe through the countryside roads until Lippe and his car are destroyed by SPECTRE agent Fiona Volpe for failing to kill Bond . SPECTRE has demanded £ 100 million in white flawless uncut diamonds from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs . If their demands are not met , SPECTRE will destroy a major city in the United States or the United Kingdom . At the meeting , Bond recognises Derval from a photograph . Since Derval 's sister , Domino , is in Nassau , Bond asks M to send him there , where he discovers Domino is Largo 's mistress . 
 Bond takes a boat to where Domino is snorkelling . After Bond saves her life , the two have lunch together . Later , Bond goes to a party , where he sees Largo and Domino gambling . Bond enters the game against Largo and wins , and subsequently takes Domino to a dance . Recognising each other as adversaries , Bond and Largo begin a tense cat @-@ and @-@ mouse game of attempting to gain advantage over each other while still pretending ignorance of their adversary 's true nature . 
 Bond meets Felix Leiter and Q , and is issued a collection of gadgets , including an underwater infrared camera , a distress beacon , underwater breathing apparatus , a flare gun , and a Geiger counter . Bond attempts to swim underwater beneath Largo 's boat , but is nearly killed . Bond visits Largo at his estate , Palmyra . Bond 's assistant , Paula , is later abducted by Largo for questioning and kills herself before Bond can rescue her . 
 Bond is kidnapped by Fiona but escapes . He is chased through a Junkanoo celebration and enters the Kiss Kiss club . Fiona finds and attempts to kill him , but she is shot by her own bodyguard . Bond and Felix search for the Vulcan , finding it underwater . Bond meets Domino scuba @-@ diving and tells her that Largo killed her brother , asking for help finding the bombs . She tells him where to go to replace a henchman on Largo 's mission to retrieve them from an underwater bunker . Bond gives her his Geiger counter , asking her to look for them on Largo 's ship . She is discovered and captured . Disguised as Largo 's henchman , Bond uncovers Largo 's plan to destroy Miami Beach . 
 Bond is discovered and rescued by Leiter , who orders United States Navy SEALs to parachute to the area . After an underwater battle , the henchmen surrender . Largo escapes to his ship , the Disco Volante , which has one of the bombs on board . Largo attempts to escape by jettisoning the rear of the ship . The front section , a hydrofoil , escapes . Bond , also aboard , and Largo fight ; Largo is about to shoot him when Domino , freed by Largo 's nuclear physicist Ladislav <unk> , kills Largo with a harpoon .

 Originally meant as the first James Bond film , Thunderball was the centre of legal disputes that began in 1961 and ran until 2006 . Former Ian Fleming collaborators Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham sued Fleming shortly after the 1961 publication of the Thunderball novel , claiming he based it upon the screenplay the trio had earlier written in a failed cinematic translation of James Bond . The lawsuit was settled out of court ; McClory retained certain screen rights to the novel 's story , plot , and characters . By then , James Bond was a box office success , and series producers Broccoli and Saltzman feared a rival McClory film beyond their control ; they agreed to McClory 's producer 's credit of a cinematic Thunderball , with them as executive producers . 
 The sources for Thunderball are controversial among film aficionados . In 1961 , Ian Fleming published his novel based upon a television screenplay that he , and others developed into the film screenplay ; the efforts were unproductive , and Fleming expanded the script into his ninth James Bond novel . Consequently , one of his collaborators , Kevin McClory , sued him for plagiarism ; they settled out of court in 1963 . 
 Later , in 1964 , Eon producers Broccoli and Saltzman agreed with McClory to cinematically adapt the novel ; it was promoted as " Ian Fleming 's Thunderball " . Yet , along with the official credits to screenwriters Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins , the screenplay is also identified as based on an original screenplay by Jack Whittingham and as based on the original story by Kevin McClory , Jack Whittingham , and Ian Fleming . To date , the novel has twice been adapted cinematically ; the 1983 Jack Schwartzman @-@ produced Never Say Never Again , features Sean Connery as James Bond , but is not an Eon production . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Broccoli 's original choice for the role of Domino Derval was Julie Christie following her performance in Billy Liar in 1963 . Upon meeting her personally , however , he was disappointed and turned his attentions towards Raquel Welch after seeing her on the cover of the October 1964 issue of Life . Welch , however , was hired by Richard Zanuck of 20th Century Fox to appear in the film Fantastic Voyage the same year instead . Faye Dunaway was also considered for the role and came close to signing for the part . Saltzman and Broccoli auditioned an extensive list of relatively unknown European actresses and models including former Miss Italy Maria Grazia <unk> , Yvonne <unk> of the Hammer horror films and Gloria Paul . Eventually former Miss France Claudine Auger was cast , and the script was rewritten to make her character French rather than Italian , although her lines was redubbed for the final cut . Nevertheless , director Young would cast her once again in his next film , Triple Cross ( 1966 ) . One of the actresses that tried for Domino , Luciana Paluzzi , later accepted the role as the redheaded femme fatale assassin Fiona Kelly who originally was intended by Maibaum to be Irish . The surname was changed to Volpe in co @-@ ordination with Paluzzi 's nationality . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Guy Hamilton was invited to direct , but considered himself worn out and " creatively drained " after the production of Goldfinger . Terence Young , director of the first two Bond films , returned to the series . Coincidentally , when Saltzman invited him to direct Dr. No , Young expressed interest in directing adaptations of Dr. No , From Russia with Love and Thunderball . Years later , Young said Thunderball was filmed " at the right time " , considering that if it was the first film in the series , the low budget ( Dr. No cost only $ 1 million ) would not have yielded good results . Thunderball was the final James Bond film directed by Young . 
 Filming commenced on 16 February 1965 , with principal photography of the opening scene in Paris . Filming then moved to the Château d <unk> , near Dreux , France for the fight in pre @-@ credit sequence . Much of the film was shot in the Bahamas ; Thunderball is widely known for its extensive underwater action scenes which are played out through much of the latter half of the film . The rest of the film was shot at Pinewood Studios , Buckinghamshire , Silverstone racing circuit for the chase involving Count Lippe , Fiona Volpe and James Bond 's Aston Martin DB5 before moving to Nassau , and Paradise Island in the Bahamas ( where most of the footage was shot ) , and Miami . Huntington Hartford gave permission to shoot footage on his Paradise Island and is thanked at the end of the film . 
 On arriving in Nassau McClory searched for possible locations to shoot many of the key sequences of the film and used the home of a local millionaire couple , the Sullivans , for Largo 's estate , Palmyra . Part of the SPECTRE underwater assault was also shot on the coastal grounds of another millionaire 's home on the island . The most difficult sequences to film were the underwater action scenes ; the first to be shot underwater was at a depth of 50 feet to shoot the scene where SPECTRE divers remove the atomic bombs from the sunken Vulcan bomber . Peter Lamont had previously visited a Royal Air Force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close @-@ up shots of secret missiles ( those appearing in the film were not actually present ) . Most of the underwater scenes had to be done at lower tides due to the sharks in the Bahamian sea . 
 Connery 's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Largo 's pool . He had been in fear of this risk when he read the script . He insisted that production designer Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool , but it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it . Connery had to abandon the pool immediately , seconds away from attack . Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian , 
 " We had to use special effects but , unlike special effects today , they were real . The jet pack we used in Thunderball was real - it was invented for the United States army . Bloody dangerous , and it only lasted a couple of minutes . The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo 's boat , the Disco Volante , was real . You had power boats at that time but there were no good @-@ sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots so it was quite a problem . But by combining a hydrofoil , which we bought in Puerto Rico for $ 10 @,@ 000 , and a catamaran , it at least looked like a big yacht . We combined the two hulls with a one @-@ inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream . We used lots of sharks for this movie . I 'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a salt @-@ water pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming . The smell was horrendous . This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten . We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him but I didn 't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through . He never got out of a pool faster in his life - he was walking on water . " 
 Another dangerous situation occurred when special effects coordinator John Stears brought in a supposed dead shark carcass to be towed around the pool . The shark , however , was not dead and revived at one point . Due to the dangers on the set , stuntman Bill Cummings demanded an extra fee of £ 250 to double for Largo 's sidekick Quist as he was dropped into the pool of sharks . 
 The climactic underwater battle was shot at Clifton Pier and was choreographed by Hollywood expert <unk> Browning , who had worked on many films previously such as Creature From the Black Lagoon in 1954 . He was responsible for the staging of the cave sequence and the battle scenes beneath the Disco Volante and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in the onslaught . Voit provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for product placement and film tie @-@ in merchandise . Lamar Boren , an underwater photographer , was brought in to shoot all of the sequences . United States Air Force Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Charles Russhon , who had already helped alliance Eon productions with the local authorities in Turkey for From Russia with Love ( 1963 ) and at Fort Knox for Goldfinger ( 1964 ) , stood by and was able to supply the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the Disco Volante . Russhon , using his position , was also able to gain access to the United States Navy 's Fulton surface @-@ to @-@ air recovery system , used to lift Bond and Domino from the water at the end of the film . Filming ceased in May 1965 and the final scene shot was the physical fight on the bridge of the Disco Volante . 
 While in Nassau , during the final shooting days , special effects supervisor John Stears was supplied experimental rocket fuel to use in exploding Largo 's yacht , the Disco Volante . Ignoring the true power of the volatile liquid , Stears doused the entire yacht with it , took cover , and then detonated the boat . The resultant massive explosion shattered windows along Bay Street in Nassau roughly 30 miles away . Stears went on to win an Academy Award for his work on Thunderball . 
 As the filming neared its conclusion , Connery had become increasingly agitated with press intrusion and was distracted with difficulties in his marriage of 32 months to actress Diane Cilento . Connery refused to speak to journalists and photographers who followed him in Nassau stating his frustration with the harassment that came with the role ; " I find that fame tends to turn one from an actor and a human being into a piece of merchandise , a public institution . Well , I don 't intend to undergo that metamorphosis . " In the end he gave only a single interview , to Playboy , as filming was wrapped up , and even turned down a substantial fee to appear in a promotional TV special made by Wolper Productions for NBC The Incredible World of James Bond . According to editor Peter R. Hunt , Thunderball 's release was delayed for three months , from September until December 1965 , after he met David Picker of United Artists , and convinced him it would be impossible to edit the film to a high enough standard without the extra time .

The rocket belt Bond uses to escape the château actually worked , and was used many times , before and after , for entertainment , most notably at Super Bowl I and at scheduled performances at the 1964 – 1965 New York World 's Fair . 
 Bond receives a spear gun @-@ armed underwater jet pack scuba ( allowing the frogman to manoeuvre faster than other frogmen ) . Designed by Jordan Klein , green dye was meant to be used by Bond as a smoke screen to escape pursuers . Instead <unk> Browning , the film 's underwater director , used it to make Bond 's arrival more dramatic . 
 The sky hook , used to rescue Bond at the end of the film , was a rescue system used by the United States military at the time . At Thunderball 's release , there was confusion as to whether a rebreather such as the one that appears in the film existed ; most Bond gadgets , while implausible , often are based upon real technology . In the real world , a rebreather could not be so small , as it has no room for the breathing bag , while the alternative open @-@ circuit scuba releases exhalation bubbles , which the film device does not . It was made with two CO2 bottles glued together and painted , with a small mouthpiece attached . For this reason , when the Royal Corps of Engineers asked Peter Lamont how long a man could use the device underwater , the answer was " As long as you can hold your breath . " 
 Maurice Binder was hired to design the title sequence , and was involved in a dispute with Eon Production to have his name credited in the film . As Thunderball was the first James Bond film shot in Panavision , Binder had to reshoot the iconic gun barrel scene which permitted him to not only incorporate pinhole photographic techniques to shoot inside a genuine gun barrel , but also made Connery appearing in the sequence for the first time a reality , as stunt man Bob Simmons had doubled for him in the three previous films . Binder gained access to the tank at Pinewood which he used to film the silhouetted title girls who appeared naked in the opening sequence , which was the first time actual nudity ( although concealed ) had ever been seen in a Bond film . 
 On 26 June 2013 Christie 's auction house sold the Breitling SA Top Time watch worn in the film by Sean Connery for over £ 100 @,@ 000 ; given to Bond by Q , it was also a Geiger counter in the plot . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Thunderball was the third James Bond score composed by John Barry , after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger . The original title song was entitled " Mr. Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang " , taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang . The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse ; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey , and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick , whose version was not released until the 1990s . The song was removed from the title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics . Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote " Thunderball " , which was sung by Tom Jones who , according to Bond production legend , fainted in the recording booth when singing the song 's final note . Jones said of it , " I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning . " 
 Country musician Johnny Cash also submitted a song to Eon productions titled " Thunderball " , but it went unused .

It eventually grossed $ 63 @.@ 6 million in the United States , equating to roughly 58 @.@ 1 million admissions . In total , the film has earned $ 141 @.@ 2 million worldwide , surpassing the earnings of the three preceding films in the series — easily recouping its $ 9 million budget — and remained the highest @-@ grossing Bond film until Live and Let Die ( 1973 ) assumed the record . After adjusting its earnings to 2011 prices , it has made approximately $ 1 billion , making it the second most financially successful Bond film after Skyfall . 
 Thunderball won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects awarded to John Stears in 1966 . Ken Adam the production director was also nominated for a Best Production Design BAFTA award . The film won the Golden Screen Award in Germany and the Golden Laurel Action Drama award at the 1966 Laurel Awards . The film was also nominated for an Edgar Best Foreign Film award at the Edgar Allan Poe Awards .

 Upon its release the film received generally positive reviews . Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times remarked after seeing the film that " The cinema was a duller place before 007 . " David Robinson of The Financial Times criticised the appearance of Connery and his effectiveness to play Bond in the film remarking : " It 's not just that Sean Connery looks a lot more haggard and less heroic than he did two or three years ago ; but there is much less effort to establish him as connoisseur playboy .

 According to Danny Peary , Thunderball " takes forever to get started and has too many long underwater sequences during which it 's impossible to tell what 's going on . Nevertheless , it 's an enjoyable entry in the Bond series . Sean Connery is particularly appealing as Bond – I think he projects more confidence than in other films in the series . Film has no great scene , but it 's entertaining as long as the actors stay above water . " . 
 Critics such as James Berardinelli praised Connery 's performance , the femme fatale character of Fiona Volpe and the underwater action sequences , remarking that they were well choreographed and clearly shot . He criticised the length of the scenes , however , and believed they were too long and in need of editing , particularly during the film 's climax . At Rotten Tomatoes , the film received an 86 % " fresh " rating . In 2014 Time Out polled several film critics , directors , actors and stunt actors to list their top action films ; Thunderball was listed at number 73 . 
 = The Messenger : The Story of Joan of Arc = 
 The Messenger : The Story of Joan of Arc ( French : Jeanne d 'Arc ) is a 1999 French historical drama film directed by Luc Besson . The film stars Milla Jovovich , John Malkovich , Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman . The screenplay was written by Besson and Andrew Birkin , and the original music score was composed by Éric Serra . 
 The Messenger portrays the story of St. Joan of Arc , the French war heroine and religious martyr of the 15th century . The story begins with young Joan as she witnesses the atrocities of the English against her family , and she is portrayed as having visions that inspire her to lead the French in battle against the occupying English forces . Her success in routing the English allows Charles VII to take the throne . Eventually Joan is tried and executed for heresy . 
 Besson 's previous film , The Fifth Element , which also starred Jovovich , was a critical and financial success , and it had a positive influence on both their careers . The Messenger was intended to follow up that success and cement the status of Besson and Jovovich in film . However , the film received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office , earning just under $ 67 million on an $ 60 million budget . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As a child , Joan has a violent and supernatural vision . She returns home to find her village burning . Her sister Catherine tries to protect her by hiding her from the attacking English forces , part of a longstanding rivalry with France . Joan , while hiding , witnesses the brutal murder and rape of her sister . Afterward , Joan is taken in by distant relatives . 
 Several years later at Chinon , the Dauphin and soon to be King of France , Charles VII ( John Malkovich ) , receives a message from the now adult Joan ( Milla Jovovich ) , asking him to provide an army to lead into battle against the occupying English . After meeting him and his mother @-@ in @-@ law Yolande of Aragon ( Faye Dunaway ) she describes her visions . Desperate , he believes her prophecy . 
 Clad in armor , Joan leads the French army to the besieged city of Orléans . She gives the English a chance to surrender , which they refuse . The armies ' commanders , skeptical of Joan 's leadership , initiate the next morning 's battle to take over the stockade at St. Loup without her . By the time she arrives on the battlefield , the French soldiers are retreating . Joan ends the retreat and leads another charge , successfully capturing the fort . They proceed to the enemy stronghold called the " Tourelles " . Joan gives the English another chance to surrender , but they refuse . Joan leads the French soldiers to attack the Tourelles , though the English defenders inflict heavy casualties , also wounding Joan . Nevertheless , Joan leads a second attack the following day . As the English army regroups , the French army moves to face them across an open field . Joan rides alone toward the English and offers them a final chance to surrender and return to England . The English accept her offer and retreat . 
 Joan returns to Rheims to witness the coronation of Charles VII of France . Her military campaigns then continue to the walls of Paris , though she does not receive her requested reinforcements , and the siege is a failure . Joan tells King Charles VII to give her another army , but he refuses , saying he now prefers diplomacy over warfare . Believing she threatens his position , Charles conspires to get rid of Joan by allowing her to be captured by enemy forces . She is taken prisoner by the pro @-@ English Burgundians at Compiègne , who sell her to the English . 
 Charged with the crime of heresy , based on her claim of visions and signs from God , she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding , which is forced by the English occupation government . The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive , based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison . Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God . About to be burned for heresy , Joan is distraught that she will be executed without making a final confession . The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession . Joan signs the recantation . The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English , saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic . Whilst in her cell , Joan in confronted by an unnamed cloaked man ( Dustin Hoffman ) , who is implied to be Joan 's conscience . The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God . 
 The frustrated English devise another way to have Joan executed by the church . English soldiers go into Joan 's cell room , rip her clothes and give her men 's clothing to wear . They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear , suggesting that she is a witch who must be burned . Although suspecting the English are lying , the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate , and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen .

 Luc Besson stated that he was not interested in narrating the history of Joan of Arc ; rather , he wanted to pull a message out of history that is relevant for today . Besson states that in order to achieve this he stepped away from the factual narrative of the 15th century , instead trying to get behind the " exterior envelope " and into both the emotional effect and affect of Joan . In the book The Films of Luc Besson , Susan Hayward interprets this as meaning Besson sought to follow Joan emotionally , revealing her doubts and demonstrating that one cannot return intact from the experience of war . 
 As the medievalist Gwendolyn Morgan observes , Joan 's sanity is a continuing theme throughout the film , beginning with the priest questioning her as a child and ending with her conversations with ' The Conscience ' in the film 's final scenes . Scholars view The Conscience as providing a postmodern explanation of Joan 's visions . At the time that Joan lived , her voices and visions would not have been doubted . John <unk> , writing in the book A Knight at the Movies stated the filmmakers invented The Conscience to satisfy a modern audience that is aware of mental illness . The film was also said to have " feminist undercurrents " ; after Joan witnesses the rape of her sister , her crusade is said to become " a fight against male domination and the abuse of women . " Writing in <unk> , Nickolas Haydock also considered the witnessing of her sister 's murder and rape to be an alternate psychological motivation for Joan to want to fight the English , rather than just her visions . 
 Haydock also considered a theme in the film to be the inability of the church to fulfill individual spiritual needs . This is said to be shown through many of Joan 's encounters with the church ; as a girl she is scolded for going to confession too often , denied communion and forced to sneak into the church to take it herself , and during her trial , where she is denied confession until The Conscience confesses her instead . 
 Writing in Studies in Medievalism XIII , Christa <unk> considered anti @-@ intellectualism to be present in The Messenger ; Joan admits to not knowing how to read or write and has not received any formal education , military or otherwise , yet triumphs over those who have . Haydock commented that Joan possesses a quick wit which she uses against the unrelenting accusatory questions provided by her " intellectual superiors " during the trial . Joan also manages to triumph in battle where those with more experience and knowledge could not , made especially apparent by her use of a siege weapon backward to force open a gate . 
 = = Production = = 
 Luc Besson was originally hired as executive producer for a film that was to be directed by Kathryn Bigelow . Bigelow had been developing ideas for a Joan of Arc film for about a decade . Her film was to be entitled Company of Angels , with Jay Cocks hired to write the script . The film was to be made with Besson 's assistance and financial backing . In July 1996 contracts between Bigelow and Besson were exchanged , which gave Besson the right to be consulted on casting in addition to his personal fee . According to Bigelow , eight weeks prior to filming , Besson realised that his then wife , Milla Jovovich , was not going to be cast as Joan , and he subsequently withdrew his support from the film , and with it the support of his financial backers . Bigelow threatened legal action for breach of contract and " stealing her research " ; the matter was settled out of court . After Besson left , he commenced production of his own Joan of Arc project , The Messenger , with Jovovich given the lead role ; the production of Company of Angels disbanded shortly thereafter . The Messenger was intended to follow up the success Besson and Jovovich achieved with their previous collaboration , The Fifth Element . 
 Filming took place in the Czech Republic . A stuntman died in an accident during the first weeks of filming . Besson was said to have become completely uncommunicative after the incident , only appearing on set to shout orders at people . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 The soundtrack for the film was composed by Éric Serra and released as an album via Sony Music Entertainment . It was Serra 's eighth collaboration with director Luc Besson , having composed soundtracks for seven of Besson 's previous films including La Femme Nikita and Léon : The Professional . The album runs for about 64 minutes , and some form of music is playing during about 90 percent of the film . Commentators noted the change in Serra 's work , which had traditionally relied heavily on synthesizer effects . The Messenger , on the other hand , is a primarily orchestral score as justified by the film 's historical context , though synthesized effects are still used in some tracks . Writing in The Films of Luc Besson , Mark Brownrigg stated Serra 's score completed his " evolution " from pop @-@ score writer to orchestral film composer ; Serra 's previous score for The Fifth Element had also used orchestral elements . They gave a favourable review of the score , though criticised the music that is heard during Joan 's death , describing it as an unimaginative paraphrasing of Carmina Burana . Heather Phares from Allmusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars , stating it " combines orchestral , rock , and electronic elements for a sweeping , cinematic experience . " Dan Goldwasser from Soundtrack.net gave the soundtrack 4 out of 5 , stating it was " very satisfying to listen to " , though he expressed disappointment with the absence on the soundtrack of a particular piece of music present during Joan 's discussion with The Conscience . 
 = = Historical accuracy = = 
 The scene in which Joan witnesses her sister 's murder and posthumous rape by English soldiers in their village is entirely a fictional construction . Joan and her family fled their village before it was attacked , and it was actually attacked by the Burgundians , not the English . In the film Joan is seen experiencing visions as a young child when the historical Joan asserted that these visions began around the age of 13 . Joan is also seen finding her sword in a field as a child , whereas historically it was uncovered many years later on her journey to Chinon . 
 Hayward credits Besson with showing the collaboration between the Burgundians and the English more accurately than previous filmmakers . Many lines during scenes of Joan 's trial are taken verbatim from Joan 's real trial transcript . Joan is shown receiving both wounds she was given in real life ( an arrow above the breast and later an arrow to the leg ) , and the film includes some of the 15th @-@ century accounts associated with Joan , such as being able to pick out Charles VII from among a group of his courtiers at Chinon . The examining of Joan 's virginity was a real test Joan had to complete to prove her merit . 
 Joan 's visions are portrayed as being of a tatty Christ on a derelict wooden throne . Joan 's own description of them was that she saw St. Michael , St. Catherine and St. Margaret in their glory . The most glaring inconsistency is the androgynous portrayal of Joan by Mila Jovovich . Several eyewitnesses said that the real Joan was " beautiful and shapely " and similar descriptions of her femininity . However other writers have come to the conclusion that she must have been sexually unattractive to survive her military career .

Also praising the action scenes , Wells stated that the film 's main strength was its " adult ambiguities and relationships " ; its decision not to portray Joan as a " super @-@ hero " , but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar , concluding , " This film , as most things that involve religion , is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally .

 = Moorish Gibraltar = 
 The history of Moorish Gibraltar began with the landing of the Muslims in Hispania and the fall of the Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo in 711 and ended with the fall of Gibraltar to Christian hands 751 years later , in 1462 , with an interregnum during the early 14th century . 
 The Muslim presence in Gibraltar began on 27 April 711 when the Berber general Tariq ibn @-@ Ziyad led the initial incursion into Iberia in advance of the main Moorish force under the command of Musa ibn <unk> , Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya . Gibraltar was named after Tariq , who was traditionally said to have landed on the shores of the Rock of Gibraltar , though it seems more likely that he landed somewhere nearby . Muslim sources claimed that Tariq established some kind of fortification on the Rock , but no evidence has been found and it is not considered credible . It was not until 1160 that a first fortified settlement was built there . 
 The Madinat al @-@ Fath ( English : City of Victory ) was intended to be a major city furnished with palaces and mosques , but it seems to have fallen well short of the ambitions of its founder , the Almohad caliph Abd al @-@ Mu 'min , by the time it was captured by the Kingdom of Castile in 1309 after a short siege . Muslim control was restored in 1333 after another , much longer , siege . The city subsequently underwent a major expansion and refortification . A number of buildings and structures from this period still exist , including the Moorish Castle , parts of the Moorish walls , a bath @-@ house and a subterranean reservoir . 
 Gibraltar was subjected to several more sieges before its final fall on 20 August 1462 ( feast of St. Bernard ) to Christian forces under the 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia . The population , Muslim and Jewish , was expelled en masse and replaced by Christian settlers . 
 = = Early years of Muslim conquest = = 
 Gibraltar 's Islamic history began with the arrival of Tariq ibn @-@ Ziyad on 27 April 711 at the start of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania . Traditionally , Tariq was said to have landed on the shores of the Rock of Gibraltar , which was henceforth named after him ( Jabal @-@ ı <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , English : " Mountain of Tariq " – a name which was later corrupted into " Gibraltar " by the Spanish ) . However , according to one early Islamic account , Tariq " cast anchor close to a mountain which received his name " , rather than actually landing at Gibraltar . Another account , by the 9th @-@ century Egyptian historian Ibn ' Abd al @-@ Hakam , describes Gibraltar as lying between the points of departure and disembarkation rather than being the actual landing place . According to this account , the possibly legendary Julian , Count of Ceuta – an ally of Tariq who was estranged from Roderic , the Visigothic king of Hispania – transported the Muslim forces in ships which " in no way seemed different from " those which " plied across the Strait for trade . " Spanish accounts corroborate this with the detail that the invasion force was transported " in merchant ships that the reason for their crossing should not be <unk> . " Gibraltar would have been a poor place to land due to its relative isolation and difficult rocky terrain , and it is more likely that Tariq either landed in the vicinity of the former Roman colony of Carteia at the head of the Bay of Gibraltar or on the Alboran coast north of Gibraltar around La <unk> ( now a barrio of La Línea de la Concepción in Spain ) , where a landing would have been less conspicuous . 
 It has been argued that some kind of fortification was probably constructed at Gibraltar thereafter . According to the 13th century Kurdish historian Ali ibn al @-@ Athir , Tariq built a fort on The Rock , but this was " only for temporary use , and after he had captured the area of Algeciras , he abandoned it ... He descended from the mountains to the desert tract and conquered Algeciras and other places , and he abandoned the fort which was in the mountain . " The " fort " probably consisted of no more than a look @-@ out post on the Rock to observe movements in and around the bay during the period of landing ; there would have been little need for anything more substantial ( as better landing points such as Algeciras or Tarifa were in his hands ) , and Tariq would not have had the manpower to construct a sizeable fortification . No mention to a permanent occupation of Gibraltar is found in Arab or Christian chronicles , nor archaeological evidence is found until the 12th century . 
 As the rest of Al @-@ Andalus , Gibraltar was initially part of the territory of the Umayyad Caliphate before passing to the Spanish branch of the Umayyads , which broke away from the main Caliphate after the Abbasid Revolution . Around 1035 , the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba splintered into a series of independent taifa kingdoms . The Taifa of Algeciras included Gibraltar and managed to maintain its own independence only until 1056 , when it was forcibly absorbed into the Taifa of Seville . By the mid @-@ 1060s Seville faced the threat of invasion from the Almoravids of North Africa . The kingdom 's ruler , Abbad II al @-@ Mu 'tadid , was conscious that the Almoravids could repeat Tariq 's feat of three centuries earlier and bring an invasion force across the Strait before the garrison at Algeciras could react . In 1068 he ordered the Governor of Algeciras to " build a fort on Gibraltar , and to be on guard and watch events on the other side of the straits . " 
 However , nothing seems to have been done before the death of Abbad II in 1069 . The Almoravids did come , in 1086 , but at the invitation of the taifa kings whose territories were threatened by the expansionist Christian king Alfonso VI of León and Castile . Yusuf ibn Tashfin incorporated the taifas into the Almoravid realm in 1090 , but they reemerged 50 years later following the political disintegration of the Almoravid state . The Almoravids ' successors , the Almohads , returned to Spain in 1146 and gained control of the taifas once again . <unk> by Alfonso VII of León and Castile and Alfonso I of Aragon into Muslim @-@ held territory in Al @-@ Andalus had shown that the area around Algeciras needed to be more strongly defended . The Almohad caliph Abd al @-@ Mu 'min therefore ordered the construction of a fortified city on Gibraltar , to be called the Madinat al @-@ Fath ( the " City of Victory " ) . 
 = = Madinat al @-@ Fath = = 
 Abd al @-@ Mu 'min 's order , issued on 19 March 1160 , charged two of the most important architects of the day with the task of building Madinat al @-@ Fath . Al @-@ Hajj Ya 'is of Málaga , a renowned mathematician , was assisted by Ahmad ibn <unk> , an experienced architect . Abd al @-@ Mu 'min ordered that the city should have a mosque , several palaces for himself and his sons , and reservoirs to provide a supply of water . It was to be protected by a " wall of fine build " with a single gate known as the Bab al @-@ Fath ( English : Gate of Victory ) facing towards the isthmus connecting Gibraltar with the mainland . A harbour was also to be constructed , and windmills were to be constructed on the Rock . 
 It is unclear how much of Madinat al @-@ Fath was actually built , since after the death of Abd al @-@ Mu 'min , his son and successor Abu Yaqub Yusuf preferred Seville as his capital . A portion of wall some 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) long still survives to the south of the main part of the city of Gibraltar , of similar design to defensive walls in Morocco . It may have protected a settlement on the upper part of the Rock , around where the modern Queen 's Road is , but firm archaeological evidence is lacking . In fact , there is no mention of any settlement in Gibraltar either in Arabic or Spanish contemporary sources between the project of Madinat al @-@ Fath and the capture of the town by the Christians in 1309 . 
 = = The Battle for the Strait = = 
 In the late thirteen and early fourteenth centuries , Castile , the Marinids of Morocco and the Nasrids of Granada fought for the control of the Strait of Gibraltar . This " battle " ( Spanish : la Cuestión del <unk> ) is a major chapter in the history of the Christian reconquest of Spain . It was within this framework of clashes between said powers to bring under control such a strategic area when Gibraltar definitely appeared on the scene . 
 With the implosion of the Almohad Caliphate and the Reconquista onslaught of the 1220 – 40s , the north shore of the Strait of Gibraltar came under the jurisdiction of the Nasrid Emirate of Granada , a reduced successor state to al @-@ Andalus . As a dependency of nearby Algeciras , Gibraltar was probably given along with Algeciras in 1274 , by the Nasrid sultan Muhammad II to Abu Yusuf Yaqub , the Marinid sultan of Morocco , as payment for his intervention in Spain on Granada 's behalf against Castilian encroachments . ( other sources mention 1275 as the date when the Sultan of Granada handed over Tarifa , Algeciras and Gibraltar to the Marinids for their use as base ports ) . In 1292 , in his pursuit of controlling the Strait , the troops of Sancho IV of Castile laid siege to Tarifa and easily took it . Under the governorship of Guzmán el Bueno , " the Good " , Tarifa was unsuccessfully besieged by the Marinids two years later . As a result , the North African rulers decided to retreated to <unk> and sell their remaining ports to the sultans of Granada . 
 Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the Madinat al @-@ Fath project , there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar , and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292 . After the capture of the city , it was expected that Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras ( it did not eventually happen ) in order to sever the most direct links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula . The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have led to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras . That way , Gibraltar would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a fallback position should Algeciras have fallen . At the same time , and with the increased presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits , Gibraltar provided an excellent lookout post . 
 Some years after the events in Tarifa , a quarrel erupted between the Marinids and the Nasrids , in 1306 . The Nasrids promptly sponsored the rebellion of Uthman ibn Idris , a pretender to the Marinid throne in Morocco . Uthman was landed by a Nasrid force in Ceuta , and quickly carved out an enclave . The rebels continued to receive support across the strait from the Nasrid garrisons . It is believed that the Marinid sultan Abu al @-@ Rabi Sulayman , unable to dislodge the rebel from Ceuta , intrigued with the Castilians , whose truce with Granada was about to expire , encouraging them to take Algeciras and Gibraltar and cut the rebel off . The first siege of Gibraltar was a side @-@ operation of the main Castilian siege of Algeciras in 1309 – 10 . 
 The siege was brief . It seems clear that the defences of Madinat al @-@ Fath were lacking as the Castilians succeeded in capturing Gibraltar in 1309 . The Castilian account of the First Siege of Gibraltar indicates that it was only a small place , with " one thousand one hundred and twenty @-@ five Moors " within at the time of its fall . Only two siege engines and a few hundred men were needed to reduce it . After the conquest and the expulsion of the town 's population , Ferdinand IV of Castile ordered the defences to be strengthened with the walls repaired , a keep constructed above the town and a dockyard ( <unk> ) to be built to house galleys . However , the main siege of Algeciras failed , and the Castilians struck a deal with the Granadan sultan allowing them to hold on to Gibraltar . 
 The loss of Gibraltar led to the deposition of the Nasrid sultan of Granada by his brother Nasr , who quickly reversed policy , abandoned the rebels in Ceuta and gave Algeciras ( and thus the claim on Gibraltar ) to the Marinids in 1310 , as part of a new treaty , hoping they might recover it . But too busy elsewhere for any entanglements in Spain , the Marinids gave Algeciras back to Granada almost immediately after . The <unk> launched an attempt to recover Gibraltar by themselves in 1315 , but without Marinid support , the Second Siege of Gibraltar faltered and failed . 
 The Castilians held Gibraltar for over twenty years , until a new deal was struck in 1333 between the Nasrid sultan Muhammad IV of Granada and the Marinid sultan Abu al @-@ Hasan Ali ibn Othman of Morocco . Moroccan forces crossed the strait to Algeciras and began the third siege of Gibraltar in 1333 . This was a much more serious effort , lasting four and a half months , and was mounted by a combined Granadan @-@ Moroccan force . The population of Spanish Christians was reduced to eating their own shoes and belts before the town 's governor , Vasco Pérez de Meira , surrendered on 17 June 1333 . However , Muhammad IV was assassinated almost immediately after , in a conspiracy organized by enemies of the Marinids in the Granadan court . The Marinid sultan Abu al @-@ Hasan retained both Algeciras and Gibraltar in Moroccan hands . 
 The Castilians immediately mounted an unsuccessful fourth siege which ended after two months . Following the restoration of peace , Abu al @-@ Hasan ordered a refortification of Gibraltar " with strong walls as a halo surrounds the crescent moon " . Many details of the rebuilt city are known due to the work of Abu al @-@ Hasan 's biographer , Ibn <unk> , whose Musnad ( written around 1370 – 1 ) describes the reconstruction of Gibraltar . The city was expanded , and a new defensive wall was built to cover the western and southern flanks , with towers and connecting passages added to strengthen them . The existing fortifications were also strengthened and repaired . The weak points that the Castilians had exploited were improved . 
 = = Final century of Moorish Gibraltar = = 
 The refortified city – the final incarnation of Moorish Gibraltar – stood in the north @-@ eastern part of the present @-@ day city , reaching from the area of Grand Casemates Square up to Upper Castle Road . It was divided into three main quarters . At the top was the Tower of Homage ( just part of the Moorish Castle but usually referred to as such ) , a formidable square keep situated within a kasbah . The tower had the largest footprint of all the towers to be built in Al @-@ Andalus ( 320 square metres ( 3 @,@ 400 sq ft ) ) . It was a much @-@ strengthened rebuilding of an earlier tower and still bears scars on its eastern wall from projectiles shot by the Castilians during the siege of 1333 . The kasbah could only be accessed via a single gate , which still survives ; an inscription visible up to the 18th century recorded that it had been dedicated to Yusuf I , Sultan of Granada . 
 Below the kasbah was an area later called the Villa Vieja ( English : Old Town ) by the Spanish , accessed via the Bab el @-@ Granada ( English : Granada Gate ) , and below that was a port area called La Barcina by the Spanish , which may have taken its name from the Galley House ( Arabic : Dar el @-@ <unk> ) built there by the Moors . It had three separate access gates : the Land Gate ( now the Landport Gate ) , the Sea Gate ( now the Grand Casemates Gates ) and a southern gate , the Barcina Gate . The core of the city was surrounded by substantial defensive walls with tall towers topped by merlons . Other than the Tower of Homage , two such towers still survive ; one square based which was fitted with a clock in Victorian times and another constructed en bec ( beaked , a design intended to resist mining ) . The walls were at first built using <unk> , a lime @-@ based mortar made with the local sand and faced with decorative brickwork to simulate masonry . The builders later changed their construction methods to utilise stone interlaced with brick , a rather stronger structure . The southern flank of the walls has survived relatively intact , and vestiges of the other walls are most likely still to be found underlying the modern defensive walls constructed by the British . To the south of the fortified city was an urban area known as the Turba al Hamra , literally the " red sands " , named after the predominant colouration of the soil in that area . Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1353 – 4 and wrote : 
 I walked round the mountain and saw the marvellous works executed on it by our master , the late Sultan of Morocco , and the armament with which he equipped it , together with the additions made thereto by our master Abu <unk> , may God strengthen him ... [ He ] strengthened the wall of the extremity of the mount , which is the most formidable and useful of its walls . 
 A number of other Moorish remnants are still visible in Gibraltar today . A <unk> or bath @-@ house , similar to examples in Fez in Morocco , was built in the lower town ; its remnants can still be seen today incorporated into the Gibraltar Museum . It was built using Roman and Visigothic capitals , perhaps salvaged from the nearby ruined city of Carteia . The bath @-@ house may have been part of the Moorish governor 's house . A mosque was built in the city centre and was later converted by the Spanish into a Catholic church ( now the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned ) . A small mosque was built near Europa Point at the southern tip of Gibraltar and was later converted into the Christian Shrine of Our Lady of Europe . A subterranean reservoir , now known as the Nun 's Well , was also built at Europa Point for the supply of water to the city . An existing 12th @-@ century wall along the sea shore was extended to Europa Point to block access to places where landings could be made by sea . Much of the remainder of Moorish Gibraltar was obliterated by the destruction caused by the Great Siege of Gibraltar in 1779 – 83 and is now buried below the strengthened fortifications and rebuilding implemented by the British afterwards . 
 = = Fall of the city = = 
 The powerful Marinid sultan Abu al @-@ Hasan was severely defeated by the Christian kings at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340 . Marinid Morocco subsequently went into internal convulsions , too busy for active intervention in Spain , clearing the way for a renewed attempt by the Castilians on Algeciras and Gibraltar . Algeciras was taken with relative ease by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1344 . Gibraltar , however , would not fall as easily . The <unk> subjected it to a fifth siege between 1349 – 50 . It ended when Alfonso XI died from bubonic plague during the Black Death . 
 In 1374 control of Gibraltar was transferred from Marinid Morocco to Nasrid Granada . In 1410 , however , the Moorish garrison revolted and declared their allegiance to Morocco , leading to the sixth siege in 1411 when the Granadan Nasrids stormed the city with assistance from sympathisers within the walls . 
 Another attempt to capture the city for the Christians was made by Enrique de Guzmán , Second Count of Niebla . The Seventh Siege of Gibraltar ended in disaster on 31 August 1436 when a landing led by Enrique resulted in his drowning at the Red Sands along with 40 knights and men @-@ at @-@ arms . His body was retrieved by the Moors , beheaded and displayed in a wicker basket above Gibraltar 's Sea Gate for the next 26 years . 
 Finally , on 20 August 1462 , Enrique 's son Juan Alonso de Guzmán , 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia succeeded in capturing Gibraltar after launching a surprise attack . His success in the brief Eighth Siege of Gibraltar was due to the garrison being greatly depleted after its men of rank had left for Granada , with their retinues , to pay homage to the newly enthroned sultan Abu l @-@ Hasan Ali . An initial assault by the Count of Arcos was beaten back with many casualties on both sides , but the men of the garrison realised that in their depleted state they could not withstand a second assault . They offered to surrender on condition that the garrison and inhabitants of Gibraltar would be allowed to leave with their wives , children and movable goods , with compensation to be paid for the property that they left behind . Although the proposal was welcomed , it fell through due to rivalry between the Christian commanders . The Moorish inhabitants of Gibraltar retreated to the castle and surrendered after a few days to Medina Sidonia . They were expelled along with the city 's Jewish population , to be replaced by Spanish Christians . 
 The Reconquista of Gibraltar took place on the feast of St. Bernard , who the Spanish named patron saint of Gibraltar and has remained so ever since . This brought an end to Moorish Gibraltar , just over 751 years after Tariq ibn @-@ Ziyad had begun the conquest of Iberia . 
 = CAM ship = 
 CAM ships were World War II @-@ era British merchant ships used in convoys as an emergency stop @-@ gap until sufficient escort carriers became available . CAM ship is an acronym for catapult aircraft merchant ship . A CAM ship was equipped with a rocket @-@ propelled catapult launching a single Hawker Hurricane , dubbed a " <unk> " or " <unk> " . CAM ships continued to carry their normal cargoes after conversion . They are distinguished from fighter catapult ships ( FCS ) , which also carried catapult launched fighters , in that the CAM ship was a merchant vessel commanded and crewed by the Merchant Navy but the FCS was a merchant ship that had been commissioned as a warship and commanded and crewed by the Royal Navy . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The German Luftwaffe had Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 " Condor " aircraft with a range of nearly 2 @,@ 000 nautical miles . After the Fall of France , these aircraft could operate from western France against British merchant ships in the Atlantic . Flying from Bordeaux – Mérignac Airport , Fw 200s of I / <unk> could reach the convoy lanes west of Britain while staying outside the range of British land @-@ based fighters . The Royal Navy had no aircraft carriers available to provide close air cover for the convoys . The Fw 200s could shadow convoys , directing U @-@ boat attacks on them , or drop bombs on convoy ships , without opposition and to deadly effect . 
 To counter this threat , the Admiralty developed the fighter catapult ship – a converted freighter , manned by a naval crew , carrying a single Hawker Hurricane fighter . When an enemy bomber was sighted , the fighter would be launched into the air with rockets , and fly up to destroy or drive away the bomber . Being large and slow , the Fw 200 became a rather vulnerable target . After the combat , the fighter pilot would bail out or ditch in the ocean near the convoy , and be picked up if all went well . 
 The Admiralty had already experimented with this system . They ordered 50 rocket @-@ propelled aircraft catapults to be fitted to merchant ships . The planes were Hurricane Mark Is , converted to Sea Hurricane <unk> . 
 The pilots for these aircraft were drawn from the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . The RAF formed the Merchant Ship Fighter Unit ( MSFU ) on 5 May 1941 in RAF Speke by the River Mersey in Liverpool . Wing Commander E.S. Moulton @-@ Barrett commanded the unit providing training for volunteer pilots , Fighter Direction Officers ( <unk> ) , and airmen . After training , MSFU crews were posted to Liverpool , Glasgow , or Avonmouth where they assisted in loading their Hurricanes onto the catapults . Each team consisted of one pilot for Atlantic runs ( or two pilots for voyages to Russia , Gibraltar , or the Mediterranean Sea ) , with one fitter , one rigger , one radio @-@ telephone operator , one <unk> , and a seaman <unk> who worked on the catapult as an electrician . 
 MSFU crews signed ship 's articles as civilian crew members under the authority of the civilian ship 's master . The ship 's chief engineer became responsible for the catapult , and the first mate acted as Catapult Duty Officer ( CDO ) , responsible for firing the catapult when directed . The single Hurricane fighter was launched only when enemy aircraft were sighted and agreement was reached via hand and flag signals between the pilot , CDO , and ship 's master . 
 The first four or five ships were taken into Royal Navy service as " Auxiliary Fighter Catapult Ships " , and later conversions were officially named <unk> manned by merchant crews . The first CAM ship , Michael E , was sponsored by the Royal Navy while the RAF <unk> were working up . After a trial launch off Belfast , Michael E sailed with convoy OB 327 on 28 May 1941 . She was sunk by U @-@ 108 on 2 June . The first RAF trial CAM launch was from Empire Rainbow , at Greenock on the River Clyde on 31 May 1941 ; the Hurricane landed at Abbotsinch . Six CAM ships joined convoys in June 1941 . When a CAM ship arrived at its destination , the pilot usually launched and landed at a nearby airfield to get in as much flight time as possible before his return trip . Pilots were rotated out of CAM assignments after two round @-@ trip voyages to avoid the deterioration of flying skills from the lack of flying time during the assignment . 
 CAM sailings were initially limited to North American convoys with aircraft maintenance performed by the Royal Canadian Air Force at Dartmouth , Nova Scotia . CAM ships sailed on Gibraltar and Freetown convoys beginning in September , 1941 , after an aircraft maintenance unit was established at the RAF base at North Front , Gibraltar . No CAM aircraft were provided during January and February 1942 after it proved impossible to maintain the catapult @-@ mounted aircraft in flying order during the North Atlantic winter . CAM sailings resumed on 6 March 1942 on North Atlantic convoys and in April on the Arctic Russian convoys with a RAF aircraft maintenance unit in Archangelsk .

 An airman removed the pins , showed them to the pilot , and took them to the CDO . 
 The pilot applied 30 degree flaps and 1 / 3 right rudder . 
 The CDO raised a blue flag above his head to inform the ship 's master of his readiness to launch . 
 The ship 's master manoeuvred the ship into the wind and raised a blue flag above his head to authorise the launch . ( The ship 's master stood on the starboard bridge wing to avoid the catapult rocket blast which sometimes damaged the port side of the bridge . ) 
 The CDO waved his blue flag indicating he was ready to launch upon a signal from the pilot . 
 The pilot opened full throttle , tightened the throttle friction nut , pressed his head back into the head @-@ rest , pressed his right elbow tightly against his hip , and lowered his left hand as a signal to launch . 
 The CDO counted to three , waited for the bow to rise from the trough of a swell , and moved the switch to fire the catapult rockets .

 As adequate numbers of escort carriers became available , CAM sailings on North American and Arctic Russian convoys were discontinued in August 1942 . The aircraft maintenance unit was withdrawn from Archangel in September 1942 . Catapults were removed from ten of the 26 surviving CAM ships while the remaining 16 continued to sail with the Mediterranean and Freetown convoys . Headquarters RAF Fighter Command ordered all <unk> to be disbanded commencing 8 June 1943 . The combat launches from homeward bound convoy SL 133 were from the last two operational CAM ships to sail , the last MSFU was disbanded 7 September 1943 . Twelve of the 35 CAM ships had been sunk while sailing on 170 round trip voyages . Two more ships , Cape Clear and City of Johannesburg , were briefly fitted with dummy catapults and aircraft for deception purposes in late 1941 . 
 = Marine Harvest = 
 Marine Harvest ASA , Pan Fish prior to February 6 , 2007 , is a Norwegian seafood company with operations in a number of countries around the world . The company 's primary interest is the production , processing and sale of farmed salmon , the operations of which are focused on Norway , Scotland , Canada , the Faroe Islands , Ireland and Chile . The group has a share of between 25 and 30 % of the global salmon and trout market , making it the world 's largest company in the sector . Marine Harvest also owns a ' value added processing ' unit , which prepares and distributes a range of seafood products , and a number of smaller divisions . 
 The company assumed its current form as a result of massive expansion in 2006 , when Pan Fish ASA conducted an effective three @-@ way merger with Marine Harvest N.V. and Fjord Seafood . The group is headquartered in Bergen and is dual @-@ listed on both the Oslo Stock Exchange where it is a constituent of the benchmark <unk> Index , and the New York Stock Exchange .

 The first company to use the name Marine Harvest was founded in <unk> , Scotland by Unilever in 1965 at the outset of the Atlantic salmon farming industry . Unilever had been developing farming methods at a research facility there . The company began operations in Chile in 1975 . In 1992 , Unilever sold the business to American firm <unk> , and two years later ownership of the company passed to Booker plc when it was merged with Booker 's aquaculture subsidiary , McConnell Salmon . After deciding to divest Marine Harvest McConnell so as to concentrate on its core cash and carry business in 1998 , Booker eventually succeeded in finding a buyer in July 1999 . The Dutch @-@ based nutrition firm Nutreco acquired the unit for GB £ 32 @.@ 7 million , adding it to its fish food and salmon farming unit . Nutreco 's initial attempt to further expand into the fish farming sector by acquiring the seafood arm of Norsk Hydro was blocked on the recommendation of the United Kingdom Competition Commission in late 2000 , but the deal was approved in March 2001 after Nutreco agreed not to acquire Hydro Seafood 's Scottish assets . 
 Nutreco retained the name Marine Harvest for the unit 's fish farming operations , and established interests in the emerging farmed cod , halibut , yellowtail and barramundi markets . In May 2005 , Nutreco merged its fish @-@ farming operations with the salmon , trout , halibut , tilapia , cod , sturgeon and caviar businesses of Stolt @-@ Nielsen , creating a new stand @-@ alone company , again named Marine Harvest . Nutreco held a 75 % stake in the joint venture , with Stolt taking the remainder . 
 = = = = Pan Fish = = = = 
 Pan Fish Holding AS was founded in 1992 with a strategy to acquire many fish farms domestically and abroad . By 1997 the firm had made numerous acquisitions and opted to list on the Oslo Stock Exchange as Pan Fish ASA . However , the company had borrowed heavily to finance its rapid growth — by the end of 2001 , debts had reached over NOK 4 @.@ 7 billion . When the market price of salmon collapsed in 2001 , Pan Fish encountered extreme financial difficulties , posting a heavy loss in 2002 , and having to sell off assets in order to repay creditors . A major refinancing operation implemented in late 2002 coincided with the dismissal of the entire board of directors , including founder and CEO Arne Nore . The company slowly recovered over the following years , returning to profitability in 2005 . 
 = = = = Fjord Seafood = = = = 
 Fjord Seafood has its origins in <unk> Invest , a company founded in June 1996 which initially operated a single fish farm in the Norwegian town of Brønnøysund . Expansion over the following four years was aggressive — by September 2000 , when Fjord Seafood ( as it was now called ) listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange , the company 's portfolio comprised 60 <unk> concessions , of which 50 were wholly owned , as well as a number of smolt and broodstock farms , slaughterhouses and processing factories . Fjord continued to conduct mergers and acquisitions - the purchase of Belgian fish @-@ processing company Pieters N.V. in November 2000 was swiftly followed by the addition of <unk> , the seafood joint @-@ venture of <unk> and Seaboard Corporation . 
 As with Pan Fish , poor market conditions saw Fjord 's share price worsen dramatically in 2001 , and with it the ability to pay off its debts . The company 's future was only secured thanks to a NOK 700 million bail out from major shareholders that September . Attempts to grow the company through merger and acquisitions were also frustrated — a planned merger with the aquaculture businesses of <unk> ( then the biggest shareholder of Fjord ) and state @-@ controlled <unk> was aborted in June 2002 after opposition from parties including <unk> and Seaboard , who controlled over 20 % of shares between them . Nevertheless , Fjord stabilised its financial position through restructuring and cost @-@ cutting measures . 
 = = = Merger = = = 
 Moves toward consolidation in the aquaculture sector were sparked by the activity of shipping magnate John Fredriksen , Norway 's richest man before abandoning his citizenship of the country in 2006 . Fredriksen 's first major move into the industry came in the second quarter of 2005 , when <unk> 's 24 % stake in Fjord Seafood was sold to his investment vehicle Geveran Trading . Around the same time , Pan Fish announced that two companies indirectly controlled by Fredriksen had acquired a combined 48 % of the company 's outstanding shares . In October of that year , with salmon prices high , Fjord submitted an offer for a majority stake in <unk> to the Norwegian Government , which was preparing it for a public listing . However , as with the first merger attempt in 2002 , Fjord failed in its bid — this time the offer was rejected by the Government . 
 Fredriksen 's efforts to effect change finally bore fruit in March 2006 , as Geveran Trading succeeded in purchasing Marine Harvest from its joint owners for € 881 million , before immediately turning ownership over to Pan Fish . Geveran also sold its stake in Fjord Seafood to Pan Fish at the same time . With its remaining shares purchased by Pan Fish , Fjord Seafood de @-@ listed from the Oslo Stock Exchange on 6 July 2006 . With regulatory hurdles in the United Kingdom and France cleared , the Marine Harvest group was brought under the control of Pan Fish by the end of 2006 . To allow the merger to go ahead , the sale of the former Pan Fish Scotland division was agreed with the regulatory authorities . After an initial deal to sell the unit to <unk> <unk> , owners of rival company Scottish Sea Farms , was called off in July 2007 , Pan Fish Scotland was spun off into a separate publicly traded entity , Lighthouse Caledonia , that November . 
 Geveran Trading held a 28 % stake in the company upon completion of the merger , a shareholding which has since increased to almost 30 % as of March 2009 .

 With the creation of a much enlarged company complete , the Pan Fish management announced a complete change in its identity in December 2006 . The firm 's new brand was chosen to reflect each of its three main constituents : " Marine Harvest " was again revived as the new name for the company , and the Fjord Seafood slogan " excellence in seafood " and a reworked version of the Pan Fish motif were also included in the new logo . Atle Eide , CEO of Pan Fish from 2003 , continued in his position , but resigned in September 2007 for personal reasons . Eide was replaced on an interim basis by Leif Frode <unk> , before the CEO position was filled permanently by former GE Healthcare executive Åse Aulie Michelet in March 2008 . Michelet was unexpectedly removed from her position in March 2010 and was replaced by former <unk> Seafood CEO Alf @-@ Helge <unk> .

 Marine Harvest has been criticised for destroying a large part of the weir Murray 's <unk> on the Ettrick Water in Selkirk , Scotland , through what has been claimed to be inaction . The company sold its nearby fish farm to a local businessman for £ 1 in July 2008 , who has since been given permission to commence repair work on the weir . 
 Marine Harvest 's operations have been severely affected in the south of Chile , where millions of fish have died by the disease infectious salmon anemia . The rapid propagation of the virus has motivated the enterprise to sell some of its facilities , firing more than a thousand employees , with the aim of translating its installations further south to the <unk> Region . Parasitic , viral and fungal infections are all disseminated when the fish are stressed and the centres are too close together , and a spokesman for Marine Harvest recognized that his company was using too many antibiotics in Chile and that fish pens were too close , contributing to the dissemination of the ISA virus . Norwegian scientist Are Nylund has suggested that Marine Harvest introduced the ISA virus to the region by importing infected eggs from Norway . 
 = John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum = 
 The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library and museum of John Fitzgerald Kennedy , the 35th President of the United States ( 1961 – 1963 ) . It is located on Columbia Point in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston , Massachusetts , next to the University of Massachusetts Boston , the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate , and the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum . Designed by the architect I. M. Pei , the building is the official repository for original papers and correspondence of the Kennedy Administration , as well as special bodies of published and unpublished materials , such as books and papers by and about Ernest Hemingway . The library and museum were dedicated in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter and members of the Kennedy family . It can be reached from nearby Interstate 93 or via shuttle bus or walk from the JFK / UMass stop on the Boston subway 's Red line .

 During a weekend visit to Boston on October 19 , 1963 , President Kennedy , along with John Carl Warnecke — the architect who would design the President ’ s tomb in Arlington — viewed several locations offered by Harvard as a site for the library and museum . At the time there were only four other Presidential Libraries : the Hoover Presidential Library , the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library , the Truman Library , and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library . They were all scattered around the country in small towns from New York to Iowa . Kennedy had not decided on any design concept yet , but he felt that the existing presidential libraries were placed too " far away from scholarly resources . " 
 Kennedy chose a plot of land next to the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration . The building would face the Charles River which was a few feet away , and on the other side of which , the dormitories that included Winthrop House where Kennedy spent his upperclassman days . 
 Since Kennedy encouraged his administration to save effects of both personal and official nature , the complex would not just be a collection of the President 's papers , but " a complete record of a Presidential era . " And so , the building would have the word museum appended to its name : John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum . 
 = = = Initial progress = = = 
 After President Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963 , his family and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial . A committee was formed to advise Kennedy 's widow Jacqueline , who would make the final decision . The group deliberated for months , and visited with architects from around the world including Pietro Belluschi and others from the United States , Brazil 's Lucio Costa , and Italy 's Franco Albini . Mrs. Kennedy and others met with the candidates together at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis , Massachusetts , and visited several in their offices . The committee also conducted a secretive process whereby the architects voted anonymously for the most capable of their colleagues . 
 Progress on the building began shortly after his death . On January 13 , 1964 , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy announced that a taped oral @-@ history project was to be undertaken for inclusion in the library . The project would feature administration staff , friends , family , and politicians from home and abroad . The Attorney General also announced that Eugene R. Black , Sr. agreed to serve as chairman of the board of trustees and that $ 1 million of Black ’ s $ 10 million goal had been given to the trust by the Joseph P. Kennedy , Jr . Foundation . 
 The death of the President was still fresh in the hearts and minds of the American public and by March of that year $ 4 @.@ 3 million had been pledged , including 18 @,@ 727 unsolicited donations from the public . Large donations came from the Hispanic world with Venezuela pledging $ 100 @,@ 000 and Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Muñoz Marín offering the same . The oral @-@ history project also began recording , starting with Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert Kennedy . Originally projected to consist of interviews with 150 people , 178 had agreed to participate and the total number of expected participants doubled to 300 , with just one person ( a Secret Service agent ) declining to take part . 
 Also by this time fourteen architects were named to serve on a design advisory committee : 
 Over the following months pledges continued to funnel in for the building still being conceptualized by the various architects . Some notable donations include $ 900 @,@ 000 handed over to Postmaster General John A. <unk> on July 9 , 1964 . It was the sum of a campaign encompassing 102 Federal agencies . <unk> said many of the Federal employee contributions were in the form of a $ 5 withholding each payday for a period of three years . The next day the Indian ambassador to the United States , Braj Kumar <unk> presented Black with a check for $ 100 @,@ 000 during a ceremony at the River Club . Nehru said that the Indian people were hit by a " sad blow " when the President died , and that they held him " in the highest regard , esteem and affection . " He desired for Indian students abroad in the United States to use the library , then still planned for construction at Harvard along the banks of the Charles River . 
 = = = Pei selected as architect = = = 
 On December 13 , 1964 , the Kennedy family announced that I. M. Pei was unanimously chosen by a subcommittee as the architect of the library . Even though Pei was relatively unknown amongst the list of candidates , Mrs. Kennedy , who viewed him as filled with promise and imagination and after spending several months inspecting the many architects ’ offices and creations , selected him to create the vision she held for the project . Pei did not have a design yet , but the idea as described by Robert Kennedy was to “ stimulate interest in politics . ” Meanwhile , the suggestion that Harvard may not be a suitable site for the library had begun cropping up . When asked if Pei may have had to start from scratch , he said this was the case . With an “ encouraging grin ” Robert Kennedy simply wished Mr. Pei “ Good luck . ” 
 Mrs. Kennedy chose Pei to design the library , based on two considerations . First , she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects . " He didn 't seem to have just one way to solve a problem , " she said . " He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful . " Ultimately , however , Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei . Calling it " really an emotional decision " , she explained : " He was so full of promise , like Jack ; they were born in the same year . I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him . " 
 Not long before Pei was selected , the $ 10 million goal set by Black had been reached . By 1965 , fundraising was suspended when the contributions reached $ 20 million .

 In January 1966 , when Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe signed a bill allowing the state to purchase the land for the site — an old train yard belonging to the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority ( MBTA ) — it was expected that the project would be complete by 1970 . The original design was a large complex comprising the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum , the John F. Kennedy School of Government , and an Institute of Politics . However the project faced many delays . The MBTA would not agree to remove the heavy machinery from the land until 1970 . By that time construction costs had risen to over $ 20 million . Only now could Pei prepare a six @-@ month study of the site ’ s soil , and he said the " money we had six years ago , today will barely pay for 60 percent of the original plans . " 
 Robert Kennedy , by then a senator from New York , had been serving as president of the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation until he was assassinated in 1968 . Weeks before , William Manchester and Harper & Row donated $ 750 @,@ 000 to the library . The first in a series of installments expected to total $ 5 million , came from the profits of the book The Death of a President which caused a bitter feud between the Kennedys and Manchester . Mrs. Kennedy remarked " I think it is so beautiful what Mr. Manchester did . I am glad that Senator Kennedy knew about it before he died . " The youngest of the Kennedy brothers , Senator Edward M. Kennedy , would step down as vice president of the corporation to fill the newly vacant position . 
 By 1971 , construction had still not begun ; researchers and scholars were forced to work out of the Federal Records Center which was temporarily housing some of the 15 million documents and manuscripts . Pei said there was finally " a clear way ahead " ; however , he was asked to save on construction expenses by using inexpensive materials . This would translate into Pei working with concrete instead of his preferred stone . 
 On May 22 , 1971 , President Lyndon B. Johnson , who succeeded Kennedy as president , saw the dedication of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum in Austin , Texas . On the campus of the University of Texas at Austin , and next to the LBJ School of Public Affairs , he would beat the Kennedy team to building the first Presidential Library that also served as a place of scholarly research . He would not live to see work begin on his predecessor 's . 
 Meanwhile , the Cambridge community was in fierce opposition to having the library being built in Cambridge at all . Although originally welcomed in 1965 , the library was now seen as a great attractor of over a million annual tourists who would change the neighborhood with " hordes of tourists , automobiles , fast @-@ food franchises and souvenir shops , " as well as cause a negative environmental impact . One neighborhood group filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding that the General Services Administration study , which found that the great number of visitors would have " no adverse effect on the area , " be reexamined . 
 Stephen E. Smith , a Kennedy in @-@ law who heads the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation decided that “ we want the Kennedy Library to be a happy place . It would not be in keeping with the nature of this memorial for it to open in an atmosphere of discord and controversy . ” And in February 1975 the plans for having the library where President Kennedy would have wanted it , were dropped .

 The new location of the site was Columbia Point in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston , near the University of Massachusetts Boston , described as a group of " massive , blocky structures ... in sharp contrast to the mellow and urbane atmosphere of the library ’ s original site near Harvard Square . " The site was originally a garbage dump , Pei recalls finding old refrigerators and appliances under the soil . In all seriousness , he asserted that one could toss a lit match on the earth and watch the ground ignite as the soil emitted methane gas . One thing the site did have going for it was that the community was not opposed to the area being landscaped to house the library . 
 June 12 , 1977 marked the official groundbreaking for the library with construction following in August . Although the site was a landfill it did overlook Boston , Dorchester Bay and the ocean . The area was covered in 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) of earth and topsoil . Pei was particularly proud of the landscaping results . 
 The design would be a simple geometric structure with a large glass pavilion . The concrete tower stands 125 feet ( 38 m ) tall and houses offices and archives . A circular section contains two theaters and is connected to the tower by the 115 foot ( 35 m ) grey @-@ glass pavilion . The concrete finish of the building directly reflects the budget . With more money Pei would have made the building with stone which he believes offers a nicer finish with more detail . The materials chosen kept the costs within budget , in total costing $ 20 @.@ 8 million . 
 Over 30 million people contributed to the cost of construction , which more than 225 construction workers labored to complete before the end of 1979 . 
 = = = Dedication = = = 
 The official dedication was held on October 20 , 1979 . Outside the building on the green , on a blue @-@ carpeted stage with a bank of yellow chrysanthemums sat the Kennedy family and those close to them . Among many others , President Jimmy Carter was in their company . The ceremony began with President Kennedy ’ s daughter , Caroline Kennedy , introducing her brother , John F. Kennedy , Jr . , who read from the Stephen Spender poem , I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great . 
 President Carter said of John F. Kennedy that he embodied “ the ideals of a generation as few public figures have ever done in the history of the earth . ” He spoke of openly weeping upon hearing about the death of Kennedy , something that he had not done since his own father died , ten years before . Afterwards , he accepted the library “ on behalf of the American people ” and the National Archives and Records Administration . 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy , said of his brother 's life , that it " was a voyage of discovery , a quest for excellence that inspired universal trust and faith . In that brief unfinished journey , he made us believe once more in the great historic purpose of this land . He filled America with pride and made the nation young again . " 
 Critics generally liked the finished building , but the architect himself was unsatisfied . The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design , and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion . " I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy , " he said in 2000 . " It could and should have been a great project . " Perhaps the most important consequence of the Kennedy project for Pei was his elevation in the public 's consciousness as an architect of note . Pei considered the John F. Kennedy Library " the most important commission in my life . "

It is modelled after a program by the Columbia University Oral History Research Office , the worlds oldest , which began in 1948 . At its conception , while serving as Attorney General , Robert Kennedy speculated that some of the interviews , such as ones relating to the Cuban Missile Crisis , might have to be sealed for a while due to containing " highly classified material . " He said that although the emphasis would be on releasing everything as soon as possible , some items might remain closed for 10 to 25 years .

 The library is also home to a collection of documents and belongings from Ernest Hemingway .

A room for the collection was dedicated on July 18 , 1980 by Patrick Hemingway and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis .

 = Meet Kevin Johnson = 
 " Meet Kevin Johnson " is the 80th television episode of the American Broadcasting Company 's ( ABC 's ) Lost and the eighth episode of the fourth season . It was written in October and November 2007 by supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and co @-@ producer Brian K. Vaughan , and directed in November by co @-@ executive producer Stephen Williams . " Meet Kevin Johnson " first aired March 20 , 2008 , on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada . 
 In the second season finale , after 67 days of being stranded on a mysterious and mystical tropical island , Oceanic Airlines 815 crash survivor Michael Dawson ( played by Harold Perrineau ) successfully negotiates his escape via motorboat with the island 's dangerous original inhabitants , whom the survivors refer to as the " Others " . One month later in the episode before " Meet Kevin Johnson " , Michael reappears on a freighter offshore of the island , undercover with the alias " Kevin Johnson " . Most of the narrative of " Meet Kevin Johnson " consists of a continuous flashback — the third longest in the show 's history after " Across the Sea " and " The Other 48 Days " — showing what happened to Michael in the month that he spent away in New York and on the freighter , primarily his recruitment aboard the freighter Kahana as a spy for the Others . 
 The writers completed " Meet Kevin Johnson " , the eighth of 16 ordered scripts , on the same day that the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike action began . Post @-@ production finished weeks later without input from the show 's writers . ABC pledged to air the completed eight episodes regardless of the strike 's resolution , but the writers felt that the episode 's cliffhanger was unsuitable as a potential season finale . ABC ultimately overruled their opposition . 
 " Meet Kevin Johnson " was watched by 13 million Americans and was met with mixed reactions . A major discussion point was the episode 's climax , which was criticized for its placement in the story and its focus on secondary characters . Although critics responded well to Michael 's emotional journey , they complained that his physical journey seemed to conflict with Lost 's timeline that had been laid out in previous episodes . The episode was honored with the fourth season 's sole Primetime Emmy Award for its achievement in sound mixing . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode 's opening is set on December 26 , 2004 , over three months after the crash of Oceanic 815 . Most of the episode takes place on the freighter " Kahana , " moored offshore of the island where the plane crashed . The freighter is owned by Charles Widmore ( Alan Dale ) , who is intent on extracting the Others ' leader Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson ) . Captain Gault ( Grant Bowler ) stops two crewmembers from deserting the freighter in a raft . He publicly beats them and shouts that this is to save their lives , reminding the crew of what happened to George Minkowski ( Fisher Stevens ) when he left the boat . The next morning , Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) confronts Michael about his motivations , and the narrative shifts into an uninterrupted flashback of Michael 's life after escaping from the island . 
 Michael and his son Walt Lloyd ( Malcolm David Kelley ) return to New York . Overcome with guilt , Michael confesses that he murdered Ana Lucia Cortez ( Michelle Rodriguez ) and Libby ( Cynthia Watros ) as part of his rescue of Walt from the Others ' captivity . Michael becomes estranged from Walt , who goes to live with Michael 's mother ( <unk> <unk> ) . Michael is haunted by apparitions and nightmares of the late Libby . Michael attempts to kill himself in a car crash , but fails . He sells the watch that Jin Kwon ( Daniel Dae Kim ) gave him in the first season finale and buys a gun for another suicide attempt , but this , too , is unsuccessful , because the gun jams . That night , Michael is confronted by Tom ( M.C. Gainey ) , the Other who abducted Walt . Tom explains that the island will not allow Michael to kill himself , and gives Michael an assignment : Michael must infiltrate the freighter Kahana using the pseudonym " Kevin Johnson " and kill everyone on board , who may try to kill his fellow crash survivors . Michael agrees to do it and boards the freighter from Fiji . Michael becomes acquainted with the crew and hesitates to sabotage their mission until he finds Martin Keamy ( Kevin Durand ) and his associates target @-@ practicing with machine guns . After Michael tries to detonate a provided bomb only to discover that it is a fake , Ben contacts Michael by radio and explains that the trick illustrated his stance against killing innocent people in his war against Widmore . The flashback ends and Sayid , appalled by Michael 's association with Ben , exposes his duplicity to Gault . 
 On the island in the Others ' abandoned Barracks where some of the survivors have taken residence , 815 survivor John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) meets with his faction to discuss the freighter and Ben reveals that Michael is spying for him there . Ben later urges his adopted daughter Alex ( Tania Raymonde ) to flee to the Others ' sanctuary at the " Temple " for safety ; she is accompanied by her biological mother Danielle Rousseau ( Mira Furlan ) and boyfriend Karl ( Blake Bashoff ) . On their way , Karl and Rousseau are shot dead by hidden assailants and Alex surrenders .

 " Meet Kevin Johnson " features the first appearance of Cynthia Watros as Libby in Lost since the character was murdered in the second season . Despite a promise by writer 's assistant Matt <unk> that there would be an episode in the second season in which flashbacks would focus on Libby , Watros became the first main cast member to never play the central role in a Lost episode . Following Libby 's death , Co @-@ creator / executive producer / writer Damon Lindelof revealed plans to tell her story in the third season . Libby 's story was later postponed again — Lindelof stated that her back story would be told through flashbacks of a new character introduced in the fourth season . Executive producer / writer Carlton Cuse further explained that these flashbacks would unfold over multiple episodes . This failed to materialize ; however , Watros made a couple of appearances via hallucinations in Michael 's flashbacks in " Meet Kevin Johnson " . The writers asserted that while they had yet to shed light on the character 's past , they would finally in their fifth year . The writers later made further revisions , with Cuse concluding that Libby 's part in the show is " pretty much finished . " When Watros returned to Lost for " Meet Kevin Johnson " , she did not receive the " special guest star " credit , as was customary for former main cast members of Lost . She was instead billed simply as a guest star , although her name appeared with that of frequent guest star M.C. Gainey ahead of the remainder of the episode 's guest cast , who were listed alphabetically on @-@ screen . Gainey explained that " just because they kill you on this show , don 't mean they don 't need you anymore ' cause everybody 's got a past . " Damon Lindelof said that " it was sort of like a walk down memory lane for the dead " , as it not only included Tom and Libby , but also Naomi Dorrit ( Marsha Thomason ) and George Minkowski ( Fisher Stevens ) , two characters from the freighter who had met their demises earlier in the season . 
 First season regular cast member Malcolm David Kelley returned in an uncredited cameo for a single scene as Michael 's ten @-@ year @-@ old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance . Fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Kelley claimed that make @-@ up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger ; however , Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season . Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did not appear in the cast list , television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast . Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that " You gotta hand it to the Lost writers : For weeks , people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt 's inevitable pubescence . See , the show 's set in 2004 , and only a few months have passed since the plane crash . Yet … it 's been years , and … Kelley has become a man . So what did they do ? … They just didn 't show him . Clever . " TMZ 's Daniel thought that " Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [ is ] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that they pretty much can 't show Walt ever again " . Wizard 's Nikki Stafford went so far as to remark that " That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don 't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role . " 
 Having appeared in six episodes of the third season and the first two of the fourth season , Blake Bashoff auditioned for and won the part of Moritz Stiefel in the Broadway musical Spring Awakening . He warned Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse that he would be unable to shoot Lost for at least six months beginning in December 2007 , as he rehearsed for and performed in the production . Being " big fans " of the musical and congratulating Bashoff on what they thought was an " amazing opportunity , " they brainstormed ideas with the other writers to write him out of the story while they still had him at their disposal . Having decided some time ago that Karl would eventually die , they pinpointed the episode . The cliffhanger of " Meet Kevin Johnson " sees Karl shot dead by unseen killers in the jungle . Two episodes later , the character Miles Straume ( Ken Leung ) finds Karl partially buried in the jungle dirt , but this corpse is portrayed by a body double and not Bashoff . According to Bashoff , the writers hope that he can return to Lost at some point to " serve a cool purpose like [ Tom does in ' Meet Kevin Johnson ' ] . " In regard to his experience with Lost , Bashoff recounted that " I love the show . [ The cast ] ' s a great group … and … you get to shoot in paradise " ; however , he wished that he had learned more about Karl 's backstory .

 The Writers Guild of America went on strike on November 4 , 2007 — the day that the writers finished editing the final draft of the script of " Meet Kevin Johnson " . The writers wanted to hold the eight episodes until they were able to produce more of the season because the eighth episode has a " very cool " yet inconclusive cliffhanger that was not written to end the season ; they compared it to " the end of an exciting book chapter [ but ] not the end of the novel . " ABC decided that the eight episodes would be aired from January to March , regardless of whether any more episodes were produced in the 2007 – 2008 season . After the strike 's end on February 12 , 2008 , the writers pleaded with ABC to air " Meet Kevin Johnson " on April 17 with the second pod of episodes , due to " the eighth episode [ being ] non @-@ traditional and the start of something new " . Jorge Garcia , who plays Hurley Reyes , agreed that " it 's a pretty shocking end but it doesn 't close out the way our previous [ finales ] have ended [ because ] it doesn 't have that closure to it [ and ] ends in a sense of dissonance . " ABC nevertheless prioritized scheduling Grey 's Anatomy , Ugly Betty and Lost 's returns all for April 24 . 
 Despite the struggles with the strike , co @-@ executive producer / staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as " a satisfying episode to work on — it was like we 'd been waiting so long to tell the story of what happened with Michael . " Carlton Cuse stated that " we [ the writers ] felt that the audience deserved to know , you know , once he and Walt sailed off in the boat , what was their journey . " Supervising producer / writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that " Michael 's goal — the whole season — is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [ Tom ] finds him . " Co @-@ executive producer / staff writer Edward Kitsis added that " It 's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn 't see [ Michael ] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship , he wanted to be honest with his son . In a way , you 've got to respect that . " Harold Perrineau , who plays Michael , concluded that " He 's done some bad things and he 's you know , got himself into a messy situation , but at the end of the day , Michael 's a good guy . " Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot , the flashbacks of " Meet Kevin Johnson " are presented continuously and are only bookended by present @-@ day scenes . This is the second episode to do this after " Flashes Before Your Eyes " from the third season . The flashback portion of " Meet Kevin Johnson " is the longest in Lost history ; Horowitz stated that " As we were breaking the story , it just happened , and it turned into the longest flashback to date . " When asked why Michael 's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure , as with other Lost characters , Damon Lindelof explained that " if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens , then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious : he 'd go like , ' oh , now there 's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name , which sounds very much like that 's a Benjamin Linus alias ' , so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could , which was Kevin Johnson . " Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that " Kevin Johnson " was also the name of an American basketball player . 
 In " Meet Kevin Johnson " , Michael visits Tom 's penthouse suite , where Tom and his lover Arturo ( Francesco Simone ) are revealed to be homosexual — Lost 's only gay characters . Online speculation about Tom 's sexual orientation began after the broadcast of the third season premiere , in which Tom tells Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) that she is " not [ his ] type " . A few weeks later , the writers hinted that a character would eventually be revealed as gay . In response to the internet community 's suspicions , actor M.C. Gainey began to play the character as such , subtly trying to flirt with Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) and later claiming that this attraction " got [ him ] through the first half of the season . " Following the broadcast of " Meet Kevin Johnson " , Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the line from the third season premiere is an allusion to Tom 's sexuality , but felt that it needed to be explicitly confirmed in the show . Lindelof noted that " it was not subtle , to say the least " . Edward " Eddy " Kitsis stated that " It was great to see [ Tom ] and realize that … he is a true gentleman . " M.C. Gainey stated that " anytime you 've got a group of people , somebody 's got to be marching to a different drummer — that would be Tom " and Harold Perrineau rejoiced " Right on , I thought that was cool " . 
 Tom establishes that the island has some control over whether characters can die , as demonstrated when Michael unsuccessfully attempts to commit suicide three times . Kitsis thought that " It was interesting what [ Tom ] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael 's arc . " Later in the season , Martin Keamy ( Kevin Durand ) tries to shoot Michael in the head , but the gun jams and the next day , a manifestation of the island in the form of Christian Shephard ( John Terry ) appears before Michael . Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island 's " cosmic intervention [ s ] of fate " also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack 's suicide attempt in the third season finale . Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere , Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying . Cuse has said that " There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael 's story was sort of a [ n ] argument on the destiny side of that equation . He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated . " Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that " the island doesn 't let you go until it 's done with you and I think that the rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that , as well . " 
 The second scene of the episode has Captain Gault beating two of his men , who had attempted to leave the freighter . Gault 's actor Grant Bowler explained that " it was a scene about how far and fast things were spiralling out of control [ on ] the freighter … It was also about his ability to run the ship and that he was willing to go to such great lengths to keep order . It was about status , and keeping level @-@ headed , and being in control . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Shooting commenced in early November and concluded on November 27 , 2007 . The strike suspended the script for the next episode and freed the cast and crew from an immediate deadline , with the result that more time was spent on filming " Meet Kevin Johnson " than the average Lost episode . Shooting did not customarily overlap with the surrounding episodes , although it was produced simultaneously with the Lost : Missing Pieces mobisodes directed by executive producer Jack Bender and one scene from the season premiere overseen by co @-@ executive producer Jean Higgins . Perrineau hoped the audience would enjoy Michael 's return since the cast and crew " busted [ their ] butts doing this one . It felt like we were making a movie because there 's so much stuff that happens in this episode " . Lilly called it " one of the best episodes of the first eight . " 
 The exterior freighter scenes were filmed on an actual freighter , while interior scenes were filmed both on sets and in the freighter . The production crew had intended for the engine room scene where Michael goes to detonate the bomb and sees Libby to be shot in the freighter 's engine room ; instead , they built a new engine room set based on that inside the freighter . It was " so stifling hot " at around 105 ° F ( 40 ° C ) and the crew found that " to get air conditioning down [ t ] here … was an impossible task " , according to the Kahana 's real life chief engineer Bob Bower . Sculptor Jim Van Houten created twin twenty four foot ( seven meter ) marine engines for the set , primarily from urethane foam . 
 One New York flashback was filmed on the same Honolulu , Oahu , Hawaii street that had been used by set decorator Carol Bayne Kelley as Berlin , Germany in the fourth season 's " The Economist " and London , England in the third season 's " Flashes Before Your Eyes " . The cliffhanger , in which Alex , Karl and Rousseau are in the jungle , was shot at Dillingham Ranch on the northwest tip of Oahu near the beach where the pilot and other early episodes were primarily filmed . The scene originally ended with " snipers emerging through the jungle in these incredible , elaborate , jungle camouflage uniforms " ; however , this was cut in post @-@ production . Elements of this would be re @-@ shot and used in the next episode when the snipers are identified .

 Despite picketing on most days with his fellow Lost writers , Carlton Cuse , a member of the WGA negotiating committee , continued to oversee post @-@ production in late November . When negotiations between the Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke down in early December , he boycotted his producing duties on the show until the strike was resolved . 
 In addition to Michael Giacchino 's original score , " Meet Kevin Johnson " contained popular music <unk> . The song playing on Michael 's car radio during his first suicide attempt is " It 's Getting Better , " performed by " Mama " Cass Elliot . The song is heard again , fleetingly , during Michael 's vision of Libby in the ship 's engine room . Elliot 's rendition of the song was released as a single in 1969 and was included on her album Bubblegum , Lemonade , and ... Something for Mama later the same year . Lost previously played Elliot 's " Make Your Own Kind of Music " throughout the second season .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Critics and fans alike criticized the writers ' seeming disregard for the Lost timeline . Based on the actions and whereabouts of characters in the third season , fans could deduce when parts of Michael 's flashbacks occurred in relation to events on the island . John Kubicek of BuddyTV wrote that " This timeline results in some serious issues fans should have with time … This makes almost no sense … Michael left in the boat , he had to find help , come ashore , somehow explain himself , get on a plane back to New York City , drop off Walt to live with his grandma , find an apartment , get into a car accident , recover , and only then did he meet Tom . Either the writers are playing fast and loose with the concept of time , or Michael had the busiest week in the history of the world . " Using <unk> as a reference , Nikki Stafford of Wizard pointed out that the chronology was not only almost inconsistent with the third season , but also with an earlier episode of the same season . Damon Lindelof responded that " we [ the writers and producers ] find that the [ fan message ] boards can be really toxic " and pointed specifically to the " nitpick [ ing ] " of the possible continuity issues of " Meet Kevin Johnson " , saying in defence of the script that " it 's television . " 
 The cliffhanger , in which Rousseau and Karl are killed and Alex calls out in desperation that she is Ben 's daughter , gained a mixed response . In an 8 @.@ 8 out of 10 review , IGN 's Chris Carabott called the scene " completely out of place … tacked on and anticlimactic " as it " came at the strangest moment " . Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post deemed the cliffhanger " a shocker " ; he asked " do we really care [ about Karl 's death ] ? I mean , he did have a nice new haircut and all , but he really wasn 't too interesting of a character . " Despite his assessment that " this impressive episode was a fitting midseason finale " , Digital Spy 's Ben Rawson @-@ Jones wrote that the " climax wasn 't as effective as one could have hoped for , as the collective fates of Alex , Danielle and the ultra @-@ expendable Karl don 't rouse a great deal of interest . " Grading the episode as a " B " , Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen was also unimpressed with the cliffhanger and the characters carrying it ; he felt that network executives were partially to blame for going against the wish of the show 's creative team to broadcast " Meet Kevin Johnson " as a midseason premiere as opposed to a midseason finale . Jensen criticized the episode 's unique flashback format , commenting that it lacked the usual " deeper , more immersive experience [ that ] embellishes the sophistication of the storytelling " of Lost . 
 " Meet Kevin Johnson " had a share of good reviews , with critics acclaiming the character development and emotional struggles of Michael . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger found this " middle chapter " to be " quite good " with " a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau " . Sepinwall wrote that Michael 's " struggle to deal with the guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that 's happened before .

 = John Maynard Keynes = 
 John Maynard Keynes , 1st Baron Keynes , CB , FBA ( / <unk> / <unk> ; 5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946 ) , was an English economist whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments . He built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles , and is widely considered to be one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and the founder of modern macroeconomics . His ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics and its various offshoots . 
 In the 1930s , Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking , challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would , in the short to medium term , automatically provide full employment , as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands . He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment . According to Keynesian economics , state intervention was necessary to moderate " boom and bust " cycles of economic activity . Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions . 
 Following the outbreak of World War II , the leading Western economies adopted Keynes 's policy recommendations , and in the two decades following Keynes 's death in 1946 , almost all capitalist governments had done so . Keynes 's influence waned in the 1970s , partly as a result of the severe stagflation that stalled the Anglo @-@ American economies throughout that decade , and partly because of criticism of Keynesian theories by Milton Friedman , who had predicted that condition . He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favorably with fiscal policy . Although some have said that Friedman 's monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve 's response to the global financial crisis of 2007 – 08 , others have raised concerns about the validity and longevity of Friedman 's theories and characterized government economic policies undertaken during that period as a worldwide resurgence in Keynesian thought . 
 When Time magazine included Keynes among its Most Important People of the Century in 1999 , it said that " his radical idea that governments should spend money they don 't have may have saved capitalism . " The Economist has described Keynes as " Britain 's most famous 20th @-@ century economist . " In addition to being an economist , Keynes was also a civil servant , a director of the Bank of England , and a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 John Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge , Cambridgeshire , England , to an upper @-@ middle @-@ class family . His father , John Neville Keynes , was an economist and a lecturer in moral sciences at the University of Cambridge and his mother Florence Ada Keynes a local social reformer . Keynes was the first born , and was followed by two more children – Margaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and Geoffrey Keynes in 1887 . Geoffrey became a surgeon and Margaret married the Nobel Prize @-@ winning physiologist Archibald Hill . 
 According to the economist and biographer Robert Skidelsky , Keynes 's parents were loving and attentive . They remained in the same house throughout their lives , where the children were always welcome to return . Keynes would receive considerable support from his father , including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of Great Depression in 1929 . Keynes 's mother made her children 's interests her own , and according to Skidelsky , " because she could grow up with her children , they never outgrew home " . 
 In January 1889 , at the age of five and a half , Keynes started at the kindergarten of the <unk> School for Girls for five mornings a week . He quickly showed a talent for arithmetic , but his health was poor leading to several long absences . He was tutored at home by a governess , Beatrice Mackintosh , and his mother . In January 1892 , at eight and a half , he started as a day pupil at St Faith 's preparatory school . By 1894 , Keynes was top of his class and excelling at mathematics . In 1896 , St Faith 's headmaster , Ralph Goodchild , wrote that Keynes was " head and shoulders above all the other boys in the school " and was confident that Keynes could get a scholarship to Eton . 
 In 1897 , Keynes won a scholarship to Eton College , where he displayed talent in a wide range of subjects , particularly mathematics , classics and history . At Eton , Keynes experienced the first " love of his life " in Dan Macmillan , older brother of the future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan . Despite his middle @-@ class background , Keynes mixed easily with upper @-@ class pupils . In 1902 Keynes left Eton for King 's College , Cambridge , after receiving a scholarship for this also to read mathematics . Alfred Marshall begged Keynes to become an economist , although Keynes 's own inclinations drew him towards philosophy – especially the ethical system of G. E. Moore . Keynes joined the Pitt Club and was an active member of the semi @-@ secretive Cambridge Apostles society , a debating club largely reserved for the brightest students . Like many members , Keynes retained a bond to the club after graduating and continued to attend occasional meetings throughout his life . Before leaving Cambridge , Keynes became the President of the Cambridge Union Society and Cambridge University Liberal Club . He was said to be an atheist . 
 In May 1904 , he received a first class B.A. in mathematics . Aside from a few months spent on holidays with family and friends , Keynes continued to involve himself with the university over the next two years . He took part in debates , further studied philosophy and attended economics lectures informally as a graduate student for one term , which constituted his only formal education in the subject . He also studied for Tripos in 1905 and , the following year took civil service exams . 
 The economist Harry Johnson wrote that the optimism imparted by Keynes 's early life is a key to understanding his later thinking . Keynes was always confident he could find a solution to whatever problem he turned his attention to , and retained a lasting faith in the ability of government officials to do good . Keynes 's optimism was also cultural , in two senses : he was of the last generation raised by an empire still at the height of its power , and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture , rather than by expertise . According to Skidelsky , the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well @-@ educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation to each other and to life , enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems . 
 = = Career = = 
 In October 1906 , Keynes 's Civil Service career began as a clerk in the India Office . He enjoyed his work at first , but by 1908 had become bored and resigned his position to return to Cambridge and work on probability theory , at first privately funded only by two dons at the university – his father and the economist Arthur Pigou . By 1909 Keynes had published his first professional economics article in the Economics Journal , about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India . He founded the Political Economy Club a weekly discussion group . Also in 1909 , Keynes accepted a lectureship in economics funded personally by Alfred Marshall . Keynes 's earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition . On being elected a fellow in 1911 Keynes was made editor of The Economic Journal . By 1913 he had published his first book , Indian Currency and Finance . He was then appointed to the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance – the same topic as his book – where Keynes showed considerable talent at applying economic theory to practical problems . His written work was published under the name " J M Keynes " , though to his family and friends he was known as Maynard . ( His father , John Neville Keynes , was also always known by his middle name ) . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 The British Government called on Keynes 's expertise during the First World War . While he did not formally re @-@ join the civil service in 1914 , Keynes travelled to London at the government 's request a few days before hostilities started . Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes 's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer ( then Lloyd George ) was persuaded that this would be a bad idea , as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before absolutely necessary . 
 In January 1915 , Keynes took up an official government position at the Treasury . Among his responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and its continental allies during the war , and the acquisition of scarce currencies . According to economist Robert <unk> , Keynes 's " nerve and mastery became legendary " because of his performance of these duties , as in the case where he managed to assemble – with difficulty – a small supply of Spanish pesetas . The secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government . But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over , choosing instead to sell them all to break the market : his boldness paid off , as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive . In the 1917 King 's Birthday Honours , Keynes was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath for his wartime work , and his success led to the appointment that would have a huge effect on Keynes 's life and career ; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 Versailles peace conference . He was also appointed Officer of the Belgian Order of Leopold . 
 = = = Versailles peace conference = = = 
 Keynes 's experience at Versailles was influential in shaping his future outlook , yet it was not a successful one for him . Keynes 's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany 's compensation payments being set so high it would <unk> innocent German people , damage the nation 's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany 's own economy but that of the wider world . Unfortunately for Keynes , conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the 1918 coupon election were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high @-@ level talks concerning reparations . Their place was taken by the Heavenly Twins – the judge Lord Sumner and the banker Lord Cunliffe whose nickname derived from the " astronomically " high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany . Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes . 
 The three principal players at Versailles were Britain 's Lloyd George , France 's Clemenceau and America 's President Wilson . It was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access ; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes 's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany , and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments . Lloyd George did however win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much @-@ needed food supplies to German civilians . Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations , though not as high as those proposed by the British , while on security grounds , France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain . Wilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germany – he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism , and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports . To Keynes 's dismay , Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill . Towards the end of the conference , Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole . It involved the radical writing down of war debts , which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round , but at the same time thrown the entire cost of European reconstruction on the United States . Lloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate . However , America was against the plan ; the US was then the largest creditor , and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices . Hence despite his best efforts , the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds , and led to his resignation from the Treasury . 
 In June 1919 he turned down an offer to become chairman of the British Bank of Northern Commerce , a job that promised a salary of £ 2000 in return for a morning per week of work . 
 Keynes 's analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book , The Economic Consequences of the Peace , published in 1919 . This work has been described as Keynes 's best book , where he was able to bring all his gifts to bear – his passion as well as his skill as an economist . In addition to economic analysis , the book contained pleas to the reader 's sense of compassion : 
 I cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended either on our own pledges or on economic facts . The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation , of degrading the lives of millions of human beings , and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable , – abhorrent and detestable , even if it were possible , even if it enriched ourselves , even if it did not sow the decay of the whole civilised life of Europe . 
 Also present was striking imagery such as " year by year Germany must be kept impoverished and her children starved and crippled " along with bold predictions which were later justified by events : 
 If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe , vengeance , I dare predict , will not limp . Nothing can then delay for very long that final war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution , before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing . 
 Keynes 's followers assert that his predictions of disaster were borne out when the German economy suffered the hyperinflation of 1923 , and again by the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the outbreak of World War II . However the historian Ruth Henig claims that " most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that , in economic terms , the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that , while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers , the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills , and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out " . Only a small fraction of reparations were ever paid . In fact , the historian Stephen Schuker demonstrates in American ' Reparations ' to Germany , 1919 @-@ 33 , that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German <unk> so that , on a net basis , Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post @-@ World War II Marshal Plan . Schuker also shows that , in the years after Versailles , Keynes became an informal reparations adviser to the German government , wrote one of the major German reparation notes , and actually supported the hyperinflation on political grounds . Nevertheless , The Economic Consequences of the Peace gained Keynes international fame , even though it also caused him to be regarded as anti @-@ establishment – it was not until after the outbreak of World War II that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank , or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job . However , Keynes was still able to influence government policy making through his network of contacts , his published works and by serving on government committees ; this included attending high @-@ level policy meetings as a consultant . 
 = = = In the 1920s = = = 
 Keynes had completed his A Treatise on Probability before the war , but published it in 1921 . The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of probability theory , championing the important view that probabilities were no more or less than truth values intermediate between simple truth and falsity . Keynes developed the first upper @-@ lower probabilistic interval approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book , as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight , c , in chapter 26 . In addition to his academic work , the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant . In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor Alfred Marshall which Joseph Schumpeter called " the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read . " Marshall 's widow was " entranced " by the memorial , while Lytton Strachey rated it as one of Keynes 's " best works " . 
 In 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with A Revision of the Treaty . He attacked the post World War I deflation policies with A Tract on Monetary Reform in 1923 – a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices , avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate . Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s , leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of sterling to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable . From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response , where the government could create jobs by spending on public works . During the 1920s Keynes 's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion – according to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was " muddled " . The Tract had also called for an end to the gold standard . Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the gold standard , as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy . It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment . The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor Winston Churchill to re @-@ establish it , which had a depressing effect on British industry . Keynes responded by writing The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931 . 
 = = = During the Great Depression = = = 
 Keynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment , money and prices back in the 1920s . The work , Treatise on Money , was published in 1930 in two volumes . A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if interest rates are too high – then unemployment will rise . This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out , making it difficult , in aggregate , for employers to make a profit . Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial indices for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time . In particular he criticised the justification of Britain 's return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre @-@ war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index . He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and of labour . 
 Keynes was deeply critical of the British government 's austerity measures during the Great Depression . He believed that budget deficits were a good thing , a product of recessions . He wrote , " For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature 's remedy , so to speak , for preventing business losses from being , in so severe a slump as to present one , so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill . " 
 At the height of the Great Depression , in 1933 , Keynes published The Means to Prosperity , which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession , chiefly counter @-@ cyclical public spending . The Means to Prosperity contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect . While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government , it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession . A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders . The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments , and according to Robert Skidelsky , helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas , though it had little immediate practical influence . In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon . 
 Keynesian @-@ like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany , but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention , and Keynes was deliberately silent about the successful efforts of Germany as he was dismayed by their imperialist ambitions and their treatment of Jews . Apart from Great Britain , Keynes 's attention was primarily focused on the United States . In 1931 , he received considerable support for his views on counter @-@ cyclical public spending in Chicago , then America 's foremost centre for economic views alternative to the mainstream . However , orthodox economic opinion remained generally hostile regarding fiscal intervention to mitigate the depression , until just before the outbreak of war . In late 1933 Keynes was persuaded by Felix Frankfurter to address President Roosevelt directly , which he did by letters and face to face in 1934 , after which the two men spoke highly of each other . However , according to Skidelsky , the consensus is that Keynes 's efforts only began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy after 1939 . 
 Keynes 's magnum opus , The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money was published in 1936 . It was researched and indexed by one of Keynes 's favourite students , later the economist David <unk> @-@ Butt . The work served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession . The General Theory challenged the earlier neoclassical economic paradigm , which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference , the market would naturally establish full employment equilibrium . In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou . Keynes believed the classical theory was a " special case " that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century , his own theory being the general one . Classical economists had believed in Say 's law , which , simply put , states that " supply creates its own demand " , and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs . An innovation from Keynes was the concept of price stickiness – the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is rational for them to do so . Due in part to price stickiness , it was established that the interaction of " aggregate demand " and " aggregate supply " may lead to stable unemployment equilibria – and in those cases , it is the state , not the market , that economies must depend on for their salvation . 
 The General Theory argues that demand , not supply , is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity . Aggregate demand , which equals total un @-@ hoarded income in a society , is defined by the sum of consumption and investment . In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity , one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment . Without government intervention to increase expenditure , an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work . The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment , for example by spending on public works . " Let us be up and doing , using our idle resources to increase our wealth , " he wrote in 1928 . " With men and plants unemployed , it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments . It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them . " 
 The General Theory is often viewed as the foundation of modern macroeconomics . Few senior American economists agreed with Keynes through most of the 1930s . Yet his ideas were soon to achieve widespread acceptance , with eminent American professors such as Alvin Hansen agreeing with the General Theory before the outbreak of World War II . 
 Keynes himself had only limited participation in the theoretical debates that followed the publication of the General Theory as he suffered a heart attack in 1937 , requiring him to take long periods of rest . Hyman Minsky and other post @-@ Keynesian economists have argued that as result of this , Keynes 's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the IS – LM model ( which , they argue , distort Keynes 's ideas ) . Keynes began to recover in 1939 , but for the rest of his life his professional energies were largely directed towards the practical side of economics – the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts , post @-@ war negotiations with America , and the new international financial order that was presented at the Bretton Woods Conference . 
 In the General Theory and later , Keynes responded to the socialists and left @-@ wing liberals who argued , especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s , that capitalism caused war . He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally ( with coordinated international Keynesian policies , an international monetary system that didn 't pit the interests of countries against each other , and a high degree of freedom of trade ) , then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries . His plans during World War II for post @-@ war international economic institutions and policies ( which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , and later to the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization ) were aimed to give effect to this vision . 
 Although Keynes has been widely criticised – especially by members of the Chicago school of economics – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing , in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 During the Second World War , Keynes argued in How to Pay for the War , published in 1940 , that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving ( essentially workers lending money to the government ) , rather than deficit spending , in order to avoid inflation . Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand , assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts , would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings . In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the Bank of England , and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April . In June 1942 , Keynes was rewarded for his service with a hereditary peerage in the King 's Birthday Honours . On 7 July his title was gazetted as " Baron Keynes , of Tilton , in the County of Sussex " and he took his seat in the House of Lords on the Liberal Party benches . 
 As the Allied victory began to look certain , Keynes was heavily involved , as leader of the British delegation and chairman of the World Bank commission , in the mid @-@ 1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system . The Keynes @-@ plan , concerning an international clearing @-@ union , argued for a radical system for the management of currencies . He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency , the <unk> , and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union . Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses . The USA 's greater negotiating strength , however , meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White . According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong , on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans , Keynes was later proved correct by events . 
 The two new institutions , later known as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , were founded as a compromise that primarily reflected the American vision . There would be no incentives for states to avoid a large trade surplus ; instead , the burden for correcting a trade imbalance would continue to fall only on the deficit countries , which Keynes had argued were least able to address the problem without inflicting economic hardship on their populations . Yet , Keynes was still pleased when accepting the final agreement , saying that if the institutions stayed true to their founding principles , " the brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase . "

 After the war , Keynes continued to represent the United Kingdom in international negotiations despite his deteriorating health . He succeeded in obtaining preferential terms from the United States for new and outstanding debts to facilitate the rebuilding of the British economy . 
 Just before his death in 1946 , Keynes told Henry Clay , a professor of social economics and advisor to the Bank of England of his hopes that Adam Smith 's ' invisible hand ' can help Britain out of the economic hole it is in : " I find myself more and more relying for a solution of our problems on the invisible hand which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago .

 From the end of the Great Depression to the mid @-@ 1970s , Keynes provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Europe , America and much of the rest of the world . While economists and policy makers had become increasingly won over to Keynes 's way of thinking in the mid and late 1930s , it was only after the outbreak of World War II that governments started to borrow money for spending on a scale sufficient to eliminate unemployment . According to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith ( then a US government official charged with controlling inflation ) , in the rebound of the economy from wartime spending , " one could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas . " 
 The Keynesian Revolution was associated with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post @-@ war period . Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism , as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism . After the war , Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy @-@ making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign . Despite his popularity as a war hero , Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government 's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes 's ideas .

 In the late 1930s and 1940s , economists ( notably John Hicks , Franco Modigliani , and Paul Samuelson ) attempted to interpret and formalise Keynes 's writings in terms of formal mathematical models . In what had become known as the neoclassical synthesis , they combined Keynesian analysis with neoclassical economics to produce neo @-@ Keynesian economics , which came to dominate mainstream macroeconomic thought for the next 40 years . 
 By the 1950s , Keynesian policies were adopted by almost the entire developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations . By then , Keynes 's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world 's universities . Throughout the 1950s and 1960s , the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment . Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s , when Keynes 's influence was at its peak , appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism . 
 In late 1965 Time magazine ran a cover article with a title comment from Milton Friedman ( later echoed by U.S. President Richard Nixon ) , " We are all Keynesians now " . The article described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing , and reported that " Washington 's economic managers scaled these heights by their adherence to Keynes 's central theme : the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency , but can be raised to that level by the intervention and influence of the government . " The article also states that Keynes was one of the three most important economists who ever lived , and that his General Theory was more influential than the magna opera of other famous economists , like Adam Smith 's The Wealth of Nations .

 Keynesian economics were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979 , but forces had begun to gather against Keynes 's ideas over 30 years earlier . Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947 , with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences . Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman . Initially the society had little impact on the wider world – according to Hayek it was as if Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned . Friedman however began to emerge as a formidable critic of Keynesian economics from the mid @-@ 1950s , and especially after his 1963 publication of A Monetary History of the United States . 
 On the practical side of economic life , " big government " had appeared to be firmly entrenched in the 1950s , but the balance began to shift towards the power of private interests in the 1960s . Keynes had written against the folly of allowing " decadent and selfish " speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War II the public opinion was strongly against private speculators , the disparaging label " Gnomes of Zürich " being typical of how they were described during this period . International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods . According to the journalists Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson , 1968 was the pivotal year when power shifted in favour of private agents such as currency speculators . As the key 1968 event Elliott and Atkinson picked out America 's suspension of the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments , which they identified as the beginning of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system . 
 Criticisms of Keynes 's ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s , as they were then able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality . Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory . For economists such as Hyman Minsky , Keynes 's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models . Nevertheless , many models were developed by Keynesian economists , with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation . It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation . In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist . Friedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation . In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted , with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis . Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast , Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus , convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts . The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics , by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek 's Austrian School . So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians . Keynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics – by 1979 they had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo @-@ American economic policy . However , many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes , and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism , after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making . Not all academics accepted the criticism against Keynes – Minsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s , and that it was unfortunate that this branch of economics had even continued to be called " Keynesian " . Writing in The American Prospect , Robert Kuttner argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of capital controls , which allowed capital flight from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to Gresham 's law phenomenon ( where weak currencies undermine strong currencies ) . Historian Peter Pugh has stated that a key cause of the economic problems afflicting America in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the Vietnam War , which was against Keynesian advice . 
 A more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend them against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian framework – the resulting body of work largely composing New Keynesian economics . In 1992 Alan Blinder wrote about a " Keynesian Restoration " , as work based on Keynes 's ideas had to some extent become fashionable once again in academia , though in the mainstream it was highly synthesised with monetarism and other neoclassical thinking . In the world of policy making , free market influences broadly sympathetic to monetarism have remained very strong at government level – in powerful normative institutions like the World Bank , the IMF and US Treasury , and in prominent opinion @-@ forming media such as the Financial Times and The Economist . 
 = = = Keynesian resurgence 2008 – 09 = = = 
 The global financial crisis of 2007 – 08 led to public skepticism about the free market consensus even from some on the economic right . In March 2008 , Martin Wolf , chief economics commentator at the Financial Times , announced the death of the dream of global free @-@ market capitalism . In the same month <unk> James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises . Economist Robert J. Shiller had begun advocating robust government intervention to tackle the financial crises , specifically citing Keynes . Nobel laureate Paul Krugman also actively argued the case for vigorous Keynesian intervention in the economy in his columns for The New York Times . Other prominent economic commentators who have argued for Keynesian government intervention to mitigate the financial crisis include George Akerlof , J. Bradford DeLong , Robert Reich , and Joseph Stiglitz . Newspapers and other media have also cited work relating to Keynes by Hyman Minsky , Robert Skidelsky , Donald Markwell and Axel Leijonhufvud . 
 A series of major bailouts were pursued during the financial crisis , starting on 7 September with the announcement that the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government @-@ sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . In October , Alistair Darling , the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession , in accordance with Keynesian economic thought . Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide . This is in stark contrast to the action imposed on Indonesia during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 , when it was forced by the IMF to close 16 banks at the same time , prompting a bank run . Much of the post @-@ crisis discussion reflected Keynes 's advocacy of international coordination of fiscal or monetary stimulus , and of international economic institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank , which many had argued should be reformed as a " new Bretton Woods " , and should have been even before the crises broke out . The IMF and United Nations economists advocated a coordinated international approach to fiscal stimulus . Donald Markwell argued that in the absence of such an international approach , there would be a risk of worsening international relations and possibly even world war arising from economic factors similar to those present during the depression of the 1930s . 
 By the end of December 2008 , the Financial Times reported that " the sudden resurgence of Keynesian policy is a stunning reversal of the orthodoxy of the past several decades . " In December 2008 , Paul Krugman released his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 , arguing that economic conditions similar to what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned , making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever . In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published Animal Spirits , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as it does not take into account Keynes 's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents . 
 In the March 2009 speech entitled Reform the International Monetary System , Zhou <unk> , the governor of the People 's Bank of China , came out in favour of Keynes 's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency . Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that part of the reason for the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes 's <unk> . Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights ( SDRs ) . Although Zhou 's ideas had not been broadly accepted , leaders meeting in April at the 2009 G @-@ 20 London summit agreed to allow $ 250 billion of special drawing rights to be created by the IMF , to be distributed globally . Stimulus plans were credited for contributing to a better than expected economic outlook by both the OECD and the IMF , in reports published in June and July 2009 . Both organisations warned global leaders that recovery was likely to be slow , so counter recessionary measures ought not be rolled back too early . 
 While the need for stimulus measures was broadly accepted among policy makers , there had been much debate over how to fund the spending . Some leaders and institutions , such as Angela Merkel and the European Central Bank , expressed concern over the potential impact on inflation , national debt and the risk that a too large stimulus will create an unsustainable recovery . 
 Among professional economists the revival of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive . Although many economists , such as George Akerlof , Paul Krugman , Robert Shiller , and Joseph Stiglitz , supported Keynesian stimulus , others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession . Some economists , such as Robert Lucas , questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages . Others , like Robert Barro and Gary Becker , say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist . However , there is a growing academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term , and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective .

 Keynes 's economic thinking only began to achieve close to universal acceptance in the last few years of his life . On a personal level , Keynes 's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge . Keynes 's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation , rare in international relations , as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health . 
 Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek was Keynes 's most prominent contemporary critic , with sharply opposing views on the economy . Yet after Keynes 's death he wrote : 
 He was the one really great man I ever knew , and for whom I had unbounded admiration . The world will be a very much poorer place without him . 
 Lionel Robbins , former head of the economics department at the London School of Economics , who engaged in many heated debates with Keynes in the 1930s , had this to say after observing Keynes in early negotiations with the Americans while drawing up plans for Bretton Woods : 
 This went very well indeed . Keynes was in his most lucid and persuasive mood : and the effect was irresistible . At such moments , I often find myself thinking that Keynes must be one of the most remarkable men that have ever lived – the quick logic , the birdlike swoop of intuition , the vivid fancy , the wide vision , above all the incomparable sense of the fitness of words , all combine to make something several degrees beyond the limit of ordinary human achievement . 
 Douglas <unk> , an official from the Canadian High Commission , wrote : 
 I am spellbound . This is the most beautiful creature I have ever listened to . Does he belong to our species ? Or is he from some other order ? There is something mythic and fabulous about him . I sense in him something massive and sphinx like , and yet also a hint of wings . 
 Bertrand Russell named Keynes one of the most intelligent people he had ever known , commenting : 
 Keynes 's intellect was the sharpest and clearest that I have ever known . When I argued with him , I felt that I took my life in my hands , and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool . 
 Keynes 's obituary in The Times included the comment : 
 There is the man himself – radiant , brilliant , effervescent , gay , full of impish jokes ... He was a humane man genuinely devoted to the cause of the common good .

 As a man of the centre described by some as having the greatest impact of any 20th @-@ century economist , Keynes attracted considerable criticism from both sides of the political spectrum . In the 1920s , Keynes was seen as anti @-@ establishment and was mainly attacked from the right . In the " red 1930s " , many young economists favoured Marxist views , even in Cambridge , and while Keynes was engaging principally with the right to try to persuade them of the merits of more progressive policy , the most vociferous criticism against him came from the left , who saw him as a supporter of capitalism . From the 1950s and onwards , most of the attacks against Keynes have again been from the right . 
 In 1931 Friedrich Hayek extensively critiqued Keynes 's 1930 Treatise on Money . After reading Hayek 's The Road to Serfdom , Keynes wrote to Hayek " Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it " , but concluded the letter with the recommendation : 
 What we need therefore , in my opinion , is not a change in our economic programmes , which would only lead in practice to disillusion with the results of your philosophy ; but perhaps even the contrary , namely , an enlargement of them . Your greatest danger is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States . 
 On the pressing issue of the time , whether deficit spending could lift a country from depression , Keynes replied to Hayek 's criticism in the following way : 
 I should ... conclude rather differently . I should say that what we want is not no planning , or even less planning , indeed I should say we almost certainly want more . But the planning should take place in a community in which as many people as possible , both leaders and followers wholly share your own moral position . Moderate planning will be safe enough if those carrying it out are rightly oriented in their own minds and hearts to the moral issue . 
 Asked why Keynes expressed " moral and philosophical " agreement with Hayek 's Road to Serfdom , Hayek explained : 
 Because he believed that he was fundamentally still a classical English liberal and wasn 't quite aware of how far he had moved away from it . His basic ideas were still those of individual freedom . He did not think systematically enough to see the conflicts . He was , in a sense , corrupted by political necessity . 
 According to some observers , Hayek felt that the post @-@ World War II " Keynesian orthodoxy " gave too much power to the state and led toward socialism . 
 While Milton Friedman described The General Theory as " a great book " , he argues that its implicit separation of nominal from real magnitudes is neither possible nor desirable . Macroeconomic policy , Friedman argues , can reliably influence only the nominal . He and other monetarists have consequently argued that Keynesian economics can result in stagflation , the combination of low growth and high inflation that developed economies suffered in the early 1970s . More to Friedman 's taste was the Tract on Monetary Reform ( 1923 ) , which he regarded as Keynes 's best work because of its focus on maintaining domestic price stability . 
 Joseph Schumpeter was an economist of the same age as Keynes and one of his main rivals . He was among the first reviewers to argue that Keynes 's General Theory was not a general theory , but in fact a special case . He said the work expressed " the attitude of a decaying civilisation " . After Keynes 's death Schumpeter wrote a brief biographical piece Keynes the Economist – on a personal level he was very positive about Keynes as a man , praising his pleasant nature , courtesy and kindness . He assessed some of Keynes 's biographical and editorial work as among the best he 'd ever seen . Yet Schumpeter remained critical about Keynes 's economics , linking Keynes 's childlessness to what Schumpeter saw as an essentially short term view . He considered Keynes to have a kind of unconscious patriotism that caused him to fail to understand the problems of other nations . For Schumpeter " Practical Keynesianism is a seedling which cannot be transplanted into foreign soil : it dies there and becomes poisonous as it dies . " 
 President Harry S. Truman was sceptical of Keynesian theorizing : " Nobody can ever convince me that government can spend a dollar that it 's not got , " he told Leon Keyserling , a Keynesian economist who chaired Truman 's Council of Economic Advisers . 
 = = = Views on race = = = 
 Keynes sometimes explained the mass murder that took place during the first years of communist Russia on a racial basis , as part of the “ Russian and Jewish nature ” , rather than as a result of the communist rule . After a trip to Russia , he wrote in his Short View of Russia that there is " beastliness on the Russian and Jewish natures when , as now , they are allied together " . He also wrote that " out of the cruelty and stupidity of the Old Russia nothing could ever emerge , but ( ... ) beneath the cruelty and stupidity of the New Russia a speck of the ideal may lie hid " , which together with other comments may be construed as anti @-@ Russian and antisemitic . 
 Some critics , including Murray Rothbard , have sought to show that Keynes had sympathy with Nazism , and a number of writers described him as antisemitic . Keynes 's private letters contain portraits and descriptions , some of which can be characterized as antisemitic , others as <unk> . Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current at the time that he accepted uncritically , rather than any racism . On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends , most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom , explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi @-@ occupied Austria . Keynes was a supporter of Zionism , serving on committees supporting the cause . 
 Allegations that he was racist or had totalitarian beliefs have been rejected by Robert Skidelsky and other biographers . Professor Gordon Fletcher wrote that " the suggestion of a link between Keynes and any support of totalitarianism cannot be sustained " . Once the aggressive tendencies of the Nazis towards Jews and other minorities had become apparent , Keynes made clear his loathing of Nazism . As a lifelong pacifist he had initially favoured peaceful containment of Nazi Germany , yet he began to advocate a forceful resolution while many conservatives were still arguing for appeasement . After the war started he roundly criticised the Left for losing their nerve to confront Hitler : 
 The intelligentsia of the Left were the loudest in demanding that the Nazi aggression should be resisted at all costs . When it comes to a showdown , scarce four weeks have passed before they remember that they are pacifists and write defeatist letters to your columns , leaving the defence of freedom and civilisation to Colonel Blimp and the Old School Tie , for whom Three Cheers . 
 = = = Views on inflation = = = 
 Keynes has been characterised as being indifferent or even positive about mild inflation . He had indeed expressed a preference for inflation over deflation , saying that if one has to choose between the two evils , it is " better to disappoint the rentier " than to inflict pain on working class families . He also supported the German hyperinflation as a way to get free from reparations obligations . However , Keynes was also aware of the dangers of inflation . In The Economic Consequences of the Peace , he wrote : 
 Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency . By a continuing process of inflation , governments can confiscate , secretly and unobserved , an important part of the wealth of their citizens . There is no subtler , no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency . The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction , and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose .

 Keynes 's early romantic and sexual relationships were exclusively with men . Keynes had been in relationships while at Eton and Cambridge ; significant among these early partners were Dilly Knox and Daniel Macmillan . Keynes was open about his affairs , and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters . Keynes 's relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be fortunate , as Macmillan 's company first published his tract Economic Consequences of the Peace . 
 Attitudes in the Bloomsbury Group , in which Keynes was avidly involved , were relaxed about homosexuality . Keynes , together with writer Lytton Strachey , had reshaped the Victorian attitudes of the Cambridge Apostles : " since [ their ] time , homosexual relations among the members were for a time common " , wrote Bertrand Russell . The artist Duncan Grant , whom he met in 1908 , was one of Keynes 's great loves . Keynes was also involved with Lytton Strachey , though they were for the most part love rivals , not lovers . Keynes had won the affections of Arthur Hobhouse , and as with Grant , fell out with a jealous Strachey for it . Strachey had previously found himself put off by Keynes , not least because of his manner of " treat [ ing ] his love affairs statistically " . 
 Political opponents have used Keynes 's sexuality to attack his academic work . One line of attack held that he was uninterested in the long term ramifications of his theories because he had no children . 
 Keynes 's friends in the Bloomsbury Group were initially surprised when , in his later years , he began dating and pursuing affairs with women , demonstrating himself to be bisexual . Ray Costelloe ( who would later marry Oliver Strachey ) was an early heterosexual interest of Keynes . In 1906 , Keynes had written of this infatuation that , " I seem to have fallen in love with Ray a little bit , but as she isn 't male I haven 't [ been ] able to think of any suitable steps to take . "
