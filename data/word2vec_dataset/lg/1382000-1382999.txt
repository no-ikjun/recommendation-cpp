 = = Check constraints and foreign keys = = 
 The primary place in which SQL three @-@ valued logic intersects with SQL Data Definition Language ( DDL ) is in the form of check constraints . A check constraint placed on a column operates under a slightly different set of rules than those for the DML WHERE clause . While a DML WHERE clause must evaluate to True for a row , a check constraint must not evaluate to False . ( From a logic perspective , the designated values are True and Unknown . ) This means that a check constraint will succeed if the result of the check is either True or Unknown . The following example table with a check constraint will prohibit any integer values from being inserted into column i , but will allow Null to be inserted since the result of the check will always evaluate to Unknown for Nulls . 
 Because of the change in designated values relative to the WHERE clause , from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for <unk> constraints , meaning <unk> ( p OR NOT p ) always succeeds . Furthermore , assuming Nulls are to be interpreted as existing but unknown values , some pathological <unk> like the one above allow insertion of Nulls that could never be replaced by any non @-@ null value . 
 In order to constrain a column to reject Nulls , the NOT NULL constraint can be applied , as shown in the example below . The NOT NULL constraint is semantically equivalent to a check constraint with an IS NOT NULL predicate . 
 By default check constraints against foreign keys succeed if any of the fields in such keys are Null . For example , the table 
 would allow insertion of rows where author _ last or author _ first are NULL irrespective of how the table Authors is defined or what it contains . More precisely , a null in any of these fields would allow any value in the other one , even on that is not found in Authors table . For example , if Authors contained only ( ' Doe ' , ' John ' ) , then ( ' Smith ' , NULL ) would satisfy the foreign key constraint . SQL @-@ 92 added two extra options for narrowing down the matches in such cases . If MATCH <unk> is added after the <unk> declaration then any non @-@ null must match the foreign key , e. g . ( ' Doe ' , NULL ) would still match , but ( ' Smith ' , NULL ) would not . Finally , if MATCH FULL is added then ( ' Smith ' , NULL ) would not match the constraint either , but ( NULL , NULL ) would still match it . 
 = = Outer joins = = 
 SQL outer joins , including left outer joins , right outer joins , and full outer joins , automatically produce Nulls as placeholders for missing values in related tables . For left outer joins , for instance , Nulls are produced in place of rows missing from the table appearing on the right @-@ hand side of the LEFT <unk> <unk> operator . The following simple example uses two tables to demonstrate Null placeholder production in a left outer join . 
 The first table ( Employee ) contains employee ID numbers and names , while the second table ( <unk> ) contains related employee ID numbers and phone numbers , as shown below . 
 The following sample SQL query performs a left outer join on these two tables . 
 The result set generated by this query demonstrates how SQL uses Null as a placeholder for values missing from the right @-@ hand ( <unk> ) table , as shown below . 
 = = Aggregate functions = = 
 SQL defines aggregate functions to simplify server @-@ side aggregate calculations on data . Except for the COUNT ( * ) function , all aggregate functions perform a Null @-@ elimination step , so that Nulls are not included in the final result of the calculation . 
 Note that the elimination of Null is not equivalent to replacing Null with zero . For example , in the following table , AVG ( i ) ( the average of the values of i ) will give a different result from that of AVG ( j ) : 
 Here AVG ( i ) is 200 ( the average of 150 , 200 , and 250 ) , while AVG ( j ) is 150 ( the average of 150 , 200 , 250 , and 0 ) . A well @-@ known side effect of this is that in SQL AVG ( z ) is not equivalent with SUM ( z ) / COUNT ( * ) . 
 = = When two nulls are equal : grouping , sorting , and some set operations = = 
 Because SQL : 2003 defines all Null markers as being unequal to one another , a special definition was required in order to group Nulls together when performing certain operations . SQL defines " any two values that are equal to one another , or any two Nulls " , as " not distinct " . This definition of not distinct allows SQL to group and sort Nulls when the GROUP BY clause ( and other keywords that perform grouping ) are used . 
 Other SQL operations , clauses , and keywords use " not distinct " in their treatment of Nulls . These include the following : 
 <unk> BY clause of ranking and windowing functions like ROW _ <unk> 
 UNION , <unk> , and <unk> operator , which treat NULLs as the same for row comparison / elimination purposes 
 <unk> keyword used in SELECT queries 
 The principle that Nulls aren 't equal to each other ( but rather that the result is Unknown ) is effectively violated in the SQL specification for the UNION operator , which does identify nulls with each other . Consequently , some set operations in SQL , like union or difference , may produce results not representing sure information , unlike operations involving explicit comparisons with NULL ( e.g. those in a WHERE clause discussed above ) . In Codd 's 1979 proposal ( which was basically adopted by <unk> ) this semantic inconsistency is rationalized by arguing that removal of duplicates in set operations happens " at a lower level of detail than equality testing in the evaluation of retrieval operations . " 
 The SQL standard does not explicitly define a default sort order for Nulls . Instead , on conforming systems , Nulls can be sorted before or after all data values by using the <unk> FIRST or <unk> LAST clauses of the ORDER BY list , respectively . Not all DBMS vendors implement this functionality , however . Vendors who do not implement this functionality may specify different treatments for Null sorting in the DBMS . 
 = = Effect on index operation = = 
 Some SQL products do not index keys containing NULLs . For instance , PostgreSQL versions prior to 8 @.@ 3 did not , with the documentation for a B @-@ tree index stating that 
 B @-@ trees can handle equality and range queries on data that can be sorted into some ordering . In particular , the PostgreSQL query planner will consider using a B @-@ tree index whenever an indexed column is involved in a comparison using one of these operators : < ≤ 
 = ≥ > 
 <unk> equivalent to combinations of these operators , such as <unk> and IN , can also be implemented with a B @-@ tree index search . ( But note that IS NULL is not equivalent to = 
 and is not <unk> . ) 
 In cases where the index enforces uniqueness , NULLs are excluded from the index and uniqueness is not enforced between NULLs . Again , quoting from the PostgreSQL documentation : 
 When an index is declared unique , multiple table rows with equal indexed values will not be allowed . Nulls are not considered equal . A <unk> unique index will only reject cases where all of the indexed columns are equal in two rows . 
 This is consistent with the SQL : 2003 @-@ defined behavior of scalar Null comparisons . 
 Another method of indexing Nulls involves handling them as not distinct in accordance with the SQL : 2003 @-@ defined behavior . For example , Microsoft SQL Server documentation states the following : 
 For indexing purposes , NULLs compare as equal . Therefore , a unique index , or <unk> constraint , cannot be created if the keys are NULL in more than one row . Select columns that are defined as NOT NULL when columns for a unique index or unique constraint are chosen . 
 Both of these indexing strategies are consistent with the SQL : 2003 @-@ defined behavior of Nulls . Because indexing methodologies are not explicitly defined by the SQL : 2003 standard , indexing strategies for Nulls are left entirely to the vendors to design and implement . 
 = = Null @-@ handling functions = = 
 SQL defines two functions to explicitly handle Nulls : NULLIF and COALESCE . Both functions are abbreviations for searched CASE expressions . 
 = = = NULLIF = = = 
 The NULLIF function accepts two parameters . If the first parameter is equal to the second parameter , NULLIF returns Null . Otherwise , the value of the first parameter is returned . 
 Thus , NULLIF is an abbreviation for the following CASE expression : 
 = = = COALESCE = = = 
 The COALESCE function accepts a list of parameters , returning the first non @-@ Null value from the list : 
 COALESCE is defined as shorthand for the following SQL CASE expression : 
 Some SQL <unk> implement vendor @-@ specific functions similar to COALESCE . Some systems ( e.g. <unk> @-@ SQL ) implement an <unk> function , or other similar functions that are functionally similar to COALESCE . ( See Is functions for more on the IS functions in <unk> @-@ SQL . ) 
 = = = NVL = = = 
 The Oracle NVL function accepts two parameters . It returns the first non @-@ NULL parameter or NULL if all parameters are NULL . 
 A COALESCE expression can be converted into an equivalent NVL expression thus : 
 turns into : 
 A use case of this function is to replace in an expression a NULL by a value like in NVL ( <unk> , 0 ) which says , ' if <unk> is NULL , replace it with the value 0 ' . 
 There is , however , one notable exception . In most implementations , COALESCE evaluates its parameters until it reaches the first non @-@ NULL one , while NVL evaluates all of its parameters . This is important for several reasons . A parameter after the first non @-@ NULL parameter could be a function , which could either be computationally expensive , invalid , or could create unexpected side effects . 
 = = Data typing of Null and Unknown = = 
 The NULL literal is <unk> in SQL , meaning that it is not designated as an integer , character , or any other specific data type . Because of this , it is sometimes mandatory ( or desirable ) to explicitly convert Nulls to a specific data type . For instance , if overloaded functions are supported by the RDBMS , SQL might not be able to automatically resolve to the correct function without knowing the data types of all parameters , including those for which Null is passed . 
 Conversion from the NULL literal to a Null of a specific type is possible using the CAST introduced in SQL @-@ 92 . For example : 
 represents an absent value of type <unk> . 
 The actual typing of Unknown ( distinct or not from NULL itself ) varies between SQL implementations . For example , the following 
 parses and executes successfully in some environments ( e.g. SQLite or PostgreSQL ) which unify a NULL boolean with Unknown but fails to parse in others ( e.g. in SQL Server Compact ) . MySQL behaves similarly to PostgreSQL in this regard ( with the minor exception that MySQL regards TRUE and <unk> as no different from the ordinary integers 1 and 0 ) . PostgreSQL additionally implements a IS UNKNOWN predicate , which can be used to test whether a three @-@ value logical outcome is Unknown , although this is merely syntactic sugar . 
 = = BOOLEAN data type = = 
 The ISO SQL : 1999 standard introduced the BOOLEAN data type to SQL , however it 's still just an optional , non @-@ core feature , coded <unk> . 
 When restricted by a NOT NULL constraint , the SQL BOOLEAN works like the Boolean type from other languages . Unrestricted however , the BOOLEAN datatype , despite its name , can hold the truth values TRUE , <unk> , and UNKNOWN , all of which are defined as boolean literals according to the standard . The standard also asserts that NULL and UNKNOWN " may be used interchangeably to mean exactly the same thing " . 
 The Boolean type has been subject of criticism , particularly because of the mandated behavior of the UNKNOWN literal , which is never equal to itself because of the identification with NULL . 
 As discussed above , in the PostgreSQL implementation of SQL , Null is used to represent all UNKNOWN results , including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN . PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal ( although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator , which is an orthogonal feature . ) Most other major vendors do not support the Boolean type ( as defined in <unk> ) as of 2012 . The procedural part of Oracle 's PL / SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables ; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 = = = Common mistakes = = = 
 Misunderstanding of how Null works is the cause of a great number of errors in SQL code , both in ISO standard SQL statements and in the specific SQL dialects supported by real @-@ world database management systems . These mistakes are usually the result of confusion between Null and either 0 ( zero ) or an empty string ( a string value with a length of zero , represented in SQL as ' ' ) . Null is defined by the ISO SQL standard as different from both an empty string and the numerical value 0 , however . While Null indicates the absence of any value , the empty string and numerical zero both represent actual values . 
 A classic error is attempting to use the equality operator to find NULLs . Most SQL implementations will execute the following query as syntactically correct ( therefore give no error message ) but it never returns any rows , regardless of whether NULLs do exist in the table . 
 In a related , but more subtle example , a WHERE clause or conditional statement might compare a column 's value with a constant . It is often incorrectly assumed that a missing value would be " less than " or " not equal to " a constant if that field contains Null , but , in fact , such expressions return Unknown . An example is below : 
 Similarly , Nulls are often confused with empty strings . Consider the <unk> function , which returns the number of characters in a string . When a Null is passed into this function , the function returns Null . This can lead to unexpected results , if users are not well versed in 3 @-@ value logic . An example is below : 
 This is complicated by the fact that in some database interface programs ( or even database implementations like Oracle 's ) , NULL is reported as an empty string , and empty strings may be incorrectly stored as NULL . 
 = = = Criticisms = = = 
 The ISO SQL implementation of Null is the subject of criticism , debate and calls for change . In The Relational Model for Database Management : Version 2 , Codd suggested that the SQL implementation of Null was flawed and should be replaced by two distinct Null @-@ type markers . The markers he proposed were to stand for " Missing but Applicable " and " Missing but <unk> " , known as A @-@ values and I @-@ values , respectively . Codd 's recommendation , if accepted , would have required the implementation of a four @-@ valued logic in SQL . Others have suggested adding additional Null @-@ type markers to Codd 's recommendation to indicate even more reasons that a data value might be " Missing " , increasing the complexity of SQL 's logic system . At various times , proposals have also been put forth to implement multiple user @-@ defined Null markers in SQL . Because of the complexity of the Null @-@ handling and logic systems required to support multiple Null markers , none of these proposals have gained widespread acceptance . 
 Chris Date and Hugh Darwen , authors of The Third Manifesto , have suggested that the SQL Null implementation is inherently flawed and should be eliminated altogether , pointing to inconsistencies and flaws in the implementation of SQL Null @-@ handling ( particularly in aggregate functions ) as proof that the entire concept of Null is flawed and should be removed from the relational model . Others , like author Fabian Pascal , have stated a belief that " how the function calculation should treat missing values is not governed by the relational model . " 
 = = = Closed world assumption = = = 
 Another point of conflict concerning Nulls is that they violate the closed world assumption model of relational databases by introducing an open world assumption into it . The closed world assumption , as it pertains to databases , states that " Everything stated by the database , either explicitly or implicitly , is true ; everything else is false . " This view assumes that the knowledge of the world stored within a database is complete . Nulls , however , operate under the open world assumption , in which some items stored in the database are considered unknown , making the database 's stored knowledge of the world incomplete .

 Claire Peterson ( Jennifer Lopez ) separates from her husband Garrett ( John Corbett ) , after he was caught cheating with his secretary . Her colleague and best friend Vicky Lansing ( Kristin Chenoweth ) urges Claire to divorce . Claire meets 19 @-@ year @-@ old Noah <unk> ( Ryan Guzman ) — the orphaned nephew of her wheelchair @-@ bound neighbor — who has just moved in next door . Noah befriends Kevin ( Ian Nelson ) , Claire 's teenage son , and begins attending his school , where Claire teaches English literature . Noah is drawn to Claire , expressing love for Homer 's Iliad . With Kevin and Garrett away on a fishing trip , Claire watches a naked Noah in his room through her window . 
 Claire goes on a miserable double date with Vicky and her boyfriend Ethan ( Travis Schuldt ) , and his ill @-@ mannered friend Benny ( Bailey Chase ) . With Kevin still away , Noah calls Claire over to help him cook . She ends up having dinner with him , during which he unashamedly flirts with her . Despite Claire 's hesitation , she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex . Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together , causing him to punch a wall in rage . The school year begins , with Noah joining an uncomfortable Claire 's class after hacking into her computer , making it appear as if she had requested this . Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father , causing him to lash out at Garrett . Later , Kevin <unk> himself at the gymnasium and goes into shock ; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin 's EpiPen . Claire receives flowers from Noah , and she confronts him about this . Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett on a date together , which escalates his obsession with her . 
 After an incident where Noah — in defense of Kevin — slams a bully 's ( Adam Hicks ) head into a locker repeatedly , Vicky ( who is vice principal at the school ) discovers that Noah was kicked out of his previous school for disorderly conduct . After an encounter where Noah insults her , she expels him . During the fall fling , Claire goes to investigate a leak in the boys ' bathroom , where she instead sees the words " I fucked Claire Peterson " written on the wall before Noah emerges . He attempts to force himself on her , but she fends him off and demands that he stay away from her and Kevin . The following day , Noah leaves a printer running in Claire 's classroom , with images of them sleeping together scattered everywhere . When Garrett 's car brakes fail to work , he and Kevin are nearly involved in an accident . Noah blackmails Claire ; telling her that he has a tape of them having sex , which he will relinquish to her if she continues sleeping with him . She refuses , and organizes a plot with Vicky to steer Noah away from his house . Claire breaks into Noah 's house and sees hundreds of images of herself in his basement . She finds his laptop , deleting their sex tape , and also sees images of car brakes , implying that he rigged Garrett 's brakes . She meets with Detective Chou ( François Chau ) , who informs her that Noah 's father was killed after swerving into a truck with his minivan . 
 Noah binds and gags Vicky with duct tape and uses an audio recording of her voice to lure Claire to her house . When Claire arrives , she discovers Vicky 's dead body , with her throat having been slashed by Noah . A horrified Claire contacts the police , but runs into Noah again . He reveals to her that his mother killed herself after his father cheated on her , so he rigged the brakes of his father 's minivan , killing him and his mistress . Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has kidnapped Garrett and Kevin , threatening to kill them unless Claire stays with him . A violent altercation occurs as Claire attempts to free them . Noah pours kerosene around the barn , causing it to ignite in flames . Garrett , having freed himself , attempts to choke Noah with a rope , prompting Noah to shoot him in the chest . Claire stabs Noah 's eye with Kevin 's EpiPen . When he later holds Kevin at gunpoint , she pulls a switch that drops an engine on Noah , killing him . Claire and Kevin then help a wounded Garrett exit the burning barn house as the police arrive . Garrett is put in an ambulance . A paramedic says that Garrett will be fine . Claire and Kevin ride in the ambulance with him .

 Screenwriter Barbara Curry , who was a criminal lawyer for ten years , revealed that she developed the script 's concept after running past a house which she described as her " dream house " . A " bad boy " her son went to school with resided in the house across the street , which gave her a " really interesting " concept about a neighborhood boy creating conflict and " driving a wedge between a family " . This served as her inspiration for the screenplay . 
 Curry stated that the " first few drafts of [ the movie ] focused on a 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy and a mother 's trial of trying to get her son out of this boy 's clutches , and gradually , it became something else " . In the original script , Claire was " happily married " , but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband 's infidelity , so that she could be a " more sympathetic character " . Curry was influenced by the real @-@ life story of Mary Kay Letourneau , a teacher who became involved with her underage student , causing her to be convicted for rape charges . Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry 's draft , the character of Noah was younger , but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19 , because he felt as if it was " not healthy " and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist . Explaining her character , Lopez stated that Claire was feeling " worthless " after her husband cheated , and " People can understand that . They can understand making a mistake in a moment like that . " 
 The Boy Next Door 's plot has been compared to the thriller films Basic Instinct ( 1992 ) and <unk> ( 2002 ) , while being dubbed " the Fatal Attraction of 2015 " . The formerly dominant erotic thriller genre had been fading from Hollywood features since the 1990s . Director Rob Cohen stated that with the film , he wanted to " reinvent the genre in an entertaining way " that would reflect " 2015 , not 1990 " .

In October 2013 , John Corbett and Ryan Guzman were cast in the film , with Corbett played as Lopez 's ex @-@ husband , while Guzman played the titular role . After an audition , newcomer Lexi Atkins was also cast in the film for a small role . 
 Lopez , who also served as producer on the film , chose a fellow Latino actor Guzman to cast in the film , and for which she stated that " two Latinos opening in a mainstream movie , if it does well , that 's gonna change things . I would love for the Latino community to come out and support this movie because it would give us the freedom .

According to CinemaScore , audiences gave the film a grade of " B − " on an A + to F scale . 
 Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle , Thomas Lee wrote : " Why Lopez decided to do this inept , cliche @-@ infested film is anyone 's guess " . Peter Keough of The Boston Globe wrote that " [ the film ] may end up as one of the worst movies of 2015 , but it is also one of the most entertaining " .

Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times was critical of The Boy Next Door , calling it " breathless , uninspired ( ... ) junk that feels like the <unk> bits of a Lifetime movie and late @-@ night cable schlock slapped together " , calling Guzman 's character boring . Entertainment Weekly 's Leah Greenblatt similarly wrote that the film was a " few deliciously bonkers bons mots dot the Lifetime @-@ grade dialogue " , while calling its script " too timid to fully dive into the high camp it hints at " . Despite negative reviews , Lopez has received praise . Richard Lawson from Vanity Fair wrote : " Given the material , Lopez is actually pretty darn good in the movie , taking it seriously enough that it 's not <unk> arch camp , but also plenty aware that she 's not doing Shakespeare .

 Daniel D 'Addario from Time called the movie " clunky and ridiculous " , but also called it " a rare movie about women " and " the Bad Movie Hollywood Needs Right Now , " adding that : " Lopez 's new project represents an earnest attempt to capitalize on a very real public hunger to see a woman at the center of a mainstream movie — not an indie , but an old @-@ fashioned popcorn flick .

 " In the Name of the Grandfather " was the first episode written by Matt Marshall who had previously worked on the show as a writers ' assistant . In 2007 , he pitched the idea of Grampa being neglected and the Simpsons taking him to Ireland . The script was ready for a table read in late 2007 , but the Writers Guild of America strike delayed work on the episode . Executive producer Al Jean said the episode is intended to be " an affectionate love letter to Ireland " because many of the writers have Irish roots . He added , " The episode is based on the experiences of myself and a lot of the writers on The Simpsons who have Irish ancestry and come back to visit to find it very different , much more hi @-@ tech . " According to James L. Brooks , the story was also inspired by a New York Times article about the effects of the smoking ban in Ireland on pubs . 
 Previous episodes of the show where the Simpsons visit other countries have been controversial . For example , the Simpsons visited Australia in " Bart vs. Australia " ( season six , 1995 ) and Brazil in " Blame It on Lisa " ( season 13 , 2002 ) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries . In the latter case , Rio de Janeiro 's tourist board — who claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime , kidnappings , slums , and monkey and rat infestations — went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action . When asked whether he thought this episode would generate similar controversies , Al Jean replied " I 'm Irish American and I know Irish people have an excellent sense of humor so we weren 't very worried . "

 Colm Meaney guest starred as Tom O 'Flanagan . Al Jean felt that Meaney was " just perfect with his voice " . For the episode , Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová reprised their roles as a street musician and Eastern European woman , respectively , from the film Once . They recorded their parts in October 2008 in Los Angeles during their tour of the United States . 
 In a September 2008 interview , Jean said that Kenneth Branagh would guest star as the pub owner and that he had come in to record the part . However , Branagh was replaced by Meaney and did not appear in the episode . According to Fox 's official press release , Kathy Ireland was to have a cameo as herself . However , although she appeared in animated form in the episode , a caption stated that the producers asked her to guest voice and that she had declined . The voice of her character was performed by Tress MacNeille . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode featured numerous jokes about and references to Ireland and its culture . First of all , the title refers to the Irish film In the Name of the Father . The Simpson family visits landmarks including Blarney Castle and Guinness Brewery as well as the Giant 's Causeway . The fictional village of <unk> contains yuppie leprechauns described by Grampa as " <unk> " and Homer drinks Guinness beer . An advertising executive with Guinness stated that a deal had to be worked out with The Simpsons producers in order for the brand to appear in the episode . The Simpsons visit Dublin on Bloomsday , a day when people recreate the events in James Joyce 's novel Ulysses . Homer says that he wants to take Ireland back to the " good old days of Angela 's Ashes " , referencing Irish author Frank McCourt 's memoir . In his flashback , Grampa dances in Riverdance style . Musicians Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová reprise their roles from the 2007 Irish film Once - much of which was originally shot in Mountjoy Square , Dublin , coincidentally a location that is also featured in Ulysses . A billboard in Ireland advertises a U2 moving company with the slogan " We Move in Mysterious Ways " . Grandpa angrily tells the family when they forgot about the family visit day that " I was lonelier than Estes Kefauver at a meeting of Murder , Inc . , and his follow @-@ up to the Simpsons ' non @-@ recognition is " That actually makes sense ! " is accurate : Kefauver was a Democratic U.S. Senator from Tennessee who chaired the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce in 1950 , and as they were the largest organized crime syndicate in the U.S. at that time , Murder , Inc. would not have been very welcoming to Sen. Kefauver if he had ever showed up at one of their gatherings . Ina spoof of the theme of Irish Immigrants going to America , this episode had immigrants coming from America to settle in Ireland @-@ and receiving Irish Surnames ; likewise Homer Simpson finds himself deported from Ireland to Springfield USA in care of comic relief idiot Clancy <unk> . 
 Apart from the references to Ireland Bart also makes a derogatory remark about Belgium , causing Marge to threaten him with " taking his <unk> away " , whereupon Bart clutches a copy of the Tintin album The Crab with the Golden Claws to his chest , promising he 'll behave .

 " In the Name of the Grandfather " was first episode of The Simpsons to premiere in Europe before airing on Fox in the United States . Previously , new episodes of the show occasionally aired on the Global Television Network in Canada a half @-@ hour before they aired on Fox . Global simulcasts shows from several American networks and the occasional special forces them to push episodes of The Simpsons to an earlier timeslot . 
 The episode aired at 7 : 30 PM on Sky1 and was paired with " Sex , Pies and Idiot Scrapes " , the season premiere episode of The Simpsons , which begins with a visit to a St. Patrick 's Day parade . The special broadcast is part of Fox 's year @-@ long " Best . 20 Years . Ever . " celebration which commemorates the 20th anniversary of the show . To promote the broadcast , executive producers Al Jean and James L. Brooks , as well as Nancy Cartwright visited Ireland and participated in the Saint Patrick 's Day parade in Dublin . The episode was screened at the Lighthouse Cinema in Dublin on March 16 . In addition , Homer was announced as the special guest editor of the March edition of Sky Magazine . To promote the episode in the United States , several people dressed as Marge visited pubs in various major cities on March 17 and gave away codes for free cell phone ringtones and wallpaper . A clip from the episode was played all day on the JumboTron screen in Times Square , New York City . 
 Before " In the Name of the Grandfather " aired , Irish bookmaker Paddy Power started taking bets on what would happen in the episode . It offered odds on things such as which Irish phrase Homer would use first , number of viewers , and which Irish star would make a cameo appearance .

 Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times wrote that it " may not have been a vintage episode [ ... ] but it had plenty of good moments , and from an Irish perspective it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves through the eyes of the greatest comedy series ever written . " He added that " even as it reveled in stereotypes , it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn 't conform to American 's [ sic ] views of it . " Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars . He wrote that he enjoyed the jokes about the Irish landmarks but called it " a fairly slapdash , ramshackle half @-@ hour " and mentioned that Colm Meaney deserved a better role . Evan Fanning of the Sunday Independent wrote " Yes , The Simpsons came to Ireland and all we got was some lousy rehashed jokes and a feeling that the whole thing was a bit of a waste of time . " 
 Robert Canning of IGN wrote " It wasn 't the funniest of foreign land adventures , but it was serviceable .

 = Junior Eurovision Song Contest = 
 The Junior Eurovision Song Contest ( French : Concours Eurovision de la Chanson Junior ) , often shortened to <unk> , Junior Eurovision or Junior <unk> , is a song competition which has been organised by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) annually since 2003 and is open exclusively to broadcasters that are members of the EBU . It is held in a different European city each year , however the same city can host the contest more than once . 
 The competition has many similarities to the Eurovision Song Contest from which its name is taken . Each participating broadcaster sends an act , the members of which are aged 10 to 15 on the day of the contest , and an original song lasting between 2 minutes 45 seconds and 3 minutes to compete against the other entries . Each entry represents the country served by the participating broadcaster . Viewers from the participating countries are invited to vote for their favourite performances by televote and a national jury from each participating country also vote . The overall winner of the contest is the entry that has received the most points after the scores from every country have been collected and totalled . The current winner is Destiny <unk> of Malta , who won the 2015 contest in Bulgaria with " Not My Soul " . The highest scoring winner is also Destiny <unk> of Malta who won the 2015 contest with a record 185 points . 
 In addition to the countries taking part , the contest has been screened in Australia every year . Estonia , Finland and Germany also broadcast the inaugural contest in 2003 , followed by Andorra in 2006 and Bosnia and Herzegovina ( in 2006 , 2008 and 2009 ) , however these countries have yet to participate . Since 2006 , the contest has been streamed live on the Internet through the official website of the contest . Australia was invited to sing at the 2015 contest . 
 = = Origins and history = = 
 The origins of the contest date back to 2000 when Danmarks Radio held a song contest for Danish children that year and the following year . The idea was extended to a Scandinavian song festival in 2002 , MGP Nordic , with Denmark , Norway and Sweden as participants . The EBU picked up the idea for a song contest featuring children and opened the competition to all EBU member broadcasters making it a pan @-@ European event . The working title of the programme was " Eurovision Song Contest for Children " , branded with the name of the EBU 's already popular song competition , the Eurovision Song Contest . Denmark was asked to host the first programme after their experience with their own contests and the MGP Nordic . 
 After a successful first contest , the second faced several location problems . The event originally should have been organised by British broadcaster ITV in Manchester . ITV then announced that due to financial and scheduling reasons , the contest would not take place in the United Kingdom after all . It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years ' audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount . The EBU approached Croatian broadcaster HRT , who had won the previous contest , to stage the event in Zagreb ; though it later emerged that HRT had ' forgotten ' to book the venue in which the contest would have taken place . It was at this point , with five months remaining until the event would be held , that Norwegian broadcaster NRK stepped in to host the contest in Lillehammer . 
 Broadcasters have had to bid for the rights to host the contest since 2004 to avoid such problems from happening again . Belgium was therefore the first country to successfully bid for the rights to host the contest in 2005 . 
 All contests have been broadcast in 16 : 9 widescreen and in high definition . All have also had a CD produced with the songs from the show . Between 2003 and 2006 , DVDs of the contest were also produced though this ended due to lack of interest . 
 As of 2008 , the winner of the contest is decided by 50 % televote and 50 % national jury vote . The winners of all previous contests had been decided exclusively by televoting . Between 2003 and 2005 viewers had around 10 minutes to vote after all the songs had been performed . Between 2006 and 2010 the televoting lines have been open throughout the programme . Since 2011 viewers vote after all the songs had been performed . Profits made from the televoting during the 2007 and 2008 contests were donated to UNICEF . 
 Prior to 2007 , a participating broadcaster 's failure in not broadcasting the contest live would incur a fine . Now broadcasters are no longer required to broadcast the contest live , but may transmit it with some delay at a time that is more appropriate for children 's television broadcast . 
 The 2007 contest was the subject of the 2008 documentary Sounds Like Teen Spirit : A <unk> . The film followed several contestants as they made their way through the national finals and onto the show itself . It was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival 2008 and was premiered in Ghent , Belgium and Limassol , Cyprus where the 2008 contest was held . 
 = = Format = = 
 The format of the contest has remained relatively unchanged over the course of its history in that the format consists of successive live musical performances by the artists entered by the participating broadcasters . The EBU claims that the aim of the programme is " to promote young talent in the field of popular music , by encouraging competition among the [ ... ] performers " . 
 The programme is always screened on a Saturday night in late November / early December and lasts approximately two hours fifteen minutes . 
 Traditionally the contest will consist of an opening ceremony in which the performers are welcomed to the event , the performances of the entries , a recap of the songs to help televoting viewers decide which entries to vote for , an interval act usually performed after the televoting has closed , the results of the televoting or back @-@ up jury voting which is then followed by the declaration of the winner and a reprise of the winning song . At various points throughout the show , networks may opt out for a few minutes to screen a commercial break . 
 Since 2008 the winning entry of each contest has been decided by a mixture of televoting and national juries , each counting for fifty percent of the points awarded by each country . The winners of all previous contests had been decided exclusively by televoting . The ten entries that have received the most votes in each country are awarded points ranging from one to eight , then ten and twelve . These points are then announced live during the programme by a spokesperson representing the participating country ( who , like the participants , is aged between ten and fifteen ) . Once all participating countries have announced their results , the country that has received the most points is declared the winner of that year 's contest . 
 Until 2013 the winners receive a trophy and a certificate . Since 2013 contest the winner , runner @-@ up and third place all win trophies and certificates . 
 Originally , unlike it 's adult version , the winning country did not receive the rights to host the next contest . This was changed in 2012 , the winning country now has first refusal on hosting the next contest . 
 The contest usually features two presenters , one man and one woman ( though the 2006 , 2014 , and 2015 contests were exceptions to this ) , who regularly appear on stage and with the contestants in the green room . The presenters are also responsible for repeating the results immediately after the spokesperson of each broadcaster to confirm which country the points are being given <unk> spokespersons are giving the points in the arena stage . 
 Despite the Junior Eurovision Song Contest being modelled on the format of the Eurovision Song Contest , there are many distinctive differences that are unique to the children 's contest . For instance , while the main vocals must be sung live during the contest , backing vocals may be recorded onto the backing track . Each country 's entry must be selected through a televised national final ( unless circumstances prevent this and permission is gained from the EBU ) . Each country 's performance is also allowed a maximum of eight performers on stage , as opposed to the original number of six in the Eurovision Song Contest . Since 2005 every contestant has automatically been awarded 12 points to prevent the contestants scoring zero points , although ending with 12 points total is in essence the same as receiving zero , however , no entry has ever received the infamous " nul points " . 
 = = Entry restrictions = = 
 The song must be written and sung in the national language ( or one of the national languages ) of the country being represented . However , they can also have a few lines in a different language . The same rule was in the adults ' contest from 1966 to 1972 and again from 1977 to 1998 . Performers must be nationals of that country or have lived there for at least two years . 
 Originally the competition was open to children between the ages of 8 and 15 , however since 2007 the age range has been narrowed and presently only children aged 10 to 15 on the day of the contest are allowed to enter . 
 The song submitted into the contest cannot have previously been released commercially and must last between 2 minutes 45 seconds and 3 minutes ( as of 2013 onwards ) . The rule stating that performers also must not have previously released music commercially was active from 2003 to 2006 . This rule was dropped in 2007 thus allowing already experienced singers and bands in the competition . As a result , NRK chose to withdraw from the contest . 
 Since 2008 , adults have been allowed to assist in the writing of entries . Previously , all writers had to be aged 10 to 15 . 
 = = Organisation = = 
 The contest is produced each year by the European Broadcasting Union . The executive supervisor of every contest since 2003 has been Svante <unk> who also heads the " Steering Group " that decides on the rules of the contest , which broadcaster hosts the next contest and oversees the entire production of each programme . In 2011 , he was succeeded by Sietse Bakker . In 2013 , Vladislav Yakovlev took over the position of the EBU executive supervisor . The current EBU executive supervisor is Jon Ola Sand , the Norwegian who is also the executive supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest since 2011 . 
 Steering Group meetings tend to include the " Heads of Delegation " whose principal job is to liaise between the EBU and the broadcaster they represent . It is also their duty to make sure that the performers are never left alone without an adult and to " create a team atmosphere amongst the [ performers ] and to develop their experience and a sense of community . " 
 The list of executive supervisors of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest appointed by the EBU since the first edition ( 2003 ) is the following : 
 Svante <unk> ( 2003 – 2010 ) 
 Sietse Bakker ( 2011 – 2012 )

 = Tropical Storm Arlene ( 1993 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Arlene brought torrential rainfall to the western United States Gulf Coast , particularly to the U.S. state of Texas , in June 1993 . The first named storm of the annual hurricane season , Arlene developed from an area of low pressure in the Bay of Campeche on June 18 . The depression slowly strengthened as it tracked west @-@ northwestward and later north @-@ northwestward across the western Gulf of Mexico . Arlene was subsequently upgraded to a tropical storm on June 19 , but failed to intensify further due to its proximity to land . The cyclone then made landfall on Padre Island , Texas , with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) and degenerated into a remnant disturbance on June 21 . 
 The precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Arlene dropped heavy rainfall over Central America . As a result , 20 fatalities occurred , all of which were from a mudslide in El Salvador . Heavy rainfall also produced heavy rainfall on the Yucatán Peninsula . After Arlene became a tropical cyclone , rainfall in Mexico inundated areas of Campeche , where damage totaled US $ 33 million . In total , five people were killed in Mexico . Flood damage in South Texas was extensive , with widespread urban flooding and road closures . Entire plots of farmland were inundated by torrential rains brought by Arlene . The landfalling Arlene interacted with a passing cold front which helped to produce showers further northeast , though damage in those locales was comparatively less severe . In total , Arlene caused 26 deaths and at least US $ 60 @.@ 8 million in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The precursor to Arlene was first identified in satellite images as a cluster of disturbed weather east of the Mosquito Coast on June 9 . Over the following week , the system grew in expanse as it slowly tracked northwestward as strong wind shear in the area prohibited the development of a tropical cyclone . On June 16 , the formation of an upper @-@ level low over the Bay of Campeche and the progression of a tropical wave across the Caribbean Sea helped foster the development of a low @-@ pressure area over the Yucatán Peninsula . Although initially diffuse , new rainbands began to wrap around the new vortex 's center , and at 0000 UTC , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) classified the system as a tropical depression west of the Yucatán Peninsula . Although the storm was now considered a tropical cyclone , wind shear that had earlier inhibited development remained present , as well as the outflow of Tropical Storm Beatriz in the Eastern Pacific , disrupting the core of the infant tropical depression ; aircraft reconnaissance often could not identify a defined center of circulation . 
 While the initial system in the Bay of Campeche continued to struggle in its organization , a new cluster of thunderstorms concentrated in a band developed to the depression 's northwest late on June 18 . Over the next 24 hours , this new area of precipitation began to wrap cyclonically around a new and dominant circulation center ; the NHC assumed the tropical depression to have relocated to the northwest and classified the system as Tropical Storm Arlene at 1200 UTC on June 19 . As Arlene would not strengthen after classification , peak intensity was attained concurrent with its upgrade to tropical storm strength with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 71 inHg ) . Meandering off the coast of South Texas due to the presence of a shortwave trough to its north , Arlene eventually made landfall at 0900 UTC on June 20 at a virtually unchanged intensity at point on Padre Island roughly 45 mi ( 70 km ) south of Corpus Christi , Texas . The tropical storm quickly deteriorated to tropical depression intensity after landfall , and was no longer considered a tropical cyclone after 0600 UTC on June 21 . The remnants of Arlene continued to track across the Rio Grande Valley before they faded into the ambient environment .

 = = = Central America and the Gulf of Mexico = = = 
 The precursor to Arlene caused torrential and prolonged rainfall across Central America . In El Salvador , a single landslide attributed to the flooding killed 20 people . Flooding in Mexico associated with the tropical system killed four in the state of Yucatán and one in Campeche , where flood damage was estimated at US $ 33 million . As many as 4 @,@ 000 homes were flooded , impacting roughly 10 @,@ 000 people and prompting Mexican armed forces to implement emergency rescue plans in the state . The highest rainfall total in Mexico was documented in Mérida , Yucatán , where a station measured 13 @.@ 26 in ( 336 mm ) of rain . As a tropical cyclone , however , Arlene 's highest rainfall total occurred in the Camargo Municipality of Tamaulipas , where 7 @.@ 32 in ( 186 mm ) of rain was reported . In Matamoros , roads were blocked by mud and rocks . 
 Arlene passed over several offshore oil platforms as it tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico , producing gusty winds . The strongest surface wind gust reported in association with Arlene was clocked at 63 mph ( 101 km / h ) on an oil platform south of Sabine Pass , Texas . Four other oil platforms experienced gusts or sustained winds of at least gale force . 
 = = = Texas = = = 
 Due to the unanticipated relocation of Arlene , only one tropical cyclone watch or warning — a tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Brownsville to Matagorda on June 19 — was ever issued by the NHC in association with the cyclone . Issued 21 hours before landfall , the warning was discontinued after the system moved inland . Prior to the warning , Arlene had satisfied the criterion for a tropical storm watch as a developing tropical depression . However , the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the watch as a result of the poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time . Given the weak nature of Arlene and the relatively unpopulated extent of coast which it impacted , evacuations were minimal – only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola , Texas due to the threat of flooding . 
 On the Texas coast , Arlene produced a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in some areas , breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding . The storm tide also eroded up to a foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) of sand from beaches in the lower Texas coast . Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene , the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches . Beach erosion occurred as far north as Galveston Bay , where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) . A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard . Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi , a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage . Nearby , the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated with the exception of one lane , prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later . 
 Precipitation from the tropical storm reached areas 170 mi ( 275 km ) inland , and was enhanced in northeastern Texas , Louisiana , and Arkansas as a result of interaction between the cyclone and a passing frontal boundary . Arlene exacerbated preexisting flood conditions in some areas of South Texas . Rainfall peaked at 15 @.@ 26 in ( 388 mm ) in Angleton , Texas , and other localized rainfall maxima of at least 10 in ( 250 mm ) were observed in Texas . The torrential precipitation caused rivers to swell and overflow their banks , forcing farm @-@ to @-@ market roads to close and inundating plots of crops . Portions of Interstate 10 were forced to close after flood waters overran the highway . The entirety of the watermelon crop in Waller County was eliminated by the floods . In Kingswood , Texas , some homes were flooded . One storm @-@ related death occurred in Henderson , where rain was measured at 14 @.@ 82 in ( 326 mm ) . 
 The deep moisture from Arlene caused extensive crop damage , with 20 % losses to the cantaloupe crop , 10 % for the watermelon crop , and 18 % of the tomato crop , resulting in US $ 3 – 5 million in damage in East Texas . In the Brownsville area , standing floodwaters ruined the near harvest @-@ ready sorghum crop and killed blossoming cotton plants . Street flooding was prevalent in urban areas . At one point during the storm downtown Raymondville was completely underwater . The U.S. Coast Guard deployed small boats to the city to encourage the evacuation of about 250 homes . Urban flooding also occurred in the Corpus Christi area , in addition to an increase of weeds and insects . A station in the city set a daily record for rainfall with 2 @.@ 57 in ( 65 mm ) of rain over a seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hour period . Roughly 50 @,@ 000 ac ( 20 @,@ 000 ha ) of sorghum , 11 @,@ 000 ac ( 4 @,@ 000 ha ) of cotton , and 8 ac ( 3 ha ) of <unk> cotton were inundated in Refugio County .

 = Cartman Gets an Anal Probe = 
 " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " is the first episode of the animated television series South Park . It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on August 13 , 1997 . The episode introduces child protagonists Eric Cartman , Kyle Broflovski , Stan Marsh and Kenny McCormick , who attempt to rescue Kyle 's younger brother Ike from being abducted by aliens . 
 At the time of the writing of the episode , South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not yet have a series contract with Comedy Central . Short on money , the creators animated the episode using paper cutout stop motion technique , similar to the short films that were the precursors to the series . " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " remains the only South Park episode animated largely without the use of computer technology . 
 Part of a reaction to the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States , South Park is deliberately offensive . Much of the show 's humor , and of " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " , arises from the juxtaposition of the seeming innocence of childhood and the violent , crude behavior exhibited by the main characters . The episode also exemplifies the carnivalesque , which includes humor , bodily excess , linguistic games that challenge official discourse , and the inversion of social structures . 
 Initial reviews of the episode were generally negative ; critics singled out the gratuitous obscenity of the show for particular scorn . Regarding the amount of obscenity in the episode , Parker later commented that they felt " pressure " to live up to the earlier shorts which first made the duo popular . Critics also compared South Park unfavorably with what they felt were more complex and nuanced animated shows , such as Beavis and Butt @-@ Head and The Simpsons . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As Kyle , Stan , Kenny and Cartman wait for the school bus , Kyle 's little brother , Ike , tries to follow Kyle to school ; Kyle tells Ike he can 't come to school with him . Cartman tells the boys about a dream he had the previous night about being abducted by aliens . The others try to convince him the events did happen and that the aliens are called " visitors " , but Cartman refuses to believe them . Chef pulls up in his car and asks if the boys saw the alien spaceship the previous evening , inadvertently confirming Cartman 's " dream " , and relays stories of alien anal probes ( which throughout the episode Cartman denies he experienced ) . After Chef leaves , the school bus picks up the boys , and ( looking out the back window ) they watch in horror as the visitors abduct Ike ; Kyle spends the rest of the episode attempting to rescue him . 
 At school , Cartman begins farting fire , and Kyle unsuccessfully tries to convince his teacher , Mr. Garrison , to excuse him from class to find his brother . When Chef learns that Kyle 's brother was abducted and sees a machine emerge from Cartman 's anus , he helps the boys escape from school by pulling the fire alarm . Once outside , Cartman reiterates that his abduction was only a dream , when suddenly he 's hit by a beam , causing him to begin singing and dancing . Soon afterward , a spaceship appears . Kyle throws a stone and the spaceship fires back , propelling Kenny into the road . As he gets back up , he is trampled over by a herd of cows , but survives . Then , a police car runs him over , killing him . 
 Stan and Kyle meet Wendy at Stark 's Pond , where she suggests using the machine lodged inside Cartman to contact the visitors . To lure them back , the children tie Cartman to a tree and , the next time he farts , a massive satellite dish emerges from his anus . The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety . In the meantime , the visitors communicate with the cows in the area , having found them to be the most intelligent species on the planet . Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns to the bus stop the following day with pinkeye .

 The origins of South Park go back to 1992 when Trey Parker and Matt Stone , students at the University of Colorado , created a Christmas @-@ related animated short commonly known as " Jesus vs. Frosty " . The low @-@ budget , crudely made animation featured prototypes for the main characters of South Park . Fox Broadcasting Company executive Brian Graden saw the film and in 1995 commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short that he could send to his friends as a video Christmas card . Titled The Spirit of Christmas , also known as " Jesus vs. Santa " , the short more closely resembled the style of the later series . The video was popular and widely shared , both by duplication and over the Internet . After the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series , Parker and Stone developed a concept based on the town of South Park and the characters Stan , Kyle , Kenny , and Cartman . Later , Comedy Central expressed interest in the series , and Parker and Stone created a pilot episode for the network . 
 South Park was part of a reaction to the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States , in which issues such as Murphy Brown 's motherhood , <unk> Winky 's sexuality , and the Simpsons ' family values were extensively debated . The culture wars , and political correctness in particular , were driven by the belief that relativism was becoming more relevant to daily life and thus what were perceived as " traditional " and reliable values were losing their place in American society . South Park , one scholar explains , " made a name for itself as rude , crude , vulgar , offensive , and potentially dangerous " within this debate about values . Its critics argued that Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny were poor role models for children while its supporters celebrated the show 's defense of free speech . 
 = = Production = = 
 The pilot episode was written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker , and was directed by Parker ; it was made on a budget of $ 300 @,@ 000 . Similarly to Parker and Stone 's Christmas shorts , the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques . This laborious process involved creating hundreds of construction paper cutouts – including individual mouth shapes , and many of the characters in several different sizes – , and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera , to the dialog that had been recorded earlier . Assistants helped with the cutting and pasting of the cutouts , while the animation was primarily done by Parker , Stone , and South Park animation director Eric Stough . The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete , and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios , in Denver , Colorado , during the summer of 1996 . Additional animation techniques involved creating the starry night sky by putting holes into a black <unk> and illuminating it from behind , and having the pooling of Kenny 's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen , and drawing more to it with every frame . The characters who are not speaking rarely move , saving time in the animation process . 
 The finished pilot was 28 minutes long , which was too long to air , as Parker and Stone did not realize that more time should be allowed for television commercials during the half @-@ hour spot reserved for an episode on Comedy Central . In order to shorten the episode to 22 minutes , the creators cut out about ten minutes worth of material , and added back another three minutes , in order to tie up the changed storyline . For example , in the original pilot , Cartman farts fire because some older kids feed him hot tamales , while in the shortened version , he does so because of the alien probe implanted in him . Other scenes focused more heavily on the character Pip . The scene where he is introduced was later inserted into the fifth episode of the series , " An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig " , in its original , cutout animation form . The storyline additions were created with the use of computer animation , and all subsequent episodes of the series have been computer animated . While the creators ' aim was for the computer animation to visually simulate the cardboard cutout animation , the techniques were not perfected until later in the series , and as a result , the two styles of animation are easily distinguishable in the pilot . 
 The idea for the town of South Park came from the real Colorado basin of the same name where , according to the creators , a lot of folklore and news reports originated about " UFO sightings , and cattle mutilations , and Bigfoot sightings . " Parker and Stone 's original intentions were to have the alien presence feature more frequently in the plot of subsequent episodes , but eventually they decided against this , as they did not want the show to look like a parody of the popular science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . However , the crew started hiding aliens in the background in many South Park episodes as Easter eggs for fans , a tradition that goes back to Parker and Stone 's first major collaboration , the 1993 independent film Cannibal ! The Musical . 
 Regarding the language in the episode , Parker has said that they " felt the pressure to live up to Spirit of Christmas " , which contains a lot of obscenities , and as a result , they " tried to push things ... maybe further than we should " . In particular , Parker said that they felt the need " to put in dildo and every word we can get away with . " In contrast , they allowed subsequent episodes to " be more natural " , saying that those episodes are " more about bizarre happenings and making fun of things that are taboo " , " without just throwing a bunch of dirty words in there . " 
 " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " received poor results from test audiences and Comedy Central executives were uncertain whether to order additional episodes of the show . However , as the two original Christmas shorts , " Jesus vs. Frosty " and " Jesus vs. Santa " , continued to produce Internet buzz , the network paid Parker and Stone to write one more episode . In writing " Weight Gain 4000 " , the duo sought to give the network an idea of how each episode could differ from the others . The network liked the script and agreed to commit to a series when Parker and Stone said they would not write another individual episode until Comedy Central signed off on a season of at least six episodes .

 Describing the general tone of the show , Teri Fitsell of The New Zealand Herald explains that " South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality , and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them . " Often compared to The Simpsons and King of the Hill , South Park , according to Tom Lappin of Scotland on Sunday , " has a truly malevolent streak that sets it apart " from these shows ; he cites the repeated death of Kenny as an example . 
 The humor of the show comes from the " disparity " between the " cute " appearance of the characters and their " crude " behavior . However , Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show 's language is realistic . " There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet , and it 's just not real ... Don 't people remember what they were like in third grade ? We were little bastards . " Frederic Biddle of The Boston Globe notes how the show " constantly plays on its grade @-@ school aesthetic for shock value , with great success " , arguing that at its height , it is " more a profane ' Peanuts ' than a downsized ' Beavis and Butt @-@ Head . ' " He points , for example , to Kenny , who symbolically represents the voiceless underclass , which is eliminated in each episode . Claire Bickley of the Toronto Sun explains that " The show captures that mix of innocence and viciousness that can co @-@ exist in kids that age " , that " the boys are fascinated by bodily functions " , and that they " mimic adult behavior and language " . For example , Kyle instructs Stan and Wendy to " make sweet love down by the fire " , a phrase he learns from Chef . In a light @-@ hearted study of the humor of flatulence , Jim Dawson explains how the rise of adult animation in the 1990s allowed television to indulge in such humor with The Ren & Stimpy Show , The Simpsons , and Beavis and Butt @-@ Head . Beginning with " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " , South Park builds on this tradition . 
 The episode employs what literary theorist Mikhail <unk> calls the carnivalesque . As Ethan Thompson explains in his article , " Good Demo , Bad Taste : South Park as <unk> Satire " , the style consists of four crucial elements : humor , bodily excess , linguistic games that challenge official discourse , and the inversion of social structures . Cartman 's body — his obesity and his inability to control his farting — is supposed to exemplify the grotesque . The boys swear throughout the episode , using words and phrases such as " fat ass " and " dildo " , challenging the boundaries of appropriate language . Finally , the social structure of the town is inverted , as the episode focuses on the knowledge that the four boys have of the aliens as opposed to the ignorant and incompetent adults . Moreover , the aliens perceive the cows as more intelligent than the humans , inverting the species order . 
 South Park tends to employ large @-@ scale musical numbers in its episodes , often parodying 1930s cartoons . For example , Cartman sings part of " I Love to Singa " , from the cartoon of the same name , when he is struck by a beam from the alien ship . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 The episode was broadcast for the first time at 10 pm EDT in the United States on August 13 , 1997 on Comedy Central . South Park was originally broadcast during prime time after Seinfeld on Canada 's Global TV , with objectionable material cut from the show . The " dildo " jokes were removed from the pilot as well as two scenes in which Kyle kicks his baby brother , Ike . After complaints from viewers , the series was moved to midnight on October 17 , 1997 and the deleted material was restored . Almost a year after its original air date , the episode was broadcast for the first time in Britain ( outside of satellite television ) on July 10 , 1998 on Channel 4 . A station representative said " It 's for the audience coming back from the pub with a curry . " 
 " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " initially earned a Nielsen rating of 1 @.@ 3 , translating to 980 @,@ 000 viewers , which is considered high for a cable program in the United States . In April 2007 , The New Zealand Herald called the first episode " a huge success " ; however , reviews at the time of the episode 's broadcast were generally negative , most focusing on the low , obscene comedy . Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly thought poorly of the writing and characters , stating that " If only the kids ' jokes were as fresh as their mouths " and " It might help if the South Park kids had personalities , but they 're as one @-@ dimensional as the show 's cut @-@ and @-@ paste animation " . Tim Goodman of The San Francisco Examiner acknowledged that many viewers will find South Park " vile , rude , sick , potentially dangerous , childish and mean @-@ spirited " . He argued that viewers " have to come into ' South Park ' with a bent for irony , sarcasm , anger and an understanding that cardboard cut @-@ out animation of foul @-@ mouthed third @-@ graders is a tragically underused comic premise . " 
 Calling the series " sophomoric , gross , and unfunny " , Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel believed that this episode " makes such a bad impression that it 's hard to get on the show 's strange wavelength . " Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle considered the show " made by and for childish grown @-@ ups " and for " adults who enjoy kid shows " . Seeing the show as the inheritor of The Simpsons and Beavis and Butt @-@ Head , Ginia Bellafante of Time noted its failure to cohere and considered the show " devoid of subtext " . Caryn James of The New York Times commented that the series " succeeds best in small touches " but " seems to have a future " . In a generally negative review of the first three episodes of the series , Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote that " Most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self @-@ conscious and self @-@ congratulatory in its vulgarity : flatulence jokes , repeated use of the word ' dildo ' ( in the literal as well as pejorative sense ) and a general air of malicious unpleasantness . " In one of the few generally positive reviews , Eric Mink of the Daily News praised the South Park universe and the " distinct , interesting characters " within it . He singled out Cartman , calling him " the most vibrant of the bunch " , describing him as " a bitter old man living in an 8 @-@ year @-@ old 's body " .

 = Battle of Kellogg 's Grove = 
 The Battle of Kellogg 's Grove is either of two minor battles , or skirmishes , fought during the Black Hawk War in U.S. state of Illinois , in present @-@ day Stephenson County at and near Kellogg 's Grove . In the first skirmish , also known as the Battle of Burr Oak Grove , on June 16 , 1832 , Illinois militia forces fought against a band of at least 80 of Native Americans . During the battle three militia men under the command of Adam W. Snyder were killed in action . The second battle occurred nine days later when a larger Sauk and Fox band , under the command of Black Hawk , attacked Major John Dement 's detachment and killed five militia men . 
 The second battle is known for playing a role in Abraham Lincoln 's short career in the Illinois militia . He was part of a relief company sent to the grove on June 26 and he helped bury the dead . He made a statement about the incident years later which was recollected in Carl Sandburg 's writing , among others . Sources conflict about who actually won the battle ; it has been called a " rout " for both sides . The battle was the last on Illinois soil during the Black Hawk War . 
 = = Background = = 
 As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement , the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828 . However , Sauk Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty , claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted , nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands . Angered by the loss of his birthplace , from 1830 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River , but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed . In April 1832 , encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British , he again moved his so @-@ called " British Band " of around 1000 warriors and non @-@ combatants into Illinois . Finding no allies he attempted to return to Iowa , but events overtook him and led to the Battle of Stillman 's Run . A number of other engagements and massacres followed , and the militias of Michigan Territory and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk 's band . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In the days preceding the second Battle of Kellogg 's Grove a raid occurred on Bureau Creek , between the Rock and Illinois Rivers . Major John Dement 's battalion was ordered to the scene to protect settlers and ascertain the presence of Native Americans in the area , they were to report to Colonel Zachary Taylor at Dixon 's Ferry . On June 22 Dement reached Dixon 's Ferry where he reported to Taylor . Taylor then ordered him to cross the Rock River to take a position between Dixon 's Ferry and Galena . Additionally , Taylor ordered Dement to set up his headquarters at Kellogg 's Grove . With a command of 140 inexperienced men , Dement set out for the grove to replace a group of volunteers led by a Major Riley who had abandoned the fort on June 23 . The troops that abandoned the fort had skirmished with the Native Americans two or three times and were defeated in all clashes , according to the soldiers stationed there . Major Dement 's group crossed the Rock River on June 24 and reached the small fort at Kellogg 's Grove where they camped for the night . 
 The day before the second Battle of Kellogg 's Grove , June 24 , Black Hawk was leading his band in an attack on Apple River Fort . During the Battle of Apple River Fort the Sauk besieged the small stockade for much of the day . Other warriors were dispatched to gather food , horses and other supplies , all of which were badly needed by the band . The following day the group would reach Kellogg 's Grove where they would engage Dement 's militia forces .

 The first Battle of Kellogg 's Grove , or the Battle of Burr Oak Grove , occurred on June 16 , 1832 . Men from Captain Adam Wilson Snyder 's company engaged part of a group of about 80 Kickapoo warriors resulting in three militia deaths and six Kickapoo deaths . 
 On the night of June 15 , 1832 , Captain Snyder and his men were in Kellogg 's Grove when Native Americans were discovered in the area , during the night a horse was stolen . The next day , June 16 , Snyder and his men pursued the Native Americans to the southwest ; they came upon four natives and killed them . During the ensuing skirmish , Private William B. Mecomson was fatally wounded . The militia men put the wounded man on a litter and began to carry him back to the Kellogg cabin , along the way Mecomson asked that the group stop to rest . The group stopped and some of the men went for water while the rest waited with Mecomson . As they waited , a large group of Native Americans came upon them ; a short battle followed and two more militia members were killed . After the short skirmish , the natives left the area and the militia men returned to the Kellogg cabin and buried their dead the next day . 
 = = = Second Battle of Kellogg 's Grove = = = 
 The Second Battle of Kellogg 's Grove occurred on June 25 , 1832 , after Major John Dement and his men , while camped at Kellogg 's Grove on Sunday June 24 , learned of a large group of Native Americans nearby . The battle pitted a large band of Native American warriors led by Black Hawk and his <unk> Neapope and <unk> against Dement 's spy company of militia men . Dement 's company had been searching the area for bands of warriors sent out by Black Hawk and their trail had led to Kellogg 's Grove . 
 During the night , three of the militia 's horses wandered off ; the next day , June 25 , three men went in search of the animals while the rest stayed behind . At the cabin , seven Native American braves appeared in the distance . The troops immediately began pursuing the natives , who fled into the woods , instead of reporting the sighting to Dement . The Native American warriors , as had been done other times during the course of the war , set an ambush for the militia men in the forest . The militia pursued the natives into the woods and , as they entered the forest , the natives opened fire , the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another . The militia retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent . The rest of Dement 's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors . Black Hawk 's band attacked the militia men , again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn . 
 As the militia fell back , the three men who had set out in search of their horses returned and they too were killed by the Native American forces . The natives continued to assault the barn and cabin ; their attacks did not cease and during the battle about 25 horses were killed . Finally , the native forces withdrew , leaving nine of their own dead behind . The June 25 battle was the last of the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil . Dement 's company lost five men with another three were wounded , many horses were killed as well . 
 That night American reinforcements arrived under the command of General Alexander Posey , who chose not to pursue the attackers and instead reported the situation to Colonel Zachary Taylor . Black Hawk asserted later that had Posey chose to attack him and his warriors that the blow dealt Black Hawk 's band would have been decisive and war @-@ ending . In fact , Dement 's opinion was that there were more Native Americans at Kellogg 's Grove than at any other engagement during the war . The next day more reinforcements arrived when Captain Jacob Early 's detachment reached the grove . 
 = = Lincoln 's role = = 
 Abraham Lincoln 's service during the Black Hawk War has been a source of discrepancies and questioning , with two major battle sites being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat . A number of sources assert that on June 26 , 1832 , the morning after the second battle , members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg 's Grove to help bury the dead . One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln . Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the experience that has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg 's Grove and the fight at Stillman 's Run . 
 The Lincoln quote appeared both in William H. Herndon and Jesse W. Wiek 's Life of Lincoln and Carl Sandburg 's Lincoln biography , Abraham Lincoln The Prairie Years . Lincoln 's presence at Stillman 's Run was still under investigation as of 2003 , but his presence at Kellogg 's Grove has been corroborated by several sources . 
 Lincoln made a humorous remark during an 1848 speech before the U.S. Congress in which he referenced his Black Hawk War service , mentioning Stillman 's Run by name . 
 The marble facade at the monument , erected in 1901 , commemorating the battle in Stillman Valley , Illinois includes the reference to Lincoln 's , " The presence of soldier , statesman , martyr , Abraham Lincoln assisting in the burial of these honored dead has made this spot more sacred . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Sources vary concerning exactly which side was victorious during the battle . The Battle of Kellogg 's Grove , like many of the battles and skirmishes during the Black Hawk War , had no real order or strategy . Early sources indicated that the battle was a complete victory for the state militia , declaring the battle a rout and noting that the Sauk lost 15 while the militia only suffered 5 men killed . Conversely , according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources , the result , essentially , was that the band of approximately 50 Sauk warriors routed the 300 or so ill @-@ disciplined white troops . 
 The battle site at Kellogg 's Grove was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 23 , 1978 . The listing included a 1 ½ acre public park where a stone monument and memorial cemetery is located . The cemetery holds the interred remains of the militia who died during both battles at Kellogg 's Grove . The men were initially buried in other spots around the grove but during the 1880s local farmers banded together to collect the remains of the Black Hawk War dead and inter them in one spot beneath a memorial . 
 = Gough Whitlam = 
 Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC ( / <unk> <unk> / 11 July 1916 – 21 October 2014 ) was the 21st Prime Minister of Australia , serving from 1972 to 1975 . The Leader of the Labor Party from 1967 to 1977 , Whitlam led his party to power for the first time in 23 years at the 1972 election . He won the 1974 election before being controversially dismissed by the Governor @-@ General of Australia , Sir John Kerr , at the climax of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis . Whitlam remains the only Australian prime minister to have his commission terminated in that manner . 
 Whitlam served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II for four years as airforce navigator in the Pacific and worked as a barrister following the war . He was first elected to Parliament in 1952 , representing Werriwa in the House of Representatives . Whitlam became Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in 1960 , and in 1967 , after the retirement of Arthur Calwell , was elected Leader and became the Leader of the Opposition . After narrowly losing the 1969 election , Whitlam led Labor to victory at the 1972 election after 23 years of continuous Liberal @-@ Country Coalition Government . 
 The Whitlam Government implemented a large number of new programs and policy changes , including the termination of military conscription , institution of universal health care and free university education , and the implementation of legal aid programs . With the opposition @-@ controlled Senate delaying passage of bills , Whitlam called a double dissolution election in 1974 in which he won a majority in the House of Representatives , albeit a slightly reduced one , and picked up three Senate seats . The government and the opposition then had equal numbers in the Senate where they again voted against the six trigger bills which had formed the basis for the 1974 double dissolution . The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only 1974 joint sitting enabled under s . 57 of the Constitution as part of the double dissolution process . All six of the ' trigger ' bills were then passed at the Joint Sitting in August 1974 . 
 Despite the government 's second election victory , the opposition , reacting to government scandals and a flagging economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1973 – 75 recession , continued to obstruct the government 's program in the Senate . In late 1975 , the Opposition Senators refused to allow a vote on the government 's appropriation bills , returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election , thus denying the government supply . Whitlam refused to back down , arguing that his government , which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives , was being held to ransom by the Senate . The crisis ended on 11 November , when Gough Whitlam arrived at a pre @-@ arranged meeting with the Governor @-@ General , Sir John Kerr , at Government House in order to call a half @-@ Senate election . Kerr had agreed to the draft documents and the date for the half @-@ Senate election — 13 December — with Whitlam over the preceding days . Whitlam described it as ' the greatest shock I had ever experienced ' when Kerr instead dismissed him without warning and commissioned the opposition leader , Malcolm Fraser , as prime minister . Later that afternoon the House of Representatives passed a motion of no confidence in Fraser and called on the Governor @-@ General to reinstate the Whitlam government . Kerr refused to see the Speaker of the House or receive the motion of the House of Representatives and prorogued parliament with Fraser still in office . Labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide . 
 Whitlam stepped down after losing again at the 1977 election , and retired from parliament in 1978 . Upon the election of the Hawke Government in 1983 , he was appointed as Ambassador to UNESCO , a position he filled with distinction , and was elected a member of the UNESCO Executive Board . He remained active into his nineties . The circumstances of his dismissal and the legacy of his government remain a large part of Australian political discourse . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Edward Gough Whitlam was born on 11 July 1916 at the family home ' <unk> ' , 46 Rowland Street , Kew , a suburb of Melbourne . He was the older of two children ( he had a younger sister , Freda ) born to Martha ( née Maddocks ) and Fred Whitlam . His father was a federal public servant who later served as Commonwealth Crown Solicitor , and Whitlam senior 's involvement in human rights issues was a powerful influence on his son . Since the boy 's maternal grandfather was also named Edward , from early childhood he was called by his middle name , Gough , which in turn had come from his paternal grandfather , who had been named after the British soldier Field @-@ Marshal Hugh Gough , 1st Viscount Gough . 
 In 1918 , Fred Whitlam was promoted to deputy Crown solicitor and transferred to Sydney . The family lived first in the North Shore suburb of Mosman and then in Turramurra . At age six , Gough began his education at Chatswood Church of England Girls ' School ( early primary schooling at a girls ' school was not unusual for small boys at the time ) . After a year there , he attended Mowbray House School and Knox Grammar School , in the suburbs of Sydney . 
 Fred Whitlam was promoted again in 1927 , this time to Assistant Crown Solicitor . The position was located in the new national capital of Canberra , and the Whitlam family moved there . Gough Whitlam remains the only prime minister to have spent his formative years in Canberra . At the time , conditions remained primitive in what was dubbed " the bush capital " and " the land of the blowflies " . Gough attended the government Telopea Park School . In 1932 , Whitlam 's father transferred him to Canberra Grammar School where , at the Speech Day ceremony that year , he was awarded a prize by the Governor @-@ General , Sir Isaac Isaacs . 
 Whitlam enrolled at St Paul 's College at the University of Sydney at the age of 18 . He earned his first wages by appearing , with several other " <unk> " , in a cabaret scene in the film The Broken Melody — the students were chosen because St Paul 's requires formal wear at dinner , and they could therefore supply their own costumes . After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree with second @-@ class honours in classics , Whitlam remained at St Paul 's to begin his law studies . He had originally contemplated an academic career , but his lacklustre marks made that unlikely . Dropping out of Greek classes , he professed himself unable to care for the " dry as dust " lectures of Enoch Powell .

 Soon after the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , Whitlam enlisted in the Sydney University Regiment , part of the Militia . In late 1941 , following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , and with a year remaining in his legal studies , he volunteered for the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . In 1942 , while awaiting entry into the service , Whitlam met and married Margaret Elaine Dovey , who had swum for Australia in the 1938 British Empire Games and was the daughter of barrister and future New South Wales Supreme Court judge Bill Dovey . He entered the RAAF on 20 June 1942 . 
 Whitlam trained as a navigator and bomb aimer , before serving with No. 13 Squadron RAAF , based mainly on the Gove Peninsula , Northern Territory , flying Lockheed Ventura bombers . He reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant . While in the service , he began his political activities , distributing literature for the Australian Labor Party during the 1943 federal election and urging the passage of the " Fourteen Powers " referendum of 1944 , which would have expanded the powers of the federal government . Although the party was victorious , the referendum it advocated was defeated . In 1961 , Whitlam said of the referendum defeat , " My hopes were dashed by the outcome and from that moment I determined to do all I could do to modernise the Australian Constitution . " While still in uniform , Whitlam joined the ALP in Sydney in 1945 . He was discharged from the RAAF on 17 October 1945 , and continued to use Air Force log books to record all of the flights he took until 2007 . Whitlam completed his studies after the war , obtained his Bachelor of Laws , and was admitted to the federal and New South Wales bars in 1947 .

 With his war service loan , Whitlam built a house in seaside Cronulla . He also bought the block of land next door , using the prize money ( £ 1 @,@ 000 in security bonds ) he received for winning the Australian National Quiz Championship in 1948 and 1949 ( he was runner @-@ up in 1950 ) . He sought to make a career in the ALP there , but local Labor supporters were sceptical of Whitlam 's loyalties , given his privileged background . In the postwar years , he practised law , concentrating on landlord / tenant matters , and sought to build his bona fides in the party . He ran twice — unsuccessfully — for the local council , once ( also unsuccessfully ) for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly , and campaigned for other candidates . In 1951 , Bert Lazzarini , the Labor member for the Federal electorate of Werriwa , announced that he would stand down at the next election . Whitlam won the preselection as ALP candidate . Lazzarini died in 1952 before completing his term and Whitlam was elected to the House of Representatives in the ensuing by @-@ election on 29 November 1952 . Whitlam trebled Lazzarini 's majority in a 12 per cent swing to Labor . 
 Whitlam joined the ALP minority in the House . His maiden speech provoked an interruption by a future prime minister , John McEwen , who was then told by the Speaker that maiden speeches are traditionally heard in silence . Whitlam responded to McEwen by stating that Benjamin Disraeli had been heckled in his maiden speech and had responded , " The time will come when you shall hear me . " He told McEwen , " The time will come when you may interrupt me . " According to early Whitlam biographers Laurie Oakes and David Solomon , this cool response put the Coalition government on notice that the new Member for Werriwa would be a force to be reckoned with . 
 In the rough and tumble debate in the House of Representatives , Whitlam called fellow <unk> Bill Bourke " this <unk> Quisling " , Garfield Barwick ( who would , as High Court Chief Justice , play a role in Whitlam 's downfall ) a " bumptious bastard " , and stated that Bill Wentworth exhibited a " hereditary streak of insanity " . After calling future prime minister William McMahon a " <unk> " , he apologised . 
 The ALP had been out of office since the Chifley Government 's defeat in 1949 and , since 1951 , had been under the leadership of Bert Evatt , whom Whitlam greatly admired . In 1954 , the ALP seemed likely to return to power . The Prime Minister , Robert Menzies , adroitly used the defection of a Soviet official to his advantage , and his coalition of the Liberal and Country parties was returned in the 1954 election with a seven @-@ seat majority . After the election , Evatt attempted to purge the party of industrial groupers , who had long dissented from party policy , and who were predominantly Catholic and anti @-@ communist . The ensuing division in the ALP , which came to be known as " The Split " , sparked the birth of the Democratic Labor Party ( DLP ) . It was a conflict that helped to keep Labor out of power for a generation , since DLP supporters chose the Liberal Party in preferential voting . Whitlam supported Evatt throughout this period . 
 In 1955 , a redistribution divided Whitlam 's electorate of Werriwa in two , with his Cronulla home located in the new electorate of Hughes . Although Whitlam would have received ALP support in either division , he chose to continue standing for Werriwa and moved from Cronulla to Cabramatta . This meant even longer journeys for his older children to attend school , since neither electorate had a high school at the time , and they attended school in Sydney . 
 Whitlam was appointed to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1956 . Biographer Jenny Hocking calls his service on the committee , which included members from all parties in both chambers of Parliament , one of the " great influences in his political development " . According to Hocking , service on the committee caused Whitlam to focus not on internal conflicts consuming the ALP , but on Labor goals which were possible and worthwhile in the constitutional framework . Many Labor goals , such as nationalisation , ran contrary to the Constitution . Whitlam came to believe that the Constitution — and especially Section 96 ( which allowed the federal government to make grants to the states ) — could be used to advance a worthwhile Labor programme . 
 = = = Deputy Leader ( 1960 – 67 ) = = = 
 By the late 1950s Whitlam was seen as a leadership contender once the existing Labor leaders exited the scene . Most of the party 's major figures , including Evatt , Deputy Leader Arthur Calwell , Eddie Ward , and Reg Pollard , were in their sixties , twenty years older than Whitlam . In 1960 , after losing three elections , Evatt resigned and was replaced by Calwell , with Whitlam defeating Ward for deputy leader . Calwell came within a handful of votes of winning the cliffhanger 1961 election . He had not wanted Whitlam as deputy leader , and believed Labor would have won if Ward had been in the position . 
 Soon after the 1961 election , events began to turn against Labor . When President Sukarno of Indonesia announced that he intended to take over West New Guinea as the colonial Dutch departed , Calwell responded by declaring that Indonesia must be stopped by force . Calwell 's statement was called " crazy and irresponsible " by Prime Minister Menzies , and the incident reduced public support for the ALP . At that time , the Federal Conference of the Labor Party , which dictated policy to parliamentary members , consisted of six members from each state , but not Calwell or Whitlam . In early 1963 a special conference met in a Canberra hotel to determine Labor policy regarding a proposed US base in northern Australia ; Calwell and Whitlam were photographed by The Daily Telegraph peering in through the doors , waiting for the verdict . In an accompanying story , Alan Reid of the Telegraph wrote that Labor was ruled by " 36 faceless men " . The Liberals seized on it , issuing a leaflet called " Mr Calwell and the Faceless Men " which accused Calwell and Whitlam of taking direction from " 36 unknown men , not elected to Parliament nor responsible to the people . " 
 Menzies manipulated the Opposition on issues that bitterly divided it , such as direct aid to the states for private schools , and the proposed base . He called an early election for November 1963 , standing in support of those two issues . The Prime Minister performed better than Calwell on television and received an unexpected boost after the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy . As a result , the Coalition easily defeated Labor on a 10 @-@ seat swing . Whitlam had hoped Calwell would step down after 1963 , but he remained , reasoning that Evatt had been given three opportunities to win , and that he should be allowed a third try . Calwell dismissed proposals that the ALP leader and deputy leader should be entitled to membership of the party 's conference ( or on its governing 12 @-@ person Federal Executive , which had two representatives from each state ) , and instead ran successfully for one of the conference 's Victoria seats . Labor did badly in a 1964 by @-@ election in the Tasmanian electorate of Denison , and lost seats in the 1964 half @-@ Senate election . The party was also defeated in the state elections in the most populous state , New South Wales , surrendering control of the state government for the first time since 1941 . 
 Whitlam 's relationship with Calwell , never good , deteriorated further after publication of a 1965 article in The Australian . The article reported off @-@ the @-@ record comments Whitlam had made that his leader was " too old and weak " to win office , and that the party might be gravely damaged by an " old @-@ fashioned " 70 @-@ year @-@ old Calwell seeking his first term as prime minister . Later that year , at Whitlam 's urging , and over Calwell 's objection , the biennial party conference made major changes to the party 's platform : deleting support for the White Australia policy and making the ALP 's leader and deputy leader ex officio members of the conference and executive , along with the party 's leader and deputy leader in the Senate . As Whitlam considered the Senate unrepresentative , he opposed the admission of its ALP leaders to the party 's governing bodies . 
 Menzies retired in January 1966 , and was succeeded as prime minister by the new Liberal Party leader , Harold Holt . After years of politics being dominated by the elderly Menzies and Calwell , the younger Holt was seen as a breath of fresh air , and attracted public interest and support in the run @-@ up to the November election . 
 In early 1966 , the 36 @-@ member conference , with Calwell 's assent , banned any ALP parliamentarian from supporting federal assistance to the states for spending on both government and private schools , commonly called " state aid " . Whitlam broke with the party on the issue , and was charged with gross disloyalty by the executive , an offence which carried the penalty of expulsion from the party . Before the matter could be heard , Whitlam left for Queensland , where he campaigned intensively for the ALP candidate in the Dawson by @-@ election . The ALP won , dealing the government its first by @-@ election defeat since 1952 . Whitlam survived the expulsion vote by a margin of only two , gaining both Queensland votes . At the end of April , Whitlam challenged Calwell for the leadership ; though Calwell received two @-@ thirds of the vote , he announced that if the party lost the upcoming election , he would not stand again for the leadership . 
 Holt called an election for November 1966 , in which Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War was a major issue . Calwell called for an " immediate and unconditional withdrawal " of Australian troops from Vietnam . Whitlam , however , said that this would deprive Australia of any voice in a settlement , and that regular troops , rather than conscripts , should remain under some circumstances . Calwell considered Whitlam 's remark disastrous , disputing the party line just five days before the election . The ALP suffered a crushing defeat ; the party was reduced to 41 seats in the House of Representatives . Shortly after the election , Whitlam faced another expulsion vote for his stance on Vietnam , and survived . True to his word , Calwell resigned two months after the election . At the caucus meeting on 8 February 1967 , Whitlam was elected party leader , defeating leading left @-@ wing candidate Dr Jim Cairns .

 Gough Whitlam saw that the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the traditional working @-@ class base to include the suburban middle class . He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party , and hoped that even rank @-@ and @-@ file party members could be given a voice in the conference . In 1968 , controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian <unk> , a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right @-@ wing extremist . Whitlam resigned the leadership , demanding a vote of confidence from caucus . He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38 – 32 vote . Despite the vote , the executive refused to seat <unk> . 
 With the ALP 's governing bodies unwilling to reform themselves , Whitlam worked to build support for change among ordinary party members . He was successful in reducing union influence in the party , though he was never able to give the rank and file a direct vote in selecting the executive . The Victoria branch of the party had long been a problem ; its executive was far to the left of the rest of the ALP , and had little electoral success . Whitlam was able to reconstruct the Victoria party organisation against the will of its leaders , and the reconstituted state party proved essential to victory in the 1972 election . 
 By the time of the 1969 party conference , Whitlam had gained considerable control over the ALP . That conference passed 61 resolutions , including broad changes to party policy and procedures . It called for the establishment of an Australian Schools Commission to consider the proper level of state aid for schools and universities , recognition of Aboriginal land claims , and expanded party policy on universal health care . The conference also called for increased federal involvement in urban planning , and would form the basis of " The Program " of modern socialism which Whitlam and the ALP would present to the voters in 1972 . 
 Since 1918 , Labor had called for the abolition of the existing Australian Constitution , with the vesting of all political power in Parliament , a plan which would turn the states into powerless geographic regions . Beginning in 1965 , Whitlam had sought to change this goal . He finally succeeded at the 1971 ALP Conference in Launceston , Tasmania , which called for Parliament to receive " such plenary powers as are necessary and desirable " to achieve the ALP 's goals in domestic and international affairs . Labor also pledged to abolish the Senate ; this goal would not be erased from the party platform until 1979 , after Whitlam had stepped down as leader . 
 = = = Leader of the Opposition = = = 
 Soon after taking the leadership , Whitlam reorganised the ALP caucus , assigning portfolios and turning the Labor frontbench into a shadow cabinet . While the Liberal @-@ Country Coalition had a huge majority in the House of Representatives , Whitlam energised the party by campaigning intensively to win two by @-@ elections in 1967 : first in Corio in Victoria , and later that year in <unk> ( Queensland ) . The November half @-@ Senate election saw a moderate swing to Labor and against the Coalition , compared with the general election the previous year . These federal victories , in which both Whitlam and Holt campaigned , helped give Whitlam the leverage he needed to carry out party reforms . 
 At the end of 1967 , Holt vanished while swimming in rough seas near Melbourne ; his body was never recovered . McEwen , as leader of the junior Coalition partner , the Country Party , took over as prime minister for three weeks until the Liberals could elect a new leader . Senator John Gorton won the vote and became prime minister . The leadership campaign was conducted mostly by television , and Gorton appeared to have the visual appeal needed to keep Whitlam out of office . Gorton resigned his seat in the Senate , and in February 1968 won the by @-@ election for Holt 's seat of Higgins in Victoria . For the remainder of the year , Gorton appeared to have the better of Whitlam in the House of Representatives . In his chronicle of the Whitlam years , however , speechwriter Graham Freudenberg asserts that Gorton 's erratic behaviour , Whitlam 's strengthening of his party , and events outside Australia ( such as the Vietnam War ) ate away at Liberal dominance . 
 Gorton called an election for October 1969 . Whitlam and the ALP , with little internal dissension , stood on a platform calling for domestic reform , an end to conscription , and the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam by 1 July 1970 . Whitlam knew that , given the ALP 's poor position after the 1966 election , victory was unlikely . Nevertheless , Whitlam scored an 18 @-@ seat swing , Labor 's best performance since losing government in 1949 . Although the Coalition was returned for an eighth term in government , it was with a slim majority of seven seats , down from 41 after the writs were dropped . Labor actually won a bare majority of the two @-@ party vote ; only DLP preferences in four Melbourne @-@ area seats kept Whitlam from becoming prime minister . The 1970 half @-@ Senate election brought little change to Coalition control , but the Liberal vote fell for the first time below 40 per cent , representing a severe threat to Gorton 's leadership . 
 In March 1971 , the resentment against Gorton came to a head when a confidence vote in the Liberal caucus resulted in a tie . Declaring that this was a sign he no longer had the confidence of the party , Gorton resigned , and William McMahon was elected his successor . With the Liberals in turmoil , Whitlam and the ALP sought to gain public trust as a credible government @-@ in @-@ waiting . The party 's actions , such as its abandonment of the White Australia policy , gained favourable media attention . The Labor leader flew to Papua New Guinea and pledged himself to the independence of what was then an Australian possession . In 1971 , Whitlam flew to Beijing and met with Chinese officials , including Zhou Enlai . McMahon attacked Whitlam for the visit and claimed that the Chinese had manipulated him . This attack backfired when US President Richard Nixon announced that he would visit China the following year . His National Security Advisor , Henry Kissinger , visited Beijing between 9 – 11 July ( less than a week after Whitlam 's visit of 4 – 6 July ) , and ( unknown to Whitlam ) some of Kissinger 's staff had actually been in Beijing preparing for Kissinger 's visit at the same time as the Labor delegation . According to Whitlam biographer Jenny Hocking , the incident transformed Whitlam into an international statesman , while McMahon was seen as reacting defensively to Whitlam 's foreign policy ventures . Other errors by McMahon , such as a confused ad @-@ lib speech while visiting Washington , and a statement to Indonesia 's President Suharto that Australia was a " west European nation " , also damaged the government . 
 By early 1972 , Labor had established a clear lead in the polls ; indeed , for the first time since 1955 its support was greater than the combined vote for the Coalition and DLP . Unemployment was at a ten @-@ year peak , rising to 2 @.@ 14 percent in August ( though the unemployment rate was calculated differently compared to the present , and did not include thousands of rural workers on Commonwealth @-@ financed relief work ) . Inflation was also at its highest rate since the early 1950s . The government recovered slightly in the August Budget session of Parliament , proposing income tax cuts and increased spending . The Labor strategy for the run @-@ up to the election was to sit back and allow the Coalition to make mistakes . Whitlam controversially stated in March that " draft @-@ dodging is not a crime " and that he would be open to a revaluation of the Australian dollar . With the Coalition sinking in the polls and his own personal approval ratings down as low as 28 percent , McMahon waited as long as he could , finally calling an election for the House of Representatives for 2 December . Whitlam noted that the polling day was the anniversary of the Battle of Austerlitz – at which another " ramshackle , reactionary coalition " had been given a " crushing defeat " . 
 Labor campaigned under the slogan " It 's Time " , an echo of Menzies ' successful 1949 slogan , " It 's Time for a Change " . Surveys showed that even Liberal voters approved of the Labor slogan . Whitlam pledged an end to conscription and the release of individuals who had refused the draft ; an income tax surcharge to pay for universal health insurance ; free dental care for students ; and renovation of aging urban infrastructure . The party pledged to eliminate university tuition fees and establish a schools commission to evaluate educational needs . The party benefited from the support of the proprietor of News Limited , Rupert Murdoch , who preferred Whitlam over McMahon . Labor was so dominant in the campaign that some of Whitlam 's advisers urged him to stop joking about McMahon ; people were feeling sorry for him . The election saw the ALP increase its tally by 12 seats , mostly in suburban Sydney and Melbourne , for a majority of nine in the House of Representatives . The ALP gained little beyond the suburban belts , however , losing a seat in South Australia and two in Western Australia .

 Whitlam took office with a majority in the House of Representatives , but without control of the Senate ( elected in the 1967 and 1970 half @-@ elections ) . The Senate at that time consisted of ten members from each of the six states , elected by proportional representation . The ALP parliamentary caucus chose the ministers , but Whitlam was allowed to assign portfolios . A caucus meeting could not be held until after the final results came in on 15 December . In the meantime , McMahon would remain caretaker prime minister . Whitlam , however , was unwilling to wait that long . On 5 December , once Labor 's win was secure , Whitlam had the Governor @-@ General , Sir Paul Hasluck , swear him in as prime minister and Labor 's deputy leader , Lance Barnard , as deputy prime minister . The two men held 27 portfolios during the two weeks before a full cabinet could be determined . 
 During the two weeks the so @-@ called " duumvirate " held office , Whitlam sought to fulfill those campaign promises that did not require legislation . Whitlam ordered negotiations to establish full relations with the People 's Republic of China , and broke those with Taiwan . Legislation allowed the defence minister to grant exemptions from conscription . Barnard held this office , and exempted everyone . Seven men were at that time incarcerated for refusing conscription ; Whitlam arranged for their liberation . The Whitlam government in its first days reopened the equal pay case pending before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission , and appointed a woman , Elizabeth Evatt , to the commission . Whitlam and Barnard eliminated sales tax on contraceptive pills , announced major grants for the arts , and appointed an interim schools commission . The duumvirate barred racially discriminatory sports teams from Australia , and instructed the Australian delegation at the United Nations to vote in favour of sanctions on apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia . It also ordered the Australian Army Training Team home from Vietnam , ending Australia 's involvement in the war ; most troops ( including all conscripts ) had been withdrawn by McMahon . 
 According to Whitlam speechwriter Graham Freudenberg , the duumvirate was a success , as it showed that the Labor government could manipulate the machinery of government , despite its long absence from office . However , Freudenberg noted that the rapid pace and public excitement caused by the duumvirate 's actions caused the Opposition to be wary of giving Labor too easy a time , and gave rise to one post @-@ mortem assessment of the Whitlam government : " We did too much too soon . " 
 = = = Enacting a program = = = 
 The McMahon government had consisted of 27 ministers , twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet . In the run @-@ up to the election , the Labor caucus had decided that should the party take power , all 27 ministers were to be Cabinet members . Intense canvassing took place amongst ALP parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work , and on 18 December the caucus elected the Cabinet . The results were generally acceptable to Whitlam , and within three hours , he had announced the portfolios of the Cabinet members . To give himself greater control over the Cabinet , in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees ( with the members appointed by himself , not the caucus ) and took full control of the Cabinet agenda . 
 Gough Whitlam , prime minister for fewer than three years between 1972 and 1975 , pushed through a raft of reforms that radically changed Australia 's economic , legal and cultural landscape . 
 The Whitlam government abolished the death penalty for federal crimes . Legal aid was established , with offices in each state capital . It abolished university fees , and established the Schools Commission to allocate funds to schools . Whitlam founded the Department of Urban Development and , having lived in developing Cabramatta , most of which lacked sewage facilities , set a goal to leave no urban home <unk> . The Whitlam government gave grants directly to local government units for urban renewal , flood prevention , and the promotion of tourism . Other federal grants financed highways linking the state capitals , and paid for standard @-@ gauge rail lines between the states . The government attempted to set up a new city at Albury – Wodonga on the Victoria – New South Wales border . " Advance Australia Fair " became the country 's national anthem in place of " God Save the Queen " . The Order of Australia replaced the British honours system in early 1975 . 
 In 1973 , the National Gallery of Australia , then called the Australian National Gallery , bought the painting " Blue Poles " by contemporary artist Jackson Pollock for US $ 2 million ( A $ 1 @.@ 3 million at the time of payment ) – about a third of its annual budget . This required Whitlam 's personal permission , which he gave on the condition the price was publicized . The purchase created a political and media scandal , and was said to symbolise , alternatively , Whitlam 's foresight and vision or his profligate spending . 
 Whitlam travelled extensively as prime minister , and was the first Australian prime minister to visit China while in office . He was criticised for making this visit , especially after Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin ; he interrupted an extensive tour of Europe for 48 hours ( deemed too brief a period by many ) to view the devastation . 
 = = = Early troubles = = = 
 In February 1973 , the Attorney General , Senator Lionel Murphy , led a police raid on the Melbourne office of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation , which was under his ministerial responsibility . Murphy believed that ASIO might have files relating to threats against Yugoslav Prime Minister <unk> <unk> , who was about to visit Australia , and feared ASIO might conceal or destroy them . The Opposition attacked the Government over the raid , terming Murphy a " loose cannon " . A Senate investigation of the incident was cut short when Parliament was dissolved in 1974 . According to journalist and author Wallace Brown , the controversy over the raid continued to dog the Whitlam government throughout its term , because the incident was " so silly " . 
 From the start of the Whitlam government , the Opposition , led by Billy Snedden ( who replaced McMahon as Liberal leader in December 1972 ) sought to use control of the Senate to baulk Whitlam . It did not seek to block all government legislation ; the Coalition senators , led by Senate Liberal leader Reg Withers , sought to block government legislation only when the obstruction would advance the Opposition 's agenda . The Whitlam government also had troubles in relations with the states . New South Wales refused the government 's request that it close the Rhodesian Information Centre in Sydney . The Queensland premier , Joh Bjelke @-@ Petersen refused to consider any adjustment in Queensland 's border with Papua New Guinea , which , due to the state 's ownership of islands in the Torres Strait , came within half a kilometre ( about one @-@ third of a mile ) of the Papuan mainland . Liberal state governments in New South Wales and Victoria were re @-@ elected by large margins in 1973 . Whitlam and his majority in the House of Representatives proposed a constitutional referendum in December 1973 , transferring control of wages and prices from the states to the federal government . The two propositions failed to attract a majority of voters in any state , and were rejected by over 800 @,@ 000 votes nationwide . 
 By early 1974 , the Senate had rejected nineteen government bills , ten of them twice . With a half @-@ Senate election due by mid @-@ year , Whitlam looked for ways to shore up support in that body . Queensland senator and former DLP leader Vince Gair signalled his willingness to leave the Senate for a diplomatic post . With five Queensland seats at stake in the half @-@ Senate election , the ALP would probably win only two , but if six were at stake , the party would most likely win three . Possible control of the Senate was therefore at stake ; Whitlam agreed to Gair 's request and had Governor @-@ General Sir Paul Hasluck appoint him ambassador to Ireland . Word leaked of Gair 's pending resignation , and Whitlam 's opponents attempted to counteract his manoeuvre . On what became known as the " Night of the Long <unk> " , Country Party members secreted Gair at a small party in a legislative office as the ALP searched for him to secure his written resignation . As Gair enjoyed beer and prawns , Bjelke @-@ Petersen advised the Queensland governor , Sir Colin Hannah , to issue writs for only the usual five vacancies , since Gair 's seat was not yet vacant , effectively countering Whitlam 's plan . 
 The Senate had refused to pass six bills after their twice being passed by the House of Representatives . With the Opposition threatening to disrupt money supply to government , Whitlam used the Senate 's recalcitrance to trigger a double dissolution election , holding it instead of the half @-@ Senate election . After a campaign featuring the Labor slogan " Give Gough a fair go " , the Whitlam government was returned , with its majority in the House of Representatives cut from seven to five and increasing its Senate seats by three . It was only the second time since Federation that a Labor government had been elected to a second full term . The government and the opposition each had 29 Senators with two seats held by independents . The deadlock over the twice @-@ rejected bills was broken , uniquely in Australian history , with a special joint sitting of the two houses of Parliament under Section 57 of the Constitution . This session , authorised by the new governor @-@ general , Sir John Kerr , passed bills providing for universal health insurance ( known then as Medibank , today as Medicare ) and providing the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory with representation in the Senate , effective at the next election .

 By mid @-@ 1974 , Australia was in an economic slump , suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973 – 75 recession . The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and , according to government figures , inflation topped 13 percent for over a year between 1973 and 1974 . Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam 's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector . The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25 percent in 1973 ; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30 percent and a $ 1 @.@ 5 billion increase in the trade deficit . Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short @-@ term rates rose to extremely high levels . Unemployment also rose significantly . Unease within the ALP led to Barnard 's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership . Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy , who had formed the other half of the duumvirate . 
 Despite these economic indicators , the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending , especially in education . Treasury officials had advised a series of tax and fee increases , ranging from excise taxes to the cost of posting a letter ; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet . The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment , and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November . He also announced additional spending to help the private sector . 
 Beginning in October 1974 , the Whitlam government sought overseas loans to finance its development plans , with the newly enriched oil nations a likely target . Whitlam attempted to secure financing before informing the Loan Council ( which included state officials hostile to Whitlam ) , and his government empowered Pakistani financier <unk> Khemlani as an intermediary in the hope of securing US $ 4 billion in loans . While the Loans Affair never resulted in an actual loan , according to author and Whitlam speechwriter Graham Freudenberg , " The only cost involved was the cost to the reputation of the Government . That cost was to be immense — it was government itself . " 
 Whitlam appointed Senator Murphy to the High Court , even though Murphy 's Senate seat would not be up for election if a half @-@ Senate election were held . Labor then held three of the five short @-@ term New South Wales Senate seats . Under proportional representation , Labor could hold its three short @-@ term seats in the next half @-@ Senate election but , if Murphy 's seat were also contested , Labor was unlikely to win four out of six . Thus , a Murphy appointment meant the almost certain loss of a seat in the closely divided Senate at the next election . Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway . By convention , senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator . The New South Wales premier , Tom Lewis felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill @-@ health , and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton , former mayor of Albury and an independent . By March 1975 , many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as leader of the Opposition , and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives . Malcolm Fraser challenged Snedden for the leadership , and defeated him on 21 March . 
 Soon after Fraser 's accession , controversy arose over the Whitlam government 's actions in trying to restart peace talks in Vietnam . As the North prepared to end the civil war , Whitlam sent cables to both Vietnamese governments , telling Parliament that both cables were substantially the same . The Opposition contended he had misled Parliament , and a motion to censure Whitlam was defeated along party lines . The Opposition also attacked Whitlam for not allowing enough South Vietnamese refugees into Australia , with Fraser calling for the entry of 50 @,@ 000 . Freudenberg alleges that 1 @,@ 026 Vietnamese refugees entered Australia in the final eight months of the Whitlam government , and only 399 in 1976 under Fraser . However , by 1977 , Australia had accepted over five thousand refugees . 
 As the political situation deteriorated , Whitlam and his government continued to enact legislation : The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no @-@ fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt , but which had never been ratified . In August 1975 , Whitlam gave the <unk> people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands , beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform . The next month , Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea . 
 Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution , Portugal began a process of decolonisation and began a withdrawal from Portuguese Timor ( later East Timor ) . Australians had long taken an interest in the colony ; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II , and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas . In September 1974 , Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor . At the height of the Cold War , and in the context of the American retreat from Indo @-@ China , he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region , and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement , which many feared was communist , coming to power . 
 Whitlam had offered Barnard a diplomatic post ; in early 1975 Barnard agreed to this , triggering a by @-@ election in his Tasmanian electorate of Bass . The election on 28 June proved a disaster for Labor , which lost the seat with a swing against it of 17 percent . The next week , Whitlam fired Barnard 's successor as deputy prime minister , Cairns , who had misled Parliament regarding the Loans Affair amid controversy about his relationship with his office manager , Junie Morosi . At the time of Cairns 's dismissal , one Senate seat was vacant , following the death on 30 June of Queensland ALP Senator Bertie Milliner . The state Labor party nominated Mal Colston , resulting in a deadlock . The unicameral Queensland legislature twice voted against Colston , and the party refused to submit any alternative candidates . Bjelke @-@ Petersen finally convinced the legislature to elect a low @-@ level union official , Albert Field , who had contacted his office and expressed a willingness to serve . In interviews , Field made it clear he would not support Whitlam . Field was expelled from the ALP for standing against Colston , and Labor senators boycotted his swearing @-@ in . Whitlam argued that , because of the manner of filling vacancies , the Senate was " corrupted " and " tainted " , with the Opposition enjoying a majority they did not win at the ballot box . 
 = = Dismissal = = 
 In October 1975 , the Opposition , led by Malcolm Fraser , determined to withhold supply by deferring consideration of appropriation bills . With Field on leave ( his Senate appointment having been challenged ) , the Coalition had an effective majority of 30 – 29 in the Senate . The Coalition believed that if Whitlam could not deliver supply , and would not advise new elections , Kerr would have to dismiss him . Supply would run out on 30 November . 
 The stakes were raised in the conflict on 10 October , when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each . In a half @-@ Senate election , most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976 , but the territories ' senators , and those filling Field 's and Bunton 's seats , would assume their seats at once . This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate , at least until 1 July 1976 . 
 On 14 October , Labor minister Rex Connor , mastermind of the loans scheme , was forced to resign when Khemlani released documents showing that Connor had made misleading statements . The continuing scandal bolstered the Coalition in their stance that they would not concede supply . Whitlam on the other hand , convinced that he would win the battle , was glad of the distraction from the Loans Affair , and believed that he would " smash " not only the Senate , but Fraser 's leadership as well . 
 Whitlam told the House of Representatives on 21 October , 
 Let me place my government 's position clearly on the record . I shall not advise the Governor @-@ General to hold an election for the House of Representatives on behalf of the Senate . I shall tender no advice for an election of either House or both Houses until this constitutional issue is settled . This government , so long as it retains a majority in the House of Representatives , will continue the course endorsed by the Australian people last year . 
 Whitlam and his ministers repeatedly claimed that the Opposition was damaging not only the constitution , but the economy as well . The Coalition senators remained united , though several became increasingly concerned about the tactic of blocking supply . As the crisis dragged into November , Whitlam attempted to make arrangements for public servants and suppliers to be able to cash cheques at banks . These transactions would be temporary loans which the government would repay once supply was restored . This plan to prolong government without supply was presented to Kerr unsigned on 6 November , under the title " Draft Joint Opinion " ( ostensibly of solicitor @-@ general Maurice Byers and attorney @-@ general Kep Enderby ) . It proposed that public employees , including members of the armed forces and police , " could assign arrears of pay by way of mortgage " . The government 's refusal to formalise this and other " advice " was a factor justifying the Governor @-@ General 's fateful resort to alternative legal advice . 
 Governor @-@ General Kerr was following the crisis closely . At a luncheon with Whitlam and several of his ministers on 30 October , Kerr suggested a compromise : if Fraser conceded supply , Whitlam would agree not to call the half @-@ Senate election until May or June 1976 , or alternatively would agree not to call the Senate into session until after 1 July . Whitlam rejected the idea , seeking to end the Senate 's right to deny supply . On 3 November , after a meeting with Kerr , Fraser proposed that if the government agreed to hold a House of Representatives election at the same time as the half @-@ Senate election , the Coalition would concede supply . Whitlam rejected this offer , stating that he had no intention of advising a House election for at least a year . 
 With the crisis unresolved , Kerr decided to dismiss Whitlam as prime minister . Fearing that Whitlam would go to the Queen and potentially have him removed , the Governor @-@ General gave Whitlam no prior hint . He conferred ( against Whitlam 's advice ) with High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick , who agreed that he had the power to dismiss Whitlam . 
 A meeting among the party leaders , including Whitlam and Fraser , to resolve the crisis on the morning of 11 November came to nothing . Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor @-@ General 's office that afternoon at 1 @.@ 00 pm . Unknown to Whitlam , Fraser was waiting in an ante @-@ room ; Whitlam later stated that he would not have set foot in the building if he had known Fraser was there . Whitlam , as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day , came prepared to advise a half @-@ Senate election , to be held on 13 December . Kerr instead told Whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister , and handed him a letter to that effect . After the conversation , Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister 's residence , The Lodge , had lunch and conferred with his advisers . Immediately after his meeting with Whitlam , Kerr commissioned Fraser as ' caretaker ' Prime Minister , on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election . 
 In the confusion , Whitlam and his advisers did not immediately tell any Senate members of the dismissal , with the result that when the Senate convened at 2 @.@ 00 pm , the appropriation bills were rapidly passed , with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in . The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent . At 2 @.@ 34 pm , ten minutes after supply had been secured , Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister . Whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against the new prime minister in the House , which instructed the Speaker , Gordon Scholes , to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam . 
 Kerr refused to receive Scholes , keeping him waiting for more than an hour while he prorogued Parliament by proclamation : his Official Secretary , David Smith , came to Parliament House to proclaim the dissolution from the front steps . A large , angry crowd had gathered , and Smith was nearly drowned out by their noise . He concluded with the traditional " God save the Queen " . The dismissed prime minister , Whitlam , who had been standing behind Smith , then addressed the crowd : 
 Well may we say " God save the Queen " , because nothing will save the Governor @-@ General ! The Proclamation which you have just heard read by the Governor @-@ General 's Official Secretary was countersigned Malcolm Fraser , who will undoubtedly go down in Australian history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr 's cur . They won 't silence the outskirts of Parliament House , even if the inside has been silenced for a few weeks . ... Maintain your rage and enthusiasm for the campaign for the election now to be held and until polling day . 
 = = Return to Opposition , 1975 – 78 = = 
 As the ALP began the 1975 campaign , it seemed that its supporters would maintain their rage . Early rallies drew huge crowds , with attendees handing Whitlam money to pay election expenses . The crowds greatly exceeded those in any of Whitlam 's earlier campaigns ; in Sydney , 30 @,@ 000 partisans gathered for an ALP rally in The Domain below a banner : " Shame Fraser Shame " . Fraser 's appearances drew protests , and a letter bomb sent to Kerr was defused by authorities . Instead of making a policy speech to keynote his campaign , Whitlam made a speech attacking his opponents and calling 11 November " a day which will live in infamy " . 
 Polls from the first week of campaigning showed a nine @-@ point swing against Labor , which would have decimated Labor if repeated in an election . Whitlam 's campaign team disbelieved the results at first , but additional polling returns were clear : the electorate had turned against Labor . The Coalition attacked Labor for economic conditions , and released television commercials including " The Three Dark Years " showing images from Whitlam government scandals . The ALP campaign , which had concentrated on the issue of Whitlam 's dismissal , did not address the economy until its final days . By that time Fraser , confident of victory , was content to sit back , avoid specifics and make no mistakes . On election night , 13 December , the Coalition won the largest majority government in Australian history , winning 91 seats to Labor 's 36 . Labor suffered a 6 @.@ 5 percent swing against it and its caucus was cut almost in half , suffering a 30 @-@ seat swing . Labor was left with five fewer seats than it had when Whitlam took the leadership . The Coalition also won a 37 – 25 majority in the Senate . 
 Whitlam stayed on as Opposition leader , surviving a leadership challenge . In early 1976 , an additional controversy broke when it was reported that Whitlam had been involved in ALP attempts to raise $ 500 @,@ 000 during the election from the Ahmed Hassan al @-@ Bakr government of Iraq . " Luckily , for Whitlam and Labor , the deal , ultimately , went pear @-@ shaped . " No money had actually been paid , and no charges were filed . The Whitlams were visiting China at the time of the Tangshan earthquake in July 1976 , though they were staying in Tianjin , 90 miles ( 140 km ) away from the epicentre . The Age printed a cartoon by Peter Nicholson showing the Whitlams huddled together in bed with Margaret Whitlam saying , " Did the earth move for you too , dear ? " This cartoon prompted a page full of outraged letters from Labor partisans and a telegram from Gough Whitlam , safe in Tokyo , requesting the original of the cartoon . 
 In early 1977 Whitlam faced a leadership challenge from Bill Hayden , the final treasurer in the Whitlam government , and won by a two @-@ vote margin . Fraser called an election for 10 December . Although Labor managed to pick up five seats , the Coalition still enjoyed a majority of 48 . According to Freudenberg , " The meaning and the message were unmistakable . It was the Australian people 's rejection of Edward Gough Whitlam . " Whitlam 's son Tony , who had joined his father in the House of Representatives at the 1975 election , was defeated . Shortly after the election , Whitlam resigned as party leader and was succeeded by Hayden . 
 = = Later years and death ( 1978 – 2014 ) = = 
 Whitlam was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in June 1978 and resigned from Parliament on 31 July of the same year . He then had various academic positions . When Labor returned to power under Bob Hawke in 1983 , Whitlam was appointed as ambassador to UNESCO , based in Paris . He served for three years in this post , defending UNESCO against allegations of corruption . At the end of his term as Australia 's Ambassador Whitlam was elected to the Executive Board of UNESCO for a 3 @-@ year term , until 1989 . In 1985 , he was appointed to Australia 's Constitutional Commission . 
 Whitlam was appointed chairman of the National Gallery of Australia in 1987 after his son Nick ( then managing director of the State Bank of New South Wales ) turned down the position . He and Margaret Whitlam were part of the bid team that in 1993 persuaded the International Olympic Committee to give Sydney the right to host the 2000 Summer Olympics . 
 John Kerr died in 1991 . He and Whitlam never reconciled ; indeed , Whitlam always saw his dismissal from office as a " constitutional coup d 'état " . Whitlam and Fraser put aside their differences and became friends during the 1980s , though they never discussed the events of 1975 . The two subsequently campaigned together in support of the 1999 Australian republic referendum . In March 2010 , Fraser visited Whitlam at his Sydney office while on a book tour to promote his memoirs . Whitlam accepted an autographed copy of the book and presented Fraser with a copy of his 1979 book about the dismissal , The Truth of the Matter . 
 In 2001 Whitlam received a Centenary Medal . 
 In 2003 , Whitlam 's former research assistant Mark Latham became the leader of the ALP . Although Latham was more conservative than Whitlam , the former prime minister gave Latham much support , according to one account " anointing him as his political heir " . Latham , like Whitlam , represented Werriwa in the House of Representatives . Whitlam supported Latham when he opposed the invasion and occupation of Iraq . 
 Whitlam supported fixed four @-@ year terms for both houses of Parliament . In 2006 , he accused the ALP of failing to press for this change . In April 2007 , he and Margaret Whitlam were both made life members of the Australian Labor Party . This was the first time anyone had been made a life member of the party organisation at the national level . 
 In 2007 , Whitlam testified at an inquest into the death of Brian Peters , one of five Australia @-@ based TV personnel killed in East Timor in October 1975 . Whitlam indicated that he had warned Peters ' colleague , Greg Shackleton ( who was also killed ) , that the Australian government could not protect them in East Timor and that they should not go there . He also said that Shackleton was " culpable " if he had not passed on Whitlam 's warning . 
 Whitlam joined three other former prime ministers in February 2008 in returning to Parliament to witness the Federal Government apology to the Aboriginal Stolen Generations by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd . On 21 January 2009 , Whitlam achieved a greater age ( 92 years , 195 days ) than any other prime minister of Australia , surpassing the previous record holder Frank Forde . On the 60th anniversary of his marriage to Margaret Whitlam , he called it " very satisfactory " and claimed a record for " matrimonial endurance " . In 2010 , it was reported that Whitlam had moved into an aged care facility in Sydney 's inner east in 2007 . Despite this , he continued to go to his office three days a week . Margaret Whitlam remained in the couple 's nearby apartment . In early 2012 she suffered a fall there , leading to her death in hospital at age 92 on 17 March of that year , a month short of the Whitlams ' 70th wedding anniversary . 
 On the morning of 21 October 2014 , Whitlam 's family announced his death , at the age of 98 , and that there would be a private cremation and a public memorial service . Whitlam was survived by his four children , five grandchildren and nine great @-@ grandchildren . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 A state memorial service was held on 5 November 2014 in the Sydney Town Hall and was led by Kerry O 'Brien . The Welcome to Country was given by Auntie Millie Ingram and eulogies were delivered by Graham Freudenberg , Cate Blanchett , Noel Pearson , John Faulkner and Antony Whitlam . Pearson 's contribution in particular was hailed as " one of the best political speeches of our time " . Musical performances were delivered by William Barton ( a didgeridoo improvisation ) , Paul Kelly and Kev Carmody ( their land rights protest song From Little Things Big Things Grow ) , as well as the Sydney Philharmonia Choir and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Benjamin Northey . In accordance with Whitlam 's wishes , the orchestra performed " In Tears of Grief " from Bach 's St Matthew Passion , " Va , pensiero " from Verdi 's Nabucco , " Un Bal " from Symphonie fantastique by Berlioz and , as the final piece , Jerusalem by Parry . Jerusalem was followed by a flypast of four RAAF F / A @-@ 18 Hornets in missing man formation . Those attending the memorial included the current and some former governors @-@ general , the current and all living former prime ministers , and members of the family of Vincent <unk> . The two @-@ hour service , attended by 1 @,@ 000 invited guests and 900 others , was screened to thousands outside the Hall , as well as in Cabramatta and Melbourne , and broadcast live by ABC television . 
 The Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory Katy Gallagher announced that a future Canberra suburb will be named for Whitlam , and that his family would be consulted about other potential memorials . 
 In honour of Whitlam , the Australian Electoral Commission renamed the Division of Throsby to Whitlam , to take effect at the 2016 election . 
 The house in which Whitlam was born , " <unk> " at 46 Rowland St , Kew in suburban Melbourne , was temporarily preserved on 22 October 2014 pending an assessment of its heritage value . Initial work to demolish the house had started several days before Whitlam 's death . In July 2015 the Heritage Council of Victoria deemed the property not significant enough to warrant protection . The City of Boroondara separately applied an interim Heritage Overlay on the site . A subsequent planning panel also determined that the house was not of sufficient significance to warrant preservation . However , at its meeting of 16 November 2015 , the Boroondara Council rejected the planning panel recommendation , and voted to retain the Heritage Overlay on the house , thereby preserving it . On 3 May 2016 the Victorian Minister for the Environment overruled the heritage order , and on Friday 13 May 2016 , the home was bulldozed . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Whitlam remains well remembered for the circumstances of his dismissal . It is a legacy he did little to efface ; he wrote a 1979 book , The Truth of the Matter ( the title is a play on that of Kerr 's 1978 memoir , Matters for Judgment ) and devoted part of his subsequent book , Abiding Interests , to the circumstances of his removal . According to journalist and author Paul Kelly , who penned two books on the crisis , Whitlam " achieved a paradoxical triumph : the shadow of the dismissal has obscured the sins of his government " . 
 More books have been written about Whitlam , including his own writings , than about any other Australian prime minister . According to Whitlam biographer Jenny Hocking , for a period of at least a decade , the Whitlam era was viewed almost entirely in negative terms , but that has changed . Still , she feels that Australians take for granted programs and policies initiated by the Whitlam government , such as recognition of China , legal aid , and Medicare . Ross McMullin , who wrote a book on the history of the ALP , notes that Whitlam remains greatly admired by many Labor supporters because of his efforts to reform Australian government , and his inspiring leadership . Economist and writer Ross Gittins evaluated the Whitlam Government 's responses to the economic challenges of the time . 
 Wallace Brown describes Whitlam in his book about his experiences covering Australian prime ministers as a journalist : 
 Whitlam was the most paradoxical of all Prime Ministers in the last half of the 20th century . A man of superb intellect , knowledge , and literacy , he yet had little ability when it came to economics . ... Whitlam rivalled Menzies in his passion for the House of Representatives and ability to use it as his stage , and yet his parliamentary skills were rhetorical and not tactical . He could devise a strategy and then often botch the tactics in trying to implement that strategy . ... Above all he was a man of grand vision with serious blind spots . 
 Whitlam 's last words in the documentary film Gough Whitlam – In His Own Words ( 2002 ) were in response to a question about his status as an icon and elder statesman . He said : 
 " I hope this is not just because I was a martyr ; the fact was , I was an achiever " .

 = Battle of Bunker Hill = 
 The Battle of Bunker Hill was fought on June 17 , 1775 , during the Siege of Boston in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War . The battle is named after Bunker Hill in Charlestown , Massachusetts , which was peripherally involved in the battle , and was the original objective of both the colonial and British troops , though the majority of combat took place on the adjacent Breed 's Hill . 
 On June 13 , 1775 , the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British were planning to send troops out from the city to fortify the unoccupied hills surrounding the city , giving them control of Boston Harbor . In response , 1 @,@ 200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed 's Hill . During the night the colonists constructed a strong redoubt on Breed 's Hill , as well as smaller fortified lines across the Charlestown Peninsula . 
 By daybreak of June 17 the British became aware of the presence of colonial forces on the Peninsula , and mounted an attack against them that day . After two assaults on the colonial positions were repulsed with significant British casualties , the third and final attack carried the redoubt after the defenders ran out of ammunition . The colonists retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill , leaving the British in control of the Peninsula . 
 Though the battle was a tactical victory for the British , it proved to be a sobering experience for them , involving many more casualties than the Americans had incurred , including a large number of officers . The battle had demonstrated that inexperienced militia were able to stand up to regular army troops in battle . Subsequently the battle discouraged the British from any further frontal attacks against well defended front lines . Though American casualties were comparatively much less , their losses included General Joseph Warren and Major Andrew McClary , the final casualty of the battle . 
 The battle led the British to adopt a more cautious planning and maneuver execution in future engagements , which was evident in the subsequent New York and New Jersey campaign , and arguably helped , rather than hindered , the American forces . Their new approach to battle was actually giving the Americans greater opportunity to retreat if defeat was imminent . The costly engagement also convinced the British of the need to hire substantial numbers of foreign mercenaries to bolster their strength in the face of the new and formidable Continental Army . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Boston , situated on a peninsula , was largely protected from close approach by the expanses of water surrounding it , which were dominated by British warships . In the aftermath of the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 , the colonial militia , a force of about 15 @,@ 000 men had surrounded the town , and effectively besieged it . Under the command of Artemas Ward , they controlled the only land access to Boston itself ( the Roxbury Neck ) , but , lacking a navy , were unable to even contest British domination of the waters of the harbor . The British troops , a force of about 6 @,@ 000 under the command of General Thomas Gage , occupied the city , and were able to be resupplied and reinforced by sea . In theory , they were thus able to remain in Boston indefinitely . 
 However , the land across the water from Boston contained a number of hills , which could be used to advantage . If the militia could obtain enough artillery pieces , these could be placed on the hills and used to bombard the city until the occupying army evacuated it or surrendered . It was with this in mind that the Knox Expedition , led by Henry Knox , later transported cannon from Fort Ticonderoga to the Boston area . 
 The Charlestown Peninsula , lying to the north of Boston , started from a short , narrow isthmus ( known as the Charlestown Neck ) at its northwest , extending about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) southeastward into Boston Harbor . Bunker Hill , with an elevation of 110 feet ( 34 m ) , lay at the northern end of the peninsula . Breed 's Hill , at a height of 62 feet ( 19 m ) , was more southerly and nearer to Boston . The town of Charlestown occupied flats at the southern end of the peninsula . At its closest approach , less than 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 305 m ) separated the Charlestown Peninsula from the Boston Peninsula , where Copp 's Hill was at about the same height as Breed 's Hill . While the British retreat from Concord had ended in Charlestown , General Gage , rather than immediately fortifying the hills on the peninsula , had withdrawn those troops to Boston the day after that battle , turning the entire Charlestown Peninsula into a no man 's land . 
 = = British planning = = 
 Throughout May , in response to orders from Gage requesting support , the British received reinforcements , until they reached a strength of about 6 @,@ 000 men . On May 25 , three generals arrived on HMS Cerberus : William Howe , John Burgoyne , and Henry Clinton . Gage began planning with them to break out of the city , finalizing a plan on June 12 . This plan began with the taking of the Dorchester Neck , fortifying the Dorchester Heights , and then marching on the colonial forces stationed in Roxbury . Once the southern flank had been secured , the Charlestown heights would be taken , and the forces in Cambridge driven away . The attack was set for June 18 . 
 On June 13 , the Massachusetts Provincial Congress was notified , by express messenger from the Committee of Safety in Exeter , New Hampshire , that a New Hampshire gentleman " of undoubted veracity " had , while visiting Boston , overheard the British commanders making plans to capture Dorchester and Charlestown . On June 15 , the Massachusetts Committee of Safety decided that additional defenses needed to be erected . General Ward directed General Israel Putnam to set up defenses on the Charlestown Peninsula , specifically on Bunker Hill . 
 = = Prelude to battle = = 
 = = = Fortification of Breed 's Hill = = = 
 On the night of June 16 , colonial Colonel William Prescott led about 1 @,@ 200 men onto the peninsula in order to set up positions from which artillery fire could be directed into Boston . This force was made up of men from the regiments of Prescott , Putnam ( the unit was commanded by Thomas Knowlton ) , James Frye , and Ebenezer Bridge . At first , Putnam , Prescott , and their engineer , Captain Richard Gridley , disagreed as to where they should locate their defense . Some work was performed on Bunker Hill , but Breed 's Hill was closer to Boston and viewed as being more defensible . Arguably against orders , they decided to build their primary redoubt there . Prescott and his men , using Gridley 's outline , began digging a square fortification about 130 feet ( 40 m ) on a side with ditches and earthen walls . The walls of the redoubt were about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) high , with a wooden platform inside on which men could stand and fire over the walls . 
 The works on Breed 's Hill did not go unnoticed by the British . General Clinton , out on reconnaissance that night , was aware of them , and tried to convince Gage and Howe that they needed to prepare to attack the position at daylight . British sentries were also aware of the activity , but most apparently did not think it cause for alarm . Then , in the early predawn , around 4 a.m. , a sentry on board HMS Lively spotted the new fortification , and notified her captain . Lively opened fire , temporarily halting the colonists ' work . Aboard his flagship HMS Somerset , Admiral Samuel Graves awoke , irritated by the gunfire that he had not ordered . He stopped it , only to have General Gage countermand his decision when he became fully aware of the situation in the morning . He ordered all 128 guns in the harbor , as well as batteries atop Copp 's Hill in Boston , to fire on the colonial position , which had relatively little effect . The rising sun also alerted Prescott to a significant problem with the location of the redoubt – it could easily be flanked on either side . He promptly ordered his men to begin constructing a breastwork running down the hill to the east , deciding he did not have the manpower to also build additional defenses to the west of the redoubt . 
 = = = British preparations = = = 
 When the British generals met to discuss their options , General Clinton , who had urged an attack as early as possible , preferred an attack beginning from the Charlestown Neck that would cut off the colonists ' retreat , reducing the process of capturing the new redoubt to one of starving out its occupants . However , he was outvoted by the other three generals . Howe , who was the senior officer present and would lead the assault , was of the opinion that the hill was " open and easy of ascent and in short would be easily carried . " General Burgoyne concurred , arguing that the " untrained rabble " would be no match for their " trained troops " . Orders were then issued to prepare the expedition . 
 When General Gage surveyed the works from Boston with his staff , Loyalist <unk> Willard recognized his brother @-@ in @-@ law Colonel Prescott . " Will he fight ? " asked Gage . " [ A ] s to his men , I cannot answer for them ; " replied Willard , " but Colonel Prescott will fight you to the gates of hell . " Prescott lived up to Willard 's word , but his men were not so resolute . When the colonists suffered their first casualty , Asa Pollard of Billerica , a young private killed by cannon fire , Prescott gave orders to bury the man quickly and quietly , but a large group of men gave him a solemn funeral instead , with several deserting shortly thereafter . 
 It took six hours for the British to organize an infantry force and to gather up and inspect the men on parade . General Howe was to lead the major assault , drive around the colonial left flank , and take them from the rear . Brigadier General Robert Pigot on the British left flank would lead the direct assault on the redoubt , and Major John Pitcairn led the flank or reserve force . It took several trips in longboats to transport Howe 's initial forces ( consisting of about 1 @,@ 500 men ) to the eastern corner of the peninsula , known as Moulton 's Point . By 2 p.m. , Howe 's chosen force had landed . However , while crossing the river , Howe noted the large number of colonial troops on top of Bunker Hill . Believing these to be reinforcements , he immediately sent a message to Gage , requesting additional troops . He then ordered some of the light infantry to take a forward position along the eastern side of the peninsula , alerting the colonists to his intended course of action . The troops then sat down to eat while they waited for the reinforcements . 
 = = = Colonists reinforce their positions = = = 
 Prescott , seeing the British preparations , called for reinforcements . Among the reinforcements were Joseph Warren , the popular young leader of the Massachusetts Committee of Safety , and Seth Pomeroy , an aging Massachusetts militia leader . Both of these men held commissions of rank , but chose to serve as infantry . Prescott ordered the Connecticut men under Captain Knowlton to defend the left flank , where they used a crude dirt wall as a breastwork , and topped it with fence rails and hay . They also constructed three small v @-@ shaped trenches between this dirt wall and Prescott 's breastwork . Troops that arrived to reinforce this flank position included about 200 men from the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments , under Colonels John Stark and James Reed . Stark 's men , who did not arrive until after Howe landed his forces ( and thus filled a gap in the defense that Howe could have taken advantage of , had he pressed his attack sooner ) , took positions along the breastwork on the northern end of the colonial position . When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River to the north , they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the water 's edge . Colonel Stark placed a stake about 100 feet ( 30 m ) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it . Just prior to the action , further reinforcements arrived , including portions of Massachusetts regiments of Colonels Brewer , Nixon , Woodbridge , Little , and Major Moore , as well as Callender 's company of artillery . 
 Behind the colonial lines , confusion reigned . Many units sent toward the action stopped before crossing the Charlestown Neck from Cambridge , which was under constant fire from gun batteries to the south . Others reached Bunker Hill , but then , uncertain about where to go from there , milled around . One commentator wrote of the scene that " it appears to me there never was more confusion and less command . " While General Putnam was on the scene attempting to direct affairs , unit commanders often misunderstood or disobeyed orders .

 By 3 p.m. , the British reinforcements , which included the 47th Foot and the 1st Marines , had arrived , and the British were ready to march . Brigadier General Pigot 's force , gathering just south of Charlestown village , were taking casualties from sniper fire , and Howe asked Admiral Graves for assistance in clearing out the snipers . Graves , who had planned for such a possibility , ordered incendiary shot fired into the village , and then sent a landing party to set fire to the town . The smoke billowing from Charlestown lent an almost surreal backdrop to the fighting , as the winds were such that the smoke was kept from the field of battle . 
 Pigot , commanding the 5th , 38th , 43rd , 47th , and 52nd regiments , as well as Major Pitcairn 's Marines , were to feint an assault on the redoubt . However , they continued to be harried by snipers in Charlestown , and Pigot , when he saw what happened to Howe 's advance , ordered a retreat . 
 General Howe led the light infantry companies and grenadiers in the assault on the American left flank , expecting an easy effort against Stark 's recently arrived troops . His light infantry were set along the narrow beach , in column , in order to turn the far left flank of the colonial position . The grenadiers were deployed in the middle . They lined up four deep and several hundred across . As the regulars closed , John Simpson , a New Hampshire man , prematurely fired , drawing an ineffective volley of return fire from the regulars . When the regulars finally closed within range , both sides opened fire . The colonists inflicted heavy casualties on the regulars , using the fence to steady and aim their muskets , and benefit from a modicum of cover . With this devastating barrage of musket fire , the regulars retreated in disarray , and the militia held their ground . 
 The regulars reformed on the field and marched out again . This time , Pigot was not to feint ; he was to assault the redoubt , possibly without the assistance of Howe 's force . Howe , instead of marching against Stark 's position along the beach , marched instead against Knowlton 's position along the rail fence . The outcome of the second attack was much the same as the first . One British observer wrote , " Most of our Grenadiers and Light @-@ infantry , the moment of presenting themselves lost three @-@ fourths , and many nine @-@ tenths , of their men . Some had only eight or nine men a company left ... " Pigot did not fare any better in his attack on the redoubt , and again ordered a retreat . Meanwhile , in the rear of the colonial forces , confusion continued to reign . General Putnam tried , with only limited success , to send additional troops from Bunker Hill to Breed 's Hill to support the men in the redoubt and along the defensive lines . 
 The British rear was also in some disarray . Wounded soldiers that were mobile had made their way to the landing areas , and were being ferried back to Boston , and the wounded lying on the field of battle were the source of moans and cries of pain . General Howe , deciding that he would try again , sent word to General Clinton in Boston for additional troops . Clinton , who had watched the first two attacks , sent about 400 men from the 2nd Marines and the 63rd Foot , and then followed himself to help rally the troops . In addition to the new reserves , he also convinced about 200 of the wounded to form up for the third attack . During the interval between the second and third assaults , General Putnam continued trying to direct troops toward the action . Some companies , and leaderless groups of men , moved toward the action ; others retreated . John Chester , a Connecticut captain , seeing an entire company in retreat , ordered his company to aim muskets at that company to halt its retreat ; they turned about and headed back to the battlefield . 
 The third assault , concentrated on the redoubt ( with only a feint on the colonists ' flank ) , was successful , although the colonists again poured musket fire into the British ranks , and it cost the life of Major Pitcairn . The defenders had run out of ammunition , reducing the battle to close combat . The British had the advantage once they entered the redoubt , as their troops were equipped with bayonets on their muskets while most of the colonists were not . Colonel Prescott , one of the last colonists to leave the redoubt , parried bayonet thrusts with his normally ceremonial sabre . It is during the retreat from the redoubt that Joseph Warren was killed . 
 The retreat of much of the colonial forces from the peninsula was made possible in part by the controlled retreat of the forces along the rail fence , led by John Stark and Thomas Knowlton , which prevented the encirclement of the hill . Their disciplined retreat , described by Burgoyne as " no flight ; it was even covered with bravery and military skill " , was so effective that most of the wounded were saved ; most of the prisoners taken by the British were mortally wounded . General Putnam attempted to reform the troops on Bunker Hill ; however the flight of the colonial forces was so rapid that artillery pieces and entrenching tools had to be abandoned . The colonists suffered most of their casualties during the retreat on Bunker Hill . By 5 p.m. , the colonists had retreated over the Charlestown Neck to fortified positions in Cambridge , and the British were in control of the peninsula . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The British had taken the ground but at a great loss ; they had suffered 1 @,@ 054 casualties ( 226 dead and 828 wounded ) , with a disproportionate number of these officers . The casualty count was the highest suffered by the British in any single encounter during the entire war . General Clinton , echoing Pyrrhus of Epirus , remarked in his diary that " A few more such victories would have shortly put an end to British dominion in America . " British dead and wounded included 100 commissioned officers , a significant portion of the British officer corps in North America . Much of General Howe 's field staff was among the casualties . Major Pitcairn had been killed , and Lieutenant Colonel James Abercrombie fatally wounded . General Gage , in his report after the battle , reported the following officer casualties ( listing lieutenants and above by name ) : 
 1 lieutenant colonel killed 
 2 majors killed , 3 wounded 
 7 captains killed , 27 wounded 
 9 lieutenants killed , 32 wounded 
 15 sergeants killed , 42 wounded 
 1 drummer killed , 12 wounded 
 The colonial losses were about 450 , of whom 140 were killed . Most of the colonial losses came during the withdrawal . Major Andrew McClary was technically the highest ranking colonial officer to die in the battle ; he was hit by cannon fire on Charlestown Neck , the last person to be killed in the battle . He was later commemorated by the dedication of Fort McClary in Kittery , Maine . A serious loss to the Patriot cause , however , was the death of Dr. Joseph Warren . He was the President of Massachusetts ' Provincial Congress , and he had been appointed a Major General on June 14 . His commission had not yet taken effect when he served as a volunteer private three days later at Bunker Hill . Only thirty men were captured by the British , most of them with grievous wounds ; twenty died while held prisoner . The colonials also lost numerous shovels and other entrenching tools , as well as five out of the six cannon they had brought to the peninsula . 
 = = Political consequences = = 
 When news of the battle spread through the colonies , it was reported as a colonial loss , as the ground had been taken by the enemy , and significant casualties were incurred . George Washington , who was on his way to Boston as the new commander of the Continental Army , received news of the battle while in New York City . The report , which included casualty figures that were somewhat inaccurate , gave Washington hope that his army might prevail in the conflict . 
 The Massachusetts Committee of Safety , seeking to repeat the sort of propaganda victory it won following the battles at Lexington and Concord , commissioned a report of the battle to send to England . Their report , however , did not reach England before Gage 's official account arrived on July 20 . His report unsurprisingly caused friction and argument between the Tories and the Whigs , but the casualty counts alarmed the military establishment , and forced many to rethink their views of colonial military capability . King George 's attitude toward the colonies hardened , and the news may have contributed to his rejection of the Continental Congress ' Olive Branch Petition , the last substantive political attempt at reconciliation . Sir James Adolphus <unk> , part of the Tory majority , wrote to Lord Dartmouth of the colonies , " the sooner they are made to Taste Distress the sooner will [ Crown control over them ] be produced , and the <unk> of Blood be put a stop to . " About a month after receiving Gage 's report the Proclamation of Rebellion would be issued in response ; this hardening of the British position would also lead to a hardening of previously weak support for the rebellion , especially in the southern colonies , in favor of independence . 
 Gage 's report had a more direct effect on his own career . His dismissal from office was decided just three days after his report was received , although General Howe did not replace him until October 1775 . Gage wrote another report to the British Cabinet , in which he repeated earlier warnings that " a large army must at length be employed to reduce these people " , that would require " the hiring of foreign troops . " 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Much has been written in the wake of this battle over how it was conducted . Both sides made strategic and tactical missteps which could have altered the outcome of the battle . While hindsight often gives a biased view , some things seem to be apparent after the battle that might reasonably have been within the reach of the command of the day . 
 Years after the battle General Dearborn published an account of the battle in Port Folio magazine , accusing General Putnam of inaction , cowardly leadership and failing to supply reinforcements during the battle , which subsequently sparked a long lasting and major controversy among veterans of the war , various friends , family members and historians . 
 = = = Disposition of Colonial forces = = = 
 The colonial forces , while nominally under the overall command of General Ward , with General Putnam and Colonel Prescott leading in the field , often acted quite independently . This was evident in the opening stages of the battle , when a tactical decision was made that had strategic implications . After deliberating with General Putnam and Colonel Gridley , Colonel Prescott and his staff , apparently in contravention of orders , decided to fortify Breed 's Hill rather than Bunker Hill . The fortification of Breed 's Hill was more provocative ; it would have put offensive artillery closer to Boston . It also exposed the forces there to the possibility of being trapped , as they probably could not properly defend against attempts by the British to land troops and take control of Charlestown Neck . If the British had taken that step , they might have had a victory with many fewer casualties . 
 While the front lines of the colonial forces were generally well managed , the scene behind them , especially once the action began , was significantly disorganized , due at least in part to a poor chain of command . Only some of the militias operated directly under Ward 's and Putnam 's authority , and some commanders also disobeyed orders , staying at Bunker Hill rather than joining in the defense on the third British assault . Several officers were subjected to court martial and cashiered . Colonel Prescott was of the opinion that the third assault would have been repulsed , had his forces in the redoubt been reinforced with either more men , or more supplies of ammunition and powder . 
 = = = Disposition of British forces = = = 
 The British leadership , for its part , acted slowly once the works on Breed 's Hill were spotted . It was 2 p.m. when the troops were ready for the assault , roughly ten hours after the Lively first opened fire . This leisurely pace gave the colonial forces time to reinforce the flanking positions that had been poorly defended . Gage and Howe decided that a frontal assault on the works would be a simple matter , when an encircling move ( gaining control of Charlestown Neck ) , would have given them a more resounding victory . ( This move would not have been without risks of its own , as the colonists could have made holding the Neck expensive with fire from the high ground in Cambridge . ) But the British leadership was excessively optimistic , believing that " two regiments were sufficient to beat the strength of the province " . 
 Once in the field , Howe , rather than focusing on the redoubt , opted ( twice ) to dilute the force attacking the redoubt with a flanking maneuver against the colonial left . It was only with the third attack , when the flank attack was merely a feint , and the main force ( now also reinforced with additional reserves ) squarely targeted the redoubt , that the attack succeeded . 
 Following the taking of the peninsula , the British arguably had a tactical advantage that they could have used to press into Cambridge . General Clinton proposed this to Howe ; having just led three assaults with grievous casualties , he declined the idea . The colonial military leaders eventually recognized Howe as a tentative decision @-@ maker , to his detriment ; in the aftermath of the Battle of Long Island ( 1776 ) , he again had tactical advantages that might have delivered Washington 's army into his hands , but again refused to act . 
 Historian John Ferling maintains that had General Gage used the Royal Navy to secure the narrow neck to the Charleston peninsula , cutting the Americans off from the mainland , he could have achieved a far less costly victory , but he was motivated by revenge over patriot resistance at the Battles of Lexington and Concord and relatively heavy British losses , and also felt that the colonial militia were completely untrained and could be overtaken with little effort , opting for a frontal assault . 
 = = " The whites of their eyes " = = 
 The famous order " Don 't fire until you see the whites of their eyes " was popularized in stories about the battle of Bunker Hill . It is uncertain as to who said it there , since various histories , including eyewitness accounts , attribute it to Putnam , Stark , Prescott , or Gridley , and it may have been said first by one , and repeated by the others . It was also not an original statement . The idea dates originally to the general @-@ king Gustavus Adolphus ( 1594 – 1632 ) who gave standing orders to his musketeers : " never to give fire , till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy 's eye " . Gustavus Adolphus 's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated . It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham , when his troops defeated Montcalm 's army on September 13 , 1759 . The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27 , 1743 , where Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of <unk> warned his Regiment , the Royal Scots Fusiliers , not to fire until they could " see the white of their e 'en . " The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745 , and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great , and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with . Whether or not it was actually said in this battle , it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect , especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited .

 A significant number of notable people fought in this battle . Henry Dearborn and William Eustis , for example , went on to distinguished military and political careers ; both served in Congress , the Cabinet , and in diplomatic posts . Others , like John Brooks , Henry <unk> , Christian <unk> , Thomas Knowlton , and John Stark , became well known for later actions in the war . Stark became known as the " Hero of Bennington " for his role in the 1777 Battle of Bennington . Free African @-@ Americans also fought in the battle ; notable examples include Barzillai Lew , Salem Poor , and Peter Salem . Another notable participant was Daniel Shays , who later became famous for his army of protest in Shays ' Rebellion . Israel Potter was immortalized in Israel Potter : His Fifty Years of Exile , a novel by Herman Melville . Colonel John Paterson commanded the Massachusetts First Militia , served in Shays ' Rebellion , and became a congressman from New York . Lt. Col. Seth Read , who served under John Paterson at Bunker Hill , went on to settle Geneva , New York and Erie , Pennsylvania , and was said to have been instrumental in the phrase E pluribus unum being added to U.S. coins . George <unk> of the Massachusetts militia was shot in the knee at Bunker Hill and went on after the war to become the master builder of the USS Constitution , a.k.a. " Old Ironsides " , which is the oldest naval vessel in the world that is still commissioned and afloat .

 John Trumbull 's painting , The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill ( displayed in lede ) , was created as an allegorical depiction of the battle and Warren 's death , not as an actual pictorial recording of the event . The painting shows a number of participants in the battle including a British officer , John Small , among those who stormed the redoubt , yet came to be the one holding the mortally wounded Warren and preventing a fellow redcoat from bayoneting him . He was friends of Putnam and Trumbull . Other central figures include Andrew McClary who was the last man to fall in the battle . 
 The Bunker Hill Monument is an obelisk that stands 221 feet ( 67 m ) high on Breed 's Hill . On June 17 , 1825 , the fiftieth anniversary of the battle , the cornerstone of the monument was laid by the Marquis de Lafayette and an address delivered by Daniel Webster . ( When Lafayette died , he was buried next to his wife at the Cimetière de Picpus under soil from Bunker Hill , which his son Georges sprinkled over him . ) The Leonard P. <unk> Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge was specifically designed to evoke this monument . There is also a statue of William Prescott showing him calming his men down . 
 The National Park Service operates a museum dedicated to the battle near the monument , which is part of the Boston National Historical Park . A cyclorama of the battle was added in 2007 when the museum was renovated . 
 In nearby Cambridge , a small granite monument just north of Harvard Yard bears this inscription : " Here assembled on the night of June 16 , 1775 , 1200 Continental troops under command of Colonel Prescott . After prayer by President Langdon , they marched to Bunker Hill . " See footnote for picture . ( Samuel Langdon , a Congregational minister , was Harvard 's 11th president . ) Another small monument nearby marks the location of the Committee of Safety , which had become the Patriots ' provisional government as Tories left Cambridge . These monuments are on the lawn to the west of Harvard 's <unk> Center , which is itself the west of Harvard 's huge Science Center . See footnote for map . 
 Bunker Hill Day , observed every June 17 , is a legal holiday in Suffolk County , Massachusetts ( which includes the city of Boston ) , as well as Somerville in Middlesex County . Prospect Hill , site of colonial fortifications overlooking the Charlestown Neck , is now located in Somerville , which was previously part of Charlestown . State institutions in Massachusetts ( such as public institutions of higher education ) located in Boston also celebrate the holiday . However , the state 's FY2011 budget requires that all state and municipal offices in Suffolk County be open on Bunker Hill Day and Evacuation Day . 
 On June 16 and 17 , 1875 , the centennial of the battle was celebrated with a military parade and a reception featuring notable speakers , among them General William Tecumseh Sherman and Vice President Henry Wilson . It was attended by dignitaries from across the country . Celebratory events also marked the sesquicentennial ( 150th anniversary ) in 1925 and the bicentennial in 1975 . 
 Over the years the Battle of Bunker Hill has been commemorated on four U.S. Postage stamps .

 Gunroar is a naval themed shoot ' em up likened to a vertically scrolling version of Geometry Wars ( or a cross between Asteroids and Space Invaders ) . The player controls a small , abstract gunboat which can be rotated through 360 degrees as in games such as Geometry Wars and Robotron . The game also features vertical scrolling ; however , unlike the standard shoot ' em up in which the propulsion of the craft dictates the pace , players can control the speed at which they proceed through the level . The faster players move through a level , the more points they will score . The game features multiple modes dependent on how the game is controlled : the player can choose to control a single boat by means of the keyboard or mouse or a more complicated " dual " mode allowing the use of two boats using both hands on the keyboard . Gunroar was praised for its minimalist design , impressive polygonal graphics , and frenetic action .

Chuck soon finds himself on a date with Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski ) , who is revealed to be a CIA agent assigned , along with veteran National Security Agency ( NSA ) agent Major John Casey ( Adam Baldwin ) , to capture Chuck . The episode also introduces series regulars Joshua Gomez and Sarah Lancaster as Chuck 's best friend and older sister , Morgan Grimes and Ellie Bartowski , respectively . Guest stars include Matthew Bomer as Bryce Larkin , Chuck 's college roommate @-@ turned @-@ nemesis and the CIA agent who emails him the Intersect , Wendy Makkena as the National Intelligence Director , Tony Todd as CIA Director Langston Graham , C.S. Lee as Harry Tang , Dale Dye as General Stanfield , and Nickolas Pajon as <unk> <unk> . 
 " Chuck Versus the Intersect " received mixed reviews from critics , though most writers praised the casting of the series , or at least that of Zachary Levi . According to the Nielsen ratings system , the pilot drew 9 @.@ 21 million viewers , a series high . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Echo Park , California , Chuck Bartowski ( Zachary Levi ) and his best friend Morgan Grimes ( Joshua Gomez ) make an unsuccessful attempt to escape Chuck 's birthday party hosted by his sister Ellie ( Sarah Lancaster ) . Despite the efforts of Ellie and her boyfriend , " Captain Awesome " ( Ryan McPartlin ) , for Chuck to socialize with the party 's female guests , Chuck dispels the women by explaining how years earlier his Stanford University roommate , Bryce Larkin ( Matthew Bomer ) , had him expelled and began a relationship with Chuck 's girlfriend , Jill Roberts . 
 Meanwhile , Bryce , a rogue CIA agent , is shown breaking into a top @-@ secret government computer center and downloading a vast amount of data to his PDA before destroying the computer . As Bryce attempts to escape , he is shot dead by NSA agent Major John Casey ( Adam Baldwin ) , but not before emailing the data to Chuck and self @-@ destructing his PDA . After viewing the rapid series of images , Chuck experiences a series of " flashes " of data , triggered by things he hears and sees , including a strange man ( Nickolas Pajon ) . 
 In Washington , D.C. , Casey is informed by the National Security Director ( Wendy Makkena ) and CIA Director Langston Graham ( Tony Todd ) that the computer Bryce destroyed was a government database called the Intersect , which the NSA and CIA used as a joint resource to identify threats to the government . Casey is ordered to track down the recipient of Bryce 's email in California . 
 At work at the Buy More , Chuck is approached at the Nerd Herd counter by Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski ) . After Chuck fixes Sarah 's phone , she leaves him her phone number , but he decides not to call her . He arrives home to find an intruder stealing his computer . After the computer is dropped and destroyed , the intruder escapes and is revealed to be Sarah , a CIA agent . 
 Sarah takes Chuck on a date to find out what he knows . Sarah spots and quickly dispatches an NSA team following but flees with Chuck when she spots Casey . Sarah leads Chuck up to the top floor of a skyscraper and attempts to call in an evacuation while Chuck explains what happened when he uploaded the Intersect . Sarah then aims her gun at Chuck when Casey arrives on the roof . Sarah warns Casey that Chuck uploaded the Intersect and tells Chuck that their mutual friend Bryce is dead . Chuck then flashes on the building where the visiting General Stanfield ( Dale Dye ) is giving an address and puts together all the pieces from the flashes he had been having : the stranger in the Large Mart is a demolitions expert and has set a bomb to destroy the conference . Chuck , Sarah , and Casey locate the bomb in the conference hall and Chuck defuses the bomb by deliberately infecting the machine with a computer virus . 
 Sarah reassures Chuck that he will remain at the Buy More , while she and Casey watch over him . He is to work with them until they can discover a way for the Intersect to be removed from his brain . All she asks is that Chuck trust her .

 = = = Conception = = = 
 Chuck was conceived by Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak . NBC initially gave the series a put pilot commitment before green lighting a pilot order in January 2007 . Schwartz and Fedak both attended the University of Southern California and the latter pitched the idea to Schwartz who agreed to develop the project with him . The hour @-@ long , high @-@ concept action @-@ comedy , described in press releases as being " in the vein of Grosse Pointe Blank " , would revolve around a man who downloads the entire CIA and NSA databases into his head . Schwartz signed a three @-@ year , seven @-@ figure overall deal with Warner Bros. Television to write and executive produce the series with Fedak . 
 Schwartz has stated that he set the series at an electronics store to compliment Chuck : 
 I think the big @-@ box culture is very much a way that we live our lives right now . And in trying to figure out what was sort of the best home for a character like Chuck , the Nerd Herd -- obviously inspired by such things as the Geek Squad [ of the consumer electronics store Best Buy ] -- felt like a really natural environment for him . I also liked that even in the uniforms that the Nerd Herd guys have to wear , they kind of resemble G @-@ men from 1950s FBI movies . So there 's a lot of components , both visually and in terms of his character , that were really appealing about setting it there . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Zachary Levi was the first actor to be cast in the series , before any other roles had been cast . Schwartz said that casting the role of Chuck was difficult , but Levi was perfect because you " could believe he was a social outcast , but still got the girl . " Adam Baldwin was cast as John Casey shortly thereafter on February 8 , 2007 . Fedak always had Baldwin in mind for the role and the producers found that the actor was a " perfect fit " for the character during the first casting session . On February 12 , 2007 , Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski was announced for what was then the role of Sarah Kent , joining Levi and Adam Baldwin . Prior to beginning of filming the character 's name was changed to Sarah Walker . Strahovski was unable to come to the United States for the audition , so the producers allowed her to audition via the internet . 
 In March , Sarah Lancaster , Joshua Gomez and Natalie Martinez were cast as Ellie Bartowski ( Chuck 's older sister ) , Morgan Pace ( Chuck 's best friend ) , and Kayla Hart ( Chuck 's neighbor and love interest ) , respectively . Gomez decided he wanted to be part of the pilot after reading there was a ninja in the script . Tony Todd and Wendy Makkena were cast as CIA Director Graham and the National Intelligence Director , General Mary Beckman . The casting for Beckman was narrowed to Makkena and Bonita Friedericy , with Mekenna ultimately being chosen . However , Mekenna only appeared in the pilot , and was replaced in the following episode by Friedericy as General Diane Beckman . 
 Morgan 's surname was changed to " Grimes " before filming , and Sarah 's to " Walker " . Despite Natalie Martinez appearing in promotional cast photographs , the character Kayla Hart was dropped before filming . Hart , the owner of the club where Sarah and Chuck first encounter Casey , was intended to be a rival for Chuck 's affections . However , Fedak and Schwartz found it too unlikely and too complicated to the storyline that two women would be pining over Chuck . Additionally , Captain Awesome was originally planned to be an enemy agent but his portrayal by Ryan McPartlin was so well received that this storyline was also abandoned .

 McG , Schwartz 's fellow executive producer on The O.C. , directed the pilot and consequently became an executive producer ( via his production company , Wonderland Sound and Vision ) , along with Fedak , Peter Johnson , Scott Rosenbaum , Matthew Miller and Allison Adler . NBC gave the series an early pick @-@ up and a thirteen @-@ episode order on May 10 , 2007 . 
 McG said he felt the appeal of the series was its mix of an " Office style comedy " and an action series , and added that Chuck 's work place " is designed to be as dangerous as the spy world . " Although Chuck 's apartment is set in Echo Park , the pilot was shot in El Cabrillo in Hollywood .

 The music of Chuck has been described as " a blending of generic action soundtracks with Schwartz 's penchant for good , pretty obscure bands " such as Foreign Born and The Shins . Journey 's song " Any Way You Want It " is featured as Chuck 's ringtone . Other songs include " <unk> " by Teddybears , " Cellphone 's Dead " by Beck , " Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is " by Jet , " See the World " by Gomez , " For A Fistful of Dollars " by Ennio Morricone , and " The Missionary " by Brothers Martin . 
 The pilot also establishes the series ' tendency to reference popular culture . Schwartz has revealed in interviews that the Buy More is based on consumer electronics stores such as Best Buy , while the Nerd Herd is inspired by the Best Buy subsidiary Geek Squad . When Sarah walks into the Buy More , Chuck and Morgan reference Prince 's song " <unk> " . Chuck and Morgan also continuously play Call of Duty .

 The series premiered on broadcast television at 8pm EST on September 24 , 2007 , after having been screened to overwhelmingly positive reception at the San Diego Comic @-@ Con International . According to the Nielsen ratings system , the pilot episode drew an estimated 9 @.@ 21 million viewers , a series high . 
 " Chuck Versus the Intersect " received mostly positive reviews from critics , with several praising the casting of the series , especially that of Zachary Levi . Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a rating of 9 out of 10 , writing , " Schwartz and Fedak 's script for the Chuck pilot is very strong , deftly mixing action and humor . Where Schwartz 's other new series , Gossip Girl , could use more of the humor he brought to The O.C. , Chuck does a great job capturing the wit and self @-@ awareness Schwartz 's previous series contained . " Varun <unk> of AOL TV criticized the episode 's opening as being " a weak gag " , though writing that " the ensuing moments were hilarious enough to almost erase the poorly executed opening moments . " Stephen Lackey of Mania called the pilot better than he expected , as well as " energetic , cinematic , and quite funny . " Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- on a scale of A + to F. 
 The Columbus Dispatch called the pilot " delightful " , writing , " Chuck has good nerd jokes , a winning everyman who is easy to root for , a hot blonde , ninja fighting and a backward car chase . " The newspaper praised the performance by the main cast , especially Zachary Levi , who it wrote " should soon be a pleasant surprise to audiences . " The paper called the episode " deftly directed by " McG , who kept " things from becoming too silly or far @-@ fetched . " Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the episode an overwhelmingly positive review , writing , " Everyday superheroes are , of course , a recurring TV fantasy , but seldom has the genre shown as much pluck as Chuck , and seldom has it found a more agreeable hero than Zachary Levi ... Levi needs only a few minutes here to convince you of his wider range and lay claim on breakout stardom . " 
 Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club gave the episode a negative review , rating it as a C- . Hyden criticized Levi as being " likeable but unconvincing playing a loser who hasn 't had a girlfriend in five years " and Levi and Gomez as " blandly recreating Judd Apatow 's loser heroes without any of the authentic details " , though calling Baldwin 's performance " one of the few bright spots " . Katey Rich of Television Blend wrote that the episode , like Chuck , was " gangly and awkward " and " a lot to swallow in a pilot episode , not to mention totally implausible . " However , Rich concluded that the series showed comedic promise and was loved by its audience , " while not necessarily being a slam dunk . " 
 For the pilot , editor Norman Buckley won the Award for Best Edited One @-@ Hour Series for Commercial Television at the 2007 American Cinema Editors Awards . " Chuck Versus the Intersect " was also nominated for Outstanding Main Title Design at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards . 
 = Peyk @-@ i Şevket @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Peyk @-@ i Şevket class was a pair of torpedo cruisers built for the Ottoman Navy by the German shipyard Germaniawerft in 1906 – 07 . The class comprised two ships : Peyk @-@ i Şevket and Berk @-@ i Satvet . They were ordered as part of a program to modernize the Ottoman fleet at the turn of the century . The ships were small vessels , at only 775 metric tons ( 763 long tons ; 854 short tons ) ; they were nevertheless heavily armed for their size , with three torpedo tubes and a pair of 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns along with several smaller weapons . 
 Neither ship saw action during the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 , as Peyk @-@ i Şevket had been interned in Suez and Berk @-@ i Satvet spent the war confined to the Sea of Marmara with the main Ottoman fleet . Both ships took a more active role in the Balkan Wars , frequently providing gunfire to support to Ottoman troops in East Thrace . During World War I , both ships served in the Black Sea , where they conducted patrols , escorted convoys , and attacked Russian ports . In January 1915 , Berk @-@ i Satvet was mined off the Bosporus , and seven months later , Peyk @-@ i Şevket was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS E11 in the Sea of Marmara . Both ships were repaired and returned to service by 1918 . 
 After the end of the war , both ships were kept in service with the new Turkish Navy , with lengthy overhauls in the mid @-@ 1920s . Both ships were extensively modernized in the late 1930s , and they remained in service to 1944 , when they were finally decommissioned . Both vessels were ultimately broken up in the early 1950s . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Peyk @-@ i Şevket class was classified as a torpedo cruiser by the Ottoman Navy , but was also sometimes referred to as a torpedo gunboat . The two ships were authorized in 1903 , and were ordered from the Krupp @-@ owned Germaniawerft shipyard in Germany , as part of a deal to modernize the elderly ironclad Âsâr @-@ ı Tevfik . The two cruisers were part of a naval reconstruction program that began in the late 1890s , following the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1897 , in which the Ottoman fleet had been unable to play an active role . 
 = = = Characteristics = = = 
 The ships were 80 @.@ 1 m ( 262 ft 10 in ) long , with a beam of 8 @.@ 4 m ( 27 ft 7 in ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 6 m ( 15 ft 1 in ) . They displaced 775 t ( 763 long tons ; 854 short tons ) while on sea trials . By 1938 , their displacement had increased to 850 t ( 840 long tons ; 940 short tons ) . The ships were fitted with two pole masts , the foremast just aft of the conning tower and the main mast further aft . The forecastle deck extended to the base of the forward funnel , and the quarterdeck was stepped down aft of the mainmast . They were steel @-@ hulled ships and carried no armor protection . Their crew numbered 125 officers and enlisted men as completed , and it had risen to 145 by 1915 . 
 The ships were powered by a pair of vertical triple @-@ expansion engines each driving a screw propeller . Their four coal @-@ fired Schulz water @-@ tube boilers , manufactured by Germaniawerft , were trunked into two funnels . The engines were rated at 5 @,@ 100 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 800 kW ) for a top speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) , though on trials they reached 22 kn ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . By 1915 , poor maintenance and heavy use had reduced their speed to 18 kn ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . The Peyk @-@ i Şevket @-@ class ships had storage capacity for 244 t ( 240 long tons ; 269 short tons ) of coal , which provided a cruising radius of 3 @,@ 240 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 000 km ; 3 @,@ 730 mi ) . 
 The two Peyk @-@ i Şevket @-@ class cruisers ' primary offensive armament was their three 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . One was mounted in the bow , above water , and the other two were in deck @-@ mounted swivel launchers amidships . They were armed with a pair of 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) quick @-@ firing 40 @-@ caliber guns that were placed in shielded single mounts on the forecastle and quarterdeck . They also carried six 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) 40 @-@ caliber guns , four of which were mounted in sponsons , a pair of 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and two machine guns .

 Both ships were rebuilt in the late 1930s and incorporated substantial improvements . Both stem and stern were rebuilt , with a new raked bow . Their superstructure was also reconstructed . The old gun armament was replaced with a pair of 88 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) 45 @-@ caliber guns and four 37 mm 40 @-@ caliber guns , and Berk @-@ i Satvet received equipment to handle 25 naval mines .

 = = Service history = = 
 Both ships saw extensive service with the Ottoman fleet over the course of the decade following their arrival in November 1907 . They took part in the first fleet maneuver conducted by the fleet in over twenty years in 1909 . Neither ship saw action during the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 , as Peyk @-@ i Şevket had been interned at British @-@ controlled Suez at the outbreak of war , and Berk @-@ i Satvet was stationed with the reserve fleet in the Sea of Marmara , which did not risk confrontation with the significantly stronger Italian fleet . Both ships saw combat during the First Balkan War in 1913 , primarily in supporting Ottoman forces ashore in East Thrace . The ships provided gunfire support to the Ottoman army holding the Çatalca line in defense of the capital at Constantinople . Berk @-@ i Satvet also took part in two brief skirmishes with the Greek Navy . 
 The Ottoman Empire joined World War I in November 1914 ; Peyk @-@ i Şevket and Berk @-@ i Satvet primarily operated in the Black Sea against the Russian Black Sea Fleet . They frequently patrolled the Ottoman coast , particularly off the Bosporus , and escorted convoys to western Anatolia . On one of these convoy operations in January 1915 , Berk @-@ i Satvet struck a mine that wrecked her stern . She was towed back to Constantinople and repaired , returning to service in 1918 . Peyk @-@ i Şevket returned to the Sea of Marmara during the Dardanelles Campaign in 1915 , where she carried munitions to the defending Ottoman forces . On 6 August , she was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS E11 and was badly damaged , with repairs lasting until 1917 . Both ships were used as convoy escorts in the Black Sea in the final year of the war . 
 The two cruisers were retained by the new Turkish Navy following the end of the Turkish War of Independence in 1923 , and their names were shortened to Peyk and Berk . Lengthy overhauls followed , in 1924 – 5 for Berk and 1927 – 9 for Peyk . They were modernized a decade later , in 1936 – 8 for Peyk and 1937 – 9 for Berk . The ships remained in service until 1944 , when they were stricken from the naval register and laid up at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard before being scrapped after 1953 . 
 = Mercy , Mercy ( Don Covay song ) = 
 " Mercy , Mercy " ( sometimes referred to as " Have Mercy " ) is a soul song first recorded by American singer / songwriter Don Covay in 1964 . It established Covay 's recording career and influenced later vocal and guitar styles . The songwriting is usually credited to Covay and Ron Alonzo Miller , although other co @-@ writers ' names have also appeared on various releases . 
 In late 1964 , the song became a hit , reaching number one on the Cash Box R & B chart and number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 . Several artists have recorded " Mercy , Mercy " , including a well @-@ known version by the Rolling Stones in 1965 . More recently , Covay 's original version has received attention as one of Jimi Hendrix 's first recordings as a sideman . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 In 1964 , after years of writing and recording songs for several record labels , Don Covay was again in search of a record deal . A recording session was arranged for May 13 , 1964 , at the A1 Recording Studio in New York City , operated by Atlantic Records co @-@ founder Herb Abramson . New York radio station <unk> disc jockey Nathaniel " Magnificent " Montague provided financing for the session . Covay has given differing accounts about the recording . In one , " Mercy , Mercy " was recorded the day following a well @-@ received performance by Covay and his band the Goodtimers the previous night . For the session , various members of the Goodtimers have been mentioned , including guitarist Ronald Alonzo Miller ( also suggested as the bassist ) , backup singer George " King " Clemons , bassist Horace " Ace " Hall , drummer Bernard Purdie , guitarist Bob Bushnell , guitarist Jimmy Johnson , and a young Jimi Hendrix . 
 Music critic Richie Unterberger describes " Mercy , Mercy " as a " soul tune with a gospel overlay in the pleading tone of the lyrics " . It opens with the refrain , sung by Covay with a higher @-@ register harmony : 
 Covay 's vocal is described as " impassioned " and " assured " . Music historian Peter Guralnick notes that the guitar part " established a new guitar dominated soul sound " . It plays a prominent role , beginning with the chorded lead @-@ in , which music writer Keith Shadwick describes as " rhythmic patterns that are tasteful modifications of the motifs favored by Curtis Mayfield and Jimmy Johnson – and there have been suggestions that it is Johnson himself on the record " . Covay recalled that the song was recorded in one or two takes and additional single @-@ note fills at the fade @-@ out suggest a second guitarist or an overdub . 
 = = Releases and charts = = 
 Rosemart Records released " Mercy , Mercy " , with the artist name " Don Covay and the Goodtimers " , as a single by in August 1964 . Producer Abramson 's former label Atlantic picked up the distribution and it entered the Billboard Hot 100 on September 5 , 1964 . The single reached number 35 during a stay of ten weeks on the chart . It was also a best seller in the R & B market , reaching number one on the Cash Box R & B chart ( Billboard 's R & B chart was suspended at the time ) . 
 An original pressing of the Rosemart single lists the composers as " Covay @-@ Miller " . The performing rights organization BMI shows the writers as " Donald Covay " and " Ronald Alonzo Miller " . However , different releases list " Covay @-@ Ott " , including Covay 's Mercy ! album ( Atlantic SD – 8104 ) and the Atlantic UK single ( <unk> ) ( Horace Ott played keyboards on and is credited with several songs on Mercy ! ) . Additionally , Miller is sometimes identified as " Ronald Norman Miller " , a Motown composer , and " Ronald Dean Miller " , a later R & B songwriter . BMI does not list " Mercy , Mercy " among Ott 's or the other Miller 's songwriting credits . 
 = = Hendrix involvement = = 
 Beginning in 2002 , it has become generally accepted that Jimi Hendrix contributed a guitar part to " Mercy , Mercy " . According to backup singer Clemons : 
 Curtis Knight , Jimmy [ Jimi Hendrix ] , and I all used to live in the same apartment building – around 81st Street [ near the A1 Studio ] ... Don Covay came around shopping for a record deal . He used to go down to the Harlem clubs looking for somebody to use ... on songs he was looking to sell to Atlantic [ Records ] . He 'd say , ' I got this tune I want you to help me with ... come on down to the studio ... Can you sing this part ? Can you play this part ? ' 
 Covay has sometimes identified Hendrix as a participant and on others does not mention him . According to Hendrix biographer Steven Roby , Hendrix " arrived at A1 Studio [ and ] was asked to play a simple Curtis Mayfield @-@ like R & B riff and not overstep his boundaries at the song 's dramatic pause " . However , Shadwick feels the song 's guitarist " certainly enjoys a prominent role – and perhaps this does suggest a regular band @-@ member performing a well @-@ learned routine rather than a last minute substitution " . Music writer David Malvinni describes Hendrix 's performance : " Hendrix deftly combines chords with a melodic line in a style that later will come to full development in his classic ' Little Wing ' " . 
 According to Clemons , Hendrix performed " Mercy , Mercy " at several small clubs before Covay 's single was released . Booker T. & the M.G. ' s guitarist Steve Cropper recalled meeting Hendrix at the Stax Records studio in Memphis in 1964 , when Hendrix mentioned that he had played on Covay 's " Mercy , Mercy " : 
 That about knocked me to my knees ... because that was one of my favorite records at the time . I hadn 't worked with Don [ Covay ] yet , but I asked Jimi to show me that great lick he played . [ Later ] Jimi took my guitar and started playing that sucker upside down [ Cropper played a right @-@ handed guitar , while Hendrix played left @-@ handed ] . I laughed and told him , ' I can 't learn that lick by looking at it that way ' . 
 Cropper 's recollection is supported by a 1968 Rolling Stone interview with Hendrix : " He [ Cropper ] showed me how to play lots of things and I showed him how I played ' Have Mercy ' or something like that " . Cropper later recorded an instrumental version of the song with Booker T. & the M.G. ' s for their 1965 Soul Dressing album . 
 Hendrix performed " Mercy , Mercy " with Curtis Knight and the Squires in 1965 . A live version with Knight on vocals , was recorded at George 's Club 20 in Hackensack , New Jersey ; it later appeared on the German bootleg album Mr. Pitiful ( <unk> <unk> ) , released about 1981 with Curtis Knight manager Ed Chalpin listed as the producer . Hendrix also performed the song in 1966 with his band Jimmy James and the Blue Flames at the Cafe Wha ? in Greenwich Village . In England later that year , Noel Redding recalled that it was one of the first songs that he played at his audition for the Jimi Hendrix Experience ; it was also the first song performed during Mitch Mitchell 's audition ( Redding had initially auditioned with drummer Aynsley Dunbar ) . 
 During the Experience 's first performances during a short tour of France in October 1966 and before they worked up some original material , they played the song along with a few other R & B cover songs during their 15 @-@ minute opening sets . A performance by the Experience at the Flamingo Club in London on February 4 , 1967 , was recorded and has been issued on several bootleg albums . Hendrix announces the song as " very straight Top @-@ 40 R & B rock ' n ' roll record ... a little thing called ' Have Mercy ' ... ' Have Mercy on Me , Baby ' " . The three and a half minute song features more elaborate and driving guitar work , although remains focused on chording . 
 = = Rolling Stones version = = 
 The Rolling Stones recorded their interpretation of " Mercy , Mercy " during their early American recording sessions , when they were beginning to emerge from their <unk> and R & B @-@ cover band roots . Their first attempt came during their second session at the Chess Records studio in Chicago in November 1964 . This version , which Malvinni calls " workmanlike " , remains unreleased . On their third Chess visit , they recorded the final version of the song . The session took place on May 10 and 11 , 1965 , with engineer Ron Malo . 
 The Stones generally follow Covay 's arrangement , but Unterberger notes the guitar work : " [ they ] really upped the guitar wattage , as heard in the memorable opening section of interwoven guitars and , more particularly , in the booming low fuzz guitar riffs that underpin the verses " . Malvinni comments on the song 's development since the first attempt : 
 [ Guitarist Keith ] Richards had absorbed the guitar part , and he gives an original , strident , and more improvisatory interpretation of the Hendrix part , and one with more rhythmic confidence than his first take on the song . In general , with a slightly overdriven ( distorted ) timbre and daring verve , Richards takes the song in the direction of rock . 
 Mick Jagger 's vocal for the song has been compared to Covay 's . AllMusic critic Steve Huey notes " [ he ] clearly modeled his vocal on Covay 's original , which apparently had a lasting impact on the way Jagger subsequently used his voice " . Guralnick calls Covay 's style a " formative influence " on Jagger , who was " gaining confidence as a soul @-@ rock vocalist " . 
 The song was not released as a single , however , it was used as the lead track on the Rolling Stones ' Out of Our Heads American album . Released on July 30 , 1965 , it became their first number one album in the US . The album , released in the UK on September 24 , 1965 , reached number two in the UK and includes the song as the second track . The group was filmed performing the song during their first appearance with Mick Taylor in Hyde Park on July 5 , 1969 , which was later included on the 2006 Stones in the Park expanded DVD .

 " Lisa the Greek " is the fourteenth episode of The Simpsons ' third season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 23 , 1992 . In the episode , Homer begins to bond with his daughter , Lisa , after learning her unique and convenient ability to pick winning football teams , but , secretly , uses her ability to help him gamble . When Lisa finds out Homer 's secret , she refuses to speak to her father until he fully understands her . " Lisa the Greek " was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky , and directed by Rich Moore . 
 The episode was designed to satirize the Simpsons staff members ' " love affair with gambling , particularly on football . " " Lisa the Greek " references both the Super Bowl and the National Football League ( NFL ) . It aired only a few days before Super Bowl XXVI , and correctly predicted that the Washington Redskins would win the game .

It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 2 , and was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network the week it aired . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Lisa complains to Marge that Homer never pays any attention to her or gets involved with her interests . Marge suggests that Lisa take an interest in something her father does , so she decides to join Homer on the couch while he is watching football on television . After being ripped off by betting advice hotlines , a desperate Homer turns to Lisa to pick a winner . She picks the Miami Dolphins , prompting Homer to call Moe 's Tavern to place his $ 50 bet . In the end , the Dolphins win , and Homer and Lisa celebrate . 
 Meanwhile , Marge suggests that she and Bart have a Mother @-@ Son day shopping for new clothes since Lisa is spending time with Homer . Bart claims he doesn 't need new clothing , but it 's seriously undermined when she sees how damaged his clothes are . At the mall , Marge 's excessive mothering embarrasses him more when she buys clothes from the clearance rack and ignoring his disgust by making him try out the clothes she picked for him . Bart remains hiding in the car , while the bullies taunt him to come out and Marge takes no notice of it , believing the bullies to be his friends . 
 Lisa becomes adept at choosing winners of football games , and Homer declares every Sunday during football season Daddy @-@ Daughter Day . Lisa remains perfect in her picks for eight weeks , earning her father more and more money as the Super Bowl approaches . With his new money , Homer starts buying expensive presents for the family and treating them to fine dining . When Lisa asks Homer if they can go hiking the Sunday following the Super Bowl , he tells her that he is instead going bowling with Barney and that Daddy @-@ Daughter Days are over until next football season . Lisa realizes that all Homer really wanted was to exploit her prognostic abilities to help him gamble . She dreams that she grows up to become a chain @-@ smoking , thrice @-@ divorced , casino @-@ hopper . Completely heartbroken , Lisa gives away all the toys Homer bought for her . At night , Marge berates Homer for using Lisa 's gift for his own purposes . 
 Homer realizes he needs to make amends with Lisa , but she is too hurt to even talk with him . Homer briefly cheers her up by inviting her to watch the Super Bowl together , but shows that he still only wants to win a bet . Heartbroken , she agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be , but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet , leading her to a cryptic prediction : if she still loves Homer , Washington will win ; if she does not , Buffalo . Homer bets with Washington , while the others go with Buffalo . As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe 's Tavern , Washington scores at the last second to win the game . Homer becomes happy at this blessing and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer , with which she agrees . Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and — on the Sunday after the Super Bowl — makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa despite not being in good shape .

 The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky , and directed by Rich Moore . According to show runner Al Jean , it was designed to satirize the staff members ' " love affair with gambling , particularly on football . " Kogen , Wolodarsky , Jean , George Meyer , Sam Simon , and James L. Brooks were all frequent gamblers . Many of the staff members were also football fans , particularly Kogen and Wolodarsky . In " Lisa the Greek " , the writers wanted to further develop Lisa 's character , and so they decided to make it about Lisa 's relationship with her father . 
 Kogen commented that Lisa and Marge episodes " tend to be the better episodes " , because they are more thought @-@ out and have more emotional depth to them . However , they are harder to write than other episodes because they are " less jokey . " The writers therefore made the decision to replace Marge 's role with Homer , who tends to be funnier than Marge . Jean commented that because he has a daughter , Homer – Lisa episodes are easier for him to write and he " always want [ s ] to work on them . " Moore said they are his favorite episodes to direct , because " the two most opposite characters in the cast finding some kind of common ground [ ... ] That was always interesting . " In one scene , Homer makes Lisa sit on the end of the sofa so that she will not interrupt the game . Yeardley Smith , the voice of Lisa , recalls that many people at the table @-@ read thought Homer was " too harsh " in the scene , but it ended up being included in the episode anyway . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 " Lisa the Greek " references both the Super Bowl and the National Football League ( NFL ) . The episode aired only a few days before Super Bowl XXVI , and correctly predicted that the Washington Redskins would win the game . When a repeat of the episode re @-@ aired the following year only days before Super Bowl XXVII , the staff redubbed the episode to mention the Dallas Cowboys instead of the Washington Redskins . The Cowboys won , making the episode accurate once again . It has continued to be accurate in later years when it has been redubbed ( the last redubbing came on the week before Super Bowl XXIX to reflect an all @-@ California Super Bowl , with the San Francisco 49ers in place of the Redskins and the San Diego Chargers in place of the Buffalo Bills ) , and Jean commented that he would always bet against Lisa 's predictions , causing him to think " Why didn 't I take Lisa 's advice ? " when he lost . As Lisa studies football at the Springfield library , she goes through the card catalog and finds an entry on Phyllis George , an American sportscaster . The title of the episode is a reference to the American bookie and sports commentator Jimmy " the Greek " Snyder . The Duff Bowl advertisement that airs during the Super Bowl halftime show is a reference to the Bud Bowl advertisements for Anheuser @-@ Busch 's Budweiser family of beers . 
 In addition to the football references , the episode parodies the 1979 film Apocalypse Now . Homer tells Moe , who keeps his wallet in his shoe , " I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet . Now it 's the smell of victory , " a play on a line from the film . In a commercial for his new television show , celebrity Troy McClure says that he plays " Jack Handle , a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal . We 're the original Odd Couple ! " , referencing the television show The Odd Couple . With his gambling winnings Homer buys Marge a bottle of perfume by Meryl Streep . The perfume is called Versatility and the bottle is shaped like an Academy Award . The Globe and Mail 's Liam Lacey commented on the similarities between the 2009 film Imagine That and this episode in a review of the film . He said the " message in each case is about the dangerous confusion of love and money . Naturally there 's a turning point [ ... ] where the child begins to wonder whether her father really loves her or just her profitable talent . "

 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle called it his favorite episode of the show . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote that " it 's nice to see [ Homer ] and Lisa getting along so well for once . " Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5 / 5 rating and commented that " any football fan will love this episode , but the reason why it is so good is the relationship between Homer and Lisa . The two truly are a father and daughter to one another , causing both laughter and touching emotion in the audience . " Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said " Lisa the Greek " is " a chance for Homer and Lisa to bond under less than ideal , but always amusing , circumstances . Oddly , for a show relying on actual events like the Super Bowl to guide its plotline , it doesn 't have [ a ] retread feeling . 
 DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson , however , did not think the episode developed Lisa 's and Homer 's relationship , but it " tosses in some good pokes at the NFL and the culture that surrounds the sport . " Jacobson added that although the episode " echoes the neglectful father theme seen not long ago in ' Lisa 's Pony ' , the show doesn 't feel like just a retread . [ ... ] It 's not a classic , but it remains an above average program .

 = Arado E.381 = 
 The Arado E.381 ( <unk> – " smallest fighter " ) was a proposed parasite fighter aircraft . Conceived by Arado Flugzeugwerke in December 1944 for Germany 's Luftwaffe during World War II , the E.381 was to have been carried aloft by and launched from an Arado Ar 234 " mother " aircraft . It would then have activated its rocket engine , which would have propelled it to attack Allied ( mainly American and British ) bombers . Development was cancelled due to lack of funds and official support . 
 There were three proposed variants ; each had fuel capacity for only two target runs , after which the pilot would have been required to glide without power to a landing on under @-@ belly skids . To survive close pursuits , the E.381 was designed with the narrowest frontal cross section possible to increase its chances of surviving shots from the front . This also forced the pilot to lie in a prone position . The cross @-@ section was 0 @.@ 45 square meters ( 4 @.@ 8 sq ft ) , or approximately a quarter of the cross section of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 . 
 = = Development = = 
 Near the end of World War II , in December 1944 , the German aircraft manufacturers Arado , BMW , Gotha , Heinkel , Henschel , and Zeppelin submitted design proposals for small <unk> or jet @-@ powered aircraft intended for pursuit or ground attack duties . All these proposals exploited the Luftwaffe 's concept of " gaining a tactical advantage by placing excessive stress on the man in the cockpit [ the German pilot ] " . The g @-@ forces envisioned in these proposals were feasible for aircraft structures but exceeded human capabilities in a normal sitting position . The designers attempted to alleviate this constraint by placing the pilot in the prone position , which increased the sustainable g @-@ force limit . This also allowed a reduction in fuselage size , weight , and drag . A smaller cross section also decreased the likelihood of being hit by enemy gunners , and Arado exploited this opportunity to the fullest . According to their " specific design philosophy " , the fighter was designed to fly close to bomber formations and open fire from its MK 108 cannon at point @-@ blank range . 
 The E.381 began in a proposal from Arado Flugzeugwerke to the Air Ministry for a parasite fighter , carried underneath another aircraft , to destroy Allied bombers . Three variants of the E.381 , named Mark I , II and III , were designed . Each version was essentially an armored tube provided with armament and a Walter HWK 109 @-@ 509 rocket engine for power . The aircraft would have carried enough fuel for two approaches to the target as well as only sixty ( some say forty @-@ five ) 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) rounds . After using all his fuel during an attack it was intended that the pilot would glide the fighter to the ground , deploy its drogue parachute , and land the aircraft on a primitive skid landing gear . None of the designs were ever completed due to its cancellation , though some wooden airframes and a single mockup were constructed in 1944 to provide prone @-@ position training for pilots . The E.381 was cancelled due to a lack of funds and interest by the Ministry of Aviation , along with a scarcity of mother Ar 234 aircraft — the Arado Ar <unk> four @-@ BMW 003 jet engined aircraft intended for this purpose was never able to be flight tested before the war 's end . 
 = = Variants = = 
 = = = Arado E.381 / I = = = 
 The first design , the Mark I , had a fuselage with a circular cross section and a small round window in the nose for pilot vision . A 5 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) armored shell protected most of the fuselage . The pilot would have been in a prone position in the very cramped cockpit ( the cross @-@ section was 0 @.@ 45 square meters ( 4 @.@ 8 sq ft ) , or approximately a quarter of the cross section of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 . ) behind a removable 140 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) bullet @-@ resistant glass screen mounted in front of the pilot . Two small bulges were located on the sides of the fuselage for the pilot 's elbows . Three C @-@ Stoff tanks surrounded the pilot , with the T @-@ Stoff oxidizer tank in the center section between the pilot and the engine . The aircraft had straight wings mounted at the top of the aircraft . In the dorsal area ( at the wing mounts ) the fuselage humped to accommodate a blister for a single MK 108 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) cannon and 60 ( other writers say 45 ) rounds . The Walter HWK 109 @-@ <unk> single @-@ chamber rocket engine was mounted beneath the aft fuselage , which also carried a twin @-@ fin empennage and the drogue parachute housing . 
 Landing the aircraft required the extension of the retractable landing skid and the deployment of a braking drogue parachute . As pilots could only access the plane from a hatch above the cockpit , the pilot would have to enter the E.381 before it could be attached to the carrier Ar <unk> and had no way to escape in case of an emergency while attached to the carrier .

 The second design , the Mark II , was very similar to the Mark I , aside from being larger and having smaller fins The variant was planned to have a deeper and shorter 5 m ( 16 ft 5 in ) fuselage and a high mid @-@ wing layout . It was to be powered by a Walter HWK 109 @-@ 509 A @-@ 2 engine . The unit was rated at 1 @,@ 700 kg ( 3 @,@ 700 lb ) of thrust . About a quarter of the way back from the nose the fuselage deepened in the form of a hump which extended to the tail . This hump housed a single MK 108 cannon with 45 rounds . 
 = = = Arado E.381 / III = = = 
 The third design , the Mark III , was also similar to the Mark I , aside from being larger than any of the preceding variants . The circular cross section of the previous variants became more triangular and the 30 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) MK 108 cannon was replaced with six rockets of an unspecified type . Although the landing procedure was unchanged , a hatch was added on the side to provide for simpler pilot entry and exit .

 = Oecomys sydandersoni = 
 Oecomys sydandersoni is an arboreal species of rodent in the genus Oecomys . It lives in forest patches in a small area in eastern Bolivia . It is a medium @-@ sized species , weighing about 45 g ( 1 @.@ 6 oz ) , with mostly grayish and brownish fur and short and broad hindfeet with well @-@ developed pads . 
 First collected in 1964 , it was formally described in 2009 . The species may be most closely related to O. concolor and O. mamorae , which are distributed further north and south in South America . Among other characters , the three share a particular arrangement of the arteries of the head . Virtually nothing is known of its biology . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 An American Museum of Natural History expedition led by Sydney Anderson collected the first three specimens of Oecomys sydandersoni in 1964 and 1965 . The material was mentioned in passing in a report on the chiggers of the region and tentatively identified as O. concolor in publications of the 1990s . During studies in the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park ( NKMNP ) from 1997 to 2006 , Smithsonian zoologist Louise Emmons and coworkers obtained large series of Oecomys , including four species — Oecomys bicolor , Oecomys roberti , Oecomys <unk> , and a fourth species they could not identify to species level . In 2009 , Michael Carleton , Louise Emmons , and Guy Musser described the latter as a new species , Oecomys sydandersoni , referring to it the specimens collected in the 1960s and previously identified as O. concolor . They named the new species after Sydney Anderson in honor of his work on the Bolivian mammal fauna , including the first collection of O. sydandersoni . 
 Its closest relatives may be O. concolor from northern Amazonia , including northwestern Brazil , southern Venezuela , and eastern Colombia , and O. mamorae from Bolivia , Paraguay , nearby Brazil , and possibly northeastern Argentina . The three share a particular configuration of the arteries in the head known as the derived carotid arterial circulatory pattern , which is unique within the genus Oecomys , and a general similarity in other traits . However , O. sydandersoni differs from the other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters . Whether the three species are truly closely related needs to be determined using molecular data . 
 All three are part of the genus Oecomys , which includes about fifteen species distributed in rainforest habitats in South America and into southern Central America . Oecomys is one of the genera of the tribe Oryzomyini ( " rice rats " ) , a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species , and on higher taxonomic levels is classified in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents . 
 = = Description = = 
 Oecomys sydandersoni is medium @-@ sized for its genus , being larger than , for example , O. bicolor , but smaller than O. concolor and O. mamorae . Its short , soft , and fine fur is bright ochraceous brown to pale tawny on the upperparts , changing moderately abruptly into the generally gray underparts . The fur on the chin , throat , and part of the belly is entirely white . The head is more grayish than the rest of the upperparts and the eyelids are black . Short hairs thinly cover the external ears , which are brown to gray @-@ brown in color . The short and broad hindfeet are dirty white and show some characters that are typical of the genus , including well @-@ developed pads and tufts of hair on the digits and a long fifth digit . The tail is slightly longer than the head and body on average , but relatively short for the genus . It is uniformly brown , but with a somewhat paler portion below near its base . Sparsely haired , the tail ends in a rudimentary pencil . There is no evidence for sexual dimorphism . 
 The skull shows a short front part ( rostrum ) and a broad interorbital region ( located between the eyes ) . The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves . The incisive foramina , which perforate the front part of the palate , are very broad and extend between the first molars . The zygomatic plates , the flattened anterior portions of the zygomatic arches ( cheekbones ) , are expansive and show well @-@ developed notches at their front ends . The palate itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars . The posterolateral palatal pits , located near the third molars , are well developed . The mesopterygoid fossa , the opening behind the end of the palate , is rounded at the frond and broad . An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present , separating two foramina ( openings ) , the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory @-@ buccinator foramen . The roof of the tympanic cavity , the tegmen tympani , is small . 
 The upper incisors are opisthodont , with the chewing edge located behind the vertical plane of the incisors . As is usual for the genus , the molars are brachyodont , low @-@ crowned , and bunodont , with the cusps higher than the connecting crests , and accessory crests such as mesolophs are present . On the upper first molar , the frontmost cusp , the anterocone , is divided into two small cusps in young individuals , connected by a crest , but the two fuse with wear . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 O. sydandersoni is known from the departments of Beni and Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia , including the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park ( NKMNP ) , where the type locality is located . All but a few specimens come from pockets of woodland in seasonally flooded grasslands , where it is the most frequently encountered rodent ; the related oryzomyine Hylaeamys <unk> , the spiny rat <unk> longicaudatus , and the opossum Marmosa <unk> were found in the same habitat . It is absent in other , more contiguous forests and in other grasslands without large forest patches . Thus , O. sydandersoni is a narrow habitat specialist with a limited distribution . It joins several other species with restricted ranges found in the NKMNP , including Hylaeamys <unk> , the <unk> rodents <unk> <unk> and J. <unk> , and an opossum , <unk> <unk> . 
 All specimens from the NKMNP were caught above the ground in vegetation , suggesting that the species is arboreal like the other members of its genus . The <unk> Eutrombicula <unk> has been found on O. sydandersoni . Nothing else is known about ecology , behavior , diet , reproduction , or conservation status . 
 = Woolwich Ferry = 
 The Woolwich Ferry is a free vehicle ferry service across the River Thames in East London , connecting Woolwich to the south with North Woolwich to the north . It is licensed and financed by London River Services , the maritime arm of Transport for London ( TfL ) . The service is operated by Briggs Marine under licence from TfL and carries both foot passengers and vehicles . Around two million passengers use the ferry each year . 
 There has been a ferry operating in Woolwich since the 14th century , and commercial crossings operated intermittently until the mid @-@ 19th century . The free service opened in 1889 , following the abolition of tolls across bridges to the west of London . Traffic increased in the 20th century owing to the rise in motor vehicle use , and because of the lack of nearby fixed crossings of the Thames it has remained popular , although pedestrian use has dropped as a result of the construction of a parallel foot tunnel and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway through to Woolwich Arsenal station . Alternatives such as the Thames Gateway Bridge and the Gallions Reach Crossing have been proposed as replacements , but there are no immediate plans to discontinue the Woolwich Ferry as long as there is a demand . 
 = = Services = = 
 The service links Woolwich in the Royal Borough of Greenwich with North Woolwich in the London Borough of Newham . It also links two ends of the inner London orbital road routes : the North Circular and the South Circular . 
 On weekdays , the ferry operates from 6 @.@ 10 am until 8 pm with a two @-@ boat service ( 10 minutes nominal interval between sailings ) ; on Saturdays , from 6 @.@ 10 am to 8 pm with a one @-@ boat service ( 15 minutes nominal interval ; the last south @-@ to @-@ north sailing is 15 minutes earlier at 7 @.@ 45 pm ) ; on Sundays , from 11 @.@ 30 am to 7 @.@ 30 pm with a one @-@ boat service ( last south @-@ to @-@ north sailing at 7 @.@ 15 pm ) . The ferries can carry heavy goods vehicles and other road traffic across the river , up to a maximum height of 4 @.@ 7 metres ( 15 ft ) and width of 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) . The service is free for all traffic ; in 2012 Transport for London ( TfL ) estimated a subsidy cost of <unk> per passenger . 
 = = = Nearest alternative crossings = = = 
 The nearest alternative crossing for pedestrians is the Woolwich foot tunnel that runs parallel to the ferry . A Docklands Light Railway ( DLR ) station , Woolwich Arsenal on the south side of the Thames , was opened in January 2009 as the new terminus of the London City Airport branch . King George V DLR station , on the opposite side of the river , is close to the north ferry dock . 
 The nearest vehicle alternatives are the Blackwall Tunnel about two miles ( 3 km ) upstream to the west , or the Dartford Crossing around ten miles ( 16 km ) downstream to the east . Both tunnels have height restrictions for heavy goods vehicles , and users of the Dartford Crossing incur toll charges . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early services = = = 
 There has been a connection between what is now Woolwich and North Woolwich across the Thames since the Norman Conquest . The area was mentioned in Domesday Book as 63 acres ( 25 ha ) belonging to Hamon , the dapifer ( steward ) , " which belong to ( pertinent in ) Woolwich " ; the " pertinent " here refers to the portion of land north of the Thames yet also part of the county of Kent . State papers in 1308 show that a service was running between North Woolwich and Warren Lane . That year , William de <unk> sold the business to William atte Halle for £ 10 . The ferry was subsequently sold in 1320 for 100 silver marks . 
 Cross @-@ river traffic increased following the establishment of the Royal Arsenal in 1671 . To enable movement of troops and supplies , the army established its own ferry in 1810 . The following year an Act of Parliament established a commercial ferry company , but it was dissolved in 1844 . In 1846 the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway extended its lines to include a Thames wharf branch ; eventually three steam ferries operated , but they proved inadequate to meet the growing demand . In October 1880 a public meeting was held in Woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam @-@ ferry service , but the cost was seen as prohibitive . 
 Following the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works , which had taken over toll bridges in west London and opened them to free public use , it was suggested that the Board should fund a free crossing of the Thames in east London . Proposals were made to provide services at Woolwich and further upstream at Greenwich , but the latter plan was abandoned . In 1884 the Board agreed to provide two steam @-@ powered ferries , each costing £ 10 @,@ 650 , and asked chief engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette to lead design and construction . In September 1887 Messrs Mowlem and company were awarded contracts valued at £ 54 @,@ 900 to build approaches , bridges and pontoons . 
 = = = Modern service = = = 
 The service was officially opened on 23 March 1889 , with the paddle steamer Gordon . Two days before the first service , the Metropolitan Board of Works was replaced by the London County Council ( LCC ) , and the opening ceremony was conducted by Lord Rosebery instead of the expected Bazalgette . The sister vessel , Duncan was introduced on 20 April . 
 By the end of the 1920s the rise in motor traffic had put pressure on the ferry 's capacity . A proposed bridge between Shooter 's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious a target for wartime bombings , and a third vessel was introduced instead . Because of the lack of a fixed crossing , the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London , who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river , including the Woolwich Ferry . The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream . 
 By the 1950s it was still quicker for ferry traffic to divert via the Blackwall Tunnel even with all three vessels operating at full capacity . In April 1963 the ferry service was upgraded to a Roll On Roll Off model , reducing waiting times on the approach roads . The LCC continued to operate the ferry until it was replaced by the Greater London Council ( GLC ) on 31 March 1965 . In 1964 Marples Ridgeway and Partners started building the current reinforced concrete terminals , which can operate over a 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) tidal range . The three ferries in use today were built in 1963 and the current terminals were opened in 1966 . 
 After the abolition of the GLC in 1986 the responsibility for operating the service was transferred to the Secretary of State for Transport , who contracted the then London Borough of Greenwich to run the service . Asset ownership and operating rights were subsequently transferred to Transport for London ( TfL ) on the establishment of the Greater London Authority , but the London Borough of Greenwich continued to operate the ferry on behalf of TfL . 
 In March 2008 the London Borough of Greenwich gave TfL notice that it would cease operating the service from 30 September 2008 . On 12 September TfL announced that the outsourcing group Serco would take over the operation of the service from 1 October 2008 ; the contract ran initially until 31 March 2010 . In December 2012 control of the crossing passed from Serco to Briggs Marine , who were expanding into public passenger services . The company was awarded a £ 50 million 7 @-@ year contract , which began in April 2013 .

 On 3 August 2011 a 19 @-@ year @-@ old ferry worker died after falling off the boat into the river Thames . The <unk> report published in August 2012 blamed " <unk> working practices " during the unmooring operation for the death .

 The first ferries were the side @-@ loading paddle steamers Gordon , Duncan and Hutton , named after General Gordon of Khartoum , Colonel Francis Duncan MP and Professor Charles Hutton . Each was powered by a condensing engine manufactured by John <unk> & Son of Greenwich producing 100 nominal horsepower . 
 The initial fleet was eventually replaced , starting in 1923 with The Squire ( named after William Squires , a former mayor of Woolwich ) , and in 1930 with the Will Crooks ( Labour MP for Woolwich , 1903 – 21 ) and the John Benn ( Sir John was a member of London County Council , Liberal MP for Wapping , and grandfather of Tony Benn ) . 
 The current three vessels were built in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers , and were each named after prominent local politicians : John Burns , Ernest Bevin and James Newman ( Newman was mayor of Woolwich , 1923 – 25 ) . These ferries feature Voith @-@ Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability . A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end , and each is driven by a <unk> 7 @-@ cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine . In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme , showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels . 
 = = Passenger numbers = = 
 The ferry typically attracts about two million passengers a year ; occupants of vehicles ( including drivers ) are counted as passengers . Ferry patronage is still high for vehicles , but has fallen away to minimal numbers for foot passengers . In 2012 the ferry carried around 20 @,@ 000 vehicles and 50 @,@ 000 passengers weekly . 
 At all times of day , but particularly at peak hours , it is common for vehicles to have to queue beyond the next ferry departure . Several rearrangements and improvements have been made to the vehicle queueing arrangements over the years , especially to avoid impact on other local traffic . 
 For foot passengers , bus services converge on both terminals . There is a small bus station on the north side , but some cross @-@ river foot passengers take the foot tunnel instead . About 300 foot passengers used the ferry daily between 1983 and 1985 . Further competition arrived in 2009 with the extension to Woolwich of the Docklands Light Railway , which crosses under the river to the east of the crossing and the tunnel . 
 = = Future = = 
 The ferry service provides one of the few available crossings of the River Thames east of London . Although there are seventeen river crossings in the 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of Tower Bridge , there are only three the same distance east . As long as there is a demand for a vehicle ferry it is unlikely to be discontinued , and it would require changing an 1885 Act of Parliament to do so . 
 In 2004 planning applications were submitted for a new bridge , the Thames Gateway Bridge , close to the location of the Woolwich Ferry . However the project was cancelled in 2008 . In 2012 , the Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , announced the Gallions Reach Crossing , a replacement ferry service running further east from Beckton to Thamesmead expected to open in 2017 . The option of a bridge is still popular , with an alternative option of a tunnel in the area . TfL planning director Richard de <unk> has said that the ferry will continue to operate as long as there are no alternatives , and there are no current plans to discontinue the service . 
 Tolls cannot be levied on the ferry without changing the 1885 Act of Parliament . However , it is possible that the service may eventually be tolled in conjunction with other projects such as the Gallions Reach Crossing , which is likely to be tolled itself .

 = Jones v Kaney = 
 Jones v Kaney [ 2011 ] <unk> 13 is a 2011 decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on whether expert witnesses retained by a party in litigation can be sued for professional negligence , or whether they have the benefit of immunity from suit . The case involved a psychologist ( Kaney ) instructed as an expert witness in a personal injury claim , who was said to have negligently signed a statement of matters agreed with the expert instructed by the opposing side , in which she made a number of concessions that weakened the claim considerably . As a result , according to the injured claimant ( Jones ) , he had to settle the claim for much less than he would have obtained had his expert not been careless . To succeed in the claim , he had to overturn an earlier Court of Appeal decision that had decided that preparation of a joint statement with the other side 's expert was covered by immunity from suit . Kaney therefore succeeded in getting the claim struck out before trial on an application heard by Mr Justice Blake in the High Court of Justice . The judge issued a certificate allowing the claimant to " leapfrog " the Court of Appeal and go straight to the Supreme Court to appeal against his decision . 
 The Supreme Court , by a majority of five to two , decided that expert witnesses were not immune in the law of England and Wales from claims in tort or contract for matters connected with their participation in legal proceedings . This reversed a line of authority dating back 400 years . The case considered the narrow issue , namely whether preparation of a joint statement by experts was immune from suit , and the wider public policy issue of whether litigants should be able to sue experts that they had instructed for breach of duty . There was discussion about whether removing the immunity would have a " chilling effect " on the willingness of experts to participate in court proceedings , although judges on both sides of the decision agreed that there was no empirical evidence on the point . Lord Phillips , a member of the majority , compared the situation of expert witnesses with that of advocates , on the basis that both owed duties to clients and to the court . Advocates ' immunity from claims in negligence had been removed in 2001 in Hall v Simons . The change , he said , had not led to an increase in vexatious claims or a reduction in the performance of duties owed by advocates to the court . Lord Hope , in the minority , said that experts and advocates had different functions and so disagreed with the comparison . He also pointed out that English law would now be different from Scots law on this issue . 
 The judgment has been called a " landmark ruling " by the Law Society Gazette , with lawyers saying that the decision was expected but long overdue . One barrister , Clare Montgomery QC , looked at the implications for other participants in the legal process , commenting that the " process of whittling away the scope of the immunity " that they have " appears to be far from over " . Other commentators were concerned that the decision would lead to reduction in the number of expert witnesses prepared to become involved with some particularly sensitive areas , such as child abuse cases . Lady Hale , the other dissenting judge , said that changing the law in this way was " irresponsible " and said that the position should instead be considered by the Law Commission and Parliament . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2001 , the claimant ( Paul Jones ) was involved in a road traffic accident and later brought a claim for damages for physical and psychiatric injury . His solicitors instructed the defendant , Dr Sue Kaney ( a consultant clinical psychologist ) , in 2003 to advise and report on the claim . She expressed her initial view was that he was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . However , the view taken by the psychiatrist instructed by the insurers defending the claim was that Jones was exaggerating the effects of his physical injuries , either consciously or unconsciously . The two experts held a discussion in November 2005 to see what if any agreement they could reach . The joint statement signed by both experts after the discussion showed that Kaney had conceded ground on a number of issues , weakening the claim considerably . She agreed that the claimant 's psychological reaction was only an adjustment reaction , not PTSD , and she further stated that Jones had been " very deceptive and deceitful in his reporting " , suggesting that he might be consciously giving incorrect information to the experts . 
 Jones 's solicitors asked why she had changed her views so completely . According to the allegations made in the subsequent claim for damages against her , she had felt under pressure to agree the wording of the document although it did not represent what she had agreed during the discussion and did not represent her true view , which was that Jones had had PTSD and had only been evasive not deceptive . The personal injury claim was subsequently settled without a trial . 
 In 2009 , Jones brought a claim for damages for professional negligence against Kaney , on the basis that the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views . Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence , on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side 's expert witness . 
 The application succeeded before Mr Justice Blake , sitting in the High Court . He granted a certificate under section 12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1969 , allowing the claimant to " leapfrog " the Court of Appeal and proceed directly to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , who ( unlike the Court of Appeal ) would have power to overrule the decision in Stanton if it was wrong . He took the view that there was a " substantial likelihood " that Stanton would be overturned by the Supreme Court , on the basis that " a policy of blanket immunity for all witnesses , indiscriminately protecting witnesses as to fact and witnesses on the opposing side from expert witnesses retained by a party to advise them before and during the proceedings as to a pertinent issue in those proceedings , may well prove to be too broad to be sustainable and therefore disproportionate . " 
 = = Judgment = = 
 The appeal was heard by seven of the Justices of the Supreme Court : Lord Phillips , the President of the Court ; Lord Hope , the Deputy President ; Lady Hale ; Lord Brown ; Lord Collins ; Lord Kerr ; and Lord Dyson . The decision to allow Jones 's appeal against the strike @-@ out order was reached by a majority of five to two , with Lord Hope and Lady Hale dissenting . The Supreme Court normally sits with a panel of five Justices , but may sit with more when the case is of " great public importance " . 
 = = = Majority views = = = 
 Lord Phillips said that the appeal raised the " narrow issue " of whether " the act of preparing a joint witness statement is one in respect of which an expert witness enjoys immunity from suit " , and the broader issue of whether " public policy justifies conferring on an expert witness any immunity from liability in negligence in relation to the performance of his duties in that capacity . " He said that it was surprising that the immunity had simply been accepted in the past and never challenged . He noted that the immunity dated back to Cutler v Dixon in 1585 , over 400 years ago , before English tort law developed the modern law of negligence . It was originally a complete protection for witnesses against claims for defamation , before developing to cover protection from other tort claims . He noted that it was difficult to draw the line at present between expert assistance that was immune from claim and that which was not : it might be that the earlier advice was negligent , not the evidence given in court <unk> from that earlier advice , even if it was the later developments about which the client complained . 
 He said that there were three justifications for the immunity given in the caselaw and in argument . Firstly , there was the " chilling effect " of such claims , making witnesses reluctant to give frank evidence or to provide expert evidence at all ; secondly , the risk that an expert witness would be reluctant to comply with his paramount duty to the court if to do so involved giving evidence contrary to his client 's interest with a risk of being sued for doing so . Thirdly , it was " undesirable " that a court hearing a claim for negligence against an expert witness should have to decide whether the court that decided the claim in which the expert gave evidence reached the correct decision . This argument was not at the forefront of the defendant 's arguments , but was one that Lord Phillips said should not be wholly discounted . He noted that a claim based on an alleged wrongful conviction as the result of an expert 's negligence would be struck out as an abuse of process unless the conviction had been overturned , under the rule in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police . 
 Lord Phillips noted that expert witnesses ( unlike witnesses giving evidence of facts ) had volunteered to give evidence and were doing so for payment . He saw " no justification " for the assumption that experts would be discouraged from providing their services if they could be sued . As for the effect on an expert 's willingness to give frank evidence , there was no empirical evidence either way , he said . However , a witness of integrity would concede a change of view where necessary to do so and ought not to be concerned about being sued . 
 He noted that Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons ( 2001 ) had said that a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence , only a duty to tell the truth , but he considered that to be incorrect , since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts . The expert would have a contract with the client in which he agreed to perform the duties that he owed to the court , and so there was no conflict between the two duties . In this respect , expert witnesses were more like advocates , who owed duties to client and court , than to witnesses of fact . He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons . Removing their immunity , he said , had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court , and it would be " mere conjecture " to assume that this would be any different for expert witnesses . Neither had vexatious claims been a problem for barristers – in any event , the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles , both procedural and financial , in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making <unk> claims against an expert . As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were " immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings " , he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty ( but not defamation ) should be abolished . 
 Lord Brown concurred . He said that " the gains to be derived from denying [ expert witnesses ] immunity from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this " , since a potential liability would lead to a " sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their client ’ s case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date . " He thought that this was a " healthy development " . It would also ensure that a client who was caused loss by an expert witness acting in " an egregious manner " would receive a proper remedy ; he said that such cases were likely to be " highly exceptional " . Lord Collins , agreeing , noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis @-@ a @-@ vis the opposing litigant , where there were " wider considerations of policy " against allowing claims . He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a liability to their clients for breach of duty would have a chilling effect on experts ' willingness to give evidence . Lord Kerr , who also agreed with the decision , said that if " an expert expresses an honestly held view , even if it differs from that which he may have originally expressed , provided it is an opinion which is tenable , he has nothing to fear from a disgruntled party . "

 Lord Hope said that there was " a formidable body of authority which should not be lightly disregarded " in favour of the immunity . He emphasised that the rule was not there to protect the incompetent expert witness , but ensure that witnesses were not deterred from coming forward and giving evidence without facing allegations afterwards in attempt to obtain damages from them . He was concerned by the lack of evidence either way as to whether an exception to the rule in Watson was needed or the consequences of introducing such an exception , particularly as the effect of the decision of the majority was to remove the immunity with retrospective effect , and there was " no way back " from this without legislation . The " need for certainty " made it necessary to extend the rule to all witnesses , in his view , even though some genuine claims may be barred as a result . He was particularly concerned that an " incautious " removal of the immunity from experts " risks destabilising the protection that is given to witnesses generally " , adding that the approach of Lord Phillips contained " seeds ... for challenging the whole concept of witness immunity . " 
 Lord Hope disagreed with the principles and analogies relied upon by the majority . Of the principle that " where there is a wrong there must be a remedy " , he said that the policy decision to protect witnesses from litigation had been taken some time ago , without anything being said to cast doubt on the policy choice . He also asked how the rule could be altered to allow negligence claims but not defamation claims , since if there was a well @-@ founded defamation claim barred by witness immunity then a wrong would have been done without remedy in that instance . He said that advocates and experts performed different functions and so it could not be assumed that the fact that advocates ' immunity had been removed without difficulty would mean that immunity could be removed from experts without any problems . He was more impressed with the difficulties about where to draw the line if the claim was allowed to proceed than the argument that there would be a " chilling effect " on the availability of witnesses , wondering what the impact would be for experts involved in criminal proceedings or family cases involving children . He wondered whether a company director , owing a duty of care to the company , would face removal of the immunity if making an " inexcusable error " when giving evidence on the company 's behalf . Overall , he considered that the matter was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission . He furthermore noted that the decision in Watson remained binding in Scots law , in preference to the decision in Jones ( since Jones only concerned the law of England and Wales ) , adding that the issue ought also to be considered by the Scottish Law Commission . 
 Lady Hale was also concerned about the ramifications of the decision . She asked if a doctor treating a patient after an accident and giving evidence about what happened as well as his opinions as to what would happen would be covered or not , or whether only in part . She noted that the ruling in the case would have to apply to experts dealing with cases before tribunals as well as courts , thus including claims for unfair dismissal before employment tribunals and disputes between landlord and tenants about service charges and rent assessments . She queried whether it ought to extend to psychiatrists assessing patients for tribunal proceedings under the Mental Health Act 1983 , or educational psychologists giving evidence about children with special educational needs in tribunal proceedings about their future education . In her view , these are " sensitive and often highly fraught cases in which performing the expert 's duty to the tribunal may well be perceived by the client patient or parent as a breach of her duty towards him . " In family law cases , she said , there would now be some professional witnesses who had immunity from negligence claims for their evidence and others who did not , with some of the distinctions between the two groups appearing to be " arbitrary " . She thought that the decision might make experts more likely to confirm their previous views rather than change them , and could lead to higher insurance premiums for experts , increased fees and the use of exemption clauses in contracts – " in which case we shall be back where we started " , she said . Overall , she called the decision to change the law " irresponsible " and , like Lord Hope , considered that the topic was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission .

 The Supreme Court 's conclusions were described by newspapers and legal magazines as " a landmark ruling " , an " historic decision " , and as a " major victory " for the lawyers acting for the claimant . The Lawyer magazine said that the ruling " professionalised the expert witness industry " . In similar vein , one legal training consultant said that it " marked the end of the amateur expert " , but that " only wimps will withdraw " from giving expert evidence . One of the lawyers involved in the case , Daniel Shapiro , predicted that it would lead to between five and ten claims against experts in the following year . 
 A solicitor working in the field of professional negligence claims , Ian McConkey , said to insurance magazine Post Online that the result had been " widely expected " . McConkey urged the insurance industry to " take stock " of the decision and consider the terms on which cover was offered to experts . Another lawyer was quoted by the Law Society Gazette as saying the decision was long overdue , but unlikely to lead to experts becoming reluctant to take on claims , since they could limit their liability in their terms of engagement . 
 The barrister Clare Montgomery QC of Matrix Chambers considered the wider implications of the decision , wondering whether it might lead to claims against other participants in the legal process being allowed . She asked rhetorically if a police officer who owed a duty of care to an individual might now be liable when giving evidence or making a statement that was a breach of that duty . " The process of whittling away the scope of the immunity available to protect the participants in judicial processes appears to be far from over " , she said . Penny Cooper , a professor at the City Law School in London , was concerned about a " lack of clarity " in the decision about who else apart from experts could be sued as a result , and commented that the witness box had now become " an even more scary place to be " . 
 Some lawyers were concerned about the impact of the ruling on the willingness of experts to act , particularly in court cases involving allegations of child abuse . The chairman of the Expert Witness Institute , James Badenoch QC , told The Independent on Sunday that he was worried about experts being " frightened off " by the prospects of claims against them in such cases . Peter Garsden , a solicitor who is president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers , called the decision " horrifying " , adding that he already found it difficult to find expert witnesses and the " fear of litigation " could have " a drastic effect " on his firm 's work . 
 Writing in the New Law Journal , Chris Pamplin called the decision " unprincipled " and argued that the decision " threatens the very foundation of witness immunity " , based on an out @-@ of @-@ date view of the expert witness as a " hired gun " . Pamplin 's view was that the majority had " ignored the fundamental difference " between experts and advocates , saying that advocates had no choice but to continue in the legal system whereas experts could continue their ordinary work without needing to carry on as an expert witness . Therefore , experts would be more likely to abandon such work than advocates , making them more vulnerable to vexatious litigation . However , he said it would make " little immediate difference " for many experts , since " conscientious professionals " would have little worry about being found negligent and would have insurance in case they were . The ruling would also help develop a " professional class of expert " , making it less likely that people would contribute expertise occasionally , and although a professional expert witness would have a better knowledge of their role and duties , this would be at the expense of " freshness and challenge to dogma " .
