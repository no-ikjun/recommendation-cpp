 Although Hurricane Marco never made landfall , it was a large storm with an unusual and erratic path and as a result , caused heavy rainfall throughout Central America and the western Caribbean nations . In the Dominican Republic , three people drowned north of Santo Domingo , while 200 families fled their homes during the flooding . Marco also contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica , which had already caused a total of $ 3 million in damage to roads and left 170 families without shelter . After significant damage from Hurricane Lili in the previous month , minimal effects occurred in Cuba . Large amounts of precipitation also fell across Cuba , especially on the Isle of Youth and in Pinar del Río Province . Heavy rains caused thousands to flee their homes . However , damage in the country , if any is unknown . 
 Torrential rainfall in Honduras caused flooding , which forced 60 @,@ 000 people from their homes . In addition , 4 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed and 40 wooden bridges were washed away . Roads were significantly affected , with six roads and the national highway damaged in Cortés Department . Damage to the highway infrastructure totaled to approximately $ 500 @,@ 000 . Television broadcast images from La Lima showed houses submerged to their roofs . Flood waters also inundated nearly 50 @,@ 000 acres of banana and fruit plantations owned by Chiquita Brands International . Other crops that sustained damage were maize , beans , sorghum , and rice . Agricultural losses associated with the storm totaled to approximately $ 7 @.@ 7 million . Along the Caribbean coastline of Honduras , about 1 @,@ 000 shanty houses were destroyed . Overall , Marco caused nine fatalities in the country . In the Pacific and northern regions of Nicaragua , numerous houses washed away in the floods . In addition , Nicaraguan civil defense authorities reported two fatalities . Further north in Guatemala , at least one death occurred , and flood waters damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes . Swollen rivers in Costa Rica flooded several towns and numerous banana plantations . 
 During its formative stage , a high pressure area combined with the low pressure of Marco resulted in a tight pressure gradient which led to beach erosion and gale force winds on the Florida coast . In Broward , Miami @-@ Dade , and Palm Beach counties , heavy surf generated by the combination of those systems caused 15 to 30 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 to 9 @.@ 1 m ) of beach erosion . Additionally , 3 to 4 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 to 1 @.@ 22 m ) of top sand were lost in that region . Further north , severe beach erosion caused the loss of as much as 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) of the dune line in Brevard , Indian River , St. Lucie , and Martin counties . Other impact was minimal . Marco was one of few hurricanes to enter the Caribbean Sea and not make landfall . Also , Hurricane Hunter flights recorded volatile center structure with severe turbulence , extreme rainfall , and hail during a flight into the storm . Overall , Marco caused 14 fatalities and approximately $ 8 @.@ 2 million in damage . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While Marco was still spinning in the western Caribbean , the Government of Honduras allotted 70 million HNL ( $ 5 @.@ 6 million 1996 USD ) in emergency assistance . Following the storm , several countries contributed cash toward the recovery of Honduras , including : Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Norway , Spain , the United Kingdom , and the United States ; cash donations collectively totaled slightly more than $ 438 @,@ 000 . In addition , the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs contributed an emergency grant , worth $ 10 @,@ 000 . Japan donated 40 tents , 10 water purifiers , 480 soaps , and 3 emergency health kits in lieu of money . Norway donated almost $ 71 @,@ 000 worth of food , medicines , and clothing . Spain also contributed medicine and transportation , costing $ 156 @,@ 250 . The United States donated plastic sheeting , water containers , and family food bags . The primary contributor of non @-@ government aid was the Red Cross . After the storm , the Red Cross set up temporary shelters in San Pedro Sula , Puerto Cortés , and El Progreso . Additionally , they distributed 3 @,@ 000 pounds of milk , clothing , 500 sheets , chlorine boxes , 14 @,@ 000 pounds of rice , 15 @,@ 000 pounds of beans and 9 @,@ 000 pounds of maize , sugar , and butter . 
 = BL 18 inch Mk I naval gun = 
 The BL 18 @-@ inch Mk I naval gun was a breech @-@ loading naval gun used by the Royal Navy during World War I. It was the largest and heaviest gun ever used by the British . Only the Second @-@ World @-@ War Japanese 40 cm / 45 Type 94 had a larger calibre , 18 @.@ 1 inches ( 46 cm ) , but the British shell was heavier . The gun was a scaled @-@ up version of the BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun and was developed to equip the " large light cruiser " ( a form of battlecruiser ) Furious . Three guns were built , but they did not see combat with Furious , before they were removed from her and transferred to the Lord Clive @-@ class monitors General Wolfe and Lord Clive for coast bombardment duties . Only 85 rounds were fired in anger before the war ended . All three were removed from service in 1920 and served as proving guns for cordite tests . Two were scrapped in 1933 and the last one survived until it was scrapped in 1947 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 The 18 @-@ inch gun had its genesis in the insistence of the First Lord of the Admiralty , Admiral Fisher , for the biggest possible gun mounted on the fastest possible ship . He conceived of what he called " large light cruisers " carrying four 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) guns , which became the Courageous class , but he wanted their half @-@ sister Furious to carry an even bigger gun . The Elswick Ordnance Company was the only company capable of manufacturing such a large gun and began design work in 1915 . It was designated as the " 15 @-@ inch B " to conceal its real size and was derived from the design of the 15 @-@ inch Mk I already in service . 
 The gun and its breech mechanism weighed a total of 149 long tons ( 151 t ) , almost half again as much as the 15 @-@ inch gun 's 100 long tons ( 102 t ) . It was mounted in a single @-@ gun turret , also designated as the 15 @-@ inch B , derived from the twin @-@ gun 15 @-@ inch Mark I / N turret . The barbettes of Furious were designed to accommodate either turret , in case problems arose with the 18 @-@ inch gun 's development . The gun could depress to − 3 ° and elevate to a maximum of 30 ° . Ammunition development for the gun was naturally focused on anti @-@ ship shells for Furious , and it fired a 3 @,@ 320 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 510 kg ) , 4 crh armour @-@ piercing , capped ( APC ) shell , at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 270 ft / s ( 690 m / s ) to a distance of 28 @,@ 900 yards ( 26 @,@ 400 m ) . It could fire one round per minute . The turret 's revolving mass was 826 long tons ( 839 t ) , only a slight 2 % more than the 810 long tons ( 823 t ) of its predecessor . 
 The guns proved to be too powerful for Furious ' light hull , and they became available for other uses during 1917 , after trials showed the ship could not handle the stress of firing . Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon , commander of the Dover Patrol , conceived a plan to mount two guns inside the shell of the Palace Hotel in Westende from where they could bombard the naval facilities at Zeebrugge and Bruges , provided that the hotel was captured during the upcoming Battle of Passchendaele . He planned to transport the guns across the English Channel lashed to the torpedo bulges of monitors . He also thought that they could be used on the decks of monitors and as such a dual purpose carriage was designed for the guns , which could be used both afloat and ashore . Only a limited amount of traverse was required for either role , but elevation had to be increased to 45 ° to maximize range . The concept was approved 23 September 1917 , and Elswick was ordered to design the new ' B CD ' mounts for delivery in five months . 
 The original concept for land use involved a special elevating slide that could traverse 6 ° to either side . Ammunition handling , elevation and ramming were to be done via hydraulic pump , but the breech was hand @-@ worked . The gun was to be installed in a turf @-@ covered concrete dome with a gunport for the barrel . As much as possible of the gun and its mount was designed to be assembled out of range of German artillery and then moved on a special broad @-@ gauge railway to the site on specially @-@ designed wheels . The transportable section weighed 210 long tons ( 213 t ) . 
 After the British Army failed to capture Westende , the mounting was optimised for use on a monitor . It was very simple , consisting of two large girders connected together at each end with the gun and its carriage between them . The mount could only traverse 10 ° inside its fixed , ½ -inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) gun shield and was aimed over the starboard side of the monitor . It was loaded at a fixed angle of 10 ° , but it could only fire between 22 ° and 45 ° to equalize the stresses on the carriage and the ship . It was provided with hydraulically powered cranes , loading tray , rammer and breech mechanism to minimize the crew 's workload , but the ammunition parties had to use muscle power . The shells were stowed below deck and had to be moved by overhead rail to the hatch in the deck behind the gun to be lifted up and loaded . The cordite propellant charges were kept in eighteen steam @-@ heated storage tanks mounted on the forecastle deck abaft the funnel and moved to the gun on a bogie mounted on rails , two one @-@ sixth charges at a time , which reduced the rate of fire to about one round about every 3 – 4 minutes . The monitors had to be extensively modified to handle the gun . Numerous additional structural supports had to be added underneath the gun to support its weight of 384 long tons ( 390 t ) ; the sides had to be plated in to accommodate the additional crewmen and the interior rearranged for the 18 – inch shells and the loading arrangements . 
 = = Service = = 
 A total of three guns were built by Armstrong Whitworth , two for Furious and a spare . The forward gun was removed from Furious in March 1917 , before she was completed , when she was ordered to be converted to a seaplane carrier . The second gun was removed later in 1917 , and she was converted into an aircraft carrier . The new ' B CD ' mounts were delayed , and the mount for Lord Clive @-@ class monitor General Wolfe was not delivered until 20 June 1918 . The gun from Furious ' ' A ' turret was lifted aboard on 9 July , but the General Wolfe was not ready to begin firing trials until 7 August . She was given the nickname of ' Elephant and Castle ' , as the enormous gun @-@ mount structure dominated the ship 's profile . 
 While the new mounting was being designed , further effort was put into the ammunition to extend the range as much as possible . Use of a <unk> , where one of the six charges was increased in weight to 165 pounds ( 74 @.@ 8 kg ) , making a total of 690 pounds ( 313 @.@ 0 kg ) propellant , and increasing the elevation to 45 ° extended the range to about 36 @,@ 900 yards ( 33 @,@ 700 m ) with the existing 4 crh shells . New 8 crh high explosive shells , with a longer , thinner ballistic cap , were ordered , but only two shells had been delivered before the end of the war . Some of the existing stock of 500 APC and 500 CPC ( common , pointed , capped ) shells on hand from Furious were modified with the new cap and were probably the only shells used during the war . 
 General Wolfe was assigned to the Dover Patrol on 15 August 1918 , but did not fire on any targets until 28 September , when a large force of monitors was gathered to harass German lines of communication . She was anchored bow and stern , broadside to her target , and had difficulties dealing with the tidal currents . She opened fire on the railway bridge at <unk> ( 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south of Ostend ) at a range of 36 @,@ 000 yards ( 32 @,@ 918 m ) and made naval history as the heaviest shell fired from the largest gun at the longest range in action to date . She fired 52 shells that day and found that the recoil from her 18 – inch gun moved her sideways with her shallow hull and also caused her to roll , which slowed her rate of fire . She fired a total of 81 rounds before the end of the war . 
 The second gun , Furious ' spare , was mounted in Lord Clive , but she was not ready for combat until 13 October 1918 . She fired three rounds the following day , but had to cease fire to avoid hitting friendly advancing troops . One round had already been loaded when the order came to cease fire so she fired it , with a reduced charge , into a minefield to seaward . A total of 85 18 @-@ inch shells were fired in action by both guns . Wear on General Wolfe 's gun was measured at about 0 @.@ 37 inch after firing 161 effective full charges ( EFC ) - 105 rounds including proof and practice , with 57 being <unk> . This indicates the gun would have been good for well over 300 EFC , comparable with most other British ordnance using Cordite MD . 
 The third gun , from Furious ' ' Y ' turret , was intended for Prince Eugene , which had been modified to accept it earlier in the year , but the war ended before it was mounted , although the monitor was ordered to Portsmouth to have it fitted on 19 October . The guns were removed from the monitors in December 1920 . Gun No. 1 , from Furious ' ' Y ' turret , was lined down to 16 inches ( 410 mm ) and used in cordite @-@ proving tests for the BL 16 @-@ inch Mk I gun , intended for the cancelled G3 battlecruisers , and used in the Nelson @-@ class battleships . It remained in use until 1942 and was scrapped in 1947 . The other two guns were used at Shoeburyness and <unk> artillery ranges in the Thames Estuary for similar duties ; they were scrapped in 1933 . 
 One mount survived and was used to mount a spare BL 14 @-@ inch Mk VII gun from the battleship King George V. It was emplaced near Dover in 1940 , and the combination was named " Pooh " , after Winnie @-@ the @-@ Pooh .

 Ashland Community and Technical College ( ACTC ) , located in Ashland , Kentucky , United States , is one of 16 two @-@ year , open @-@ admissions colleges of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System ( KCTCS ) . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1936 , with the Ashland Independent School District 's Board of Education and first term Governor Happy Chandler 's support , Ashland Oil and Refining Company founder and CEO Paul G. Blazer and Ashland attorney John T. Diederich , a leading Republican figure in the state , lobbied for the expansion of Kentucky State tax legislation ( KRS 165 ) for municipal colleges and the associated passage of Ashland 's local school tax . With the legislative leadership of State Senator Dr. H. S. Swope of Ashland and State Representative Ira W. See of Louisa , the act was passed by the Kentucky General Assembly in December 1936 . In November 1937 , Ashland was the first and only municipality to take advantage of the expanded tax legislation to establish a junior college . 
 A holding company , known as the Ashland Junior College Corporation , formed by the board of education in 1937 , purchased the First M.E. Church 's vacated property on the corner of 15th Street and Central Avenue for $ 39 @,@ 000 in downtown Ashland . The church had bought the property for $ 163 @,@ 000 in 1925 , before the Great Depression of 1929 . 
 The Ashland Junior College was founded in 1938 to allow students the opportunity to obtain an associate degree or to complete their first two years of a bachelor 's degree . During the same year , the Ashland Vocational School was created by the Ashland Independent School system , providing vocational and technical training . 
 Dr. Herbert C. Hazel was elected dean of the Ashland Junior College in June 1938 . A rate of $ 3 per semester hour for tuition for part @-@ time students was set that year . Classes began September 14 , 1938 . 
 Within a few months of opening , the library had 2 @,@ 200 volumes and the college became a member of the Kentucky Association Colleges and Secondary Schools and the American Association of Junior Colleges . Paul and Georgia Blazer established the Ashland Junior College Loan Fund in 1938 and s second loan fund known as the Ashland Business Men 's Association Loan Fund was also established that year . The number of students enrolled the first year totaled 194 with four graduates . 
 During the 1942 @-@ 1943 year , the center had two publications , " The Portico " , the college annual , and the " Pony Prints " , the student newspaper published twice monthly . " Pony Prints " was preceded by the publication of " The Quest " during the first year . 
 Due to World War II , only eight students graduated from the college in 1944 . That was the year , however , that the first summer session opened for registration . The new school paper , " The Beacon " noted that year that the college had 191 representatives in the armed forces . The influx of veterans following the war raised enrollment to new heights when an increase of 42 per cent enrollment was recorded in 1945 . By 1946 the total number of students was 440 ; however enrollment figures soon leveled off . Library volumes on file that year totaled 6 @,@ 132 . I n 1948 an amendment was added to the H.S. Swope Act raising the limits of tuition for the college from $ 100 to $ 200 per semester . Accordingly , the tuition was raised from $ 45 to $ 80 per semester . 
 The student council , composed of a president and three members from each class , was organized in 1953 . In support of the United States Supreme Court 's 1954 " Brown vs. Board of Education " ruling ending segregation in schools , integration of the college began in 1955 with the enrollment of several graduates of the Booker T Washington High School in Ashland . 
 In June 1957 , representing the Ashland Independent School District 's Board of Education , Paul Blazer and Ashland attorney Henderson <unk> , a University of Kentucky Law School graduate , presented a proposal to President Frank G. Dickey and the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees for the University to take over the day @-@ to @-@ day operations and curriculum of the Ashland [ municipal ] Junior College . The Ashland Center of the University of Kentucky became the second University of Kentucky extension center . 
 Details of the planned relationship were contained in the agreement signed by the Ashland Board of Education and the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees . By this agreement the university would provide a course of study and administration which would be comparable to that of the university at Lexington and for which the students would receive the same credit as the students in Lexington . The Ashland Board of Education was to provide the buildings , land , equipment and facilities . All other expenses , including teacher salaries were to be paid by the University of Kentucky . 
 The Northern Extension Center of the University of Kentucky had been founded in Covington in 1948 . After Ashland , with the continued support of second term Governor Happy Chandler , President Dickey further expanded the program by developing University of Kentucky Extension Centers in Fort Knox ( 1958 ) , Cumberland ( 1960 ) , and Henderson ( 1960 ) . 
 Authorized by the Kentucky General Assembly and signed by Governor Bert Combs on March 6 , 1962 , a mandate was placed upon the University of Kentucky to form a community college system . Two years later , the Board of Trustees implemented the legislation and established the Community College System , <unk> the centers in Northern Kentucky , Ashland , Fort Knox , Cumberland , Henderson and creating a new campus in Elizabethtown . The Ashland Center of the University of Kentucky was renamed the Ashland Community College . 
 In 1968 , the UK Northern ( Covington ) Community College separated from the new system and became an autonomous four @-@ year college under the name Northern Kentucky State College . Ashland became the oldest campus in the Kentucky Community College system . 
 In 1970 , Ashland Community College relocated to the College Drive campus . 
 On July 1 , 1997 , the Ashland Technical College and the Ashland Community College began preparations to merge under the " Higher Education Act " , passed during a special session of the state legislature which also created the Kentucky Community and Technical College System ( KCTCS ) . In the following year , in January 1998 , the community college network in the commonwealth left the University of Kentucky to move to the new Kentucky Community and Technical College System . Five years later , on July 1 , 2003 , the Ashland Community & Technical College merged , consolidating functions . 
 In 2001 , ground was broken for a new campus for the Ashland Technical College in the <unk> Industrial Park along the Industrial Parkway , with funding allocated two years prior . The 43 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 4 @,@ 000 m2 ) . campus , referred to as the ' Ashland Community and Technical College Technology Drive Campus , was dedicated on December 19 , 2005 at a cost of $ 10 @.@ 4 million , although it did not open until August 16 , 2004 . An additional $ 18 million in funding was provided in 2005 for phase two , which will include housing for Culinary Arts , recreation areas , a small bookstore and administrative offices , and for phase three , which will include housing for shop areas for diesel , carpentry , auto mechanics and applied process technologies . 
 On February 21 , 2005 , ACTC signed into agreement with Marshall University to provide less costly opportunities for students in obtaining bachelor degrees . The program , dubbed the " two @-@ plus @-@ two " agreement , would allow students to take lower level courses at ACTC and the final two years at Marshall in Huntington , West Virginia . Although it was possible to receive a bachelor 's degree in management from Marshall 's Lewis College of Business , the agreement expanded the program to nine degrees in the business college . 
 Due to an aging facility , the Kentucky Community and Technical College System is currently requesting $ 20 million for the renovation of the College Drive campus , as well as an extra $ 5 million over the next two years when the Kentucky General Assembly meets in early 2008 . The campus would receive a new roof , new electrical wiring , new heating and air conditioning units , improved security features , improvements to parking lots , new paint , a refurbished science lab and new equipment .

 Three campuses encompass the ACTC system , the primary campus located on College Drive near downtown Ashland near 13th Street and is where business , education , health @-@ related , information technology and transfer programs are offered . The Roberts Drive campus , located at the southern edge of Ashland , offers several industrial technology degrees , such as Air Conditioning , Applied Process Technologies , Auto Mechanics , Computer Aided Drafting and Fire and Rescue Technology , and courses in Cosmetology and Culinary Arts . 
 The Roberts Drive campus will ultimately be replaced with the Technology Drive campus , located off of KY 67 ( Industrial Parkway ) at the <unk> industrial park , which offers numerous industrial technology degrees that often reflect the job stock in the Ashland region that include programs in industrial maintenance , machine tool technology , electrical technology and welding . In addition to technical programs offered at the Technology Drive Campus , it also serves as the home for the college 's Business and Industry Services .

 In 2004 , the Ashland Community and Technical College established the Fulfilling the Promise Campaign to set an endowment goal of $ 3 @.@ 2 million . The first major contribution was from Perry and Susan Madden in December 2006 , who donated the former Parsons Department Store building in downtown Ashland . The 89 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 8 @,@ 300 m2 ) . building , dating to 1926 , currently houses the Highlands Museum and Discovery Center and the upper four @-@ floors could be renovated for college classrooms and for a 500 @-@ seat convention center under a $ 10 million to $ 12 million program . The museum will continue to occupy the ground floor , mezzanine and basement . 
 On September 12 , 2007 , an anonymous gift of $ 1 million was made to the community college 's foundation to establish an endowed chair in mathematics and sciences . The endowed fund was designed to " reward and encourage outstanding math and science faculty in perpetuity " and it was the first gift of over $ 1 million that the college had received . Recipients will receive an annual cash reward of 2 % of the value of the endowment fund each year for a two @-@ year period , with an additional award recipient added each year . 
 As a result of the gift of $ 1 million , total endowment credited during the campaign was $ 5 @.@ 2 million . Other major gifts included funding of faculty and nursing classes at King 's Daughters Medical Center , the Booth Foundation , Saul and Harriett Kaplan Foundation scholarships , Lincoln and Katherine and Scott scholarships and partial funding of evening nursing classes at Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital .

 = Clara Elsene Peck = 
 Clara Elsene Peck ( April 18 , 1883 – February 1968 ) was an American illustrator and painter known for her illustrations of women and children in the early 20th century . Peck received her arts education from the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts and was employed as a magazine illustrator from 1906 @-@ 1940 . Peck 's body of work encompasses a wide range , from popular women 's magazines and children 's books , works of fiction , commercial art for products like Ivory soap , and comic books and watercolor painting later in her career . Peck worked during the " Golden Age of American Illustration " ( 1880s @-@ 1930s ) contemporaneous with noted female illustrators Jessie Willcox Smith , Elizabeth Shippen Green and Violet Oakley . 
 Peck 's work appeared in exhibitions from the Art Institute of Chicago to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts , and she received awards from the New York Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in the 1920s . Peck resided in an art colony in Leonia , New Jersey with her collaborator and husband , artist John Scott Williams . In the 1940s , Peck contributed to Catholic comic books distributed to parochial schools . She focused on watercolor painting in the 1950s and her work was exhibited in Europe and the United States . Her most notable illustrations and artwork were published in three books early in her career : Shakespeare 's Sweetheart ( 1905 ) , A Lady of King Arthur 's Court ( 1907 ) , and In the Border Country ( 1909 ) . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Clara Elsene Peck was born in Allegan , Michigan on April 18 , 1883 . Peck spent her youth in St. Paul , Minnesota and later studied art at the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts . She took classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where she studied under American Impressionist painter and teacher William Merritt Chase . Reminiscing about her early years , Peck said : " With me the desire to become an artist has been strong since childhood . Other members of the family in previous generations were artists , making the love and joy in creative expression a natural one to me . " 
 = = Marriage and later life = = 
 In 1906 , Peck married British @-@ born illustrator John Scott Williams ( 1877 – 1976 ) , and they produced two children together , <unk> and Conway . Peck and Williams shared similar styles , leading the two to occasionally collaborate on illustrations together . These works were signed with the first initials of their last names , " P W " . Some of Peck 's works are also credited as Clara Elsene Williams and the press sometimes referred to her as " Mrs. John Scott Williams . " 
 After illustrator Harvey Dunn founded the Leonia School of Illustration in Leonia , New Jersey in 1915 , Peck and Williams moved to an artist colony in Leonia , joining a group of about 90 professional artists . 
 They lived in a house originally built by artist Charles Harry Eaton ( American , 1850 – 1901 ) on Crescent Avenue and were neighbors with artist @-@ couple John Rutherford Boyd ( 1882 – 1951 ) and Harriet <unk> Boyd . The Boyds ' house became a community center of artistic gatherings where many of Leonia 's artists exhibited their works . The marriage between Peck and Williams came to an end , and J. Scott Williams remarried in 1930 . 
 Peck later resided in Brooklyn , New York and Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . Towards the end of her life , art historian Helen Teri Caro located Peck and acquired over 100 pieces of her artwork on behalf of the Glenbow Museum in Calgary , Alberta . Peck died in Gettysburg in February 1968 . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Illustration = = = 
 Peck 's career in illustration began in the early 1900s with her work for publisher George W. Jacobs in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . This was a period when technological innovations in halftone and color printing engendered the " Golden Age of Illustration " . In addition to illustrations , Peck created decorations and lettering designs for books . Notable works from this period include illustrations for Sara Hawks Sterling 's Shakespeare 's Sweetheart ( 1905 ) and A Lady of King Arthur 's Court ( 1907 ) , and Josephine <unk> Bacon 's In the Border Country ( 1909 ) . Peck eventually illustrated at least four additional books by Bacon . 
 By 1908 , Peck had designed her first cover for Collier 's . Peck began illustrating women 's magazines during the 1910s and 1920s , contributing to Cosmopolitan , Good Housekeeping , Ladies Home Journal , Today 's Housewife , and Household Magazine . Peck 's magazine illustrations appeared in St. Nicholas Magazine , The Century Magazine , The <unk> , the Pictorial Review , and the The Youth 's Companion . She contributed several cover illustrations to Theatre Magazine in the early 1920s and worked as a commercial artist on advertising campaigns for companies such as Procter & Gamble , Metropolitan Life , the Aeolian Company , and Ivory Soap . Peck also illustrated educational books , educational certificates , sheet music , fiction , and fairy tales . 
 Women and children in Peck 's work were depicted with great sensitivity in a wide variety of roles and responsibilities . Art historian and illustrator Walt Reed describes Peck 's style as " decorative in composition and sensitive in rendering " . Artistic themes found in Peck 's work include education , child psychology , and the expectant mother . The decorative style of the period was popularized by seminal American illustrator Howard Pyle and his female students . According to Elizabeth H. Hawkes , curator emeritus of the Delaware Art Museum , the style consisted of " using flat , brightly colored figures boldly outlined and placed against a patterned background . They incorporated elements of the popular 1890 's poster style and borrowed motifs from Walter Crane , Kate Greenaway , and the English Arts and Crafts movement style of illustration . " 
 Peck 's career in illustration was active from the " Golden Age of American Illustration " through the onset of the Great Depression when the careers of illustrators suffered due to the poor economy . The output of magazine illustrations from Peck continued until at least 1935 .

 = Foundation of Wallachia = 
 The foundation of Wallachia ( Romanian : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , that is the establishment of the first independent Romanian principality , was achieved at the beginning of the 14th century , through the unification of smaller political units that had existed between the Carpathian Mountains , and the Rivers Danube , Siret and <unk> . 
 Prior to the consolidation of Wallachia , waves of nomadic peoples – the last of them being the Cumans and the Mongols – rode across the territory . The territory became a frontier area between the Golden Horde ( the westernmost part of the Mongol Empire ) and the Kingdom of Hungary after 1242 . The Romanians in Muntenia , east of the Olt River , had to pay tribute to the Mongols ; and west of the river , in Oltenia , they were oppressed by the Bans of Severin , appointed by the Kings of Hungary . The Golden Horde ’ s domination decreased in the region at the end of the 13th century , and at that time the Kingdom of Hungary also underwent a strong political crisis . These events enabled the incipient states of the territory to consolidate their autonomy . 
 One Romanian tradition records that Wallachia was founded when a certain Radu Negru ( ‘ Radu the Black ’ ) arrived from the Făgăraș region in the 1290s after crossing the Transylvanian Alps with " a great many following him " . More credible is the report that some Romanian lords in the Olt and Argeș valleys chose as leader one of their number , a certain Basarab . 
 It was Voivode Basarab I ( c . 1310 – 1352 ) who broke off with the Kingdom of Hungary and refused to accept the king ’ s suzerainty . Basarab I received international support and the recognition of the autonomy of Wallachia due to his great military victory over King Charles I of Hungary ( 1301 – 1342 ) at Posada on November 12 , 1330 . The Metropolitan See of Wallachia , directly subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople , was set up during the reign of Basarab I ’ s son , Nicolae Alexandru ( 1352 – 1364 ) . The first silver and bronze coins were minted in Wallachia in 1365 . 
 = = Last centuries of the Early Middle Ages = = 
 Among the oldest attestations of the countries of the Vlachs ( early Romanians ) on the left side of the Danube , there is a quotation of a passage from an Armenian book of geography . The passage represents an interpolation , probably from the first centuries of the second millennium , which refers to an " unknown country called Balak " , situated in the neighborhood of the " Sarmatians ’ country " and of " <unk> " ( Bulgaria ) . Another 11th @-@ century reference to the Vlachs ’ country appears to be the section of the ancient Turkic chronicle <unk> ( ' Oghuz Khan 's Tale ' ) , preserved in a 17th @-@ century text , which narrates the battles of the Cumans against several peoples , including the Vlachs ( <unk> ) . 
 The Cumans , a Turkic tribe approached the Danube Delta shortly after 1064 – 1065 , and from 1068 the entire territory between the Aral Sea and the lower Danube were controlled by them . But this vast territory was never politically united by a strong central power . The different Cuman groups were under independent rulers or khans who meddled in the political life of the surrounding areas , such as the Rus ’ principalities and the Byzantine Empire . In attacking the Byzantine Empire , the Cumans were also assisted by the Vlachs living in the Balkan Mountains ( now in Bulgaria ) who showed them the mountain paths where no imperial guard was set up . 
 In 1185 , the Balkan Vlachs , together with the Bulgarians , rose up in arms against the Byzantine Empire . They created , with the help of the Cumans and the Vlachs living on the left bank of the Danube , a new state , the Second Bulgarian Empire between the Balkan Mountains and the Danube ( to the south of the future Wallachia ) . The new state was called " Vlachia " or " Vlachia and Bulgaria " in Western sources . For example , in 1204 the pope elevated the head of the Bulgarian church to the rank of " <unk> " ( primate ) " of all Bulgaria and Vlachia " . " Vlachia " as a designation for northern Bulgaria only disappeared from the sources after the middle of the 13th century . 
 In 1211 , King Andrew II of Hungary ( 1205 – 1235 ) settled the Teutonic Knights in the region of Braşov in order to put an end to the frequent incursions of the Cumans into Transylvania . The knights were given all the territory they could conquer beyond the Carpathian Mountains as a fief to be held from the king of Hungary . According to a royal charter of 1222 , the knights ’ military power stretched across the Carpathians all the way to the Danube . That the Teutonic Knights won several victories " beyond the snowy mountains " ( ultra montes <unk> ) , that is to the south and to the east of the Carpathians , is also confirmed by papal letters . However , the Teutonic Knights were forced out of the territory in 1225 by King Andrew II , who claimed that they had ignored his authority . 
 The Mongols entered Europe in 1223 when they defeated a joint Rus ’ <unk> army at the river Kalka ( now in Ukraine ) . Some Cuman groups , after their defeat of the Mongols , become willing to adopt Christianity . As early as 1227 , one of the Cuman chieftains , Boricius subjected himself and his people to the future King Béla IV of Hungary , converted to Christianity and agreed to pay an annual tax and the tithe . The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania , located in northeastern Wallachia and southwestern Moldavia , was established in 1228 . A significant presence of the Vlachs within the newly established bishopric is documented in the correspondence between the Hungarian crown prince and Pope Gregory IX ( 1227 – 1241 ) , as the pope complained about Orthodox prelates active among the local Vlachs . 
 The Diocese of Cumania was de jure a part of the Kingdom of Hungary , and King Andrew II adopted the title of " king of Cumania " in 1233 . There can be no doubt that the king also placed garrisons at key points on the southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains in northeastern Wallachia . But the military outposts in the region of the bishopric are only first mentioned in relation to the Mongol invasion of 1241 by Roger of Torre Maggiore . 
 In parallel with the emergence of the Second Bulgarian Empire , the Kingdom of Hungary also persuaded an active expansionist policy in the Balkan Peninsula from the end of the 12th century . To that end , Oltenia was put under the control of a Hungarian governor , who received the title of ban . The centre of the new province ( the Banate of Severin ) was Fort Severin ( now Drobeta @-@ Turnu Severin , Romania ) , on the Danube , in the vicinity of the Iron Gates . Its first ban , Luke , was mentioned in 1233 . 
 In 1236 a large Mongol army was collected under the supreme leadership of Batu Khan and set forth to the west , in one of the greatest invasions in world 's history . The Mongols ’ most devastating attacks against the western territories of the <unk> @-@ i <unk> ( ‘ the steppe of the Cumans ’ ) took place in 1237 – 1238 . The development of the battles was not recorded in the sources , but the Cuman 's subsequent migration to Hungary , Bulgaria and other neighboring territories is eloquent enough . Although some Cuman groups survived the Mongol invasion , the Cuman aristocracy was slain . The steppes of eastern Europe were conquered by Batu Khan ’ s army and became parts of the Golden Horde . 
 But the Mongols left no garrisons or military detachments in the lower Danube region and did not take direct political control of it . Although theoretically part of the Golden Horde , the steppe corridor between the Dnieper River and the lower Danube was only a " region of hegemony " , not of direct control . 
 = = Earliest <unk> in medieval documents = = 
 After the Mongol invasion , a great many ( if not most ) of the Cuman population left the Wallachian Plain , but the Vlach ( Romanian ) population remained there under the leadership of their local chiefs , called knezes and voivodes . In 1247 , King Béla IV tried to bring the Knights Hospitallers to the region and granted to them a number of territories in the " land of Severin " . The knights ’ mission , however , proved to be a total failure ( there is even no report whether they occupied their posts ) , but the royal charter for the knights , dated June 2 , 1247 , lists four autonomous territorial @-@ administrative units ( kenezates ) in Oltenia and western Muntenia . 
 Two of them , the kenezates of Johannes and Farcaş were given to the Knights Hospitallers . But the kenezates under Litovoi and Seneslau were exempted from the grant , and the royal charter expressly stipulated that they were to be left " to the Vlachs as they had owned it until now " . On the other hand , the royal charter also describes that Voivode Litovoi 's rule had extended on the northern side of the Transylvanian Alps into the Hunedoara region , but the king removed this territory from Litovoi ’ s authority in 1247 ; thenceforward Litovoi ’ s <unk> was restricted to the Oltenian part of the Jiu valley . Voivode Seneslau held the territories of central and southern Muntenia on the banks of the rivers Argeș and <unk> . 
 After the failure and disappearance of the Hospitallers , the history of the region is shrouded in obscurity for decades . But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi . He ( or his namesake son ) was at war with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280 . In the battle , his brother , Bărbat was captured . Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule . 
 = = ' Dismounting ' by Radu Negru = = 
 Romanian chronicles written in the 17th century narrate that a <unk> or duke of Făgăraș and <unk> , named Radu Negru ( ‘ Radu the Black ’ ) or Negru Vodă ( ‘ The Black Voivode ’ ) was the first voivode of Wallachia . These texts state that Radu Negru , together with some colonists ( " Romanians , Catholics and Saxons " ) arrived from the region of Făgăraş in Transylvania . The first documentary evidence for a terra <unk> ( ‘ land of the Vlachs ’ ) on the territory later called Făgăraș is an early 13th @-@ century property register which mentions the order of King Andrew II of Hungary that estates previously in Vlach hands be transferred to the Cistercian abbey at <unk> . Radu Negru and his followers crossed the Carpathians to Muntenia and founded Wallachia with its capitals in Câmpulung and Curtea de Argeș . The chronicles narrate these events under the year 1290 or 1292 . 
 The Romanian term for the " founding " ( <unk> , literally ‘ dismounting ’ ) refers to this alleged settling in Wallachia . But the word 's exact meaning is debated , since there had been Romanians living in Wallachia before Radu Negru ’ s arrival ; thus the term likely refers simply to the unification of the lands under one ruler . Moreover , this account of Radu Negru ’ s ‘ dismounting ’ may merely be a legend subsequently invented to parallel the circumstances by which Moldavia , the other Romanian principality was founded according to the earliest chronicles . 
 The origin of Oltenia is given by some of the chronicles differently : according to these chronicles Oltenia was colonized by Romanians from Turnu Severin , who founded two other capitals , at <unk> and Craiova . After the arrival of Radu Negru and his <unk> , these Romanians swore allegiance to him . 
 Radu Negru ’ s personality is surrounded by legend ; no details about him can be proved by other historical sources . Some chronicles identify him with the founder of various churches , such as the monastery at Curtea de Argeș , but they mistake him for later voivodes of Wallachia , such as Radu I ( c . 1377 – c . 1383 ) and Neagoe Basarab ( 1512 – 1521 ) . 
 Due to lack of any actual contemporary evidence , the Roman historian Nicolae Iorga doubted the existence of such a voivode , considering that ' Negru Vodă ' is simply a nickname that could have been given to Basarab I , the real founder of Wallachia . Other view is represented by Neagu Djuvara who identifies Negru Vodă with Thocomerius , Basarab 's father , explaining his nickname by his alleged Cuman descent : he appeared to have a dark skin color for the Romanians . In an interview , historian Ioan @-@ Aurel Pop stated , Djuvara " is not a specialist in the field of medieval history " and his " <unk> theory " is questionable . 
 The legendary traditions may also be in connection with the establishment of a trans @-@ Carpathian frontier mark by the Hungarian monarchy , with its capital at Câmpulung , probably in the last decade of the 13th century . A tomb stone belonging to one of the leaders of this formation , Count Lawrence of Câmpulung ( comes Laurentius de Longo Campo ) , dating from the year 1300 , may provide a solid chronological reference point . On the other hand , comes Laurentius may have been a one @-@ time leader of the Saxon community in Câmpulung . 
 History of Wallachia from the time when the Orthodox Christians dismounted there 
 But earlier the Romanians arrived who had separated from the Romans and wandered to the north . Having crossed the waters of the Danube , they dismounted at Turnu Severin , others in Hungary , by the waters of the Olt , by the waters of the Mureș and by the waters of the Tisa , reaching as far as Maramureș . Those who had dismounted at Turnu Severin spread all along the foot of the mountains towards the waters of the Olt ; others went downward all along the Danube . Having this way all the places been filled with them , they arrived as far as the outskirts of Nicopolis . Then the boyars , who are of noble families , gathered . In order to have their own leaders ( that is great bans ) , a family , named Basarab , was appointed to the <unk> . The first seat was decided to be at Turnu Severin , the second seat to be set up farther , at <unk> , and the third seat to be set up even farther , at Craiova ; and it happened like that . Much time went by and they were governing that region . 
 In <unk> AM , there was a <unk> in Hungary , called Voievod Radu the Black , great duke of <unk> and Făgăraș . He set out from there , together with his whole household and with many other people , Romanians , papists , Saxons , and all kind of men . They descended towards the waters of <unk> , starting this way to establish a new country . First they founded the town called Câmpulung where a large , beautiful and lofty church was built . Afterwards , they settled at <unk> where another large town was founded . By building stone castles , princely houses and a large and beautiful church , the prince 's seat was also established there . Some of the people , who had come down together with him , went farther along the foothills as far as the waters of the Siret and towards Brăila . Others went downward establishing towns and villages , and they reached all the places as far as the banks of the Danube and all along the Olt . 
 In <unk> AM , there was a <unk> called Voievod Radu the Black , who had his seat at Făgăraș from the fathers and forefathers of the Romanians who had come from Rome , in the days of Emperor Trajan decided to move his seat on the other side [ of the Carpathians ] - Chronicle of Radu Popescu ( Cronica <unk> ) 
 = = Basarab I the Founder = = 
 Basarab was the son of Thocomerius whose status cannot be specified . There is no direct clue in the sources to the date when Basarab took the office of voivode . But Ioannes Kantakouzenos in his History narrates that in 1323 Basarab 's armies joined in the fighting between Bulgaria and Byzantium and supported Tzar Michael Šišman of Bulgaria ( 1323 – 1330 ) against the Byzantines . In a diploma , dated July 26 , 1324 , King Charles I of Hungary refers to Basarab as " our voivode of Wallachia " ( <unk> nostrum <unk> ) which indicates that at that time Basarab was a vassal of the king of Hungary . 
 In short time , however , Basarab refused to accept the suzerainty of the king , for neither Basarab 's growing power nor the active foreign policy he was conducting on his own account to the south could be acceptable in Hungary . In a new diploma , dated June 18 , 1325 , King Charles I mentions him as " Basarab of Wallachia , unfaithful to the king ’ s Holy Crown " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> corone <unk> ) . 
 Hoping to punish Basarab , King Charles I mounted a military campaign against him in 1330 . The king marched to Severin and took it from Basarab . The voivode asked for a truce , offering to refund 7 @,@ 000 silver marks for the costs of the army , and showed himself ready to continue paying tribute to the king and send his son as a hostage to the royal court . But the king refused and advanced with his host into Wallachia where everything seemed to have been laid waste . 
 Unable to subdue Basarab , the king ordered the retreat through the mountains . But in a long and narrow valley , the Hungarian army was attacked by the Romanians , who had taken up positions on the heights . The battle , called the Battle of Posada , lasted for four days ( November 9 – 12 , 1330 ) and was a disaster for the Hungarians whose defeat was devastating . The king was only able to escape with his life by exchanging his royal coat of arms with one of his retainers . 
 The Battle of Posada was a turning point in Hungarian @-@ Wallachian relations : though in the course of the 14th century , the kings of Hungary still tried to regulate the voivodes of Wallachia more than one time , but they could only succeed temporarily . Thus Basarab ’ s victory irretrievably opened the way to independence for the Principality of Wallachia . 
 = = Aftermath of the Battle of Posada = = 
 The international prestige of Wallachia increased considerably after Basarab ’ s victory over King Charles I. Only a few months after his great victory , in February 1331 , Basarab contributed to the establishment of his son @-@ in @-@ law , Ivan Alexander ( 1331 – 1371 ) on the throne of the <unk> of Bulgaria in <unk> . 
 As a way of <unk> his secession from the Kingdom of Hungary , Basarab ’ s son , Nicolae Alexandru also sought Byzantine approval for the creation of an Orthodox see for his territories . In 1359 Byzantium acceded to his request that the displaced metropolitan of <unk> , <unk> – whom Nicolae Alexander had been hosting at his court for some time – should became the " legitimate pastor of all Oungrovlachia for the blessing and spiritual direction of himself , his children and all his lordship " . At the same time , Byzantium also agreed to the creation of a metropolitan see , after <unk> ’ death , for " all Oungrovlachia " . 
 The new state was denoted as Oungrovlachia ( <unk> ) in Byzantine sources which reflects that it bordered on the Kingdom of Hungary . This name is first encountered in a Greek diploma issued by the synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1370 . In the diploma , the ruler of Wallachia , Nicolae Alexandru is styled " great voivode and master of all Oungrovlachia " . 
 Latin documents used the term Wallachia or Wallachia maior ( ‘ Greater Wallachia ’ ) for Muntenia ( which first appeared in 1373 ) , and Wallachia minor ( ‘ Lesser Wallachia ’ ) for Oltenia ( first recorded in 1377 ) . The new country was identified as terra <unk> ( ‘ land beyond the mountains ’ ) or partes <unk> ( ‘ parts beyond the mountains ’ ) in documents issued by the Royal Chancellery of Hungary in the entire 14th century . The terminology of the Hungarian chancellery was also used in the Latin documents of the Wallachian voivodes . 
 The Romanian rulers chose the Byzantine model of government , and Wallachia was from the start an absolute monarchy . The princes ' absolute power was held to be divinely ordained . Their correspondence and records used the expression " By the Grace of God " from the 14th century . Wallachian sovereigns were host commanders and supreme judges , they patronized the church and made decisions that became laws . In theory , the voivodes were considered proprietors of all the lands in the country , but in fact they were devoid of extensive personal land holdings . 
 The monarchy was also dynastic : the princes were to be elected by boyars from among the members of the ruling family , the <unk> . The boyars were the members of the privileged landed aristocracy . However , the origin of the Romanian boyar class is problematic : it may have evolved naturally from the heads of the Vlach villages and communities , but it is also possible that the princes created it by granting privileges to certain favored persons . 
 Multiple vassalage became an important aspect of Romanian diplomacy after the Christian Balkan states ( Bulgaria , Serbia ) one by one fell to the Ottoman Empire in the course the second half of the 14th century . For example , Mircea the Elder ( 1386 – 1418 ) accepted the suzerainty of Poland in 1387 and that of Hungary in 1395 , and Wallachia was paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417 . When accepting Hungarian suzerainty , the princes of Wallachia usually also received the district of Făgăraş in Transylvania from the Hungarian monarchs , for example in 1366 King Louis I of Hungary ( 1342 – 1382 ) granted the region to Prince Vladislav I of Wallachia ( 1364 – 1377 ) , with the title of duke , and Prince Mircea the Elder received it from King Sigismund ( 1387 – 1437 ) . 
 During the reign of Mircea the Elder , Dobruja also became part of Wallachia before it was annexed to the Ottoman Empire . 
 = 95th Infantry Division ( United States ) = 
 The 95th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army . Today it exists as the 95th Training Division , a component of the United States Army Reserve headquartered at Fort Sill , Oklahoma . 
 Activated too late to deploy for World War I , the division remained in the Army 's reserve until World War II , when it was sent to Europe . Renowned for fighting back fierce German counterattacks , the division earned the nickname " Iron Men of Metz " for fighting to liberate and defend the town . After World War II , the division spent another brief period in reserve before being activated as one of the Army 's training divisions . 
 Over the next fifty years the division would see numerous changes to its structure as its training roles changed and subordinate units shifted in and out of its command . It activated a large number of regimental and brigade commands to fulfill various training roles . The division then began conducting one station unit training , a responsibility it continues to this day .

Training of all of the Division 's units began immediately . On 11 November , the Armistice with Germany was signed , ending the hostilities . The division 's deployment was cancelled and it was demobilized in December 1918 . All of the division 's officers and enlisted men were discharged from the military or transferred to other units .

During this time it was reassigned to III Corps . The division bivouacked near Norroy @-@ le @-@ Sec , from 1 to 14 October . It was then assigned to XX Corps of the Third United States Army . The division was sent into combat on 19 October in the Moselle bridgehead sector east of Moselle and South of Metz and patrolled the <unk> near <unk> , capturing the forts surrounding Metz and repulsing enemy attempts to cross the river . It was during the defense of this town from repeated German attacks that the division received its nickname , " The Iron Men of Metz .

The 95th seized a Saar River bridge on 3 December and engaged in bitter house @-@ to @-@ house fighting for <unk> . Suburbs of the city fell and , although the enemy resisted fiercely , the Saar bridgehead was firmly established by 19 December . While some units went to an assembly area , others held the area against strong German attacks . On 2 February 1945 , the Division began moving to the Maastricht area in the Netherlands , and by 14 February , elements were in the line near <unk> in relief of British units . During this time the division returned to the Ninth Army under XIX Corps , though saw temporary assignments to several other corps through the spring . 
 On 23 February , the division was relieved , and the 95th assembled near Jülich , Germany , on 1 March . It forced the enemy into a pocket near the Hitler Bridge at <unk> and cleared the pocket on 5 March , while elements advanced to the Rhine . From 12 March , the 95th established defenses in the vicinity of Neuss . Assembling east of the Rhine at <unk> on 3 April , it launched an attack across the Lippe River the next day and captured Hamm and Kamen on the 6th . After clearing the enemy pocket north of the Ruhr and the Möhne Rivers , the division took Werl and <unk> on 9 / 10 April , Dortmund on 13 April and maintained positions on the north bank of the Ruhr .

 The division was reactivated on 13 May 1947 at Oklahoma City as a reserve unit . However , it was not mobilized for any combat duties following World War II . In 1952 , the division underwent reorganization , with the first change being the addition of the 291st Infantry Regiment of Tulsa , Oklahoma , from the 75th Infantry Division . The second change that year for the division was the withdrawal of assignment of the 377th Infantry Regiment from the 95th , which was transferred to the 75th Infantry Division . The 377th had headquartered in New Orleans , Louisiana since its activation after World War II . 
 The year 1955 saw further changes to the division and more changes of assignment for subordinate elements . On 1 January 1955 , the 291st Regiment was again assigned to the 75th Infantry Division from the 95th and was subsequently inactivated on 31 January 1955 . On 30 January , the 377th Regiment was reassigned to the 95th from the 75th and its headquarters moved from New Orleans to Tulsa , Oklahoma . The same date saw the relocation of the 379th Regimental headquarters from Hot Springs , Arkansas where it had been since 1947 , to Little Rock , Arkansas . 
 On 1 April 1958 the 95th Infantry Division was redesignated as the 95th Division ( Training ) and a major reorganization of mission assignments was underway . Personnel trained for infantry combat , field artillery , military police and combat support roles were now to undergo re @-@ training to enable them to train others . The division had a new role as one of the 13 Training Divisions in the Army Reserve . The same year the division 's size increased as the 291st Regiment was reassigned again from the 75th and was redesignated as 291st Regiment ( Advanced Individual Training ) . With the reorganization of the division all of the regiments were redesignated . The 95th Divisional Artillery became the 95th Regiment ( Common Specialist Training ) with headquarters at Shreveport , Louisiana . The 377th became the 377th Regiment ( Basic Combat Training ) , as did the 378th and 379th , and all were reassigned new training sites . In 1966 , the division received a distinctive unit insignia . 
 In 1967 , the division was reorganized according to the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan , part of an army @-@ wide transformation . The division 's former World War II components were reorganized into brigades . The division 's former headquarters was reactivated as 1st Brigade , 95th Division at Tulsa , Oklahoma . The <unk> Field Artillery Battalion became the 2nd Brigade , 95th Division , also in Tulsa . The 320th Engineer Battalion became the 3rd Brigade , 95th Division at Oklahoma City , and the <unk> Ordnance Battalion became the 4th Brigade , 95th Division in Shreveport , Louisiana . In 1975 , the division 's center was changed to Midwest City , Oklahoma . 
 The Division was located in three states , Oklahoma , Arkansas , and Louisiana . The 1st Brigade was headquartered in Tulsa , Oklahoma and had elements of the 377th and 379th in regiments in its battalions . The 2nd Brigade was headquartered in Lawton , Oklahoma with elements of the 378th and 379th Regiments . The 3rd Brigade was headquartered in Stillwater , Oklahoma , a move made in September 1975 , and consisted of only 291st Regiment elements . The 4th Brigade was headquartered in Bossier City , Louisiana , a suburb of Shreveport , and includes the 95th Regiment and one element of the 379th . The Committee Group was headquartered in Little Rock , Arkansas with no Regimental elements . The 95th Support Battalion was headquartered in Midwest City , Oklahoma with the Division Headquarters , Headquarters and Headquarters Company , 95th Division Leadership Academy , and the 95th Division Maneuver Training Command . On 1 January 1979 the division 's four brigades was reorganized specifically for one station unit training . 
 The division experienced tremendous expansion in October 1984 with the addition of the <unk> US Army Reception Station , in Lafayette , Louisiana with a strength of 809 personnel . The 402nd Brigade was also activated under the division 's administrative control . It was designated to expand the training base for the Army 's Field Artillery Training Center located at Fort Sill , Oklahoma . In 1989 the division 's location was returned to Oklahoma City . 
 = = = Present day = = = 
 The division continued its mission of training and operating one station unit training . In 1996 , the division received three additional brigades as part of an Army consolidation of training commands . The 5th Brigade , 95th Division was activated in San Antonio , Texas , the 6th Brigade , 95th Division was activated in Topeka , Kansas , and the 7th Brigade , 95th Division was activated from the 95th Training Command in Little Rock , Arkansas . 
 In 2000 , the brigade took on the additional responsibility of training Reserve Officer 's Training Corps cadets . The 8th Brigade , 95th Division was activated as a provisional unit in charge of ROTC units throughout the southwestern United States . In 2005 , the division headquarters were relocated to Fort Sill , Oklahoma . This put the division at the area 's major training center , allowing it to more effectively provide training oversight .

Massad , and Lieutenant General Emmett H. Walker , Jr .. Additionally , one soldier of the division received the Medal of Honor during his service , Andrew Miller , who received the medal in World War II during the division 's fight for Metz . Miller captured a number of German machine gun nests and soldiers while leading a squad of men in assaulting the city . German born ( MG ) Gerd <unk> served as an NCO interrogating POWs and was commissioned <unk> <unk> in January 1945 . He directly assisted in the negotiations for the capture of Metz in 1944 . 
 = Palace Hotel , Perth = 
 The Palace Hotel in Perth , Western Australia is a landmark three @-@ storey heritage listed building located in the city 's central business district . Originally built in 1897 as a hotel during the gold rush period of Western Australia 's history , it was converted to banking chambers and offices in the 1980s and now accommodates global architecture practice Woods Bagot 's Perth headquarters . ( Woods Bagot ) . The building is located on the most prominent intersection in the financial district of the city , at the corner of St Georges Terrace and William Street . 
 When the hotel opened for business on 18 March 1897 it was , although slightly smaller than some of its contemporary buildings in other capital cities in Australasia , described as " ... one of the most beautiful and elegant hotels in Australasia " . Other praise included : " ... redolent of the bourgeois luxury and splendour of the Paris of Napoleon III " and later " ... in its day , as sumptuous a hostelry as any in Melbourne or Sydney . " It operated as licensed premises from 1897 until 1981 . 
 = = Style and heritage features = = 
 The building is described as being of a " Federation Free Classical " architectural style . It is three storeys high and of brick and iron construction . It was designed by architects Porter and Thomas and built by prominent mining entrepreneur and real @-@ estate investor John De Baun at a cost of £ 64 @,@ 000 . 
 In 1973 , a public lobby group known as The Palace Guards was formed to push state planning authorities for the preservation of the building . The building was entered into the register of the National Trust of Australia in June 1973 and elevated to a permanent entry in 1980 " as a first @-@ class example of the quality of building at the time of the gold rush " . 
 In the period leading up to and during the 1980s redevelopment , lobbying from The Palace Guards , the National Trust of Western Australia and the public at large pushed for the retention of some elements of the original building . In 1990 , legislation enforcing compliance with heritage preservation orders was enacted and the site became the subject of the first heritage agreement in the State . It was recorded as a permanent entry in the state heritage register at the Heritage Council of Western Australia in May 2000 .

 Due to its ornate and grand style , its prominent position within the city , and being the only building of its type and scale in St Georges Terrace , the hotel has been an important landmark in Perth for all of its life . In its early years , the hotel afforded commercial travellers a high level of opulence and comfort while visiting the city and offered a tangible reminder of the wealth and prosperity of the state during the gold @-@ boom period . 
 Prior to the construction of the Perth Town Hall in 1870 , the site ( which then housed the Freemasons ' Hotel ) was the pre @-@ eminent social and political focus of the town — important decisions such as the establishment of a local police force in 1851 were made there . At the time of its transformation into banking chambers in the 1980s , considerable amounts of nostalgia and acclamation of its place in Perth were reflected in the local media . 
 = = History = = 
 The site was first used as a lodging house when the King 's Head Hotel operated there from at least 1830 , owned and operated by William Dixon . In 1831 Dixon sold it to William Henry Leeder after which it was known as Leeder 's Hotel , with it becoming a social centre for the town with many important dinners and celebrations conducted there . The Perth Gazette wrote in August 1833 : 
 Few , if any , of [ the employed classes ] enjoyed a table such as the gentry made merry with at Leeder 's Hotel on the occasion of the King ’ s birthday celebrations in August 1833 , with nine types of meat and a choice of three desserts . 
 Leeder 's Hotel was extended in 1845 , by which time it was known as the Freemasons ' Tavern and housed the first Masonic Lodge in Western Australia . Following the death of Leeder in 1845 , his wife transferred the management to Julian Carr , a merchant who would later become a prominent local politician and Chairman of the Perth City Council from 1861 until 1869 . At this time it was known as the Freemasons ' Hotel with a number of other proprietors running it in the intervening years , including the wife of future Premier Sir Walter James and George Towton , a prominent horseman and hotelier . 
 A fire at the rear of the hotel in 1888 destroyed a number of outbuildings , adding to the premises ' general dilapidation . American real estate investor and former hotelier John De Baun purchased the property from Leeder 's widow for ₤ 14 @,@ 000 in 1894 , along with several other sites along St Georges Terrace . He engaged architects Ernest Saunders Porter and Edmond Neville Thomas to design the new Palace Hotel for the site with no expense to be spared and many of the construction materials imported . Marble for the fireplaces and mosaic floor tiles for the main entrance and bar @-@ room floors came from Italy . It boasted having " electric light and gas laid on in every room " , as well as electric bells and speaking tubes " conveniently placed everywhere " and was reputed to have the first lift in Perth as well as 10 bathrooms serving the 50 bedrooms on the first floor . De Baun also commenced construction of the nearby Melbourne Hotel in 1895 in similar style , if not quite the same degree of opulence and grandiosity . 
 John Glowrey ( a state member of parliament ) leased the Palace Hotel from De Baun in 1901 and carried out the first of many additions and modifications to the building , including the addition of bedroom wings on the north and east wings . A newspaper advertisement dated 1903 boasted : 
 ... the hotel as the finest hotel in the State , with 130 bedrooms , a number of suites of private apartments , a writing room and library , fine dining hall , a grand vestibule , electric light and electric elevator and large sample rooms . 
 De Baun died in 1911 and ownership passed to the West Australian Trustee Executor and Agency Company Limited , although Glowrey 's lease was maintained until his death in 1921 . Charles Atkins ( of Atkins Brothers Pty Ltd ) purchased the property in 1924 for £ 48 @,@ 000 . A younger relative of the previous lessee , James Henry Glowrey , took over the lease in 1930 and major internal renovations costing £ 15 @,@ 000 were undertaken at the same time , including enlarging the bar areas and conversion of the basement billiard room to a new bar area . External renovations were made in 1935 and 1939 . In 1959 a major modernisation project commenced costing £ 160 @,@ 000 and included installation of air conditioning , private bathrooms , and the replacement of timber verandas with cantilevered concrete verandas . Prior to this refurbishment , engraved lettering of the former name De Baun 's Palace Hotel was displayed in the corbelling above the front entrance . 
 = = 1980s redevelopment = = 
 The Commonwealth Banking Corporation purchased the property sometime around 1972 with an announcement that it planned to redevelop the site as high @-@ rise offices . Soon after , a public campaign developed , with a group known as The Palace Guards becoming a strong lobbying force , focussing on the state government and heritage organisations and pushing for the building 's preservation . The group 's inaugural meeting was held on 27 March 1973 at the Hotel . 
 J.M. Freeland , professor of architecture at the University of New South Wales wrote at the time : 
 This is a most important building for the history of Australian architecture , being an extreme example of High Victorian architecture . There were never many hotels of its standard in Australia and to my knowledge this is the last of them . 
 The campaign opposing the demolition culminated in a condemnation of the plan from the National Estates Committee and an appeal from the bank for the Australian Government to acquire the property . Bond Corporation ultimately purchased the property and the adjacent Terrace Arcade in 1978 and in 1980 unveiled plans ( which had been pre @-@ approved by the Perth City Council ) for a modern office block and the demolition of parts of the existing building and adjoining properties . The developers had successfully sought modification of the original planning approval by the Council to allow the use of the Palace Hotel as a bank , rather than remaining as a public hotel . The development plans were summarised in the Trust News , the journal of the National Trust of Australia as : 
 The erection of a multi @-@ storied , multi @-@ use tower block on the North East corner of the site ; retention of the Palace Hotel structure on the South West corner ; development of a covered concourse between the two structures linking William Street with St George ’ s Terrace . This will require : demolition of the structure housing the Terrace Arcade ; demolition of the eastern accommodation wing of the hotel ; dismantling and reconstruction of the northernmost portion of the William Street façade ; [ and ] dismantling and reconstruction of the dining @-@ room . 
 The tower project and restoration of the hotel were carried out as a joint venture between Bond Corporation and the R & I Bank , with the first demolition tasks commencing in August 1981 . The hotel closed in June 1986 amid demolition works and construction — by August 1983 construction had completed on the tower 's foundation and three levels of underground parking . The project was completed in 1988 and officially opened in August 1989 by premier Peter Dowding . 
 The redevelopment entailed demolition of much of the interior <unk> of the old hotel , however , the exterior façades facing the two main streets are largely intact , if slightly shortened on the William street frontage . A glass covered atrium joins the tower on the former hotel so that the tower entrances double as undercover access to the building . 
 = Bombing of Tan Son Nhut Air Base = 
 The bombing of Tan Son Nhut Air Base occurred on April 28 , 1975 , just two days before the Fall of Saigon . The bombing operation was carried out by the Vietnam People 's Air Force ( VPAF ) Quyet Thang Squadron , using captured Republic of Vietnam Air Force ( RVNAF ) A @-@ 37 aircraft flown by VPAF pilots and RVNAF defectors led by Nguyen Thanh Trung who had bombed the Presidential Palace in Saigon , less than one month earlier . 
 In 1973 , by the time the Paris Peace Accord was concluded , South Vietnam possessed the fourth largest air force in the world . Despite their size , however , South Vietnamese Air Force operations were severely curtailed due to cutbacks in U.S. military aid . Furthermore , the South Vietnamese Air Force were prevented from undertaking reconnaissance and ground support missions due to the threat posed by formidable anti @-@ aircraft weapons deployed by North Vietnam . When the North Vietnamese military renewed their offensive early in 1975 , the South Vietnamese Air Force was virtually handicapped and many of their aircraft were either lost or captured as formations of the Vietnam People 's Army swept through the Central Highlands of South Vietnam . 
 By April 1975 , morale in the South Vietnamese Air Force had sunk so low that some of their personnel simply defected to the Communist side . In a well @-@ known incident , South Vietnamese pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung used his F @-@ 5E fighter @-@ bomber to attack the Presidential Palace in Saigon instead of North Vietnamese troops . Shortly afterwards , Trung joined the Communist forces and he was ordered to train a group of North Vietnamese pilots to operate the U.S.-made A @-@ 37 Dragonfly fighter @-@ bomber , in order to support the Ho Chi Minh Campaign . On the afternoon of April 28 , 1975 , Trung led a flight of five A @-@ 37 fighter @-@ bombers against Tan Son Nhut Air Base , which temporarily stopped U.S. and South Vietnamese evacuation efforts .

 Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were supposed to end the war in Vietnam , fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the Viet Cong . Despite a pledge of support from U.S. President Richard Nixon , military aid to South Vietnam was sharply reduced . By the end of 1972 the RVNAF was the fourth largest air force in the world , with 2 @,@ 075 aircraft and over 61 @,@ 000 personnel . However , RVNAF operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid , flying hours had to be reduced by 51 % and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to two pieces of ordnance . 
 North Vietnam continued to build up its combat units in South Vietnam . With the threat of U.S. airpower removed , the North Vietnamese military moved anti @-@ aircraft units into South Vietnam , and deployed a sophisticated air @-@ defence network that included the long @-@ range SA @-@ 2 surface @-@ to @-@ air missile system , radar @-@ guided anti @-@ aircraft guns and the SA @-@ 7 Grail shoulder @-@ launched missile The strong presence of North Vietnamese anti @-@ aircraft units , which covered much of the northern provinces of South Vietnam , forced RVNAF reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles . Consequently , when North Vietnam went on the offensive again in 1975 , the RVNAF was severely handicapped . 
 = = = Ho Chi Minh Campaign = = = 
 The Ho Chi Minh Campaign commenced on March 9 , 1975 and by mid @-@ March the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) had withdrawn from the Central Highlands . The RVNAF 6th Air Force Division had been given only 48 hours to evacuate its aircraft and personnel from Pleiku Air Base leaving 64 aircraft intact , including 36 aircraft in flyable storage , and no attempt were made to put those aircraft into commission . On March 27 with South Vietnamese forces of I Corps facing imminent defeat , RVNAF Brigadier @-@ General Nguyen Duc Khanh , commander of the RVNAF 1st Air Force Division , was ordered to evacuate all flyable aircraft from Huế and Da Nang . 
 On March 28 North Vietnamese forces closed in on Da Nang , and they subjected Da Nang Air Base to heavy artillery bombardment . Under adverse conditions , the RVNAF was able to fly about 130 aircraft out of the city , but they had to abandon 180 aircraft , including 33 A @-@ 37 <unk> , due to chaos , confusion , poor discipline and the breakdown of airfield security . On March 29 , the North Vietnamese captured Da Nang , followed by Quy Nhon on April 1 and Tuy Hòa and Nha Trang on April 2 . At Phan Rang Air Base , remnants of the RVNAF continued to battle North Vietnamese troops for two days after ground units of the ARVN had given up the fight . Elements of the ARVN Airborne Division were also committed into the fight , but they were overwhelmed by the North Vietnamese and Phan Rang was captured on April 16 . 
 = = = Attack on the Presidential Palace = = = 
 On April 8 , a formation of three RVNAF F @-@ 5E Tiger fighter @-@ bombers lined up at Bien Hoa Air Base , each armed with four 250 @-@ pound bombs , for an attack on North Vietnamese positions in Bình Thuận Province . Before the second aircraft took off , First Lieutenant Nguyen Thanh Trung , who piloted the third F @-@ 5 , reported his aircraft was experiencing afterburner problems . When the second aircraft departed , Trung also took off , but flew towards Saigon instead of joining the formation . At around <unk> Trung dived on the Presidential Palace and dropped two bombs ; the first bomb landed on the Palace grounds and caused some damage , but the second bomb failed to explode . Trung climbed to over 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) before making a second pass , this time both bombs exploded , causing minor structural damage but no casualties . After the attack , Trung flew out of Saigon and landed at the petroleum storage facility at Nha Be on the outskirts of the city , where he removed the ammunition for the 20mm cannon . 
 Shortly afterwards Trung took off again and flew out to Phước Long Province , which was occupied by the Provisional Revolutionary Government since North Vietnamese troops had captured it earlier in the year , and he was warmly received by North Vietnamese soldiers . The North Vietnamese claimed that Trung had been a Viet Cong agent since 1969 , and was infiltrated into the RVNAF where he served with the RVNAF <unk> Fighter Squadron of the 3rd Air Force Division . Trung later revealed that he was originally from Bến Tre Province in the Mekong region , where his father had served as the district secretary of the People 's Revolutionary Party . In 1963 Trung 's father was killed and his body was mutilated by the South Vietnamese police . Angered by the death of his father , Trung vowed to take revenge on the South Vietnamese Government , so in 1969 he secretly joined the Viet Cong after he had been accepted into the RVNAF .

 Prior to the bombing of the Presidential Palace , North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng and his field commanders had been discussing the possibility of deploying units of the Vietnam People 's Air Force ( VPAF ) , to attack high @-@ value South Vietnamese targets in support of North Vietnamese ground troops . Use of the Soviet MiG @-@ 17 fighter was considered , North Vietnamese pilots already had significant combat experience with the type . However , moving MiGs from their bases in North Vietnam was problematic ; South Vietnamese defenses were falling much faster than anticipated , there was simply little time in which to deploy the MiGs in support of North Vietnamese units encircling Saigon . As the North Vietnamese had captured a large number of U.S.-made aircraft from the RVNAF at Pleiku and Da Nang Air Bases , it was decided to use captured aircraft instead . 
 The decision to use the captured aircraft presented a challenge for the VPAF , because they lacked experience in flying U.S.-made aircraft . Furthermore , VPAF pilots were not proficient in the English language ; most had trained on Soviet equipment using the Russian language . Upon receiving news of Trung 's actions on April 8 , General Dung decided that Trung would provide conversion training so that a group of North Vietnamese pilots would be able to fly the A @-@ 37 Dragonfly , the type selected for an upcoming operation . Trung was sent out to Da Nang Air Base , where he was joined by Lieutenants Tran Van On and Tran Van Xanh , both former RVNAF fighter pilots , captured when Da Nang capitulated on March 29 . Trung , Xanh , and On were tasked with translating manuals from English to the Vietnamese language , as well as translating instructions on board the A @-@ 37 into Vietnamese . 
 On April 19 , the VPAF Command was ordered to prepare for an operation in South Vietnam , so a group of pilots from the 4th Squadron of the VPAF <unk> Fighter Regiment was selected to undertake conversion training in Da Nang and form a new squadron for the operation . The selected group was led by Upper Captain Nguyen Van Luc along with Tu De , Tran Cao Thang , Han Van Quang and Hoang Mai Vuong . Together with former RVNAF pilots Trung and On , the group would form the Quyet Thang ( " Determined to Win " ) Squadron . On April 22 the VPAF pilots arrived at Da Nang Air Base and they began training on two A @-@ 37 aircraft that were restored to flying condition with support from Trung , On , Xanh and a few captured South Vietnamese technicians . In just five days , the VPAF pilots were able to independently fly the A @-@ 37 without support from the former RVNAF pilots . 
 As the VPAF pilots were completing the final phases of their conversion training , the VPAF Command chose to attack Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon . On the afternoon of April 27 , the pilots were flown out to <unk> Cát Air Base in Bình Định Province where Major @-@ General Le Van Tri , commander of the VPAF , briefed them on the upcoming operation . Tri also instructed the pilots to ensure that their bombs should not hit civilian areas in Saigon . From the original group of trainees , Luc , De , Quang , Vuong , Trung and On were selected to take part in the attack . Meanwhile , On and Xanh were also instructed to test @-@ fly five captured A @-@ 37 bombers , which would be the mainstay of the Quyet Thang Squadron . On the morning of April 28 , the Quyet Thang Squadron became operational with Luc as the squadron 's commander , when it was transferred to Phan Rang Air Base . 
 = = = The attack = = = 
 At Phan Rang AB , Luc submitted the squadron 's plan of attack to the VPAF Command , Trung would lead the formation in the first aircraft because he was familiar with the skies over Saigon , De would be positioned behind Trung in the second aircraft , followed by Luc in the third , Vuong and On together in the fourth and Quang would pilot the last aircraft in the formation . At around 16 : 05 on April 28 , the five A @-@ 37 bombers of the Quyet Thang Squadron , each armed with four 250 @-@ pound bombs , took off from Phan Rang and each aircraft flew between 600 meters ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) and 800 meters ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) apart from each other . To save fuel over the 400 kilometers ( 250 mi ) distance between Phan Rang and Saigon , the five @-@ aircraft formation had to fly at a height of just 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . Their first navigation point was Vũng Tàu , from where the formation would turn towards Tan Son Nhut . When the squadron flew over Bien Hoa Air Base , two RVNAF AD @-@ 6 Skyraiders were sighted conducting bombing sorties near the area , but they were not allowed to engage . 
 Shortly after 17 : 00 the formation was able to approach Tan Son Nhut Air Base unchallenged as they were still wearing South Vietnamese code numbers . From about 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) above the target Trung dived down on the target , but the bombs could not be released from the pylons , so Trung was forced to pull his aircraft up again . Next in line was De , who was able to drop his entire bomb load on the target . Luc dived on the target , but he too experienced problems with the weapons release system , so only two bombs were dropped . After the last two aircraft piloted by Vuong , Quang and On had successfully hit their targets , they strafed aircraft on the ground with gunfire . Trung and Luc made another pass , but again their bombs could not be released from the pylon . 
 By that stage the South Vietnamese had already responded by firing their anti @-@ aircraft guns , so Luc ordered the squadron to withdraw as Trung made one final attempt at dropping his load using emergency mode . Several RVNAF F @-@ 5s were scrambled to pursue the attackers , but they escaped without any damage . On the return trip Quang led the formation , followed by Luc , De and Vuong and On . Trung , who had flown back for the third bombing attempt , was trailing the rest of the group . As they flew over Phan Thiết , they had to fly at a lower altitude to avoid mistakenly being hit by North Vietnamese anti @-@ aircraft weapons . When the formation came within 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) of Phan Rang AB , De was granted permission to land first because he only had about 600 liters ( 130 imp gal ; 160 U.S. gal ) of fuel left . Squadron commander Luc was next to land , followed by Vuong and On , then Quang . Trung , who had led the attack during the mission , was the last aircraft to arrive back at base . By 18 : 00 on 28 April all the pilots of the VPAF Quyet Thang Squadron had landed at Phan Rang , after completing North Vietnam 's first successful air attack against Saigon during the entire Vietnam War . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The attack on Tan Son Nhut temporarily closed the airport , but it was soon returned to operation . The true extent of the damage is unknown ; the North Vietnamese claimed that 24 aircraft had been destroyed and about 200 South Vietnamese personnel were killed , but U.S. sources state that only 3 AC @-@ 119s and several C @-@ 47s were destroyed , with no mention of casualties . 
 By the night of 28 April , North Vietnamese artillery and rockets were hitting Tan Son Nhut . At dawn on 29 April , the RVNAF began to haphazardly depart Tan Son Nhut Air Base as A @-@ 37s , F @-@ 5s , C @-@ 7s , C @-@ 119s , and C @-@ 130s departed for Thailand , while UH @-@ 1 helicopters took off in search of the evacuation fleet of Task Force 76 . Some VNAF aircraft , however , did stay and continue to fight the advancing North Vietnamese . One AC @-@ 119 gunship had spent the night of 28 / 29 April dropping flares and firing on the approaching North Vietnamese . At dawn on 29 April , two A @-@ 1 Skyraiders began patrolling the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut at 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 760 m ) until one was shot down , presumably by an SA @-@ 7 . At 07 : 00 , the AC @-@ 119 was firing on North Vietnamese formations to the east of Tan Son Nhut when it too was hit by an SA @-@ 7 and fell in flames to the ground . Due to the deteriorating situation at Tan Son Nhut , the fixed @-@ wing evacuation of Saigon was cancelled and Operation Frequent Wind was commenced . 
 = Marie of Romania = 
 Princess Marie of Edinburgh , more commonly known as Marie of Romania ( Marie Alexandra Victoria ; 29 October 1875 – 18 July 1938 ) , was the last Queen consort of Romania as the wife of King Ferdinand I. 
 Born into the British royal family , she was titled Princess Marie of Edinburgh at birth . Her parents were Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia . Marie 's early years were spent in Kent , Malta and Coburg . After refusing a proposal from her cousin , the future King George V , she was chosen as the future wife of Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania , the heir apparent of King Carol I , in 1892 . Marie was Crown Princess between 1893 and 1914 , and became immediately popular with the Romanian people . Marie had controlled her weak @-@ willed husband even before his ascension in 1914 , prompting a Canadian newspaper to state that " few royal consorts have wielded greater influence than did Queen Marie during the reign of her husband " . 
 After the outbreak of World War I , Marie urged Ferdinand to ally himself with the Triple Entente and declare war on Germany , which he eventually did in 1916 . During the early stages of fighting , Bucharest was occupied by the Central Powers and Marie , Ferdinand and their five children took refuge in Moldavia . There , she and her three daughters acted as nurses in military hospitals , caring for soldiers who were wounded or afflicted by cholera . On 1 December 1918 , the province of Transylvania , following Bessarabia and Bukovina , united with the Old Kingdom . Marie , now Queen consort of Greater Romania , attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 , where she campaigned for international recognition of the enlarged Romania . In 1922 , she and Ferdinand were crowned in a specially @-@ built cathedral in the ancient city of Alba Iulia , in an elaborate ceremony which mirrored their status as queen and king of a united state . 
 As queen , she was very popular , both in Romania and abroad . In 1926 , Marie and two of her children undertook a diplomatic tour of the United States . They were received enthusiastically by the people and visited several cities before returning to Romania . There , Marie found that Ferdinand was gravely ill and he died a few months later . Now queen dowager , Marie refused to be part of the regency council which reigned over the country under the minority of her grandson , King Michael . In 1930 , Marie 's eldest son Carol , who had waived his rights to succession , deposed his son and usurped the throne , becoming King Carol II . He removed Marie from the political scene and strived to crush her popularity . As a result , Marie moved away from Bucharest and spent the rest of her life either in the countryside , or at her home by the Black Sea . In 1937 , she became ill with cirrhosis and died the following year . 
 Following Romania 's transition to a Socialist Republic , the monarchy was excoriated by communist officials . Several biographies of the royal family described Marie either as a drunkard or as a promiscuous woman , referring to her many alleged affairs and to orgies she had supposedly organised before and during the war . In the years preceding the Romanian Revolution of 1989 , Marie 's popularity recovered and she was offered as a model of patriotism to the population . Marie is primarily remembered for her work as a nurse , but is also known for her extensive writing , including her critically acclaimed autobiography .

 = = = Birth = = = 
 Marie was the eldest daughter and second child of Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , and the former Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia , respectively the son of Queen Victoria and the daughter of Emperor Alexander II . She was born at her parents ' residence , Eastwell Manor in Kent , on 29 October 1875 , at 10 : 30 a.m. , in the presence of her father . Her birth was celebrated by firing the Park and Tower guns . She was named Marie Alexandra Victoria , after her mother and grandmothers , but she was informally known as " Missy " . The Duke of Edinburgh wrote that his daughter " promises to be as fine a child as her brother and gives every evidence of finely developed lungs and did so before she was fairly in the world . " As a grandchild of the reigning British monarch in the male line , Marie was formally styled " Her Royal Highness Princess Marie of Edinburgh " from birth . 
 Marie 's christening took place in the private chapel of Windsor Castle on 15 December 1875 and was officiated by Arthur Stanley and Gerald Wellesley , Dean of Windsor . The baptism , " of a strictly private nature " , took place one day after the ceremony marking the anniversary of the death of her paternal grandfather , Prince Albert . Marie 's godparents were Empress Maria Alexandrovna ( her maternal grandmother , for whom Queen Victoria stood proxy ) , the Princess of Wales ( her paternal aunt ) , the Duchess of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha ( her great @-@ aunt , for whom Princess Helena of Schleswig @-@ Holstein stood proxy ) , the Tsarevich of Russia ( her maternal uncle , for whom Count Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov stood proxy ) and the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn ( her paternal uncle , for whom the Duke of Albany stood proxy ) . 
 = = = Upbringing = = = 
 Marie and her siblings , Prince Alfred ( b . 1874 ) , and Princesses Victoria Melita ( b . 1876 , known as " Ducky " ) , Alexandra ( b . 1878 , known as " Sandra " ) and Beatrice ( b . 1884 , known as " Baby Bee " ) , spent much of their early life at Eastwell Park , which their mother preferred instead of Clarence House , their official residence . In her memoirs , Marie would remember Eastwell fondly . The Duke of Edinburgh was largely absent from his children 's lives , due to his position in the British Royal Navy , and their life was governed by their mother . Marie would later state that she did not even know the colour of her father 's hair until she looked at later portraits of him , believing it to be much darker than it actually was . When he was at home , the Duke would often play with his children , inventing many games for them . Of all her siblings , Marie was closest to her sister Victoria Melita , who was one year younger , but whom everyone believed to be the older girl because of her stature , much to the princesses ' dismay . The Edinburgh children were all baptised and raised in the Anglican faith ; this upset their Russian Orthodox mother . 
 The Duchess of Edinburgh was a supporter of the idea of separating generations and Marie deeply regretted the fact that her mother never allowed chatting between the two " as if [ they ] were equals " . Nonetheless , the Duchess was independent @-@ minded , cultured and " the most important person " in her children 's lives . At the behest of their mother , Marie and her sisters were taught French , which they detested and rarely ever spoke . Overall , the Duchess neglected her daughters ' education , considering them not very bright or gifted . They were permitted to read aloud , but in the fields of painting and drawing , areas in which they had inherited Queen Victoria 's talent , the girls received only a " pedestrian instruction " . The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh frequently received members of the royal family at Eastwell Park , inviting them for breakfast nearly daily and in 1885 , Marie and Victoria Melita served as bridesmaids at the wedding of their aunt Beatrice and Prince Henry of Battenberg . Among Marie 's playmates were her maternal cousins , Grand Dukes Nicholas ( called " Nicky " ) and George ( called " Georgie " ) and Grand Duchess Xenia of Russia , the other two Russian cousins , Grand Duke Michael ( called " Misha " ) and Grand Duchess Olga being too young for the Edinburgh girls . Other playmates included the children of their maternal uncle , Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia . 
 In 1886 , when Marie was eleven years old , the Duke of Edinburgh was named commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Mediterranean Fleet and the family took up residence at San Antonio Palace in Malta . Marie would remember her time in Malta as " the happiest memory of my existence " . It was in Malta that Marie found her first love , Maurice Bourke , the captain of the Duke 's ship , whom Marie called " Captain Dear " . Marie was prone to fits of jealousy when Bourke would pay more attention to one of her sisters than to her . The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were greatly loved in Malta and San Antonio Palace was frequently full of guests . Marie and Victoria Melita received white horses from their mother and went to the local hippodrome nearly daily , apart from Saturday . During their first year in Malta , a French governess oversaw the princesses ' education , but , due to her failing health , she was replaced the following year by a much younger German woman . At San Antonio , the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh always maintained a room ready for Prince George of Wales , the second son of the Prince of Wales , later King Edward VII , who was in the Royal Navy . George called the three elder Edinburgh girls " the three <unk> " , but favoured Marie the most . 
 Meanwhile , the Duke of Edinburgh became heir presumptive to his childless paternal uncle , Ernest II , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , upon the Prince of Wales 's renunciation of his rights to the duchy . Consequently , the family relocated to Coburg in 1889 . Marie later came to view this moment as " truly the end of a life that had been absolute happiness and joy without clouds , of a life with no disappointments or delusions and without any discordant note . " The Duchess , who was pro @-@ German , hired a German governess for her daughters , bought them plain clothing and even had them confirmed in the Lutheran faith . The family spent their summers at Rosenau Castle . Duke Ernest was described by Marie as " having his oddities " ; his court was less strict than other German courts of the time . In Coburg , the princesses ' education was broadened : more emphasis was placed on painting and music , which were taught by Anna Messing and Mrs. <unk> , respectively . On Thursdays and Sundays , Marie and her sisters went to the Coburg Theatre , an experience which they enjoyed greatly . Marie and Victoria Melita often observed their brother 's friends and made comments on whom they liked better , an aspect which Marie believed was inevitable in the lives of girls who have brothers . Another activity which the girls enjoyed at Coburg was attending winter parties organised by their mother , during which they would ice @-@ skate and play different games , such as ice hockey . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 Marie grew into a " lovely young woman " with " sparkling blue eyes and silky fair hair " ; she was courted by several royal bachelors , including Prince George of Wales , who in 1892 became second in line to inherit the throne . Queen Victoria , the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh all approved , but the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Edinburgh did not . The Princess of Wales disliked the family 's pro @-@ German sentiment and the Duchess of Edinburgh did not wish for her daughter to remain in England , which she resented . She also disliked the fact that the Princess of Wales , whose father had been a minor German prince before being called to the Danish throne , was higher than she in the order of precedence . The Duchess of Edinburgh was also against the idea of a marriage between first cousins , which was not allowed by her native Russian Orthodox Church . Thus , when George proposed to her , Marie informed him that the marriage was impossible and that he must remain her " beloved chum " . Queen Victoria would later comment that " Georgie lost Missy by waiting & waiting " . 
 Around this time , King Carol I of Romania was looking for a suitable bride for Crown Prince Ferdinand , in order to secure the succession and assure the continuation of the House of Hohenzollern @-@ Sigmaringen . Possibly motivated by the prospect of removing tensions between Russia and Romania on the subject of control over Bessarabia , the Duchess of Edinburgh suggested that Marie meet Ferdinand . Marie and Ferdinand first became acquainted during a gala dinner and the pair conversed in German . She found him shy but amiable , and their second meeting went just as well . Once the pair were formally engaged , Queen Victoria wrote to another granddaughter , Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine , that " [ Ferdinand ] is nice & the Parents are charming – but the country is very insecure & the immorality of the Society at Bucharest quite awful . Of course the marriage will be delayed some time as Missy won 't be 17 till the end of October ! " German Empress Victoria , Marie 's aunt , wrote to her daughter , Crown Princess Sophia of Greece , that " Missy is till now quite delighted , but the poor child is so young , how can she guess what is before her ? " In late 1892 , King Carol visited London in order to meet the Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Victoria , who eventually agreed to the marriage and appointed him a Knight of the Garter . 
 On 10 January 1893 , Marie and Ferdinand were married at Sigmaringen Castle in three ceremonies : one civil , one Catholic ( Ferdinand 's religion ) and one Anglican . The civil ceremony was performed in the Red Hall of the castle by Karl von Wendel , the German Emperor being the first of the witnesses present to sign the marriage act . At four o 'clock , the Catholic ceremony took place at the Town Church , with Marie being led to the altar by her father . The Anglican ceremony was more modest and was conducted in one of the chambers of the castle . Although King Carol granted the couple " <unk> " ( one day of honeymoon ) , Marie and Ferdinand spent a few days at the Castle of <unk> in Bavaria . From there , they left for the countryside , their journey being interrupted briefly by a stop at Vienna , where they visited Emperor Franz Joseph . Due to growing tensions between Austria and Romania ( the visit took place during the ongoing movement of the Transylvanian Memorandum ) , the couple 's visit was brief and they arrived in the border town of <unk> following a nighttime crossing of Transylvania by train . Marie was warmly welcomed by the Romanian people , who were longing for a more personal monarchy .

 The first years of Marie and Ferdinand 's marriage were not particularly easy , and Marie would later tell her husband that " it is such a shame that we had to waste so many years of our youth just to learn how to live together ! " Gradually , the couple 's relationship became based on a cordial friendship : Marie accorded Ferdinand respect she believed he was due as a man and , later , as king , and he respected her because he realised that she had a better understanding of the world than he did . Eventually , Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were " the best associates , the most loyal companions , but our lives intertwine only in certain matters " . Ferdinand enjoyed Marie 's presence during military marches and consequently , she was frequently invited to this sort of event . 
 Marie gave birth to her first child , Prince Carol , only nine months after the marriage , on 15 October 1893 . Although Marie requested the use of chloroform in order to ease the pains of labour , doctors were reluctant to do so , believing that " women must pay in agony for the sins of Eve " . After Marie 's mother and Queen Victoria insisted , King Carol eventually allowed the use of the drug on his niece @-@ in @-@ law . Marie did not derive much joy from the arrival of her firstborn , later writing that she " felt like turning [ her ] head to the wall " . Similarly , although Marie was constantly reminded by Carol 's wife Elisabeth that childbirth is " the most glorious moment in [ Marie 's ] life " , she could only feel a longing for her mother at the birth of her second child , Princess Elisabeth , in 1894 . After becoming accustomed to life in Romania , Marie began to rejoice at the births of her children , namely Princess Maria ( 1900 – 61 ) , nicknamed " Mignon " in the family , Prince Nicholas ( 1903 – 78 ) , nicknamed " Nicky " , Princess Ileana ( 1909 – 91 ) and Prince Mircea ( 1913 – 16 ) . 
 King Carol and Queen Elisabeth promptly removed Prince Carol and Princess Elisabeth from Marie 's care , considering it inappropriate for them to be raised by their young parents . Marie loved her children , but found it difficult to even scold them at times , thus failing to properly supervise them . Consequently , the royal children were given somewhat of an education , but were never sent to school . As the royal household could not provide what a classroom education would have , most of the children 's personalities became severely flawed as they grew older . Prime Minister Ion G. Duca would later write that " it was like [ King Carol ] wished to leave for Romania heirs completely unprepared for succeeding . " 
 = = = Life at court = = = 
 From the start , Marie had trouble adjusting to life in Romania . Her personality and " high spirits " frequently created controversies at the Romanian court , and she disliked the austere atmosphere of her household . She wrote that she " had not been brought down to Romania to be adored and spoilt and made much of ; she had come to be part of the machinery King Carol had wound up . She had been imported to be trimmed , educated , cut down and trained according to the great man 's conception of things . " When describing her early days in Romania , Marie wrote that " for long hours [ she ] would mope , whilst [ her ] young husband did his military service , all alone in rooms [ she ] hated , heavy German rooms " . Marie 's paternal aunt , the Dowager German Empress , wrote to her daughter , the Crown Princess of Greece , that " Missy of Roumania is more to be pitied than you . The King is a great tyrant in his family , & has crushed the independence in Ferdinand so that no one cares about him , & his beautiful & gifted little wife , I fear , gets into scrapes , & like a butterfly , instead of hovering over the flowers , burns her pretty wings by going rather near the fire ! " Easily learning to speak the Romanian language , she followed her mother 's advice to dress carefully and show respect for Orthodox rituals . 
 Marie and Ferdinand were advised by King Carol to maintain a restricted group of friends ; thus , Marie would lament that her familial circle had been shrunk to only the King and Ferdinand , " who stood in mighty awe of the iron old man , forever trembling that any action of [ hers ] might displease that duty @-@ bound head of the family " . The Times Literary Supplement wrote that Marie had found herself , " from the hour of her arrival in Bucharest under the tutelage of that stern disciplinarian King Carol I " . 
 In 1896 , Ferdinand and Marie moved to Cotroceni Palace , which had been extended by the Romanian architect Grigore <unk> , and to which Marie added her own designs . The following year , Ferdinand was struck down with typhoid fever . For days , he was delirious and , despite his doctor 's best efforts , came close to dying . During this time , Marie exchanged numerous letters with her family in Britain and was terrified at the prospect of losing her husband . King Carol still had an heir in Prince Carol , whose young age presented issues ; thus , the whole family desperately wished for Ferdinand to pull through . Eventually , he did , and he and Marie went to Sinaia , the site of <unk> Castle , for a period of recovery . Nonetheless , the couple was not able to attend celebrations for Queen Victoria 's diamond jubilee that summer . During Ferdinand 's convalescence , Marie spent most of her time with her two children , taking them on long walks and picking flowers with them . The winter of 1897 / 1898 was spent with the Russian Imperial family on the French Riviera , where Marie often rode horses , in spite of the low temperatures . 
 Around this time , Marie met Lieutenant Gheorghe Cantacuzène , a member , albeit through an illegitimate branch , of an ancient Romanian princely family and a descendant of Prince Șerban Cantacuzino . Although not very good looking , Cantacuzène stood out using his sense of humour and fashion , as well as his talent in horse @-@ riding . The two soon became romantically involved , but their affair was terminated after it became known by the public . As much as she condemned Marie 's behaviour , her mother allowed her to come to Coburg when , in 1897 , she apparently became pregnant . Historian Julia <unk> believes that Marie gave birth to a child at Coburg ; the child may either have been stillborn or sent to an orphanage immediately following its birth . There was speculation on whether Marie 's second daughter , " Mignon " , was Cantacuzène 's daughter , and not Ferdinand 's . Over the following years , Marie was also rumoured to have been romantically linked to Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia , Waldorf Astor , Prince Barbu Știrbey and Joe Boyle . In 1903 , Ferdinand and Marie inaugurated Pelișor , an Art Nouveau castle in Sinaia that King Carol commissioned for the royal couple . Marie only learned of the extent of repression used to quell the 1907 Romanian Peasants ' Revolt once it was too late to intercede . She afterwards took to dressing quite often in folk costume , both at home and in public , initiating a fashion trend among young upper @-@ class women . 
 On 29 June 1913 , the Tsardom of Bulgaria declared war on Greece , thus starting the Second Balkan War . On 4 July , Romania entered the war , allying itself with Greece . The war , which lasted a little over a month , was worsened by a cholera epidemic . Marie would look upon her first encounter with an epidemic as a turning point in her life . With the help of Dr. Ioan Cantacuzino and Sister Pucci , a Red Cross nurse , Marie travelled between Romania and Bulgaria , lending a helping hand in hospitals . These events would prepare her for her experiences in the Great War . As a result of the war , Romania gained possession of Southern Dobrudja , including the coastal town of Balchik ( <unk> ) , which Marie would come to cherish in 1924 and use to host her residence . Soon after the war ended , Carol became ill . 
 On 28 June 1914 , at Sarajevo , Archduke Franz Ferdinand , the heir to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire , was assassinated . This came as a shock to Marie and her family , who were vacationing at Sinaia when the news reached them . On 28 July , Austria @-@ Hungary declared war on Serbia and , as Marie saw it , " the world 's peace was torn to shreds " . Then , on 3 August , King Carol held a Crown Council at Sinaia , in order to decide whether Romania should enter the war . Although Carol was in favour of his country supporting Germany and the Central Powers , the council decided against it . Not long after the council , Carol 's illness worsened and he became bed @-@ ridden ; the possibility of his abdication was even discussed . Eventually , he died on 10 October 1914 and Ferdinand automatically succeeded as king .

 On 11 October 1914 , Marie and Ferdinand were acclaimed as king and queen in the Chamber of Deputies . Princess Anne Marie Callimachi , a close friend of Marie 's , wrote that " as Crown Princess , [ Marie ] had been popular ; as queen , she was more loved " . Marie maintained a certain influence on her husband and the entire court , leading historian A. L. <unk> to write that " it was not [ Ferdinand ] , but Marie who ruled in Romania " . At the time of Ferdinand 's ascension , the government was led by the liberal prime minister Ion I. C. Brătianu . Ferdinand and Marie jointly decided to not make many changes in court and let people accept the transition from one regime to another , rather than force them . Thus , many of Carol and Elisabeth 's servants were kept in place , even the ones who were not particularly liked . With Brătianu 's help , Marie began pressuring Ferdinand into entering the war ; concurrently , she contacted various reigning relatives in Europe and bargained for the best terms for Romania , in case the country would enter the war . Marie favoured an alliance with the Triple Entente ( Russia , France and Britain ) , partly because of her British ancestry . Neutrality was not without perils , and entering the war with the Entente meant that Romania would act as Russia 's " buffer " against possible attacks . 
 Eventually , Marie demanded of Ferdinand in no uncertain terms that he enter the war , leading the French minister to Romania , Auguste Félix de <unk> , Count of Saint @-@ Aulaire , to remark that Marie was twice an ally to the French : once by birth and once by heart . Ferdinand gave in to Marie 's pleas , and he signed a treaty with the Entente on 17 August 1916 . On 27 August , Romania formally declared war on Austria @-@ Hungary . Saint @-@ Aulaire wrote that Marie " embraced war as another might embrace religion " . After informing their children that their country had entered the war , Ferdinand and Marie dismissed their German servants , who could only remain in their service as " war prisoners " of sorts . Early on during the war , Marie was involved in aiding the Romanian Red Cross and visited hospitals daily . During the first month of war , Romania fought no less than nine battles , some on Romanian soil , such as the Battle of <unk> . 
 On 2 November 1916 , Marie 's youngest son , Prince Mircea , who had been sick with typhoid fever , died at Buftea . Marie was distraught and wrote in her journal : " Can anything ever be the same ? " After Bucharest fell to Austrian troops , the royal court was transferred to Iași , capital of the Moldavia region , in December 1916 . There , she continued to act as a nurse in military hospitals . Daily , Marie would dress as a nurse and go to the train station , where she would receive more injured soldiers ; then she would transport them to hospital . 
 After the conclusion of the Russian Revolution in early November 1917 and the victory of the Bolsheviks , Romania became , in the words of diplomat Frank Rattigan , " an island surrounded on all sides by the enemy , with no hope of assistance from the Allies " . Soon afterwards , Ferdinand signed the Treaty of Focșani , on 9 December 1917 . Marie considered the treaty perilous , while Brătianu and Știrbey believed it was a necessary measure for obtaining more time . Later turns of events would prove Marie to have assumed correctly . In 1918 , Marie vehemently opposed the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest , giving rise to her description as " truly the only man in Romania " . The Armistice with Germany ( 11 November 1918 ) put an end to fighting in Europe and , thus , to the war . 
 In the tenth century , the Principality of Hungary had begun conquering Transylvania , which Hungarians had fully occupied by around 1200 . The idea of a " Greater Romania " had existed in the minds of Romanians in Transylvania for some time and Brătianu had actively supported the concept before the war . In 1918 , both Bessarabia and Bukovina voted for union with Romania . An assembly took place in the ancient city of Alba Iulia on 1 December 1918 , where Vasile <unk> read the resolution for the union of Transylvania with the Old Kingdom . This document , supported by Romanian as well as Saxon deputies , established a High National Romanian Council ( Romanian : <unk> <unk> <unk> Român ) for the province 's temporary administration . Marie wrote , " the dream of România Mare seems to be becoming a reality ... it is all so incredible that I hardly dare believe it . " After the assembly , Ferdinand and Marie returned to Bucharest , where they were met by general mirth : " a day of ' wild , delirious enthusiasm ' , with the bands crashing and the troops marching and the people cheering " . Allied troops took part in the celebration and Marie was elated to see the Entente on Romanian soil for the first time . 
 = = = Paris Peace Conference = = = 
 Because Ferdinand had refused to sign the Treaty of Bucharest and because Romania had been hostile towards the Central Powers until the end of the war , its place among the winning countries during the Paris Peace Conference was guaranteed . The official delegation was led by Brătianu , who had just begun his third term as Prime Minister . Brătianu 's rigidity , combined with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau 's reluctance to overlook Ferdinand 's acceptance of the Treaty of Bucharest led to open conflict and the Romanian delegation left Paris , much to the dismay of the " Big Four " . Hoping to resolve the situation , Saint @-@ Aulaire suggested that Marie should be sent to the conference instead . The Queen was delighted at the prospect . 
 Marie arrived in Paris on 6 March 1919 . She was immediately popular with the French people , due to her boldness during the War . Upon meeting Marie , Clemenceau abruptly told her , " I don 't like your Prime Minister " , to which she replied , " Perhaps then you 'll find me more agreeable . " He did , and president Raymond Poincaré noticed a change in Clemenceau 's attitude towards Romania after Marie 's arrival . After staying in Paris for a week , Marie accepted King George V and Queen Mary 's invitation and crossed the English Channel , lodging at Buckingham Palace . Hoping to acquire as much goodwill for Romania as possible , Marie became acquainted with many important political figures of the time , including Lord Curzon , Winston Churchill and Waldorf and Nancy Astor . She also frequently visited her son Nicky , who was then in school at Eton College . Marie was elated to have returned to England after so much time , writing that " it was a tremendous emotion to arrive in London , and to be greeted at the station by George and May . " 
 After the end of her visit in England , Marie returned to Paris , where the people were just as excited for her arrival as they had been a few weeks before . Crowds gathered around her frequently , waiting to see the " exotic " Queen of Romania . American President Woodrow Wilson remained unimpressed by Marie , and her comments on Russian laws dealing with sexual relations , which were considered inappropriate , did not help . Marie shocked many officials by waving all her ministers aside and leading negotiations herself . On this , she would later comment , " Never mind , you 'll all just have to get used to accepting me with the faults of my virtues . " Marie left Paris with numerous supplies for Romania 's relief and later that year , the conference resulted in the international recognition of Greater Romania , thus doubling Ferdinand and Marie 's kingdom to 295 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 114 @,@ 000 sq mi ) and increasing the population by ten million . This led Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia , who briefly lived in Bucharest , to conclude that " by her charm , beauty , and ready wit , [ Marie ] could obtain anything she desired " . 
 = = = Dynastic efforts = = = 
 In 1920 , Marie 's eldest daughter , Princess Elisabeth , was engaged to Prince George of Greece , the eldest son of the deposed King Constantine I of Greece and Marie 's cousin Sophia . After inviting George and his two sisters , the Princesses Helen and Irene , to lodge with them at Sinaia , Marie organised numerous activities for the young couple and was delighted at the prospect of marrying off her daughter , whose character was severely flawed . In October , reports of King Alexander 's death came from Greece ; the Greek princesses needed to be returned to their parents as soon as possible . The following day , news arrived that Marie 's mother had died in her sleep in Zurich . Marie made arrangements for her departure to Switzerland , where she would take Helen and Irene to their parents and arrange her mother 's funeral . Meanwhile , George and Elisabeth would remain at Sinaia . 
 Soon enough , Crown Prince Carol proposed to Princess Helen and they were married the following year . Marie was delighted , as she had frowned upon Carol 's relationship with Zizi <unk> and had been worried at the birth of their illegitimate son Carol , who , to her great relief , had been given his mother 's surname . In 1922 , Marie married her second daughter , " Mignon " , to Alexander I of Serbia ( later of Yugoslavia ) . She was delighted at the births of her two royal grandsons , Prince Michael of Romania ( b . 1921 ) and Prince Peter of Yugoslavia ( 1923 – 1970 ) ; the births of two grandchildren destined to sit on Europe 's thrones seemed to cement her ambitions . Marie 's dynastic efforts were viewed by critics as those of a manipulative mother who would sacrifice her children 's happiness in order to fulfil her ambitions ; in reality , Marie never forced any of her children to marry . 
 In 1924 , Ferdinand and Marie undertook a diplomatic tour of France , Switzerland , Belgium and the United Kingdom . In England , she was warmly welcomed by George V , who declared that " apart from the common aims , which we pursue , there are other and dear ties between us . Her Majesty the Queen , my dear cousin , is British born . " Similarly , Marie wrote that the day of her arrival in England was " a great day for me , one of emotions , sweet , happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen to my own country , to be received officially , in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to feel your heart swell with pride and satisfaction , to feel your heart beat and tears start into your eyes , while something gave you a lump into your throat ! " These state visits were a symbolic recognition of the prestige Romania had gained after World War I. Whilst visiting Geneva , Marie and Ferdinand became the first royals to enter the newly established headquarters of the League of Nations . 
 = = = Coronation = = = 
 The location for Marie and Ferdinand 's coronation was Alba Iulia , which had been an important fortress in the Middle Ages and where Michael the Brave had been declared Voivode of Transylvania in 1599 , thus uniting Wallachia and Transylvania for the first time . An Orthodox cathedral was built as the Coronation Cathedral in 1921 @-@ 1922 . An elaborate set of jewellery and clothing was made especially for the coronation . Marie 's crown was designed by painter Costin Petrescu and it was made in the Art Nouveau style by " <unk> " , a Parisian jewelry house . The crown was inspired by that of Despina , the wife of 16th @-@ century Wallachian ruler Neagoe Basarab , and it was made entirely out of Transylvanian gold . The crown had two pendants on the sides ; one contained an image of the royal arms of Romania and the other , the arms of the Duke of Edinburgh , which Marie had used as her own arms prior to her marriage . The crown , which cost around 65 @,@ 000 francs , was paid for by the state , via a special law . 
 Among the guests at the royal couple 's coronation were Marie 's sister " Baby Bee " , the Duke of York and French generals Maxime Weygand and Henri Mathias Berthelot . The ceremony was conducted by the Metropolitan of All Romania , Miron <unk> , but it was not performed inside the cathedral as Ferdinand , a Roman Catholic , refused to be crowned by a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church . After placing his crown on his own head , Ferdinand crowned Marie , who had knelt before him . Immediately , cannons were fired as a sign that the first king and queen of Greater Romania had been anointed . A feast was given in the same room where the union had been proclaimed in 1918 ; there , more than 20 @,@ 000 peasants were offered roast steaks . The following day , Ferdinand and Marie triumphantly entered Bucharest . The splendour of the coronation was subsequently cited as evidence of Marie 's theatricality . Marie would be received into the Romanian Orthodox Church in 1926 , mentioning a desire to be closer to her people . 
 = = = Visit to America = = = 
 The Maryhill Museum of Art in Maryhill , Washington was initially designed as a mansion for wealthy businessman Samuel Hill . However , at Loie Fuller 's behest , the building was turned into a museum instead . Hill wished it to be dedicated in 1926 , and he conceived it as a monument to peace , to his wife Mary , and to Queen Marie herself . Marie agreed to come to America and witness the dedication , especially as Fuller was an old friend of hers . Fuller quickly put together a committee that supported Marie 's " tour " of America and arrangements were made for her departure . Marie viewed the tour as an opportunity to " see the country , meet the people and put Romania on the map " . She travelled by ship across the Atlantic Ocean and disembarked in New York , on 18 October 1926 , accompanied by Prince Nicholas and Princess Ileana . 
 Upon her arrival , Marie was welcomed enthusiastically by the American people , with " whistle of steamers , roar of guns in white smoke puffs against gray fog , voices cheering in a stinging rain " . She was formally greeted by Jimmy Walker , the serving Mayor of New York City . Constance Lily Morris , author of On Tour with Queen Marie , wrote that the people were excited for Marie 's arrival mainly because of her almost mythical allure , which had been created by papers and rumour throughout her life ; she observed that " the modest Queen of the Belgians had once come with her king for a brief visit and years ago the dusky Hawaiian ruler had honored us , but there had been no others . The time could not have been better set . " Marie was also fairly popular within suffragette circles , where she was viewed as " a woman whose wits had devised many a coup d 'état , whose brains had thought out many a difficult problem for her people , who had used the gifts given her to further every good purpose " . 
 During their time in America , Marie , Nicholas and Ileana undertook tours of several cities , including Philadelphia . They were very popular , and were greeted with equal enthusiasm in each city they visited , so much so that " [ Nicholas and Ileana ] seemed fairly dazed by their tremendous ovation " . Before leaving the United States , Marie was presented with a bullet @-@ proof armored town car by Willys @-@ Knight , which she joyfully accepted . On 24 November , Marie and her children were seen off by a delegation from Washington , D.C. , as they prepared to leave by ship from New York Harbour . Morris wrote that " our last view was of Her Majesty , her children on either side , waving back with that tear @-@ and @-@ smile of those who pass from happy scenes . " Morris accompanied the queen throughout her journey and offered a very detailed account of Marie 's time in America in her book , published in 1927 . 
 Marie was delighted with the visit , and wished to return to America as soon as possible . She wrote in her diaries : 
 " both my children and I have but one dream : to return ! To return to that stupendous New World , which makes you almost <unk> [ sic ] because of its <unk> , [ sic ] its noise , its striving , its fearful impetuous [ sic ] to get on , to do always more , always bigger , quicker , more astonishingly a restless , flaring great world , where I think everything can be realised ... I know , as long as I live , breathe and think , the love for America will beautify my life and thoughts ... Perhaps Fate will allow me one day to go back to America . "

 Prince Carol sparked a dynastic crisis when he officially renounced his rights to succeed Ferdinand on 5 January 1926 , simultaneously waiving all parental rights over Prince Michael , who had been proclaimed heir . A Provisional Regency Bill was passed , creating a regency council composed of Prince Nicholas ; the Orthodox Patriarch , Miron <unk> ; and Gheorghe <unk> , the president of the Court of Cassation . However , both Marie and Ferdinand were reluctant to leave the country in the hands of a five @-@ year @-@ old boy , even overseen by a regency , for fear that the lands gained during World War I would be reclaimed by neighbouring countries and that political disturbances might lead to civil unrest . Nevertheless , when Marie returned from America , Ferdinand 's death seemed imminent . He was suffering from intestinal cancer , and by April 1927 had come so close to death as to be given the last rites of the Catholic Church . He died on 20 July , in Marie 's arms . She later wrote : " ' I am so tired ' were his last words and when he lay so quiet in my arms one hour later , I knew that I must thank God for him at least . This was rest indeed . " 
 Michael automatically succeeded as king upon Ferdinand 's death and the regency council took charge of his role as monarch . In May 1928 , Carol , who had found his life abroad with Magda Lupescu unsatisfactory , attempted to return to Romania with the help of the 1st Viscount Rothermere . He was prevented from doing so by English authorities , who then proceeded to expel him from England . Infuriated , Marie sent an official apology to George V on behalf of her son , who had already begun plotting a coup d 'état . Carol succeeded in divorcing Princess Helen on 21 June 1928 , on grounds of incompatibility . 
 Marie 's popularity was severely affected during Michael 's reign and , after refusing to be part of the regency council in 1929 , she was accused by the press , and even by Princess Helen , of plotting a coup . During this time , there were numerous rumours as to Princess Ileana 's marriage . After talk of Ileana marrying the Tsar of Bulgaria or the Prince of Asturias , she was eventually betrothed to Alexander , Count of Hochberg , a minor German prince , in early 1930 . This betrothal was , however , short @-@ lived and Marie never managed to conclude a political marriage for her youngest daughter , instead marrying her to the Italian @-@ born Archduke Anton of Austria – Tuscany in 1931 . 
 = = = Carol 's reign = = = 
 On 6 June 1930 , Carol arrived in Bucharest and made his way into Parliament , where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly declared null . Thus , Carol usurped the throne from his son , becoming King Carol II . Upon hearing of Carol 's return , Marie , who was abroad , was relieved . She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol 's return as the return of the Prodigal Son . However , as soon as she arrived in Bucharest , she became aware that things would not go well . Carol refused to accept his mother 's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie 's counsel during his reign , thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete . 
 Desolate and almost stripped of her belief , Marie turned to the religious teachings of the Bahá 'í Faith , which she found " vastly appealing " . Marie was the first member of a royal family to become a Bahá 'í . She later wrote : 
 " The Bahá 'í teaching brings peace and understanding . It is like a wide embrace gathering together all those who have long searched for words of hope . It accepts all great Prophets gone before , it destroys no other creeds and leaves all doors open . Saddened by the continual strife amongst believers of many confessions and wearied of their intolerance towards each other , I discovered in the Bahá 'í teaching the real spirit of Christ so often denied and misunderstood : Unity instead of strife , Hope instead of condemnation , Love instead of hate , and a great reassurance for all men . " 
 In 1931 , Prince Nicholas eloped with Ioana Doletti , a divorced woman . Marie strongly disapproved of her son 's actions and felt hurt by Doletti 's repeated attempts to keep Nicholas from communicating with his mother . Although she blamed the women in her sons ' lives for a while , she also came to blame herself , for failing to educate them properly . However , she stubbornly and continually refused to meet Magda Lupescu , even after Carol 's pleas . Until her last years , Marie seldom even mentioned Lupescu 's name . 
 With Carol 's mistress hated throughout the country , it was only a matter of time before opposition to the King emerged . This opposition most prominently came under the form of the Iron Guard , a group supported by Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler . After Carol turned to Ion Duca for help , the Iron Guard assassinated Duca in December 1933 . After Duca 's death , Carol 's popularity plummeted and there were rumours that an attempt would be made on his life at the annual independence parade . In order to avoid this , he instead had Marie attend the parade , in what would be her final public appearance . 
 After the parade , Carol set out to destroy his mother 's popularity among Romanians and tried to push her out of the country . Marie , however , did not comply , instead retreating to either of two locales . The first was Bran Castle . Located near Brașov in southern Transylvania and given to her as a gift in 1920 by grateful local officials , she had it restored over the next seven years . The other was Balchik , where she had built a palace and a small chapel called Stella Maris and tended to her garden . She also visited Ileana and her children in Austria . Ileana rarely received permission from Carol to visit Romania ; this irritated Marie greatly . She also spent some time in Belgrade with her daughter " Mignon " and her son @-@ in @-@ law , King Alexander . In 1934 , Marie visited England once again , meeting the Duchess of York , later Queen Elizabeth , by whom she was enchanted . 
 = = = Illness and death = = = 
 During the summer of 1937 , Marie fell ill . Her personal physician , Dr. Castellani , determined she had pancreatic cancer , although her official diagnosis was cirrhosis of the liver . Marie had not been a drinker and , upon hearing the news , she reportedly said : " then there must be a non @-@ alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver , because I have never in my life tasted alcohol . " She was prescribed a diet of cold foods , injections and bed rest . Marie was so weak at times that she could not even pick up a pen . In February 1938 , she was sent to a sanatorium in Italy , in hopes that she might recover . There , she was visited by Nicholas and his wife , whom Marie eventually forgave for her transgressions . She was also visited by Princess Helen , whom she had not seen in nearly seven years , and Waldorf Astor . Marie was eventually transferred to a sanatorium in Dresden . Growing weaker and weaker , she requested that she be taken back to Romania , in order to die there . Carol denied her a journey by aeroplane , and she declined a medical flight offered by Hitler , instead choosing to return to Romania by train . She was brought to Pelișor Castle . 
 Marie died on 18 July 1938 , at 5 : 38 p.m. , eight minutes after lapsing into a coma . Her two eldest children , Carol and Elisabeth , accompanied by Prince Michael , were at her deathbed . Two days later , on 20 July , Marie 's body was brought to Bucharest , where she lay in state in the white drawing room at Cotroceni Palace . Her coffin was surrounded by flowers and glowing tapers and was guarded by officers of the Fourth Hussars . Thousands of people filed by Marie 's bier during the three @-@ day lying in state and , on the third day , the palace was opened for factory workers . Marie 's funeral cortege made its way to the train station , passing under the Arch of Triumph . Her coffin was taken to Curtea de Argeș Monastery , where she was interred . Marie 's heart , according to her own wishes , was placed in a small golden casket embellished with the emblems of the Romanian provinces and interred in her Stella Maris chapel in Balchik . In 1940 , after Southern Dobrudja was ceded to Bulgaria during World War II , her heart was transferred to Bran Castle . There , Ileana built a chapel to house the heart , kept in two nested boxes placed inside a marble sarcophagus . 
 Marie was the last Queen consort of Romania , as Princess Helen was only ever awarded the title of Queen Mother between 1940 and 1947 . She was one of Queen Victoria 's five crowned granddaughters and one of three to retain their position as consort after the conclusion of World War I , alongside the Queens of Norway and of Spain . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 According to one of her biographers , Diana <unk> , Marie published 34 books and short stories , both in Romanian and English , during her lifetime . This included her critically acclaimed autobiography , The Story of My Life , published by Cassell in London , in three volumes . The book was reviewed by Virginia Woolf , who felt it was too familiarizing of the royal family . She stated that " suppose that among the autumn books of 2034 is Prometheus Unbound , by George the Sixth , or Wuthering Heights , by Elizabeth the Second , what will be the effect upon their loyal subjects ? Will the British Empire survive ? Will Buckingham Palace look as solid then as it does now ? Words are dangerous things , let us remember . A republic might be brought into being by a poem . " Marie kept a diary from December 1918 until shortly before her death , and the first volume was published in 1996 . 
 Even before her ascension as queen , Marie had succeeded in establishing her public image as that of " one of the best @-@ looking and richest princesses in Europe " . She was known primarily for her talent in horse @-@ riding , writing , painting , sculpting , dancing and for her beauty . Her popularity was dimmed by two slanderous campaigns : that conducted by the Central Powers during World War I ; and that led by communist officials after Romania 's transition to a Socialist Republic in 1947 . 
 During Romania 's 42 years under communist rule , Marie was alternately depicted as either an " agent of English capitalism " or as a devoted patriot who believed that her destiny was intertwined with that of Romania . In the 1949 <unk> istorie a <unk> <unk> ( " The True History of a Monarchy " ) , author Alexandru <unk> refers to orgies that supposedly were held by Marie at Cotroceni and Balchik and claims that , in fact , her cirrhosis was caused by her heavy drinking , even offering examples of instances when a drunken Marie needed to be carried out of a yacht by her fellow drinkers . Marie 's supposed extramarital affairs were brought forward as evidence of promiscuity , which contravened communist values . In 1968 , communist officials vandalised the chapel sheltering Marie 's heart , opening the sarcophagus and taking the boxes as well as the heart into Bran Castle . In 1971 , these were transferred to Bucharest 's National Museum of Romanian History . It was not until the late period of Nicolae Ceaușescu 's regime , the last years before the Romanian Revolution , that Marie 's merits came to be acknowledged . 
 In Romania , Marie is known by the nickname " Mama <unk> " ( Mother of the Wounded ) , or simply as " Regina Maria " , while in other countries she is remembered as the " Soldier Queen " and " Mamma Regina " . Marie is also nicknamed " the mother @-@ in @-@ law of the Balkans " , due to her children 's marriages among ruling houses in the Balkans . By the time of her death , Marie 's children had ruled in three of the four Balkan countries , Bulgaria excepted , although her descendants no longer occupy any European throne . Marie was called " one of the greatest figures in Romanian history " by Constantin Argetoianu , and in her memory , the Order of the Cross of Queen Marie was established in Romania . 
 Prior to 2009 , many of Marie 's personal belongings were on display at Bran Castle , her residence in her later years , which functions as a museum . That year , when the castle was legally restored to Princess Ileana 's heirs , the Culture Ministry moved the collection of her items to a nearby building , Vama <unk> , which is also open to visitors . In 2015 , the casket containing the queen 's heart was placed on a pedestal in the room at Pelișor where she died ; the display can be viewed by the public . The Maryhill Museum of Art holds a permanent exhibition titled " Marie , Queen of Romania " ; this display includes the queen 's coronation gown , a copy of the crown , silverware , gilt furniture and jewelry , among other items .

 = Cyclone Honorinina = 
 Cyclone Honorinina was a powerful tropical cyclone that struck eastern Madagascar in March 1986 . The eighth named storm of the season , Honorinina formed on March 9 to the south of Diego Garcia . It moved generally to the west @-@ southwest due to a ridge to the south , gradually intensifying . On March 12 , the Météo France office on Réunion ( MFR ) upgraded Honorinina to tropical cyclone status , which is the equivalent of a minimal hurricane . On the next day , the cyclone attained maximum sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 95 mph ) while in the vicinity of Tromelin Island . Honorinina weakened subsequently before making landfall about 40 km ( 25 mi ) north of Toamasina , Madagascar with winds of 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) . The storm weakened further over land , moving southwestward across the country . It emerged into the Mozambique Channel and became extratropical on March 18 . Honorinina turned to the southeast , dissipating on March 23 . 
 Early in its duration , the storm produced gusty winds along St. Brandon , and it later brought gusts of 158 km / h ( 98 mph ) on Tromelin Island . However , effects were worst in Madagascar , especially in Toamasina near where the storm made landfall . Damage spread along 800 km ( 500 mi ) of the coastline and spread 100 km ( 60 mi ) inland from the landfall point , with many towns severely affected . In Toamasina , the cyclone damaged the main port , the airport , and several warehouses , resulting in $ 17 million ( 1986 USD ) of lost inventory . Thousands of houses were damaged , leaving 83 @,@ 885 people homeless ; a housing program earlier set up after Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 was extended to help storm victims after Honorinina . Nationwide , the cyclone killed 99 people and caused $ 150 million ( 1986 USD ) in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On March 8 , a circulation was observed southeast of Diego Garcia and was undergoing tropical cyclogenesis . By the next day , satellite imagery indicated that a tropical storm had formed about 635 km ( 395 mi ) south of the island , given the name Honorinina . On March 9 , the Météo France office in Réunion ( MFR ) began tracking the storm in its database , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 25S . The nascent tropical storm moved generally to the west @-@ southwest , gradually intensifying . On March 11 , the JTWC upgraded Honorinina to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1 minute maximum sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . On the next day , the MFR followed suit by upgrading the storm to tropical cyclone status while it was passing 175 km ( 110 mi ) north of St. Brandon island . 
 After a trough passed eastward , a ridge developed south of Honorinina , which reinforced the southwest track toward Madagascar . On March 13 , the MFR estimated the cyclone attained peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 95 mph ) , while the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . The MFR also estimated the storm was producing gusts of 228 km / h ( 142 mph ) . While near peak intensity , Honorinina passed about 25 km ( 15 mph ) south of Tromelin Island , and subsequently gradually weakened . On March 15 , the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar about 40 km ( 25 mi ) north of Toamasina . Winds at landfall were estimated at 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) , and a barometric pressure of 971 @.@ 2 mbar ( 28 @.@ 68 inHg ) was reported at Toamasina . It rapidly weakened to tropical depression status over land , and the JTWC discontinued advisories on March 16 . The circulation continued southwestward through the island , emerging into the Mozambique Channel on the next day . Thereafter , Honorinina restrengthened slightly over open waters . However , the MFR declared the storm as extratropical on March 18 , based on the satellite appearance . The JTWC again issued advisories on the next day , only to discontinue them on March 20 . Meanwhile , the MFR tracked the cyclone as turning to the south and southeast well south of Madagascar . On March 22 , Honorinina turned back to the south and dissipated within the westerlies . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 Early in its duration , Honorinina passed near St. Brandon , where wind gusts reached 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) . Later , the storm produced wind gusts of 158 km / h ( 98 mph ) on Tromelin Island . The barometric pressure there fell to 972 mbar ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) during the storm 's passage . 
 Before moving ashore mainland Madagascar , the cyclone brushed Île Sainte @-@ Marie with gusts of 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) while also dropping 270 mm ( 11 in ) of rainfall over 24 hours . On mainland Madagascar , damage was heaviest at the port city of Toamasina , where winds also gusted to 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) , and rainfall totaled 455 @.@ 5 mm ( 17 @.@ 93 in ) over 24 hours . Heavy rainfall spread across the island , reaching 180 @.@ 4 mm ( 7 @.@ 10 in ) at Morondava along the west coast . Damage spread along 800 km ( 500 mi ) of the coastline and spread 100 km ( 60 mi ) inland from the landfall point , with many towns severely affected . Damage was heaviest in Toamasina , where the cyclone 's winds struck for 30 hours . High waves broke off a 50 m ( 160 ft ) section of the port jetty , leaving it susceptible to future storms . The tides also washed away shipping containers and flooded a coastal road . The damaged port warehouses resulted in the loss of 4000 tons of rice and 990 tons of stored cloves and cotton , as well as 1 @,@ 900 tons of coffee . Collectively , the lost stored product totaled around $ 17 million ( 1986 USD ) . Also in Toamasina , the cyclone damaged navigational systems , forcing the airport to close to all but light aircraft . 
 Outside of Toamasina , Honorinina damaged roads and rail lines connecting the city with the capital , Antananarivo . Several other roads were damaged by landslides or washouts , and many bridges were damaged . The high winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes along the storm 's path , leaving 83 @,@ 885 people homeless . Many of the damaged homes lost their roofs , which resulted in additional damage when the heavy rainfall affected their interiors . The high winds also damaged many public buildings and factories along its path . The cyclone left widespread areas without water or power ; the storm damaged electrical transmission and generation facilities . The high rainfall damaged dykes in <unk> and along the Ikopa and <unk> rivers . Across the country , Honorinina killed 99 people , and caused 424 injuries . Damage totaled about $ 150 million ( 1986 USD ) . 
 On March 20 , the government of Madagascar appealed to the international community for assistance , due to the heavy damage from the cyclone . In response to the request , various governments and international organizations provided assistance to Madagascar , including $ 490 @,@ 000 from the European Economic Community for food and blankets , as well as $ 125 @,@ 000 from UNICEF for medicine and building supplies . Catholic Relief Services donated clothing , rice , and milk from Caritas Madagascar . Countries that provided assistance included China , France , the United Kingdom , the United States , West Germany , Holy See , Mauritius , Canada , Finland , New Zealand , Norway , Sweden , Soviet Union , and Switzerland . Collectively , the international community provided $ 3 @.@ 37 million worth of aid to Madagascar . The United States Pacific Command flew from the Philippines to Madagascar to deliver medicine . The nation had earlier helped Madagascar recover from Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 with housing rebuilding projects , and transferred materials due to the impacts from Honorinina to the Toamasina area . The Malagasy government also set up a National Relief Committee to facilitate relief efforts , including an initial inspection of the affected area to determine needs . Workers delivered about 19 tons of material to Toamasina and nearby Brickaville , including milk , blankets , and clothing . The World Bank estimated the cost for repairing commercial areas would be over $ 27 million ( 1986 USD ) . The agency also allocated funds toward repairing damaged power facilities , ports , roads , and airports . The International Monetary Fund also approved a $ 37 @.@ 8 million loan to the country in 1986 , half of which for emergency aid . Many houses and buildings had to be closed for repairs due to flood damage , including hotels , churches , and schools . 
 = Vulcanodon = 
 Vulcanodon ( meaning " volcano tooth " ) is an extinct genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of southern Africa . The only known species is V. <unk> . Discovered in 1969 in Rhodesia ( now known as Zimbabwe ) , it was regarded as the earliest known sauropod for decades , and is still one of the most primitive sauropods that has been discovered . As a quadrupedal , ground @-@ dwelling herbivore , Vulcanodon already showed the typical sauropod body plan with column @-@ like legs and a long neck and tail . It was much smaller than most other sauropods , measuring approximately 6 @.@ 5 metres ( 20 ft ) in length . Vulcanodon is known from a fragmentary skeleton including much of the pelvic girdle , hind limbs , forearms , and tail , but lacking the trunk and neck vertebrae as well as the skull . 
 Originally , this genus was believed to be a prosauropod because of the knife @-@ shaped teeth found near its fossils , which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous . Scientists now know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass . Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod . Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus , both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae , though this has not been universally accepted . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Vulcanodon ( lat . Vulcanus – Roman god of fire ; <unk> odon – " tooth " ) was named by Michael Raath in 1972 . The name points to the fact that the skeleton was found in a small body of sandstone that is sandwiched between two lava flows , and emphasizes the peculiar knife @-@ shaped teeth that are now known to belong to a theropod . The species name , <unk> , refers to the place of discovery on a small island in Lake Kariba . 
 = = Description = = 
 Vulcanodon was a small sauropod , measuring approximately 6 @.@ 5 m ( 21 ft ) in length . As one of the earliest and basalmost sauropods , it is important for understanding the early evolution of this group . Sauropods descend from basal sauropodomorphs ( informally called " prosauropods " ) , which were primitively bipedal ( two legged ) . While Vulcanodon already was fully quadrupedal ( four legged ) , its limb proportions were intermediate between those of its prosauropod ancestors and those of later , more derived sauropods . Its forelimbs were much more similar to later sauropods than basal sauropodomorphs because they are straight , much more gracile , and the proximal end of the ulna is v @-@ shaped . Unfortunately , no skull or neck of Vulcanodon is known , although it is otherwise very well @-@ known . 
 = = = <unk> and pelvis = = = 
 <unk> limbs were sturdy and column @-@ like , and its forelimbs were already proportionally long , reaching 76 % of hindlimb length . Its lower leg , metatarsus , and toes were shortened in comparison to its bipedal ancestors , but still not as short as in later sauropods . The sacrum was made out of four fused sacral vertebrae ; " prosauropods " possessed only three sacrals . The tail vertebra bodies already showed an incipient excavation of their lateral sides , saving weight and giving them a waisted appearance when viewed from below . In later sauropods , this excavations were enlarged to form extensive pockets called pleurocoels . Contrasting the many sauropod @-@ like features of the skeleton , the pelvis was relatively primitive , reminiscent of its " prosauropod " ancestors . One such feature is that the brevis shelf of the ilium has a fossa , which is not found in any more derived sauropods . 
 The hallux ( the first toe of the foot ) showed a large claw that was flattened laterally , as seen in " prosauropods " . However , the claws of the second and third toe were unusual in being nail @-@ like and broader than deep . This feature was also found in the probably closely related Tazoudasaurus , but is absent in all other sauropods . The feet of Vulcanodon were semiplantigrade as in later sauropods ( where both the digits and part of the metatarsals contact the ground ) , a derived feature not found in more basal sauropods like <unk> . However , they also retained primitive features , like the fact that the phalanges were not reduced . 
 Many of the features found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack are related to the change in body size . The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis . For example , an elongating of the ilium , size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf , and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified . Vulcanodon possessed these features , the latter of which is seen earliest in it . However , Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges , which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods . This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing , they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Originally , Michael Raath ( 1972 ) described Vulcanodon not as a sauropod but as an advanced , specialized prosauropod , possibly of the family <unk> . According to Raath , the sauropod @-@ like limb proportions have been independently evolved in Vulcanodon and sauropods ( convergent evolution ) . He argued that primitive features of the pelvis as well as the knife @-@ shaped teeth preclude a classification within the Sauropoda . The teeth , however , are now known to belong to a theropod . Arthur Cruickshank ( 1975 ) was the first to show that Vulcanodon was indeed a sauropod , arguing that the fifth metatarsal bone was equally long as the remaining metatarsals , a condition seen in other sauropods but not in prosauropods . Today , Vulcanodon is universally accepted to be one of the most basal ( primitive ) members of Sauropoda . 
 Michael Cooper ( 1984 ) erected a new family , the Vulcanodontidae , which he regarded as the " rootstock " for later sauropod families . Originally , the Vulcanodontidae included Vulcanodon and the Indian Barapasaurus , but subsequent studies attributed a number of other , much more fragmentary early sauropod genera to this family , including <unk> and <unk> . Paul Upchurch ( 1995 ) showed that Barapasaurus was more closely related to later , more advanced sauropods than to Vulcanodon , rendering the Vulcanodontidae polyphyletic and therefore invalid . 
 The exact relationships with other basal sauropod genera remain unclear . Ronan Allain and colleagues ( 2004 , 2008 ) found that Vulcanodon is most closely related to Tazoudasaurus , a newly discovered sauropod genus from Morocco . These researchers suggested reintroducing the name Vulcanodontidae to name the clade containing Vulcanodon and Tazoudasaurus . However , this sibling relationship between Tazoudasaurus and Vulcanodon could not be confirmed by other analyses . 
 Adam Yates ( 2004 ) described a single sauropod tail vertebra from the Upper Elliot Formation of South Africa that may belong to a genus closely related to Vulcanodon . The Upper Elliot Formation is famous for its abundant fossils of the prosauropod Massospondylus . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Vulcanodon is known only from a single locality on an island in Lake Kariba , the largest artificial lake in the world , in northern Zimbabwe ( formerly Rhodesia ) . The island , located west of Bumi Hills , is called " Island 126 / 127 " , after early , unpublished lake charts , but has no formal name . The first bone was found by B. A. Gibson of the town of Kariba in July 1969 , and an excavation team collected the specimen in October 1969 , March 1970 and May 1970 . In the later half of 1970 , the new find was presented at a scientific symposium in Cape Town and a brief note was published . The find was formally described in July 1972 by palaeontologist Michael Raath . It was one of the first dinosaurs found in Zimbabwe . 
 The skeleton ( catalogue number <unk> ) has been found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface <unk> and plant roots . It includes the pelvis and sacrum , most of the left hind limb and foot , a right thigh bone , and 12 anterior tail vertebrae . These remains pertain to a single individual as they were all found articulated ( still connected together ) . Additionally , several disarticulated bones were found , including the right forearm and some <unk> and phalanges from both the right and left forefeet , probably also pertaining to this individual . Later , the site was revisited by the scientists G. Bond and Michael Cooper , who were able to collect additional remains including a scapula ( shoulder blade ) and a fragment of a neck vertebra . These remains show that more than one individual was present , and it is possible that they do not pertain to Vulcanodon at all . Today , the Vulcanodon remains are stored in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo . 
 Raath ( 1972 ) noted the discovery of nine fragmentary carnivorous teeth near the pelvic region of the skeleton . He argued that the Vulcanodon carcass might have been embedded with the head and neck bended backwards above the pelvis , a posture called death pose that is frequently seen in dinosaur skeletons . The teeth would have been the only preserved elements of the skull . However , as shown by Cooper ( 1984 ) , these teeth do not pertain to Vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass . 
 = = Paleoecology = = 
 During the later part of the Lower Jurassic , southern Africa was the scene of massive volcanism , resulting in extensive lava flows ( so called flood basalts ) that covered much of southern Africa and Antarctica . These basalt formations are known as the Karoo @-@ Ferrar large igneous province . Vulcanodon comes from the " Vulcanodon beds " , a fossil @-@ bearing sediment unit within the <unk> Formation , which is composed primarily of flood basalts . The skeleton was found near the top of a 30 m ( 98 @.@ 5 ft ) thick bedded layer of sand- and siltstone that is over- and underlain by flood basalts . 
 It was long assumed that Vulcanodon lived during the lowermost ( earliest ) part of the Jurassic ( the Hettangian stage ) or at the Triassic @-@ Jurassic boundary , approximately 200 million years ago . Therefore , it was regarded the earliest sauropod known , until the discovery of the even older Late Triassic <unk> was announced in 2000 . Adam Yates ( 2004 ) has recently shown that Vulcanodon is actually much younger than previously thought , dating to the uppermost ( latest ) part of the Lower Jurassic during the <unk> stage , approximately 175 – 183 million years ago . – thus , it is contemporary to the closely related Tazoudasaurus . Although the locality of Vulcanodon itself cannot be dated radiometrically because of weathering of the lavas , it would roughly be a contemporary to <unk> lavas from other localities , as the entire sequence of volcanic eruptions was finished within one million years . 
 Vulcanodon is the only named dinosaur from the Vulcanodon beds . Cooper ( 1984 ) noted that the habitat was desert @-@ like , as indicated by aeolian ( wind @-@ blown ) sands of the Forest Sandstone Formation , which underlies the " Vulcanodon beds " . The sediments in which Vulcanodon was found may represent distal alluvial fan deposits which levelled off into a desert landscape , which may have contained lakes during the wet season . The individual may have roamed the shores of wadis that cut into the alluvial fan deposits , unless the carcass was transported to the locality it was found by flooding . 
 Initially , sauropods were thought to be mainly aquatic , inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the buoyancy of water to support their giant body weights . In 1984 , Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon , the most primitive sauropod known at that time , lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial . This indicated that the large body size of sauropods , as already seen in Vulcanodon , had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style . 
 = Vaikuntha Chaturmurti = 
 Vaikuntha Chaturmurti or Vaikuntha Vishnu is a four @-@ headed aspect of the Hindu god Vishnu , mostly found in Kashmir ( northern part of the Indian subcontinent ) . The icon represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being . He has a human head , a lion head , a boar head and a demonic head . Sometimes , even three @-@ headed aspects of Vishnu where the demonic rear head is dropped are considered to represent Vaikuntha Chaturmurti . Though iconographical treatises describe him to eight @-@ armed , he is often depicted with four . Generally , Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing but sometimes he is depicted seated on his vahana ( mount ) Garuda . 
 The concept of a four @-@ headed Vishnu first appears in the Hindu epic Mahabharata , but the complete iconography was first found in a 5th @-@ century Pancharatra text . The icon reflects influences from the Gupta period and the Gandhara architectural tradition . While as per one interpretation , the animal heads represent Vishnu 's avatar Narasimha ( lion @-@ headed man ) and Varaha ( boar ) , another theory based on Pancharatra texts relates the four heads to <unk> - Vasudeva ( Krishna ) , Samkarshana ( Balarama ) , Pradyumna and Aniruddha - four vyuhas ( manifestations ) of Vishnu . A cult centered on Vaikuntha Chaturmurti developed in Kashmir in the 8 @-@ 12th century , when the deity also enjoyed royal patronage in the region . The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho suggests his worship in the Chandela kingdom ( Central India ) in the 10th century . 
 = = Names = = 
 The icon is known by various names : Vaikuntha , <unk> ( " Lord of Vaikuntha " ) , Chaturmurti ( " four @-@ fold representation " ) , <unk> ( " four @-@ faced " ) , Para Vasudeva Narayana , Vishnu Chaturmurti , Vishnu <unk> and Vaikuntha <unk> ( " four @-@ faced Vaikuntha " ) . The Vishnudharmottara Purana calls him Vishnu @-@ Vaikuntha . The icon may be called <unk> ( " having four vyuhas " ) , when identified with the four manifestations or vyuhas of Vishnu . 
 Vaikuntha generally refers to Vishnu 's abode , but in the Mahabharata and the Puranas , this term is also used as an epithet of Vishnu . Though no clear etymology of vaikuntha exists , the term is believed to be derived from vi @-@ <unk> , literally meaning " not blunt " . The earliest scriptures like the Vedas , Upanishads and Brahmanas connect the epithet to Indra , the king of the gods and the Supreme god of the era . By the time of the Mahabharata , Vishnu gained the role of Indra and the epithet vaikuntha was transferred to him . The use of vaikuntha in the name also suggests that the form represents the Para ( Ultimate Reality ) form of Vishnu . 
 The name Chaturmurti also appears in the Vishnu sahasranama ( thousand names of Vishnu ) . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 The Pancharatra text Jayakhya @-@ Samhita mentions that Vaikuntha Chaturmurti has four faces : Vaikuntha , Narasimha , Varaha and Kapila and four arms holding the usual attributes of Vishnu : shankha ( conch ) , chakra , gada ( mace ) and padma ( lotus ) . In the Vishnudharmottara Purana , Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is described as having eight arms and four faces , human ( nara - human or <unk> - mild or purusha - man ) facing the East ( front ) , lion ( Narasimha - the lion @-@ headed avatar of Vishnu ) on the South ( his right head , left ) , boar ( Varaha - the boar avatar of Vishnu ) on the North ( his left head , right ) and demonic ( kapila or <unk> - fierce / wrathful or rakshasa - demon ) facing the west ( rear ) . 
 In one of earliest Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images dating from the Gupta era - c . 6th century ( now housed in Mathura Museum ) , the positions of the boar and lion heads are reversed , though this is a rare aberration . The central front face may be smiling . Sometimes , the back face may be omitted . The fourth head may be replaced by a horse ( Hayagriva , another avatar of Vishnu ) or a Chakrapurusha ( the personified Sudarshana Chakra - the discus weapon of Vishnu ) . The kapila head may have a moustache , bulging large eyes , a third eye , grinning teeth , fangs , a short chin , broad eyebrows and a ferocious , grim or sad expression . His hair are generally tied up in a large knot - a jata ( matted hair ) like a sage ; rarely he may wear a crown . 
 The name of the fourth head as Kapila is interpreted in two ways . Taking the literal meaning of kapila as red , it is interpreted as meaning fierce or angry . The epithet kapila is associated with the fire god Agni and the solar deity Surya in early canonical texts . Another theory relates to Vishnu 's sage avatar and founder of Samkhya philosophy , Kapila , who is described as having a wrathful nature and cursing the sons of Sagara to turn into ashes for insulting him . The head @-@ dress <unk> is typical of Brahmin sages like Kapila . The Agni Purana also describes the icon having four heads , without describing the nature of each . The iconographical treatises <unk> and the Rupamandana mention that the fourth head is Shri ( Lakshmi - the wife of Vishnu ) and Stri ( female ) respectively , however no sculptures with a fourth female head have been discovered . The back face may be carved on the halo behind the central three heads in low relief or in a space between the halo . 
 In the iconography of Kashmir , during the 8th and 9th centuries , the gods of Hindu Trimurti - Brahma , Vishnu and Shiva - each are depicted with three heads . In a sculpture displayed in the Metropolitan Art Museum of New York , the four @-@ headed Brahma as well as Shiva are shown with three visible heads . Vishnu is depicted as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti in this configuration , with three visible heads . 
 Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is generally depicted standing . He wears rich clothes ( generally in sculpture , only a dhoti ) as well as various ornaments like a crown , armbands , necklaces etc . , symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita ( sacred thread ) . In his eight arms , he is prescribed in the texts to carry gada ( mace ) , sword , arrow and the Sudarshana Chakra in his left hands and shankha ( conch ) , shield , bow and lotus in his right hands . However , in sculpture , he is often four @-@ armed and in two of his hands , he holds a lotus and a conch , while his other hands rest on the heads of his personified weapons ( ayudhapurusha ) - Gadadevi or <unk> ( gada as a female ) on his right and Chakrapurusha on his left , who stand as small figures besides his legs . They both look upwards towards him and hold fly whisks . A tiny figurine of the earth goddess Prithvi ( who associated with Varaha and Vishnu as his consort ) rises from the pedestal in between his feet , as though supporting the deity . A short dagger or sword may be tucked up in the waist belt of the god near the right hip , a peculiar feature of Kashmir icons . Attendants or devotees may be also shown besides or below Vishnu . Sometimes , Brahma and Shiva and the ten avatars of Vishnu may be depicted in the background . 
 As prescribed in the Jayakhya @-@ Samhita , Vaikuntha Chaturmurti may be depicted as riding his vehicle ( vahana ) Garuda too , though these images are rarer . In this configuration , the god holds a sword , a lotus , a mace or a conch and the chakra . Generally , on four feathers of Garuda sit four female figures , two on either side of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti . The identity of the female figures is uncertain . They are interpreted as two goddesses ( possibly consorts of Vishnu - Lakshmi and Bhumi ) and two female attendants . The Jayakhya @-@ Samhita mentions that four goddesses Lakshmi , Kirti , Jaya and Maya as the female counterparts of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti . Rarely , Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is accompanied with his consort Lakshmi , who sits on his left thigh . This form is called Lakshmi Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya @-@ Samhita . 
 In rare instances , true to the textual descriptions , Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is depicted as eight @-@ armed . Examples of these exist in Kandariya Mahadeva Temple , Khajuraho ; <unk> Mahadeva Temple , Sandera , Gujarat and <unk> Museum . A ten @-@ armed Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is found at <unk> temple , <unk> . A twelve armed Vaikuntha image is categorized as a different form called Ananta by iconographical treatises ; an illustration of the same is found at <unk> Devi temple , <unk> , Chamba . This form is also identified with the Vishvarupa form of Vishnu . Another variant of Vaikuntha image is sixteen @-@ armed and is called <unk> . 
 There are some sculptures that synthesize Vaikuntha form with other forms of Vishnu . A 1170 CE sculpture at Chamba depicts <unk> Vishnu ( Vishnu reclining on the serpent Shesha ) with the three heads of Vaikuntha form . Another sculpture in <unk> Devi Temple , Udaipur combines Trivikrama ( another avatar of Vishnu ) with Vaikuntha 's three heads . 
 = = Development and symbolism = = 
 Vaikuntha Chaturmurti first appears in the Mahabharata , where he is known as <unk> . Besides the four faces , no details of his iconography are found though . The Jayakhya @-@ Samhita , generally dated to the Gupta period ( c . 5th century CE ) , is the first iconographical reference to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti . 
 Though three @-@ faced Vishnu images from the Mathura school exist from the Gupta period , not a single four @-@ faced Vaikuntha Chaturmurti from this era is found till day . It is suggested by scholars that the three @-@ faced Vishnu images should be considered as Vaikuntha Chaturmurti too , where the fourth head was dropped by sculptors just for sake of convenience . An alternate theory dates Jayakhya @-@ Samhita to c . 600 @-@ 850 CE and suggests that the three @-@ faced Vishnu images of Gupta era as well as Gupta icons of Vishvarupa ( another form of Vishnu ) inspired the iconography of the Vaikuntha Chaturmurti , which developed in Kashmir in the 8th century and attached the fourth head on the back of the older icon of a three @-@ faced Vishnu . Though popular in Kashmir , the four @-@ headed icon is rarely seen outside of it . 
 The iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti was influenced by Gandhara architectural tradition , which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India , particularly those made in Kashmir . Keeping with the Gandhara style , the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy . The muscular body is considered to be inflated with prana ( life @-@ breath ) , an Indian concept . The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture . The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence . The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu iconography of Gupta art . They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography , even when he is depicted as one @-@ headed . 
 The central Vishnu head and side heads of Varaha and Narasimha may be influenced by other configurations in architecture . For example , Vishnu , Varaha and Narasimha may be depicted on back ( western ) and side ( northern / southern ) walls of temples . Varaha ( rescues the earth from the cosmic waters at the beginning of an eon ) , Vishnu ( as a human ) and Narasimha ( destroying a demon ) may represent creation , preservation and destruction - the three functions in the Hindu universe . Vaikuntha Chaturmurti represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being , Creator of the Universe . Also , Varaha and Narasimha are oldest in antiquity ( avatars Matsya and Kurma which are described in sacred texts to be appearing before Varaha and Narasimha were associated with Vishnu at a later date ) . Their presence in the iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti suggests that this form originated in the Gupta era , where their cults were at their peak . 
 Many writers associate the boar and lion heads to the avatars Varaha and Narasimha , others associate with the Chaturvyuhas , however the latter is heavily disputed . The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes the Chaturvyuhas - Vasudeva ( Krishna ) , Samkarshana ( Balarama ) , Pradyumna , Aniruddha - four manifestations of Vishnu . Though the text does not explicitly equate the two forms . Many modern <unk> as well as Pancharatra followers associate both of them based on the association of Chaturvyuhas with gunas ( qualities ) in the Vishnudharmottara Purana and the Pancharatra texts . The gunas are in turn associated with Vaikuntha Chaturmurti . The human face is Vasudeva , who symbolizes strength / power ( <unk> ) ; the lion is Samkarshana , who is knowledge / wisdom ( jnana ) personified ; the demonic form is Pradyumna , who is prosperity / sovereignty ( <unk> ) and the boar is Aniruddha , the Lord of energy ( shakti ) . 
 = = Worship = = 
 The presence of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti found in Kashmir and north West India predating 10th century suggests the worship of Vishnu in this form in the era . The form developed a cult between 8th to 10th century CE . The 12th century chronicle <unk> also mentions about the installation of this form of Vishnu . The icon received royal patronage from King <unk> , the founder of Utpala dynasty ( reign : 855 @-@ 883 CE ) ; temples built in his reign often depict Vaikuntha Chaturmurti . Vaikuntha Chaturmurti became the tutelary deity of the <unk> and Utpala dynasties of Kashmir . It was also popular in the regions adjoining Kashmir . 
 The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho is dedicated to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti . Though three @-@ faced , an inscription in the temple suggests that it should be considered four @-@ faced . It also records a legend where Kapila and other demons conjoined together in a single form and were blessed by Brahma that only someone in the same form could slay them so Vishnu took the form of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti . The presence of the Lakshamana Temple in Khajuraho suggests worship in the Chandela kingdom in the 10th century . 
 The <unk> form of Vishnu was worshipped in Gujarat between 12th to 15th century CE . 
 = 1852 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1852 Atlantic hurricane season was one of only three Atlantic hurricane seasons in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status . Five tropical cyclones were reported during the season , which lasted from late August through the middle of October ; these dates fall within the range of most Atlantic tropical cyclone activity , and none of the cyclones coexisted with another . Though there were officially five tropical cyclones in the season , hurricane scholar Michael Chenoweth assessed two of the cyclones as being the same storm . There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season , as meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimated that up to six storms were missed each year from the official database ; this estimate was due to small tropical cyclone size , sparse ship reports , and relatively unpopulated coastlines . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 Every tropical cyclone in the season was of hurricane status , or with winds at or exceeding 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) . In only two other seasons did every cyclone attain hurricane status ; those years were 1858 and 1884 . All five cyclones affected land ; the strongest was the first storm , which caused severe damage and loss of life when it made landfall near the border between Mississippi and Alabama . The second storm of the season struck Puerto Rico , where it caused over 100 deaths , primarily from flooding . In the middle of September , the third storm moved across Florida with strong wind gusts and light rainfall , and a week later the fourth storm passed over or north of the Lesser and Greater Antilles . The last storm hit the Florida Panhandle , though damage was less than expected .

 The first tropical cyclone of the year , also known as the Great Mobile Hurricane of 1852 , was first observed on August 19 about 140 mi ( 230 km ) north of Puerto Rico . It moved on a west @-@ northwest motion before passing through the Bahamas as it attained hurricane status on August 20 . After paralleling the northern coast of Cuba , the storm passed between the Dry Tortugas and Key West , Florida on August 22 , and two days later it is estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . The storm slowed on August 25 before turning northward , and early on August 26 it made landfall near Pascagoula , Mississippi at peak strength , and the hurricane rapidly weakened to tropical storm status as it accelerated east @-@ northeastward . On August 28 it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from South Carolina , and after turning to the northeast , it was last observed on August 30 about 130 mi ( 200 km ) southeast of Cape Cod . 
 In the Florida Keys , rough waves forced several ships ashore , leaving some damaged . Strong waves created four new channels in the Chandeleur Islands , and the storm 's passage also destroyed the island lighthouse ; the three keepers were found three days later . Two schooners were also washed ashore along Cat Island . The hurricane produced an estimated storm tide of 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) in Mobile , Alabama , where strong winds damaged much of the city , leaving the majority of the houses destroyed . Trees were downed up to 30 miles ( 50 km ) inland , and coastal areas were flooded . Damage along the coastline was estimated at around $ 1 million ( 1852 USD , $ 26 million 2008 USD ) , and several lives were lost . While crossing the southeastern United States , the storm brought light rainfall but moderately strong winds ; in Charleston , South Carolina , the storm destroyed several bridges and crop fields .

 Early on September 5 , a hurricane was first observed about 65 mi ( 110 km ) southeast of Christiansted in the Danish Virgin Islands . One meteorologist assessed the hurricane as being located near Antigua on September 3 . Tracking steadily west @-@ northwestward , it quickly moved ashore near Ponce , Puerto Rico with winds estimated at 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . After crossing southwestern Puerto Rico , the hurricane emerged into the Mona Passage as a tropical storm . Late on September 5 it made landfall on eastern Dominican Republic ; it quickly weakened over Hispaniola , dissipating on September 6 over the northwestern portion of the island . An assessment by scholar Michael Chenoweth in 2006 indicated this storm was the same as the next hurricane , with it continuing northwestward and ultimately reaching the Gulf of Mexico . Due to not being considered the same cyclone in the official hurricane database , this hurricane and the following hurricane are listed separately . 
 The cyclone is known as the San Lorenzo hurricane , due to its impact in Puerto Rico . There , the passage of the storm caused severe flooding , which destroyed large quantities of crops and damaged several roads . Storm damage was heaviest between Guayanilla and Mayagüez . More than 100 people were killed in Puerto Rico , many of which due to flooding . 
 = = = Hurricane Three = = = 
 A hurricane was located in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 9 , potentially the same hurricane as the previous storm . It tracked generally eastward toward the coast of Florida , with its hurricane intensity estimation based on two ship reports . At about 0000 UTC on September 12 , it moved ashore near Clearwater , Florida as a minimal hurricane , with an estimated minimum barometric central pressure of 985 mbar . Accelerating east @-@ northeastward while crossing the state , the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened tropical storm before regaining hurricane status on September 13 . Later that day , it was last observed about 250 mi ( 400 km ) east @-@ southeast of Cape Hatteras . 
 A post in Fort Meade , Florida reported at least 0 @.@ 55 in ( 14 mm ) of rainfall during the storm 's passage . The hurricane was considered " violent " , and gusts were estimated to have reached hurricane force . Rough seas and strong easterly winds beached a vessel near St. Augustine . 
 = = = Hurricane Four = = = 
 On September 22 , a tropical storm was located about 200 mi ( 330 km ) east of Guadeloupe . With a steady west @-@ northwest path , the storm moved across the northern Lesser Antilles on September 23 , during which it intensified into a hurricane . It passed a short distance north of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as it reached its peak intensity of 90 mph ( 150 km ) . Late on September 26 the hurricane turned northwestward , bringing it through the Turks and Caicos Islands and eastern Bahamas . Recurving north @-@ northeastward , the cyclone moved into open waters , and was last classified as a tropical cyclone on September 30 about 390 mi ( 630 km ) east of Cape Hatteras . However , one hurricane researcher assessed the hurricane as lasting until October 3 , with the cyclone turning eastward and dissipating near the Azores . 
 = = = Hurricane Five = = = 
 A moderately strong hurricane with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica . Passing a short distance south of the island , the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north @-@ northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico . Late on October 9 , it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola , Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969 mbar . Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status , the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11 . Later that day , it was last observed about 250 mi ( 400 km ) southeast of Cape Cod . 
 Heavy damage was reported in Jamaica . Upon making landfall in Florida , the hurricane produced a 7 ft ( 2 m ) storm tide , and in Georgia , hurricane force winds extended into the southwestern portion of the state , while tropical storm force winds occurred along the coastline . In the state , moderate winds damaged trees and roofs , though the destruction was less than anticipated . 
 = Holy Thorn Reliquary = 
 The Holy Thorn Reliquary was probably created in the 1390s in Paris for John , Duke of Berry , to house a relic of the Crown of Thorns . The reliquary was bequeathed to the British Museum in 1898 by Ferdinand de Rothschild as part of the Waddesdon Bequest . It is one of a small number of major goldsmiths ' works or joyaux that survive from the extravagant world of the courts of the Valois royal family around 1400 . It is made of gold , lavishly decorated with jewels and pearls , and uses the technique of enamelling en ronde bosse , or " in the round " , which had been recently developed when the reliquary was made , to create a total of 28 three @-@ dimensional figures , mostly in white enamel . 
 Except at its base the reliquary is slim , with two faces ; the front view shows the end of the world and the Last Judgement , with the Trinity and saints above and the resurrection of the dead below , and the relic of a single long thorn believed to come from the crown of thorns worn by Jesus when he was crucified . The rear view has less extravagant decoration , mostly in plain gold in low relief , and has doors that opened to display a flat object , now missing , which was presumably another relic . 
 The reliquary was in the Habsburg collections from at least the 16th century until the 1860s , when it was replaced by a forgery during a restoration by an art dealer , Salomon Weininger . The fraud remained undetected until well after the original reliquary came to the British Museum . The reliquary was featured in the BBC 's A History of the World in 100 Objects , in which Neil MacGregor described it as " without question one of the supreme achievements of medieval European metalwork " , and was a highlight of the exhibition Treasures of Heaven : Saints , Relics , and Devotion in Medieval Europe at the British Museum from June 23 to October 2011 . 
 = = History = = 
 King Louis IX of France bought what he believed to be the authentic Crown of Thorns in Constantinople in 1239 , and individual thorns were distributed as gifts by subsequent French kings . John , Duke of Berry ( 1340 – 1416 ) , brother of King Charles V of France , had this reliquary made to house a single thorn ; it was probably made a few years before he commissioned his famous Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry , and some years after he commissioned the Royal Gold Cup , also in the British Museum . Previously dated between 1401 and 1410 , from evidence in John Cherry 's book of 2010 the reliquary is now thought to have been made before 1397 ; based on the heraldic forms used , the museum now dates it to 1390 – 97 . The Holy Thorn Reliquary was later thought to have been in the possession of Louis I , Duke of Orléans , but all recent writers prefer his brother , the Duke of Berry . 
 Its location is unknown until an inventory of 1544 , when it belonged to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , perhaps as an inheritance from his ancestors the Valois Dukes of Burgundy . It presumably passed to the Austrian branch of the Habsburgs on Charles V 's death , as it is listed in several inventories of the Imperial <unk> ( " treasure chamber " ) in Vienna from 1677 onwards . It remained in Vienna until after 1860 , when it appeared in an exhibition . Some time after this it was sent to be restored by Salomon Weininger , an art dealer with access to skilled craftsmen , who secretly made a number of copies . He was later convicted of other forgeries , and died in prison in 1879 , but it was still not realised that he had returned one of his copies of the reliquary to the Imperial collections instead of the original . The Viennese Rothschild family bought the original reliquary by 1872 , in ignorance of its provenance ; it was inherited by Ferdinand de Rothschild , who moved to England , and built Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire . One of the copies remained in the Ecclesiastical Treasury of the Imperial Habsburg Court in Vienna , where the deception remained undetected for several decades . 
 The original reliquary reached the British Museum as part of the Waddesdon Bequest in 1899 , by which time its origins had been " completely lost " and it was described as " Spanish , 16th Century " . Thus its history had to be reconstructed through scholarship ; the meaning of the heraldic plaques on the castle base had by now been lost in both London and Vienna . The first publication to assert that the London reliquary was the one recorded in earlier Viennese inventories was an article by Joseph <unk> in 1927 ; the matter was not finally settled until 1959 when the Viennese version was brought to London to enable close comparison . The assembled experts from the British Museum , Victoria and Albert Museum and <unk> Museum in Vienna agreed that the London reliquary was the original . Under the terms of the Waddesdon Bequest the reliquary cannot leave the museum ; in 2011 it was omitted from the Cleveland and Baltimore legs of the exhibition Treasures of Heaven : Saints , Relics , and Devotion in Medieval Europe . Normally it is on display in Room 45 , the dedicated Waddesdon Bequest Room , as specified in the terms of the bequest . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Holy Thorn Reliquary is made of gold , enamel , rock crystal , pearls , rubies and sapphires . It is just over 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) high and weighs 1 @.@ 4 kilograms ( 3 @.@ 1 lb ) . There are some areas of damage ( including what appears to be deliberate removal of enamel in the 19th century ) , and small losses and repairs ; but generally the reliquary is in good condition . The central front compartment holding the relic is protected by a thin pane of rock crystal , which has kept it in perfect condition . The enamel is mostly in ronde bosse technique , applied to three @-@ dimensional figures , with white as the dominant colour . White enamel using lead was only recently developed , and very fashionable , dominating many contemporary ronde bosse works . There is also red , green , blue , pink and black enamel . Pure gold is used throughout , which is rare even in royal commissions of such pieces at this period ; most use cheaper silver @-@ gilt for the structural framework . 
 The jewels , which would have been keenly appreciated by contemporary viewers , include two large sapphires , one above God the Father at the very top of the reliquary , where it may have represented heaven , and the other below Christ , on which the thorn is mounted . The gold elements framing God the Father and the central compartment with Christ and the thorn are decorated with alternating rubies and pearls , totalling fourteen of each . All the gemstones have the smooth and polished cabochon cut normal in medieval jewellery , and though they are set in the reliquary with gold " claws " , all are drilled through as though for threading on a necklace , suggesting that they are re @-@ used from another piece . There may have been other jewels now lost , for example mounted in two holes on either side of the door of the castle @-@ like base . 
 = = = Front face = = = 
 The design of the front face is based on the general resurrection of the dead following the Last Judgment . At the top sits God the Father , above two angels . A small hole at the level of their knees shows where a dove representing the Holy Spirit was originally attached ; with Christ below , all three persons of the Trinity were therefore represented . A round @-@ topped compartment protected by a rock @-@ crystal " window " holds the relic itself and the group around Christ . Christ in Judgment is shown seated displaying the wounds of his crucifixion , with his feet resting on the globe of the world , and making a blessing gesture . As with all the enamelled figures that are still extant , the hair is in gold , the main robe is in white , and the flesh is in white with coloured eyes and lips , a touch of pink on the cheeks . Behind Christ the celestial spheres are represented like a rainbow , and above him fly two angels holding Instruments of the Passion , including the crown of thorns over his head ; behind him a cross in shallow relief emerges from the curved gold background . The thorn relic rises below and in front of him , mounted on a " monstrously large sapphire " . 
 To the left and right of Christ are shown John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary in supplicant poses , a traditional grouping ; John was also one of the Duke 's patron saints . Around the central scene small figures of the twelve Apostles carrying their identifying attributes emerge from the foliage border of oak leaves and tendrils ; the uppermost heads on each side are replacements , probably by Weininger in the 1860s . 
 Below this upper section there is a gold scroll label with the Latin inscription Ista est una <unk> corone / Domini nostri <unk> <unk> ( " This is a thorn from the crown / Of Our Lord Jesus Christ " ) in black enamel filling the engraved letters . Below the inscription is a scene showing the mass resurrection of naked people rising from their graves on the Day of Judgement . On a green enamel mound like a hillside are four naked figures , two men and two women , emerging from tiny gold coffins whose lids have been upturned on the ground ; the women wear white caps . Four angels blowing horns sound the " Last Trump " of the Book of Revelation , standing on the turrets of a tiny castle which serves as the base of the reliquary . 
 The Last Judgement was an especially appropriate subject for setting a relic from the Crown of Thorns . Some thought that the crown was held by the French kings on loan , and would be reclaimed by Christ on the Day of Judgement — a belief expressed in the antiphon sung at Sens Cathedral in 1239 to celebrate the arrival of the main relic . 
 Two panels on the walls of the castle are patterned with the coat of arms of the Duke of Berry , and their form has been crucial for establishing the provenance and date of the work . Two of the angels with horns have blue fleurs @-@ de @-@ lis on their robes ; the other two , patterns of dots in blue . All the arches of the castle are semicircular , and in fact the whole reliquary lacks any Gothic pointed arches , even among the tracery — a sign of advanced artistic taste at the time . In this respect the Holy Thorn Reliquary contrasts strongly with the Tableau of the Trinity in the Louvre ( possibly made in London ) , whose framework is a forest of crocketed Gothic pinnacles , although estimates of its date cover the same period as the reliquary . 
 = = = Rear face = = = 
 The rear face is plainer , with no jewels , but still highly decorated ; Cherry speculates that it may originally have been much more simple and not designed for viewing , with most of the other elements added after it was originally made . At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst . The central round @-@ topped area contains two doors , secured with a small gold pin , containing full @-@ length gold figures in relief , chased in gold , a feature unique to this reliquary . On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael , spearing a dragon representing the devil . He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy , and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement , when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales . On the right is Saint Christopher , carrying the Christ child on his shoulders , who raises his hand in blessing . There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the last rites , which may well explain his presence here . 
 In the fake in Vienna , the figures of both saints are enamelled ; flesh is white , Michael and the Christ child have red robes , and Christopher blue , and the saints stand on a brownish dragon and blue water respectively , with green grass below both of these . Some scholars have thought it unlikely that the forger invented this scheme , and therefore presumed that he copied enamel on the original that has been removed in the 19th century , probably because it was damaged — sections of enamel cannot be patched up , but must be removed completely and redone . However John Cherry believes this and other changes in the enamel of the Vienna version are elaborations by Weininger and his craftsmen ; for example in Vienna the wings of the trumpeting angels are coloured . The two figures are in a sophisticated " soft and flowing " International Gothic style executed with great virtuosity ; Michael 's staff is detached from the background over most of its length and is one of a number of elements that extend outside the frame of the door . If there was once enamel on the two figures it would have been at least mainly in more fragile translucent enamels , as the very fine working of many details of them was clearly intended to be seen . The rougher working of the surfaces at the bottom of the doors : the dragon below St Michael , the water below St Christopher , and the ground below both of these , suggests that the missing original enamels were opaque in these areas . But all the extra enamel in Vienna is opaque , including the saints ' figures , and the effect of the more intense colours is " lurid " and " offends our eyes because of its crudity " . 
 When the pin is removed and the small doors opened , there is now nothing to see but " a flat layer of plaster , with a sheet of nineteenth @-@ century paper or vellum in front of it " . Whatever was designed to be displayed has now gone ; it must have been flat , and was perhaps another relic , probably a textile , or a picture on vellum . The Veil of Veronica , in either form , is a possibility ; the face of Christ at the top in a circular setting often represents this . Outside the doors the foliate border of the front is continued , uninterrupted by figures . Below two of the angels with trumpets can be seen , with an unpopulated stretch of the green hillside , and below it the back of the castle base , which has apparently had another arched " leg " in the centre crudely removed , leaving a jagged edge , and also making the reliquary rather less stable . 
 = = Goldsmith = = 
 The maker of the work is unknown ; it is not signed or marked , and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this . There are a number of goldsmiths ' names known from accounts and other records , but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker . Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux , secular and religious , produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers . Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions , whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period , but of which there are now only a handful of survivals . Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary , but this was made after 1401 , which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry . Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift , as many such pieces were , in between inventories . 
 = = = Techniques = = = 
 The reliquary exuberantly exploits the ronde bosse or " encrusted " enamelling technique , which involves creating small three @-@ dimensional figures coated in enamel on a metal core , often just gold wire . The technique was a recent innovation which the goldsmiths working for the Valois were pushing to its limits at the end of the 14th century . The main colour of enamel used is a lead @-@ based white , which had also only been developed a decade or two at most before the date of the reliquary , and was evidently very fashionable at the end of the century . White dominates the few surviving large enamels in ronde bosse dated to the period beginning about 1380 and ending about 1410 , used as here for both the clothes and flesh of the figures . Gold is used for their hair , and other enamel colours are mostly used at the neck and cuffs to demarcate between white robes and white flesh ; " throughout , colour is used in a very considered way " ; " a controlled use of red includes the alternation of rubies and pearls " , except where " a single sapphire interrupts this rhythm " above God the Father . Blue , an important enamel colour in other works , is almost entirely absent here , perhaps so as not to overshadow the large sapphires . 
 Other techniques are also used with a great degree of skill ; the large figures on the rear are chased , with St Michael 's wings being represented on the flat surface of the door in delicate stippled or pointillé work using punches , which is too detailed to see in most photographs , and indeed hard to see on the original . Michael 's body is also feathered , stopping at the neck , ankles and wrists , a " most exceptional feature " often referred to as " feather tights " , that perhaps borrows from the costumes of liturgical dramas . Other elements were cast in small moulds , and most of the visible gold has been burnished to give a smooth and shining appearance . 
 = = Patron = = 
 Jean , duc de Berry ( 1340 – 1416 ) , or the " excellent puissant Prince Jehan <unk> de roy de France Duc de Berry " ( " excellent and powerful prince Jean , son of the king of France , Duke of Berry " ) , as his secretary inscribed one of his manuscripts , was the third of the four sons of King John II of France — Charles V , Louis I , Duke of Anjou ( 1339 – 1384 ) , Berry and Philip the Bold , Duke of Burgundy ( 1342 – 1404 ) . All commissioned great numbers of works of art in various media , and in particular spent huge sums on works in gold and silver . Although it is Berry who is especially remembered as a patron , partly because he specialized in illuminated manuscripts which have little value in their materials and so have not been recycled , his brother Louis of Anjou had over 3 @,@ 000 pieces of plate at one point . These included wholly secular pieces with sculptures in enamel that can only be imagined by comparison as regards technique to the handful of reliquaries , like the Holy Thorn Reliquary , that have survived from the period , and as regards subject matter to tapestries and some secular illuminated manuscripts . There are extremely detailed inventories of Berry 's possessions including ones from 1401 – 1403 and 1413 – 1416 , however none contain an entry whose description matches the reliquary . 
 Soon after Berry 's death in 1416 , the bulk of his treasures were seized and melted down by the English , who were occupying much of northern France after their victory at the Battle of Agincourt the previous year . That the reliquary escaped this fate suggests it may have been given away by Berry , perhaps to his Burgundian cousins , in whose family it is next recorded ( the Burgundian heiress Mary of Burgundy married the Habsburg Maximilian I , Holy Roman Emperor in 1477 ) . A reliquary that was donated to the church had a better chance of surviving than the similar secular works that are now only known from their descriptions in inventories , where scenes of courtly pleasure were depicted with portrait figures of the princes and their friends . A work belonging to Berry 's elder brother Anjou showed the romance of Tristan and Isolde , with King Mark spying on the lovers from a tree above them , giving himself away when they see " the enamelled reflection of his face in the enamelled brook " . 
 One work that survived long enough to be recorded in an 18th @-@ century painting had a very similar gold castle as its base , with a <unk> garden within the walls , in this case with trees bearing pearls and red gems . However the rest of the piece was very different in scale , with a single large white enamel figure of the Archangel Michael impaling Satan with a lance @-@ like jewelled cross , completely out of scale with the garden in which he stands . This is the St Michael and the Devil Group , which can be reliably dated to before 1397 , when it was given to King Charles VI of France , Berry 's nephew , as a New Year 's gift by another uncle , Philip the Bold , Duke of Burgundy . It later passed to a church at Ingolstadt in Bavaria , where it remained until it was destroyed in 1801 . 
 Berry was religious as well as worldly , and collected relics as keenly as other types of objects . By 1397 both of his sons had died , he was in his late fifties , and he had begun to think of his tomb , finally deciding to build a new " Sainte Chapelle " in his capital of Bourges to house it . His collection of relics included objects claimed to be the wedding ring of the Virgin Mary , a cup used at the Wedding at Cana , a piece of the Burning Bush and many others . However the provenance of the Holy Thorn , as well as its centrality to the Passion of Christ must have given it a special status . The crown from which the thorn came had been bought in 1239 by Louis IX , both a saint and King of France , from the Latin Emperor in Constantinople , Baldwin II , along with a portion of the True Cross . Both had been in Constantinople since the Muslim Conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century , and may very well be the same relics that Bishop Paulinus of Nola saw in Jerusalem in 409 . There are a number of other thorn relics said to have come from the relic in the Paris Sainte Chapelle , including the far smaller Salting Reliquary in the British Museum , a French pendant of about 1340 . 
 Berry may have kept the reliquary with him on his round of visits to his many castles and palaces , or it may have been kept in a chapel , perhaps the Bourges Sainte Chapelle , built in emulation of the king 's Paris Sainte Chapelle , where the Crown of Thorns itself was kept . The reliquary is relatively small and would almost certainly have had a custom @-@ made carrying case like that for the Royal Gold Cup , in which the cup came to the British Museum .

 = Aker Stadion = 
 Aker Stadion , formerly known as Molde Stadion , is a football stadium located at Reknes in Molde , Norway , and is the home of Norwegian Premier League club Molde . The stadium has a capacity of 11 @,@ 800 spectators . 
 The building was designed by architect Kjell Kosberg . It cost NOK 212 million , most of which was paid for by club @-@ owner Kjell Inge Røkke — after whom the ground has been nicknamed " <unk> " . The main construction work took place 1997 , and the stadium was inaugurated on 18 April 1998 in a league game against Lillestrøm , replacing Molde idrettspark as Molde 's home ground . The stadium was nominated for the FIABCI Prix D ' Excellence and awarded the City Prize in 1999 . The record attendance of 13 @,@ 308 was set in a league match against Rosenborg in 1998 . The same year , the arena hosted its first international match , where Norway beat Saudi Arabia 6 – 0 . The following year , when Molde reached the UEFA Champions League , the stadium was converted to an all @-@ seater , reducing its capacity . Since May 2006 , the stadium name has been sponsored by Røkke 's company Aker . The grass pitch was replaced with artificial turf in 2014 . 
 = = History = = 
 Since 1955 , Molde had been playing their home games at Molde idrettspark ( at the time called Molde stadion ) , a municipal @-@ owned multi @-@ use venue . A new stadium was proposed to be located at the waterfront at Reknes . There were many local protests , including complaints about the size of the structure . Construction of the land fillings and preparation of the construction site started in March 1997 , before final approval had been granted by the municipality . 
 The stadium was inaugurated on 18 April 1998 , when the stadium was officially opened by Prime Minister and Molde @-@ fan Kjell Magne Bondevik . In the opening match , Molde beat Lillestrøm 4 – 0 in their first home game of the season , attracting 13 @,@ 010 spectators . During the season , this was the match in the country with the most spectators not hosted at Rosenborg 's home ground Lerkendal . On 27 May , the arena hosted its only international match , with Norway beating Saudi Arabia 6 – 0 in a 1998 World Cup friendly . On 11 August , CSKA Sofia visited Molde for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup , for which Molde failed to qualify . The all @-@ time spectator record was set on 26 September , when Molde hosted Rosenborg BK in front of 13 @,@ 308 people . 
 During the fall of 1999 , Molde played two qualification games for UEFA Champions League at the stadium . Following the aggregated victories over CSKA Moscow and Mallorca , Molde qualified for the group stage , where they played Real Madrid , Porto and Olympiacos . Following entry into Champions League , the stadium was converted to an all @-@ seater , with seats being installed on the lower sections of the short end stands . The reduced the attendance capacity permanently , because the club chose to not remove the seats afterwards . 
 In 2006 , an agreement was made where Røkke 's company Aker became the stadium name sponsor , with the stadium being renamed Aker stadion . The same season , the club was relegated to the First Division , where the team played in 2007 . Despite the relegation , average attendance increased , and Molde won the league . Since 2008 , the team has again played in the Premier League . 
 Molde later entered the UEFA Cup four times ( renamed to Europa League in 2010 ) , in 2000 – 01 , 2003 – 04 and 2006 – 07 , 2010 – 11 , playing a total of eight home games , before they in 2012 again played qualification for the Champions League and Ventspils and Basel visited Aker Stadion . Molde were eliminated by Basel , but managed to qualify for the Europa League group stage and played against Heerenveen , Stuttgart , Steaua Bucuresti and Copenhagen at Aker Stadion . 
 Aker Stadion has been proposed used during the annual <unk> , Norway 's largest jazz festival , but this has been rejected several times by the festival management . The issue was intensified in 2004 , when a much smaller arena was used for a quickly sold @-@ out Stevie Wonder concert . On 6 October 2007 , <unk> arranged a free concert at the stadium with Ane Brun and Röyksopp to celebrate the completion of their near @-@ by processing plant for the gas field Ormen Lange . In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players ' Association among away @-@ team captains , Ullevaal was found to be the league 's fourth @-@ best stadium , with a score of 4 @.@ 27 on a scale from one to five . 
 The club decided on 4 October 2013 to lay artificial turf on the field , which it hoped would be in place ahead of the 2014 season . The club was especially concerned with the poor surface during March , April , October and November . It also cited the possibility of hosting all trainings at the stadium and that the field could be used 2 @,@ 000 instead of 130 hours per year . The stadium hosted its second international match on 19 November 2013 , when Norway was defeated 0 – 1 Scotland in a friendly match watched by 9 @,@ 750 spectators . It was the first time since 2002 that a home Norway game was not played at the national stadium , Ullevaal Stadion .

 = Balangoda Man = 
 Balangoda Man ( Homo sapiens <unk> ) refers to hominins from Sri Lanka 's late Quaternary period . The term was initially coined to refer to anatomically modern Homo sapiens from sites near Balangoda that were responsible for the island 's Mesolithic ' Balangoda Culture ' . The earliest evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38 @,@ 000 BP , and from excavated skeletal remains to 30 @,@ 000 BP , which is also the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia . Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28 @,@ 500 BP , which together with some sites in Africa is the earliest record of such stone tools . 
 Other discoveries include various plants and animals that are thought to have formed part of their diet , e.g. wild banana , breadfruit , and fish bones , and articles that were used as personal ornaments such as shell pendants and shark beads , indicating occasional contact with the coast around 40 km away . It is also likely that Balangoda Man visited Horton Plains in the central highlands of Sri Lanka during their annual cycle of gathering foods such as cereals , and hunting animals , most likely wild cattle , <unk> , and deer . 
 Balangoda Man is estimated to have had thick skulls , prominent supraorbital ridges , depressed noses , heavy jaws , short necks and conspicuously large teeth . Metrical and morphometric features of skeletal fragments extracted from cave sites that were occupied during different periods have indicated a rare biological affinity over a time frame of roughly 16 @,@ 000 years , and the likelihood of a biological continuum to the present @-@ day Vedda indigenous people . 
 = = Origin = = 
 Archeological data from the Late Pleistocene in South Asia is vital for our understanding of the evolution of modern human behavior and how early humans spread through the Old World . In prehistoric times , the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over the continental shelf shared between the two countries , which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam 's Bridge . Being only around 70 m deep , significant reductions in sea level due to climate change , in at least the past 500 @,@ 000 years , periodically caused the continental shelf to be exposed , forming a land bridge approximately 100 km wide and 50 km long . 
 From an analysis of coastal deposits near <unk> in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka , paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125 @,@ 000 BP . Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period . Consequently , some believe in the possibility that there were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500 @,@ 000 BP or earlier , and consider it likely that they were on the island by 300 @,@ 000 BP . Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids . 
 From South Asia in general , there is secure evidence of such early settlement . Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens , a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh , India , referred to as Narmada Man , is the first authenticated discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene ( around 200 @,@ 000 BP ) hominid from South Asia . The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it belongs in the taxonomic organisation of <unk> hominids . Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus , but they correlate with hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens , which include pre @-@ Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia . Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus , but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning . 
 Another significant discovery from South Asia was hominid fragments from the Darra @-@ I @-@ Kur cave in northeastern Afghanistan . From associated prehistoric tools , the occupation of the cave was radiocarbon dated to around 31 @,@ 000 BP . Morphometric analysis of the skeletal fragments of the occupants revealed characteristics that were common to both Neanderthals as well as anatomically modern Homo sapiens . While more hominid remains were found from the cave later , they were associated with the more recent , post @-@ Pleistocene period . 
 = = Sri Lankan skeletal and cultural discoveries = = 
 Compared to the earlier Sri Lankan fossils , the island 's fossil records from around 40 @,@ 000 BP onwards are much more complete . Excavated fossils of skeletal and cultural remains from this period provide the earliest records of anatomically modern Homo sapiens in South Asia , and some of the earliest evidence for the use of a specific type of stone tool . 
 The Fa Hien Cave in the Kalutara district in Sri Lanka , one of the largest caves on the island , has yielded some of the earliest such fossils . Radiometric dating from excavated charcoal samples indicated that the cave was occupied from 34 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 400 BP , a period that was found to be consistent with the occupational levels of some other caves on the island . Dates from cultural sequences at the cave suggested a slightly earlier settlement from 38 @,@ 000 BP . The oldest skeletal remains unearthed from Fa Hien Cave were that of a child with an associated radiocarbon dating of 30 @,@ 000 BP . 
 Caves in <unk> lena , 460 m above sea level in the foothills of Sri Pada ( Adam 's Peak ) , have also yielded several important ancient remains . The first excavation of the cave floor in the late 1930s unearthed skeletal fragments of a child and several adults . Excavations in 1981 yielded more complete human skeletons from the sixth stratum ( a layer of internally consistent sedimentary soil or rock ) which were radiocarbon dated from associated charcoal samples to 16 @,@ 000 BP . Excavations of the seventh stratum in the following year produced further human remains along with charcoal and 17 geometric microliths , i.e. 1 – 4 cm long triangular , trapezoid or lunate stone tools made of flint or chert that form , among other artifacts , the end points of hunting weapons such as spears and arrows . Radiometric tests on the charcoal placed the tools to around 28 @,@ 500 BP . 
 Along with some sites in Africa that have also revealed geometric microliths from contexts earlier than 27 @,@ 000 BP , those recovered from caves in Beli lena in <unk> and <unk> lena , and from two coastal sites in <unk> have the earliest dates for geometric microliths in the world . The earliest date for the use of microlithic technology in India of 24 @,@ 500 BP , in the <unk> site in Maharashtra , only slightly postdates the first appearance in Sri Lanka . Such early evidence of microlithic industries in various sites in South Asia supports the view that at least some of these industries emerged regionally , perhaps to deal with challenging climatic , social or demographic conditions , rather than being brought in from elsewhere . In Europe , the earliest dates for microliths seem to start from around 12 @,@ 000 BP , though there does appear to be a trend towards microlithic blade production from 20 @,@ 000 BP . 
 Mesolithic sites in the <unk> and Uva provinces in Sri Lanka confirmed that microlithic technology continued on the island , albeit at a lower frequency , until the onset of the historical period , traditionally the 6th century BC . Cultural sequences at rock shelters showed that microliths were gradually replaced by other types of tools including grinding stones , pestles , mortars , and pitted hammers @-@ stones towards the late Pleistocene , specifically 13 @,@ 000 @-@ 14 @,@ 000 BP . 
 Other sites that have revealed ancient human skeletal fragments are the Beli lena cave and Bellanbandi Palassa in the Ratnapura district . Carbon samples corresponding to the fragments were dated to respectively 12 @,@ 000 BP for the former site and 6 @,@ 500 BP for the latter , suggesting that the island may have been relatively continuously occupied during this time frame . 
 = = = Physical traits and cultural practices = = = 
 Certain samples of Balangoda Man were estimated to be 174 cm tall for males and 166 cm tall for females , a significantly higher figure than modern day Sri Lankan populations . They also had thick skull @-@ bones , prominent supraorbital ridges , depressed noses , heavy jaws , short necks and conspicuously large teeth . 
 Apart from the microliths , hand @-@ axes from meso @-@ <unk> times were discovered at Bellanbandi Palassa , which were manufactured from slabs extracted from the leg bones of elephants , and also daggers or celts made from sambar antler . From the same period , this and other sites have also yielded evidence of widespread use of ochre , domesticated dogs , differentiated use of space , inferred burials , and the strong use of fire . 
 Other cultural discoveries of interest from the meso @-@ <unk> period included articles of personal ornamentation and animals utilised as food , e.g. fish bones , seashell @-@ based beads and shell pendants , shark vertebra beads , lagoon shells , molluscan remains , <unk> wild banana , breadfruit <unk> , and polished bone tools . The frequency at which the marine shells , shark teeth and shark beads occurred at the different cave sites suggested that the cave dwellers likely had direct contact with the coast around 40 km away ; Beli lena also showed signs that salt had been brought back from the coast . 
 The microlithic tradition appears to have been contemporaneous with high mobility , the use of rainforest resources and adaptation to changing climate and environment . The discovery of geometric microliths at Horton Plains , located on the southern plateau of the central highlands of Sri Lanka , suggests that the area was visited by prehistoric humans from the Mesolithic period . One possible interpretation is that in their annual cycle of foraging for food , prehistoric hunter @-@ gatherers that lived in lowland rock @-@ shelters periodically visited the Horton Plains for hunting — possibly wild cattle , <unk> and deer — and gathering foods such as wild cereals . While it was likely used as a temporary camp @-@ site , Horton Plains does not appear to have been used for more permanent settlement . 
 The transition from hunter @-@ foraging to food production with domesticated cereals and other plants seems to have begun in some tropical regions at the beginning of the Holocene . Until then , humans probably exploited the Horton Plains wetland , grassland and rainforest resources using slash @-@ and @-@ burn techniques , and facilitated the growth of rice fields . 
 = = Link with indigenous people = = 
 Like the prehistoric people of the island , historical sources describe the aboriginal people of Sri Lanka — the Veddas — as hunter @-@ gatherers , who inhabited natural caves and traded their game and honey for metal @-@ based arrow and spear points from neighbouring village populations . These villagers were predominantly descendants of populations from the Middle East , Europe and the Indian mainland who during different periods were en route along seaways or arrived from India . Over the years , while some Veddas remained in caves , others either assimilated with the neighbouring villagers or joined military campaigns led by the Kandyan kings during the Kingdom of Kandy from the late 15th century to the early 19th . While the Vedda title has also been adopted by certain present @-@ day farming populations in Sri Lanka , it remains unclear whether they have any roots in the Vedda populations characterised by hunting and foraging . 
 Metrical and morphometric features of the analysable skeletal remains from the Sri Lankan caves have revealed similar anatomical attributes , signalling the likelihood of a biological continuum from the prehistoric hunter @-@ gatherers of the island to the Veddas , and a close biological affinity over a period of roughly 16 @,@ 000 years . This is not surprising given the relative geographical isolation of the island until the fifth century BC when settlers arrived from the Indian mainland . Veddas are therefore relevant to the question of the degree of relative isolation of ancient and modern Homo sapiens in Sri Lanka from populations of southern India . 
 Veddas have relatively smaller statures , significantly more robust skulls , dental differences , including somewhat larger molar crown sizes , and greater cranial diversity than populations of southern India . While some of these features are also distinct from the Sinhalese and Tamil co @-@ inhabitants of the island , and from Veddas with Portuguese , Dutch or British ancestry , some claim that certain other features including genetic traits do appear among present @-@ day Sri Lankans , suggesting that their ancestry traces back to some of the earliest human settlers on the island .

 Reactive attachment disorder ( RAD ) is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon disorder that can affect children . RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts . It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way — known as the " inhibited form " — or can present itself as indiscriminate sociability , such as excessive familiarity with relative strangers — known as the " disinhibited form " . The term is used in both the World Health Organization 's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ( ICD @-@ 10 ) and in the DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR , the revised fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association 's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) . In ICD @-@ 10 , the inhibited form is called RAD , and the disinhibited form is called " disinhibited attachment disorder " , or " DAD " . In the DSM , both forms are called RAD ; for ease of reference , this article will follow that convention and refer to both forms as reactive attachment disorder . 
 RAD arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood . Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of neglect , abuse , abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years , frequent change of caregivers , or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child 's communicative efforts . Not all , or even a majority of such experiences , result in the disorder . It is differentiated from pervasive developmental disorder or developmental delay and from possibly comorbid conditions such as intellectual disability , all of which can affect attachment behavior . The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment disorder are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of attachment styles such as insecure or disorganized attachment . DSM @-@ 5 , the fifth revised edition published in 2013 , separates RAD into two separate disorders : reactive attachment disorder ( previously referred to as the " inhibited " form ) , and social engagement disorder . 
 Children with RAD are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life . There are few studies of long @-@ term effects , and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years . However , the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early @-@ 1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions . Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence , causes , mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late @-@ 1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment . Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications . 
 Mainstream treatment and prevention programs that target RAD and other problematic early attachment behaviors are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver , or if that is not possible , placing the child with a different caregiver . Most such strategies are in the process of being evaluated . Mainstream practitioners and theorists have presented significant criticism of the diagnosis and treatment of alleged reactive attachment disorder or the theoretically baseless " attachment disorder " within the controversial form of psychotherapy commonly known as attachment therapy . Attachment therapy has a scientifically unsupported theoretical base and uses diagnostic criteria or symptom lists markedly different to criteria under ICD @-@ 10 or DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR , or to attachment behaviors . A range of treatment approaches are used in attachment therapy , some of which are physically and psychologically coercive , and considered to be antithetical to attachment theory . Many constitute abuse . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 <unk> are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder . The initial presentation varies according to the child 's developmental and chronological age , although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction . Infants up to about 18 – 24 months may present with non @-@ organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli . Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration , while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated . 
 The core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children . This can manifest itself in two ways : 
 <unk> and excessive attempts to receive comfort and affection from any available adult , even relative strangers ( older children and adolescents may also aim attempts at peers ) . 
 Extreme reluctance to initiate or accept comfort and affection , even from familiar adults , especially when distressed . 
 While RAD is likely to occur in relation to neglectful and abusive treatment , automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made , as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect . 
 = = = Assessment tools = = = 
 There is as yet no universally accepted diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder . Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis . Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles , difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure ( devised by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth ) , the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment , the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment , the Attachment Q @-@ sort and a variety of narrative techniques using stem stories , puppets or pictures . For older children , actual interviews such as the Child Attachment Interview and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used . Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview . 
 More recent research also uses the Disturbances of Attachment Interview ( DAI ) developed by <unk> and Zeanah ( 1999 ) . The DAI is a semi @-@ structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers . It covers 12 items , namely " having a discriminated , preferred adult " , " seeking comfort when distressed " , " responding to comfort when offered " , " social and emotional reciprocity " , " emotional regulation " , " checking back after venturing away from the care giver " , " reticence with unfamiliar adults " , " willingness to go off with relative strangers " , " self @-@ endangering behavior " , " excessive clinging " , " vigilance / <unk> " and " role reversal " . This method is designed to pick up not only RAD but also the proposed new alternative categories of disorders of attachment . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Although increasing numbers of childhood mental health problems are being attributed to genetic defects , reactive attachment disorder is by definition based on a problematic history of care and social relationships . Abuse can occur alongside the required factors , but on its own does not explain attachment disorder . It has been suggested that types of temperament , or constitutional response to the environment , may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years . In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders . 
 There is as yet no explanation for why similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder , inhibited and disinhibited . The issue of temperament and its influence on the development of attachment disorders has yet to be resolved . RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment vary widely . 
 In discussing the neurobiological basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven @-@ year twin study , it has been suggested that the roots of various forms of psychopathology , including RAD , Borderline Personality Disorder ( BPD ) , and post @-@ traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , can be found in disturbances in affect regulation . The subsequent development of higher @-@ order self @-@ regulation is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected . Consequently , the " templates " in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted . The potential for " re @-@ regulation " ( modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range ) in the presence of " corrective " experiences ( normative caregiving ) seems possible . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 RAD is one of the least researched and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM . There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD , its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately . There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders , disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment . 
 According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry ( AACAP ) , children who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan . The signs or symptoms of RAD may also be found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation . Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history ( as available ) of the child ’ s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers . It also requires observations of the child ’ s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child ’ s early caregiving environment including , for example , pediatricians , teachers , or <unk> . In the US , initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists , psychiatrists , Licensed Marriage and Family <unk> , Licensed Professional Counselors , specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses . 
 In the UK , the British Association for Adoption and Fostering ( <unk> ) advise that only a psychiatrist can diagnose an attachment disorder and that any assessment must include a comprehensive evaluation of the child ’ s individual and family history . 
 According to the AACAP Practice Parameter ( 2005 ) the question of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved . Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult . There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence . Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior . 
 = = = Criteria = = = 
 ICD @-@ 10 describes reactive attachment disorder of childhood , known as RAD , and disinhibited attachment disorder , less well known as DAD . DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR also describes reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood divided into two subtypes , inhibited type and disinhibited type , both known as RAD . The two classifications are similar and both include : 
 markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts ( e.g. , the child is avoidant or unresponsive to care when offered by caregivers or is indiscriminately affectionate with strangers ) ; 
 the disturbance is not accounted for solely by developmental delay and does not meet the criteria for pervasive developmental disorder ; 
 onset before five years of age ( there is no age specified before five years of age at which RAD cannot be diagnosed ) ; 
 a history of significant neglect ; 
 an implicit lack of identifiable , preferred attachment figure . 
 ICD @-@ 10 states in relation to the inhibited form only that the syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect , abuse , or serious mishandling . DSM states in relation to both forms there must be a history of " pathogenic care " defined as persistent disregard of the child 's basic emotional or physical needs or repeated changes in primary caregiver that prevents the formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment that is presumed to account for the disorder . For this reason , part of the diagnosis is the child 's history of care rather than observation of symptoms . 
 In DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR the inhibited form is described as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions , as manifest by excessively inhibited , <unk> , or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses ( e.g. , the child may respond to caregivers with a mixture of approach , avoidance , and resistance to comforting or may exhibit " frozen watchfulness " , hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour ) . Such infants do not seek and accept comfort at times of threat , alarm or distress , thus failing to maintain " proximity " , an essential element of attachment behavior . The disinhibited form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments ( e.g. , excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures ) . There is therefore a lack of " specificity " of attachment figure , the second basic element of attachment behavior . 
 The ICD @-@ 10 descriptions are comparable save that ICD @-@ 10 includes in its description several elements not included in DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR as follows : 
 abuse , ( psychological or physical ) , in addition to neglect ; 
 associated emotional disturbance ; 
 poor social interaction with peers , aggression towards self and others , misery , and growth failure in some cases ( inhibited form only ) ; 
 evidence of capacity for social reciprocity and responsiveness as shown by elements of normal social relatedness in interactions with appropriately responsive , non @-@ deviant adults ( disinhibited form only ) . 
 The first of these is somewhat controversial , being a commission rather than omission and because abuse of itself does not lead to attachment disorder . 
 The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver , while the disinhibited form is more enduring . ICD @-@ 10 states the disinhibited form " tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances " . Disinhibited and inhibited are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can coexist in the same child . The question of whether there are two subtypes has been raised . The World Health Organization acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria and the appropriate subdivision . One reviewer has commented on the difficulty of clarifying the core characteristics of and differences between atypical attachment styles and ways of categorizing more severe disorders of attachment . 
 As of 2010 , the American Psychiatric Association has proposed to redefine RAD into two distinct disorders in the DSM @-@ V. Corresponding with the inhibited type , one disorder will be reclassified as Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy and Early Childhood . 
 In regards to pathogenic care , or the type of care in which these behaviors are present , a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving . Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders , a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child / caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 The diagnostic complexities of RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential . Several other disorders , such as conduct disorders , oppositional defiant disorder , anxiety disorders , post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD , leading to over and under diagnosis . RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism , pervasive developmental disorder , childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes . Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization . Autistic children are likely to be of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability . They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home . 
 = = = Alternative diagnosis = = = 
 In the absence of a standardized diagnosis system , many popular , informal classification systems or checklists , outside the DSM and ICD , were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy . These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate , too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons . Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists . Common elements of these lists such as lying , lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR or ICD @-@ 10 . Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria . There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid , externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders . However , knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the etiology , maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders . 
 The Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or <unk> is one of the better known of these checklists and is used by attachment therapists and others . The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours , many of which either overlap with other disorders , like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder , or are not related to attachment difficulties . Critics assert that it is unvalidated and lacks specificity . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Assessing the child 's safety is an essential first step that determines whether future intervention can take place in the family unit or whether the child should be removed to a safe situation . Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit ( including financial or domestic aid , housing and social work support ) , psychotherapeutic interventions ( including treating parents for mental illness , family therapy , individual therapy ) , education ( including training in basic parenting skills and child development ) , and monitoring of the child 's safety within the family environment 
 In 2005 the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry laid down guidelines ( devised by N.W. Boris and C.H. Zeanah ) based on its published parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of RAD . Recommendations in the guidelines include the following : 
 " The most important intervention for young children diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and who lack an attachment to a discriminated caregiver is for the clinician to advocate for providing the child with an emotionally available attachment figure . " 
 " Although the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder is based on symptoms displayed by the child , assessing the caregiver 's attitudes toward and perceptions about the child is important for treatment selection . " 
 " Children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others . After ensuring that the child is in a safe and stable placement , effective attachment treatment must focus on creating positive interactions with caregivers . " 
 " Children who meet criteria for reactive attachment disorder and who display aggressive and oppositional behavior require adjunctive ( additional ) treatments . " 
 Mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver , or if that is not possible , placing the child with a different caregiver . These approaches are mostly in the process of being evaluated . The programs invariably include a detailed assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the adult caregiver as attachment is a two @-@ way process involving attachment behavior and caregiver response . Some of these treatment or prevention programs are specifically aimed at foster carers rather than parents , as the attachment behaviors of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses . Approaches include " Watch , wait and wonder , " manipulation of sensitive responsiveness , modified " Interaction Guidance " , " <unk> @-@ Assisted <unk> Exposure Sessions ( <unk> ) " , " Preschool Parent Psychotherapy " , " Circle of Security " , " Attachment and <unk> Catch @-@ up " ( ABC ) , the New Orleans Intervention , and parent – child psychotherapy . Other treatment methods include Developmental , Individual @-@ difference , and Relationship @-@ based therapy ( DIR , also referred to as Floor Time ) by Stanley Greenspan , although DIR is primarily directed to treatment of pervasive developmental disorders . 
 The relevance of these approaches to intervention with fostered and adopted children with RAD or older children with significant histories of maltreatment is unclear . 
 = = = " Attachment Therapy " = = = 
 Outside the mainstream programs is a form of treatment generally known as attachment therapy , a subset of techniques ( and accompanying novel diagnosis ) for supposed attachment disorders including RAD . These " <unk> disorders " use diagnostic criteria or symptom lists different to criteria under ICD @-@ 10 or DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR , or to attachment behaviors . Sufferers of " attachment disorder " are said to lack empathy and remorse . 
 Treatments of this pseudoscientific disorder are called " Attachment therapy " . In general , these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers . The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis , accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience and parental control . There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream . There is little or no evidence base and techniques vary from non @-@ coercive therapeutic work to more extreme forms of physical , confrontational and coercive techniques , of which the best known are holding therapy , <unk> , rage @-@ reduction and the Evergreen model . These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint , the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage , aversive tickling , enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation , and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma . Critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm , are potentially abusive , and are antithetical to attachment theory . The APSAC Taskforce Report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver . Children may be described as " <unk> " , " <unk> " or " Radishes " and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy . The Mayo Clinic , a well known U.S. non @-@ profit medical practice and medical research group , cautions against consulting with mental health providers who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques ; to date , this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 The AACAP guidelines state that children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others . However , the course of RAD is not well studied and there have been few efforts to examine symptom patterns over time . The few existing longitudinal studies ( dealing with developmental change with age over a period of time ) involve only children from poorly run Eastern European institutions . 
 Findings from the studies of children from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care @-@ giving environments . However , there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors . The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care @-@ givers may be compromised , but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD . The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted , institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided . <unk> sociability may persist for years , even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers . Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships . In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence , these children were significantly more likely to exhibit poor peer relationships . 
 Studies of children who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive , no matter what quality of care they received . In one investigation , some institution @-@ reared boys were reported to be inattentive , overactive , and markedly unselective in their social relationships , while girls , foster @-@ reared children , and some institution @-@ reared children were not . It is not yet clear whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment . 
 There is one case study on maltreated twins published in 1999 with a follow @-@ up in 2006 . This study assessed the twins between the ages of 19 and 36 months , during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements . The paper explores the similarities , differences and comorbidity of RAD , disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder . The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form . It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes . At age three , some lasting relationship disturbance was evident . 
 In the follow @-@ up case study when the twins were aged three and eight years , the lack of longitudinal research on maltreated as opposed to institutionalized children was again highlighted . The girl 's symptoms of disorganized attachment had developed into controlling behaviors — a well @-@ documented outcome . The boy still exhibited self @-@ endangering behaviors , not within RAD criteria but possibly within " secure base distortion " , ( where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver , but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment ) . At age eight the children were assessed with a variety of measures including those designed to access representational systems , or the child 's " internal working models " . The twins ' symptoms were indicative of different trajectories . The girl showed externalizing symptoms ( particularly deceit ) , contradictory reports of current functioning , chaotic personal narratives , struggles with friendships , and emotional disengagement with her caregiver , resulting in a clinical picture described as " quite concerning " . The boy still evidenced self @-@ endangering behaviors as well as avoidance in relationships and emotional expression , separation anxiety and impulsivity and attention difficulties . It was apparent that life stressors had impacted each child differently . The narrative measures used were considered helpful in tracking how early attachment disruption is associated with later expectations about relationships . 
 One paper using questionnaires found that children aged three to six , diagnosed with RAD , scored lower on empathy but higher on self @-@ monitoring ( regulating your behavior to " look good " ) . These differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents , and suggested that children with RAD may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways . Their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Epidemiological data are limited , but reactive attachment disorder appears to be very uncommon . The prevalence of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare , other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme , deprived settings such as some orphanages . There is little systematically gathered epidemiologic information on RAD . A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children to the age of 18 months found a prevalence of 0 @.@ 9 % . 
 Attachment disorders tend to occur in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions , in the presence of repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child 's basic attachment needs , but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder . Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid @-@ 1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children , regardless of how long they had been there . It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers . The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow @-@ up study three years later , although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness . However , even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder . 
 A 2002 study of children in residential nurseries in Bucharest , in which the DAI was used , challenged the current DSM and ICD conceptualizations of disordered attachment and showed that inhibited and disinhibited disorders could coexist in the same child . 
 There are two studies on the incidence of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD , DSM and the DAI . The first , in 2004 , reported that children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups , however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD . The second study , also in 2004 , attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers . Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care , 35 % were identified as having ICD RAD and 22 % as having ICD DAD , and 38 % fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD . This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent . However , there are some methodological concerns with this study . A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure . 
 It has been suggested by some within the field of attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment , which is known to increase risk for RAD , is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors . The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable . Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties . Further , many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders . Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic . RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children , adoptive children , or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and / or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD . 
 There are few data on comorbid conditions , but there are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises , such as institutionalization or maltreatment . These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect . Conduct disorders , oppositional defiant disorder , anxiety disorders , post @-@ traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD . Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors . 
 = = History = = 
 Reactive attachment disorder first made its appearance in standard <unk> of psychological disorders in DSM @-@ III , 1980 , following an accumulation of evidence on institutionalized children . The criteria included a requirement of onset before the age of 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive . Both these features were dropped in DSM @-@ III @-@ R , 1987 . Instead , onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories , inhibited and disinhibited . These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version , DSM @-@ IV , 1994 , and its 2000 text revision , DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR , as well as in ICD @-@ 10 , 1992 . Both <unk> focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance . 
 The broad theoretical framework for current versions of RAD is attachment theory , based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by John Bowlby , Mary Ainsworth and René Spitz . Attachment theory is a framework that employs psychological , ethological and evolutionary concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children . Attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to seek proximity to a particular attachment figure ( familiar caregiver ) , in situations of alarm or distress , behavior which appears to have survival value . This is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment . Subsequently , the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment , returning periodically to the familiar person . Attachment is not the same as love and / or affection although they are often associated . Attachment and attachment behaviors tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years . Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant , and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time . <unk> responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment , that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual 's feelings , thoughts , and expectations in later relationships . For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder , the child 's history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment . 
 The pathological absence of a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns , known as styles or patterns . There are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research . These are known as secure , anxious @-@ ambivalent , anxious @-@ avoidant , ( all organized ) and disorganized . The latter three are characterised as insecure . These are assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure , designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all . 
 A securely attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present , engage with strangers , be visibly upset when the caregiver departs , and happy to see the caregiver return . The anxious @-@ ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration , extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns . The anxious @-@ avoidant toddler will not explore much , avoid or ignore the parent — showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns — and treat strangers much the same as caregivers with little emotional range shown . The disorganized / disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping . Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear , thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance . On reunion with the caregiver , these children can look dazed or frightened , freezing in place , backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted , or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought . It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions . 
 Although there are a wide range of attachment difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later <unk> , particularly the disorganized style , none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such . A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment , as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders . Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style , however problematic that style may be , in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder . Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles . Both DSM @-@ IV and ICD @-@ 10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such . DSM @-@ IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD @-@ 10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations . The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear . 
 There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term " attachment disorder " . The term is frequently used both as an alternative to reactive attachment disorder and in discussions about different proposed classifications for disorders of attachment beyond the limitations of the ICD and DSM classifications . It is also used within the field of attachment therapy , as is the term reactive attachment disorder , to describe a range of problematic behaviors not within the ICD or DSM criteria or not related directly to attachment styles or difficulties at all . 
 = = Research = = 
 Research from the late 1990s indicated there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care , thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD . Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior ( of any style ) towards the child 's permanent caregivers . 
 Some authors have proposed a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles . There is as yet no consensus , on this issue but a new set of practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris . The first of these is disorder of attachment , in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver . The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms , as defined in DSM and ICD . The second category is secure base distortion , where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver , but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment . Such children may endanger themselves , cling to the adult , be excessively compliant , or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult . The third type is disrupted attachment . Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD @-@ 10 and DSM criteria , and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed . This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR classification , but further research is required . The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol . Most recently , Daniel Schechter and Erica <unk> have shown a relationship between some maternal violence @-@ related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion ( see above ) which is characterized by child recklessness , separation anxiety , hypervigilance , and role @-@ reversal . 
 Some research indicates there may be a significant overlap between behaviors of the inhibited form of RAD or DAD and aspects of disorganized attachment where there is an identified attachment figure . 
 An ongoing question is whether RAD should be thought of as a disorder of the child 's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person . It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders , they do not fit comfortably into <unk> that characterize the disorder as centered on the person . Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment @-@ related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another . This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles , in which a particular parent 's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized / disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure . 
 The draft of the proposed DSM @-@ V suggests dividing RAD into two disorders , Reactive Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of RAD , and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of RAD , with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition . 
 = Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885 = 
 The 1885 season was an annus horribilis for Somerset County Cricket Club . Captained by Edward Sainsbury , who had taken over from Stephen Newton , captain for the previous three seasons , they played six first @-@ class cricket matches . Somerset 's only win of the season came in their first match ; all the other were lost . Two of the losses , those away against Gloucestershire and Surrey , number among the county 's ten heaviest defeats . Somerset were unable to field a full team for their fourth match , which coupled with their poor results and lack of fixtures resulted in the club being stripped of its first @-@ class status at the end of the season . 
 At an emergency meeting held in Taunton a new club secretary was appointed and wealthy benefactors were sought , but Sainsbury retained the club captaincy . Somerset played second @-@ class cricket for five seasons , until their readmission to the first @-@ class game for the 1891 season . 
 In their histories of Somerset County Cricket Club , Peter Roebuck and David Foot mostly gloss over the season ; Roebuck includes a scorecard , but provides only two paragraphs of prose , while Foot only mentions the loss of first @-@ class cricket .

 Somerset had been granted first @-@ class status in advance of the 1882 season . Their maiden season at the top level was described by Wisden as disastrous , but the publication qualified this statement with mild optimism for 1883 . The county failed to live up to this optimism , and although there were a few wins , performances on the whole were poor . Twice between 1882 and 1884 Somerset 's opponents scored over 500 runs in an innings against them , and against Lancashire in 1884 they fielded only ten players . Stephen Newton , who had captained the side since 1882 , left the club at the end of the 1884 season , and thereafter played all his cricket in London . 
 = = Squad = = 
 In their six first @-@ class matches in 1885 , Somerset fielded 26 different players . Only two appeared in all six matches : the captain Edward Sainsbury , and Charles Winter . James Lillywhite 's Cricketers ' Annual suggested in 1883 that " professionals not being indigenous to the area [ Somerset ] it is feared that their advance is only temporary " . This prediction was particularly accurate during 1885 : only Albert Clapp was a professional . Ten of Somerset 's players that year only appeared once during the season , and of those , all but George <unk> , Crescens Robinson , and Francis Terry , made fewer than five career first @-@ class appearances . 
 The following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in first @-@ class cricket in 1885 . Age given is at the start of Somerset 's first match of the season ( 16 July 1885 ) .

 During 1885 Somerset suffered badly from their lack of a strong bowling attack . Playing six matches , there were a total of 120 wickets on offer , but Somerset 's bowlers took only 67 . Edward Bastard , a slow left @-@ arm orthodox bowler , was the county 's leading wicket @-@ taker , claiming 25 wickets during his four appearances , at an average of 15 @.@ 32 . His bowling average was not far below that of George Lohmann , who finished the season as the country 's leading wicket taker , with 142 wickets from his 24 matches . Unfortunately for Somerset , Bastard was only able to play in four of the county 's six matches , and of the other bowlers , the best bowling average was the 25 @.@ 85 managed by Bill Roe , who took only seven wickets . Charles Winter , who took the next highest total of wickets , only managed to claim 15 in his 6 appearances . Batting was the strongest aspect of Somerset 's play , but the club lacked the strength @-@ in @-@ depth of other county teams . Herbie Hewett , playing his second season of first @-@ class cricket , finished with the highest batting average for the county with 35 @.@ 28 , a respectable average which exceeded a number of England Test batsmen that season . Only four Somerset batsman passed 50 runs in an innings – Hewett , Octavius Radcliffe , Bill Roe , and Charles Winter – and only Radcliffe advanced to reach a century during the season . 
 Somerset 's first match of 1885 commenced on 16 July 1885 , over two months after Nottinghamshire faced Sussex and Surrey travelled to Hampshire to open the first @-@ class county cricket season in England . Somerset began their season at home against Hampshire , and after losing the toss were asked to field . Somerset 's bowlers restricted the visitors to 175 runs in the first innings , during which Bastard took a career @-@ best eight wickets in the innings , conceding 54 runs ( eight for 54 ) off his 38 four @-@ ball overs . In reply , Somerset fell short of equalling their opponents and were bowled out for 153 , Radcliffe top @-@ scoring with 51 runs . Bastard collected another three wickets in the second innings , granting him one of two career ten @-@ wicket hauls , and Winter took four as Somerset bowled Hampshire out for 111 , leaving themselves needing 134 to win . None of Somerset 's top four batsmen reached 20 runs , but an unbeaten 50 from Hewett , accompanied by 32 from the number seven , Farrant Reed , helped Somerset achieve a five @-@ wicket victory . 
 For their next match Somerset travelled to Moreton @-@ in @-@ Marsh , where they faced Gloucestershire . Bastard did not take part in the match , and it fell to Winter to bowl the majority of the overs in his absence . Along with his fellow opener , James Parfitt , Winter claimed three wickets , but both openers conceded over 100 runs for their wickets . Sainsbury tried eight different bowlers in an effort to take wickets , and Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 448 after 190 overs . In reply , Somerset conceded their first three wickets for 18 runs , before a brief revival took them to 61 for 3 . The last seven wickets then fell for the addition of 39 more runs , and Somerset closed on 100 , still trailing their opponents by overs 300 runs . Captain Edward Sainsbury top @-@ scored for Somerset , reaching his highest total of the season , 40 , and only two other batsmen reached double figures for the county : Parfitt and the professional , Albert Clapp . Five Somerset players fell for ducks . Asked by Gloucestershire to follow on , Somerset batted even more poorly in their second effort , in which Winter 's total of 21 was the highest score . A total of 80 meant that they lost the match by an innings and 268 runs , their heaviest defeat in first @-@ class cricket at that point . 
 The county had just four days to rest and recover from their loss before facing Surrey at The Oval . Bastard was again unavailable for Somerset , and after losing the toss once more , Somerset spent the whole of the first day in the field . Surrey accumulated 564 runs during that day , and reached 635 before Somerset claimed the tenth wicket to close the innings . At that stage , Maurice Read remained at the crease , having scored 186 not out , his highest score in first @-@ class cricket . The Somerset opening bowlers , Winter and Parfitt , had both conceded in excess of 100 runs for the second match in a row . Sainsbury had utilised one less bowler than against Gloucestershire in his search for wickets , and claimed four of the wickets himself , recording a career @-@ best four for 74 . Hewett , whom he asked to bowl 30 overs , finished with 11 maiden overs . The 30 overs he bowled in the match accounted for over a quarter of all his bowling in first @-@ class cricket . In reply to Surrey 's total , Somerset were bowled out for 83 in their first innings , in which only John Challen and Crescens Robinson reached double figures , scoring 29 and 12 respectively . Clapp is recorded as " absent hurt " in both of Somerset 's innings . In the second innings , Somerset were much improved , reaching 251 , their highest batting total of the season . Radcliffe scored the county 's only century of the season , scoring 101 , and he shared a partnership of 129 with Hewett for the fourth wicket . Hewett reached his own highest score of the season , totalling 85 . Nevertheless Somerset 's loss was even heavier than that suffered a week earlier , losing by an innings and 301 runs . As of March 2011 , both of these back to back losses remain among the ten heaviest experienced by the county in first @-@ class cricket . 
 Somerset had just over a week off before their next match , for which they travelled to the County Ground , Southampton to face Hampshire once more . Possibly due to their losses in the previous two matches , Somerset could only field nine men in the fixture , a situation which Roebuck described as shameful . For the first time that season , Somerset batted first . They scored 117 , and a contemporary match report praised the batting of Winter and Radcliffe , who scored 22 and 34 respectively in the first innings . Bastard " did a capital performance in the first innings of Hants , taking eight of the ten wickets at a cost of only 59 runs " , according to the same report . Despite his efforts , Hampshire exceeded Somerset 's total , opening up a 45 @-@ run lead from the first innings . Winter top @-@ scored for Somerset in their second innings , reaching his highest total in first @-@ class cricket , 62 , after opening the batting . Scores in the 20s from Radcliffe and Egerton Hall helped take Somerset to 166 , but Hampshire reached the total required for victory with a day of the match remaining , winning by eight wickets . 
 Surrey visited the County Ground , Taunton a few days later for the counties ' second meeting of the season . In a repeat of their previous fixtures , Surrey won the toss and chose to bat . Bastard , who had not played in their earlier clash , opened the bowling for Somerset alongside John Challen . Bastard , presumably due to the weakness of the rest of the county 's attack , bowled 50 overs , but he could not repeat the successes he had achieved against Hampshire , toiling to take two for 99 . All of Somerset 's six bowlers in that innings claimed a wicket as Surrey were bowled out for 292 . In reply , Radcliffe occupied the crease as the batsmen at the other end came and went , scoring exactly half of Somerset 's 164 . Roe , Sainsbury and Hewett all reached double figures , but four Somerset batsmen were dismissed for ducks . Requested to follow on , Somerset fared less well in their second innings : Roe reached 43 , but no other batsman passed 20 , and Somerset were all out for 123 , five runs short of forcing Surrey to bat again . 
 Somerset were the hosts once more for their final match of the season , played with just a single day off after the Surrey match , and that only because the scheduled three @-@ day match was concluded in two days . The home side won the toss and elected to bat first against Gloucestershire , who opened the bowling with W. G. Grace and William Woof . The pair bowled unchanged for 30 overs each , and claimed five wickets apiece as Somerset were dismissed for 105 . Only Frederick Smith and Challen reached double figures , scoring 37 and 39 . In response , Gloucestershire totalled 242 , during which Bastard claimed four wickets , three of them from the tail . Somerset batted admirably in their second innings , with Roe and Hewett both scoring half @-@ centuries ( 76 and 66 respectively ) , and they reached 246 , six of the wickets falling to Woof , who collected eleven in the match . Gloucestershire achieved victory for the loss of just one wicket in their second innings , subjecting Somerset to their fifth successive loss .

 Somerset were stripped of their first @-@ class status for three reasons : they had not organised and played enough first @-@ class fixtures during the season , their performances were not what was expected from a first @-@ class county , and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches . An emergency meeting was held in Taunton during which a new club secretary was appointed , rules were altered , and wealthy benefactors were sought . Despite these widespread changes , Sainsbury retained the club captaincy . Somerset played second @-@ class cricket for five seasons , finishing as " second @-@ class county champions " in 1890 , after which they were readmitted to the first @-@ class game . 
 = 2015 Vattenfall Cyclassics = 
 The 2015 Vattenfall Cyclassics was a one @-@ day classic cycling race that took place in Northern Germany on 23 August . It was the 20th edition of the Vattenfall Cyclassics one @-@ day cycling race , and was the twenty @-@ third race of the 2015 UCI World Tour . The race started in Kiel and ended in Hamburg . The course was mainly flat ; the race generally suits sprinters , such as the defending champion , Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) . 
 Despite several attacks in the late part of the race , the outcome was decided in a sprint finish . Pre @-@ race favourite Marcel Kittel ( Giant – Alpecin ) was dropped on the final climb , while Mark Cavendish ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) was caught up in a crash with 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) remaining . Kristoff started the sprint , but André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) was able to follow him and come past to take his first victory in a one @-@ day World Tour race . With Kristoff finishing second , third place was taken by Giacomo Nizzolo ( Trek Factory Racing ) . 
 = = Route and background = = 
 The Vattenfall Cyclassics was the only UCI World Tour race held in Germany during the 2015 season . To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the race , the organizers picked a new route , starting on board of the ferry MS Stena <unk> in the harbour of Kiel , and heading in a southwesterly direction towards Hamburg . The overall distance was shortened from 247 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 153 @.@ 6 mi ) in the previous year to 221 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 137 @.@ 5 mi ) . The final kilometers inside the city remained the same , with the finish line on <unk> . The course was largely flat , thereby suiting sprinters . However , the 0 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 4 mi ) Waseberg with a gradient of up to 15 % was to be climbed three times . The first ascent of the Waseberg came with 68 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 42 @.@ 8 mi ) left to ride , the second and third at 28 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 17 @.@ 6 mi ) and 15 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) respectively . Race director Roland Hofer said of the course : " Although the race profile may appear more suitable for the sprinters , it can ultimately be won by all types of great rider , and it ’ s exactly this kind of race that ’ s needed for a well @-@ balanced WorldTour . " 
 The World Tour came to Germany in the midst of a " renaissance " in German cycling , with the latest successes rejuvenating the country 's interest in the sport after a series of setbacks during the past , doping @-@ stricken years . For the first time since 2008 , German public broadcaster ARD decided to provide live footage of the race . The route from Kiel to Hamburg was also chosen to boost the two cities ' joint bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics . This was to be the last time the race would run under the name of Vattenfall Cyclassics , as Vattenfall announced that they would not extend their sponsorship . The energy provider had a significant role in the establishment of the race in 1996 , under its earlier name HEW . The event will now be forced to search for a new sponsor to provide the estimated 800 @.@ 000 Euro previously supplied by Vattenfall , about a third of the race 's budget . 
 = = Teams = = 
 All 17 UCI WorldTeams are automatically entered and obliged to send a team to the race . Three UCI Professional Continental teams were also invited as wildcards . All twenty teams entered eight riders each , meaning that 160 riders took to the course . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 Given the nature of the course , a large number of sprint specialists came to the race , including local favourites Marcel Kittel ( Giant – Alpecin ) and André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) . Greipel came to the Cyclassics after having recently won a career @-@ best four stages at the Tour de France , and another stage win at the Eneco Tour . Meanwhile , Kittel rode as captain for Giant – Alpecin , while his teammate , 2013 winner John Degenkolb , went to compete in the Vuelta a España . Kittel had returned to competition after an illness just a week earlier at the Tour de Pologne , winning a stage . He would race with the support of his sprinter teammates Nikias Arndt and Ramon <unk> . Both Greipel and Kittel gave hope to the local fans for a German victory . Since the event was renamed from HEW Cyclassics into Vattenfall Cyclassics in 2006 , Degenkolb had been the only German winner , in 2013 . Coming into the race carrying his good form from the Tour de France , Greipel was seen as the more likely contender for race victory than Kittel . Gerald Ciolek ( MTN – Qhubeka ) and Rick Zabel ( BMC Racing Team ) were two more sprinters considered to have ambitions to win the race , while an attack by Tony Martin ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) was deemed " a distinct possibility " . For Martin , it was the first race after he broke his collarbone while wearing the yellow jersey at the Tour de France . 
 The main non @-@ German favourites for the win were the previous year 's winner Alexander Kristoff , ( Team Katusha ) and Mark Cavendish ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) . While Kristoff came from a " disappointing Tour de France " , Cavendish could count on the support of teammates Mark Renshaw and Tom Boonen , who was preparing for the Road World Championships in late September . Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) , who had won the race in 2012 , was competing , as was 2011 winner Edvald Boasson Hagen ( MTN – Qhubeka ) . Other riders in contention for the victory were Ben Swift , Elia Viviani ( both Team Sky ) , Michael Albasini ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) , Samuel Dumoulin ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Sacha Modolo ( Lampre – Merida ) , Moreno Hofland ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , and Giacomo Nizzolo ( Trek Factory Racing ) . Tinkoff – Saxo aimed to defy the odds of a sprint finish , and named Matti Breschel as their captain . Sam Bennett ( Bora – Argon 18 ) was named as a " very strong outsider " .

 Shortly after the peloton left the ferry in Kiel 's harbour , an early breakaway formed , including Jan Bárta ( Bora – Argon 18 ) , Matteo Bono ( Lampre – Merida ) , Alex Dowsett ( Movistar Team ) , and Martin Mortensen ( Cult Energy Pro Cycling ) . The group was able to establish a lead of up to five minutes , while MTN – Qhubeka controlled the pace in the field for most of the day , before Lotto – Soudal and Etixx – Quick @-@ Step joined them at the front for their respective team captains . 60 kilometres ( 37 @.@ 3 mi ) from the finish , the lead group had broken up , with only Bono and Mortensen left with a lead of less than one minute . With 43 kilometres ( 26 @.@ 7 mi ) left to ride , the two were joined by former road race world champion Philippe Gilbert ( BMC Racing Team ) , Manuele Boaro ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , and Matthias Brändle ( IAM Cycling ) , now leading by about half a minute . 20 km from the finish , the peloton had caught the escape group , and a field of about 75 riders was set to ride for the race victory . 
 Another late attack came from Linus Gerdemann ( Cult Energy Pro Cycling ) and Julian Alaphilippe ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , but they were unable to build a significant gap , and were reeled back in with 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to go . While favourite Marcel Kittel dropped out of the field at the last ascend of the Waseberg , ruling him out of contention , Mark Cavendish was involved in a crash with 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to go . While the sprint trains fought for the lead of the field , Cavendish touched wheels with another rider and was brought to the ground . He was able to continue and eventually finished 66th , but was unable to compete for the victory . At the finish line , the victory was decided by a bunch sprint . Kristoff was the first to open the sprint , but Greipel was able to get around him to claim his first ever win in a one @-@ day World Tour race . Italian rider Giacomo Nizzolo claimed third for Trek Factory Racing .

 = Crocodile shark = 
 The crocodile shark ( Pseudocarcharias kamoharai ) is a species of mackerel shark and the only extant member of the family <unk> . A specialized inhabitant of the mesopelagic zone , the crocodile shark can be found worldwide in tropical waters from the surface to a depth of 590 m ( 1 @,@ 940 ft ) . It performs a diel vertical migration , staying below a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) during the day and ascending into shallower water at night to feed . Typically measuring only 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) in length , the crocodile shark is the smallest living mackerel shark . It can be distinguished by its elongated cigar @-@ shaped body , extremely large eyes , and relatively small fins . 
 An active @-@ swimming predator of pelagic bony fishes , squid and shrimp , the crocodile shark has a sizable oily liver that allows it to maintain its position in the water column with minimal effort . The size and structure of its eyes suggests that it is adapted for hunting at night . The crocodile shark is aplacental viviparous , with females typically giving birth to litters of four . The fetuses are oophagous , meaning that they feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated for this purpose by their mother . Due to its small size , the crocodile shark poses little danger to humans and is of little commercial importance . However , substantial numbers are caught as bycatch , leading it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . This species was responsible for damaging deep sea fiberoptic cables when the technology was first deployed in 1985 . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The English common name " crocodile shark " is derived from its Japanese name <unk> ( <unk> , literally " water crocodile " ) , which refers to its sharp teeth and habit of snapping vigorously when taken out of the water . Other common names for this species include Japanese ragged @-@ tooth shark , <unk> 's sand @-@ shark , and water crocodile . The crocodile shark was first described as Carcharias kamoharai in a 1936 issue of Zoological Magazine ( Tokyo ) by ichthyologist <unk> Matsubara , based on a 73 @.@ 5 cm ( 28 @.@ 9 in ) long specimen found at the Koti Fish Market in Japan . The type specimen is a 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) long adult male found at a fish market in Su @-@ ao , Taiwan . 
 After being shuffled between the genera Carcharias and Odontaspis in the family Odontaspididae by various authors , in 1973 Leonard Compagno resurrected Jean <unk> 's 1963 subgenus Pseudocarcharias from synonymy for this species and placed it within its own family . The morphology of the crocodile shark suggests affinity with the megamouth shark ( <unk> ) , basking shark ( <unk> ) , thresher sharks ( Alopiidae ) , and mackerel sharks ( Lamnidae ) . More recent phylogenetic analyses , based on mitochondrial DNA , have suggested that the crocodile shark is closely related to either the megamouth shark or the sand sharks ( Odontaspididae ) . Alternately , analysis based on dentition suggests that the closest relatives of the crocodile shark are the thresher sharks , followed by the mackerel sharks . Fossil Pseudocarcharias teeth dating to the <unk> age ( 13 @.@ 6 – 11 @.@ 6 Ma ) of the Miocene epoch have been found in Italy , and are identical to those of the modern @-@ day crocodile shark . 
 = = Description = = 
 The crocodile shark has a spindle @-@ shaped body with a short head and a bulbous , pointed snout . The eyes are very large and lack nictating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) . The five pairs of gill slits are long , extending onto the dorsal surface . The sizable , arched jaws can be protruded almost to the tip of the snout and contain large teeth , shaped like spikes in the front and knives on the sides . There are fewer than 30 tooth rows in either jaw ; in the upper jaw , the first two large teeth are separated from the lateral teeth by a row of small intermediate teeth . 
 The pectoral fins are small , broad , and rounded . The pelvic fins are nearly as large as the pectorals . The first dorsal fin is small , low and angular ; the second dorsal fin is smaller than the first but larger than the anal fin . The caudal fin is asymmetrical with a moderately long upper lobe . The caudal peduncle is slightly compressed with weak lateral keels . The dermal denticles are small , with a flattened crown bearing small ridges and backward @-@ pointing cusps It is dark brown above and paler below , sometimes with a few dark blotches on the sides and belly and / or a white blotch between the corner of the mouth and the first gill slit . The fins have thin translucent to white margins . The crocodile shark grows to a maximum length of 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 6 ft ) . Most individuals are 1 m ( 3 ft ) long and weigh 4 – 6 kg ( 9 – 13 lbs ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The crocodile shark is almost circumtropical in distribution . In the Atlantic Ocean , it is known from off Brazil , Cape Verde , Guinea @-@ Bissau , Guinea , Angola , South Africa , and Saint Helena Island , though it has not yet been reported from the northwestern Atlantic . In the Indian Ocean , it occurs in the Mozambique Channel and possibly the Agulhas Current and the Bay of Bengal . In the Pacific , it occurs from Japan , Taiwan , and the Korean Peninsula in the northwest , southward to Indonesia , Australia , and New Zealand , and eastward to the western coast of the Americas from Baja California to Chile , including the Marshall , Phoenix , Palmyra , Johnston , Marquesas , Line , and Hawaiian Islands in between . 
 From distribution records , the crocodile shark 's range seems to be bound by the latitudes 37 ° N and 44 ° S , where the average sea surface temperature is 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) . This species is not evenly distributed but is rather locally abundant in certain areas , suggesting that it is not strongly migratory . The crocodile shark is usually found in the pelagic zone from the surface to a depth of 590 m ( 1 @,@ 940 ft ) . It is occasionally encountered inshore near the bottom and has been known to strand on the beaches of South Africa , possibly after being stunned by upwellings of cold water . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 With a long body , small fins , and large liver rich in squalene and other low @-@ density lipids , the crocodile shark is convergently similar to mesopelagic dogfish sharks such as the cookiecutter shark ( Isistius brasiliensis ) . The liver may comprise a fifth of the shark 's weight , and acts as an <unk> float that allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in the water column with little effort . Like many other inhabitants of the mesopelagic zone , the crocodile shark apparently migrates closer to the surface at night to feed and descends into deeper water during the day , being rarely found above a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) during daytime . 
 The large eyes of the crocodile shark , equipped with a reflective green or yellow retina and lacking an expanded iris , suggest that it is a nocturnal hunter that relies on sight to pick out the silhouettes or bioluminescence of its prey . Little is known of the crocodile shark 's feeding habits ; it is thought to be an active , fast @-@ swimming predator based on its strong musculature , large tail , and behavior when captured . On one occasion , a crocodile shark off Cape Point , South Africa , jumped out of the water in pursuit of bait . Its diet consists of small to medium @-@ sized bony fishes ( including bristlemouths and lanternfishes ) , squid ( including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) and shrimp . Crocodile sharks are not known to be preyed upon by any other species . 
 The crocodile shark is aplacental viviparous and typically gives birth to litters of four , two pups to each uterus . The gestation period is unknown but believed to be long . The embryos have yolk sacs at 3 – 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) long ; once the yolk sac is fully absorbed they become oophagous : the mother produces large numbers of thin @-@ walled egg capsules that contain 2 – 9 eggs each , which are then consumed by the unborn embryos . The abdomens of the embryos become characteristically distended with ingested yolk material , which can make up a quarter of the embryo 's total weight . It is unclear how two crocodile shark fetuses manage to share a single uterus , when in some other oophagous mackerel sharks such as the sand tiger shark ( Carcharias taurus ) , only one fetus survives in each uterus . The pups are born at approximately 40 cm ( 16 in ) long ; males attain maturity at 74 – 110 cm ( 29 – 43 in ) and females at 89 – 102 cm ( 35 – 40 in ) . There is no defined reproductive season . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 With its small size , non @-@ cutting teeth , and oceanic habitat , the crocodile shark is not considered dangerous to humans . However , it has a powerful bite that invites caution . This species is a common bycatch of various pelagic longline fisheries meant for tuna and swordfish . The largest numbers are caught by the Japanese yellowfin tuna fishery and the Australian swordfish fishery , both operating in the Indian Ocean . This species is also sometimes caught on squid jigs and in tuna gillnets . It is usually discarded due to its small size and low @-@ quality meat . However , its oily liver is potentially valuable . No data is available on the population status of the crocodile shark , though it is probably declining from bycatch mortality . Coupled with its low reproductive rate , this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to assessed it as Near Threatened . 
 After AT & T installed the first deep sea fiberoptic cable between Gran Canaria and Tenerife in the Canary Islands in September 1985 , the system suffered a series of shorts that necessitated costly repairs . It was discovered that attacks from the crocodile shark were responsible for most of the failures , possibly because they were attracted to the electric field around the cables . Since crocodile sharks are not benthic in nature , they were presumably biting the cables as they were being deployed . The problem was solved by protecting the cables with a layer of steel tape beneath a dense polyethylene coating .

 The Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance was an honor presented to male recording artists at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 and the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004 for quality rap solo performances . The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 , and originally called the Gramophone Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to " honor artistic achievement , technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position " . 
 Starting in 1991 , the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Best Rap Solo Performance category . In 2003 , the category was divided by gender with the introduction of the Female to accompany the award for Male Rap Solo Performances . The categories remained separated by gender until 2005 when they were combined into the genderless category originally known as Best Rap Solo Performance .

Female rapper MC Lyte has campaigned for the reinstatement of the female @-@ specific category and believes that " it destroys [ hip @-@ hop ] culture to not have the perspective of a woman " . Bill Freimuth , Recording Academy Vice President of Awards , claimed that the category was eliminated because " [ there ] wasn 't enough competition essentially , due to the lack of the number of releases in that category . " Black Entertainment Television ( BET ) executive Stephen Hill cited a similar reason for the elimination of the female categories by the BET Hip Hop Awards and VH1 's Hip Hop Honors , reflecting a lack of female representation in the hip hop music scene for several years . As of 2011 , the category name has not changed since 2005 .

 = HD 205739 b = 
 HD 205739 b is an extrasolar planet located approximately 350 light @-@ years away in the constellation of Piscis Austrinus , orbiting the star HD 205739 . This planet has a minimum mass 37 % more than Jupiter and orbits 90 % of the distance between the Earth and the Sun . The planet has a very elliptical orbit , which has led its discoverers to postulate that the planet 's surface temperature varies by about 100 K along the entire orbit . This planet was reported on September 5 , 2008 after its discovery at Las Campanas Observatory , where the planet was observed for years by the N2K Consortium while using the Magellan Telescopes . Follow @-@ up observations collected the radial velocity measurements necessary to confirm the candidate as a planet .

 HD 205739 's designation is from the Henry Draper catalogue . The star was also observed by Hipparcos , which released its catalogue in 1997 . The observations that led to the discovery of the planet HD 205739 b started when the N2K Consortium started an extended search for planets around 300 stars not usually targeted by Doppler spectroscopy surveys . In the case of HD 205739 , the star was observed using the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile . HD 205739 was selected primarily because it was a metal @-@ rich star ; the N2K collaboration biased their search towards metal @-@ rich stars with closely orbiting Jupiter @-@ size planets , hoping to find a connection between a star 's metallicity and its planets ' masses . 
 HD 205739 was flagged originally as a candidate hosting a Hot Jupiter , which is a large gas giant that orbits closely to its star , although later observations suggested that the planetary candidate orbited further out over the next 3 @.@ 5 years of observation . 
 The star was studied through the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph 's ( MIKE ) ability to use Doppler spectroscopy to measure radial velocity . Twenty @-@ four measurements were recorded for HD 205739 . The measurements were analyzed for accuracy . They were then used to derive the planet 's characteristics , which led to the planet 's confirmation . 
 The team of astronomers , which were from the United States , Chile , and the Vatican City , sent the paper to the Astronomical Journal on April 7 , 2008 . The paper was accepted , and was later published on October 7 , 2008 .

 HD 205739 is an F @-@ type star with a mass that is 1 @.@ 22 times the mass of the Sun and a size that is 1 @.@ 33 times the radius of the Sun . In other words , it is slightly more massive and slightly larger than the Sun is . With an effective temperature of <unk> K , HD 205739 is also hotter than the Sun , although it is younger , at an estimated age of 2 @.@ 84 billion years . The star is rich in iron ; its measured metallicity is [ Fe / H ] = 0 @.@ 19 , or 1 @.@ 55 times the iron detected in the Sun . After analysis of HD 205739 's spectrum , it can be concluded that HD 205739 's chromosphere ( its outermost layer ) is not active . HD 205739 cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye because the star has an apparent magnitude ( V ) of 8 @.@ 56 .
