 Although many Arabians appear to have a " white " hair coat , they are not genetically " white " . This color is usually created by the natural action of the gray gene , and virtually all white @-@ looking Arabians are actually grays . A specialized colorization seen in some older gray Arabians is the so @-@ called " bloody @-@ shoulder " , which is a particular type of " flea @-@ bitten " gray with localized aggregations of pigment on the shoulder . 
 There are a very few Arabians registered as " white " having a white coat , pink skin and dark eyes from birth . These animals are believed to manifest a new form of dominant white , a result of a nonsense mutation in DNA tracing to a single stallion foaled in 1996 . This horse was originally thought to be a sabino , but actually was found to have a new form of dominant white mutation , now labeled W3 . It is possible that white mutations have occurred in Arabians in the past or that mutations other than W3 exist but have not been verified by genetic testing . 
 = = = = Sabino = = = = 
 One spotting pattern , sabino , does exist in purebred Arabians . Sabino coloring is characterized by white markings such as " high white " above the knees and hocks , irregular spotting on the legs , belly and face , white markings that extend beyond the eyes or under the chin and jaw , and sometimes lacy or <unk> edges . 
 The genetic mechanism that produces sabino patterning in Arabians is undetermined , and more than one gene may be involved . Studies at the University of California , Davis indicate that Arabians do not appear to carry the autosomal dominant gene " SB1 " or sabino 1 , that often produces bold spotting and some completely white horses in other breeds . The inheritance patterns observed in sabino @-@ like Arabians also do not follow the same mode of inheritance as sabino 1 . 
 = = = = <unk> or roan ? = = = = 
 There are very few Arabians registered as roan , and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg , roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics . Unlike a genetic roan , rabicano is a partial roan @-@ like pattern ; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body , only on the midsection and flanks , the head and legs are solid @-@ colored . Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both . However , a roan does not consistently lighten with age , while a gray does . 
 = = = = Colors that do not exist in purebreds = = = = 
 Purebred Arabians never carry dilution genes . Therefore , purebreds cannot be colors such as dun , cremello , palomino or buckskin . However , there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian @-@ type horses in antiquity . Nonetheless , purebred Arabians today do not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex ( " Appaloosa " ) spotting patterns , except for sabino . 
 Spotting or excess white was believed by many breeders to be a mark of impurity until DNA testing for verification of parentage became standard . For a time , horses with belly spots and other white markings deemed excessive were discouraged from registration and excess white was sometimes penalized in the show ring . 
 To produce horses with some Arabian characteristics but coat colors not found in purebreds , they have to be crossbred with other breeds . Though the purebred Arabian produces a limited range of potential colors , they do not appear to carry any color @-@ based lethal disorders such as the frame overo gene ( " O " ) that can produce lethal white syndrome ( LWS ) . Because purebred Arabians cannot produce LWS foals , Arabian mares were used as a non @-@ affected population in some of the studies seeking the gene that caused the condition in other breeds . Nonetheless , partbred Arabian offspring can , in some cases , carry these genes if the non @-@ Arabian parent was a carrier . 
 = = = Genetic disorders = = = 
 There are six known genetic disorders in Arabian horses . Two are inevitably fatal , two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia of the affected animal ; the remaining conditions can usually be treated . Three are thought to be autosomal recessive conditions , which means that the flawed gene is not sex @-@ linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born ; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance . Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases ; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds , including the American Quarter Horse , American Paint Horse , American Saddlebred , Appaloosa , Miniature horse , and Belgian . 
 Genetic diseases that can occur in purebred Arabians , or in <unk> with Arabian ancestry in both parents , are the following : 
 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency ( <unk> ) . Recessive disorder , fatal when homozygous , carriers ( heterozygotes ) show no signs . Similar to the " bubble boy " condition in humans , an affected foal is born with a complete lack of an immune system , and thus generally dies of an opportunistic infection , usually before the age of three months . There is a DNA test that can detect healthy horses who are carriers of the gene causing <unk> , thus testing and careful , planned matings can now eliminate the possibility of an affected foal ever being born . 
 Lavender Foal Syndrome ( LFS ) , also called Coat Color Dilution Lethal ( <unk> ) . Recessive disorder , fatal when homozygous , carriers show no signs . The condition has its name because most affected foals are born with a coat color dilution that lightens the tips of the coat hairs , or even the entire hair shaft . Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth , often have seizures , and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth . In November 2009 , Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS . Simultaneously , the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test . 
 Cerebellar abiotrophy ( CA or CCA ) . Recessive disorder , homozygous horses are affected , carriers show no signs . An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs , but at some stage , usually after six weeks of age , develops severe <unk> , a head tremor , wide @-@ legged stance and other symptoms related to the death of the <unk> cells in the cerebellum . Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards , and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident . Severity varies , with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems , others showing milder signs . <unk> affected horses can live a full lifespan , but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident @-@ prone as to be dangerous . As of 2008 , there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals . Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions , and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia . 
 <unk> <unk> @-@ Axial <unk> ( <unk> ) . This is a condition where the occiput , atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and at the base of the skull are fused or malformed . Symptoms range from mild <unk> to the paralysis of both front and rear legs . Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse , in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks . This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1 month of age , and a radiograph can diagnose the condition . There is no genetic test for <unk> , and the hereditary component of this condition is not well researched at present . 
 Equine juvenile epilepsy , or Juvenile Idiopathic Epilepsy , sometimes referred to as " benign " epilepsy , is not usually fatal . Foals appear normal between epileptic seizures , and seizures usually stop occurring between 12 and 18 months . Affected foals may show signs of epilepsy anywhere from two days to six months from birth . Seizures can be treated with traditional anti @-@ seizure medications , which may reduce their severity . Though the condition has been studied since 1985 at the University of California , Davis , the genetic mode of inheritance is unclear , though the cases studied were all of one general bloodline group . Recent research updates suggest that a dominant mode of inheritance is involved in transmission of this trait . One researcher hypothesized that epilepsy may be linked in some fashion to Lavender Foal Syndrome due to the fact that it occurs in similar bloodlines and some horses have produced foals with both conditions . 
 Guttural Pouch <unk> ( <unk> ) occurs in horses ranging from birth to 1 year of age and is more common in fillies than in colts . It is thought to be genetic in Arabians , possibly polygenic in inheritance , but more study is needed . Foals are born with a defect that causes the pharyngeal opening of the <unk> tube to act like a one @-@ way valve – air can get in , but it cannot get out . The affected guttural pouch is distended with air and forms a characteristic <unk> swelling . Breathing is noisy in severely affected animals . Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and radiographic examination of the skull . Medical management with NSAID and antimicrobial therapy can treat upper respiratory tract inflammation . Surgical intervention is needed to correct the malformation of the guttural pouch opening , to provide a route for air in the abnormal guttural pouch to pass to the normal side and be expelled into the pharynx . Foals that are successfully treated may grow up to have fully useful lives . 
 The Arabian Horse Association in the United States has created a foundation that supports research efforts to uncover the roots of genetic diseases . The organization <unk> ( Fight Off Arabian <unk> ) is a clearinghouse for information on these conditions . Additional information is available from the World Arabian Horse Association ( WAHO ) . 
 = = Legends = = 
 Arabian horses are the topic of many myths and legends . One origin story tells how Muhammad chose his foundation mares by a test of their courage and loyalty . While there are several variants on the tale , a common version states that after a long journey through the desert , Muhammad turned his herd of horses loose to race to an oasis for a desperately needed drink of water . Before the herd reached the water , Muhammad called for the horses to return to him . Only five mares responded . Because they faithfully returned to their master , though desperate with thirst , these mares became his favorites and were called Al Khamsa , meaning , the five . These mares became the legendary founders of the five " strains " of the Arabian horse . Although the Al Khamsa are generally considered fictional horses of legend , some breeders today claim the modern Bedouin Arabian actually descended from these mares . 
 Another origin tale claims that King Solomon was given a pure Arabian @-@ type mare named <unk> ( " the pure " ) by the Queen of Sheba . A different version says that Solomon gave a stallion , Zad el @-@ <unk> or Zad @-@ el @-@ <unk> ( " Gift to the Rider " ) , to the Banu Azd people when they came to pay tribute to the king . This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle , and every hunt with him was successful , thus when he was put to stud , he became a founding sire of legend . 
 Yet another creation myth puts the origin of the Arabian in the time of Ishmael , the son of Abraham . In this story , the Angel Jibril ( also known as Gabriel ) descended from Heaven and awakened Ishmael with a " wind @-@ spout " that whirled toward him . The Angel then commanded the thundercloud to stop scattering dust and rain , and so it gathered itself into a prancing , handsome creature - a horse - that seemed to swallow up the ground . Hence , the Bedouins bestowed the title " Drinker of the Wind " to the first Arabian horse . 
 Finally , a Bedouin story states that Allah created the Arabian horse from the south wind and exclaimed , " I create thee , Oh Arabian . To thy forelock , I bind Victory in battle . On thy back , I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins . I establish thee as one of the Glories of the Earth ... I give thee flight without wings . " Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind : " I want to make a creature out of you . <unk> . " Then from the material condensed from the wind , he made a <unk> @-@ colored animal ( a bay or burnt chestnut ) and said : " I call you Horse ; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant ; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes ; you shall be the Lord of the other animals . Men shall follow you wherever you go ; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit ; you shall fly without wings ; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation . " 
 = = Origins = = 
 Arabians are one of the oldest human @-@ developed horse breeds in the world . The progenitor stock , the Oriental subtype or " Proto @-@ Arabian " was a horse with oriental characteristics similar to the modern Arabian . Horses with these features appeared in rock paintings and inscriptions in the Arabian Peninsula dating back 3500 years . In ancient history throughout the Ancient Near East , horses with refined heads and high @-@ carried tails were depicted in artwork , particularly that of Ancient Egypt in the 16th century BC . 
 Some scholars of the Arabian horse once theorized that the Arabian came from a separate subspecies of horse , known as <unk> caballus <unk> . Other scholars , including Gladys Brown Edwards , a noted Arabian researcher , believe that the " dry " oriental horses of the desert , from which the modern Arabian developed , were more likely Equus ferus caballus with specific landrace characteristics based on the environments in which they lived , rather than being a separate subspecies . Horses with similar , though not identical , physical characteristics include the Marwari horse of India , the Barb of North Africa , the Akhal @-@ Teke of western Asia and the now @-@ extinct Turkoman Horse . 
 = = = Desert roots = = = 
 There are different theories about where the ancestors of the Arabian originally lived . Most evidence suggests the proto @-@ Arabian came from the area along the northern edge of the Fertile Crescent . Another hypothesis suggests the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula , in modern @-@ day Yemen , where three now @-@ dry riverbeds indicate good natural pastures existed long ago , perhaps as far back as the Ice Age . This hypothesis has gained renewed attention following a 2010 discovery of artifacts dated between <unk> and <unk> BCE in Al @-@ <unk> , in southwestern Saudi Arabia , that appeared to portray horses . 
 The proto @-@ Arabian horse may have been domesticated by the people of the Arabian peninsula known today as the Bedouin , some time after they learned to use the camel , approximately 4 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 years ago . One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia . Other scholars , noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of Islam , theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin . The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800 @-@ 2000 BCE . 
 Regardless of origin , climate and culture ultimately created the Arabian . The desert environment required a domesticated horse to cooperate with humans to survive ; humans were the only providers of food and water in certain areas , and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive ( most horses can only live about 72 hours without water ) . Where there was no pasture or water , the Bedouin fed their horses dates and camel 's milk . The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food , and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night . Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool , and the animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare . 
 The Bedouin way of life depended on camels and horses : Arabians were bred to be war horses with speed , endurance , soundness , and intelligence . Because many raids required stealth , mares were preferred over stallions as they were quieter , and therefore would not give away the position of the fighters . A good disposition was also critical ; prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators . Though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor , the Bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features . 
 = = = Strains and pedigrees = = = 
 For centuries , the Bedouin tracked the ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition . Horses of the purest blood were known as Asil and crossbreeding with non @-@ Asil horses was forbidden . Mares were the most valued , both for riding and breeding , and pedigree families were traced through the female line . The Bedouin did not believe in gelding male horses , and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses , thus they kept very few colts , selling most , and culling those of poor quality . 
 Over time , the Bedouin developed several sub @-@ types or strains of Arabian horse , each with unique characteristics , and traced through the maternal line only . According to the Arabian Horse Association , the five primary strains were known as the <unk> , Seglawi , <unk> , Hamdani and <unk> . Carl Raswan , a promoter and writer about Arabian horses from the middle of the 20th century , held the belief that there were only three strains , <unk> , Seglawi and <unk> . Raswan felt that these strains represented body " types " of the breed , with the <unk> being " masculine " , the Seglawi being " feminine " and the <unk> being " speedy " . There were also lesser strains , sub @-@ strains , and regional variations in strain names . Therefore , many Arabian horses were not only Asil , of pure blood , but also bred to be pure in strain , with crossbreeding between strains discouraged , though not forbidden , by some tribes . Purity of bloodline was very important to the Bedouin , and they also believed in telegony , believing if a mare was ever bred to a stallion of " impure " blood , the mare herself and all future offspring would be " contaminated " by the stallion and hence no longer Asil . 
 This complex web of bloodline and strain was an integral part of Bedouin culture ; they not only knew the pedigrees and history of their best war mares in detail , but also carefully tracked the breeding of their camels , Saluki dogs , and their own family or tribal history . Eventually , written records began to be kept ; the first written pedigrees in the Middle East that specifically used the term " Arabian " date to 1330 AD . As important as strain was to the Bedouin , modern studies of mitochondrial DNA suggest that Arabian horses alive today with records stating descent from a given strain may not actually share a common maternal ancestry .

 = = = Role in the ancient world = = = 
 Fiery war horses with dished faces and high @-@ carried tails were popular artistic subjects in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia , often depicted pulling chariots in war or for hunting . Horses with oriental characteristics appear in later artwork as far north as that of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire . While this type of horse was not called an " Arabian " in the Ancient Near East until later , ( the word " Arabia " or " <unk> " first appeared in writing in Ancient Persia , c . 500 BC ) these proto @-@ Arabians shared many characteristics with the modern Arabian , including speed , endurance , and refinement . For example , a horse skeleton unearthed in the Sinai peninsula , dated to 1700 BC and probably brought by the Hyksos invaders , is considered the earliest physical evidence of the horse in Ancient Egypt . This horse had a wedge @-@ shaped head , large eye sockets and small muzzle , all characteristics of the Arabian horse . 
 = = = In Islamic history = = = 
 Following the Hijra in AD 622 ( also sometimes spelled <unk> ) , the Arabian horse spread across the known world of the time , and became recognized as a distinct , named breed . It played a significant role in the History of the Middle East and of Islam . By 630 , Muslim influence expanded across the Middle East and North Africa , by 711 Muslim warriors had reached Spain , and they controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula by 720 . Their war horses were of various oriental types , including both Arabians and the Barb horse of North Africa . 
 Arabian horses also spread to the rest of the world via the Ottoman Empire , which rose in 1299 . Though it never fully dominated the heart of the Arabian Peninsula , this Turkish empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade , diplomacy and war . The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses , and Ottoman nobles , such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure , desert @-@ bred Arabian horses . 
 El <unk> , or Al @-@ Nasir Muhammad , Sultan of Egypt ( 1290 – 1342 ) imported and bred numerous Arabians in Egypt . A stud farm record was made of his purchases describing many of the horses as well as their abilities , and was deposited in his library , becoming a source for later study . Through the Ottomans , Arabian horses were often sold , traded , or given as diplomatic gifts to Europeans and , later , to Americans . 
 = = = Egypt = = = 
 Historically , Egyptian breeders imported horses bred in the deserts of Palestine and the Arabian peninsula as the source of their foundation bloodstock . By the time that the Ottoman Empire dominated Egypt , the political elites of the region still recognized the need for quality bloodstock for both war and for horse racing , and some continued to return to the deserts to obtain pure @-@ blooded Arabians . One of the most famous was Muhammad Ali of Egypt , also known as Muhammad Ali Pasha , who established an extensive stud farm in the 19th century . After his death , some of his stock was bred on by Abbas I of Egypt , also known as Abbas Pasha . However , after Abbas Pasha was assassinated in 1854 , his heir , El Hami Pasha , sold most of his horses , often for crossbreeding , and gave away many others as diplomatic gifts . A remnant of the herd was obtained by Ali Pasha Sherif , who then went back to the desert to bring in new bloodstock . At its peak , the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif had over 400 purebred Arabians . Unfortunately , an epidemic of African horse sickness in the 1870s that killed thousands of horses throughout Egypt decimated much of his herd , wiping out several irreplaceable bloodlines . Late in his life , he sold several horses to Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt , who exported them to Crabbet Park Stud in England . After his death , Lady Anne was also able to gather many remaining horses at her Sheykh <unk> stud . 
 Meanwhile , the passion brought by the Blunts to saving the pure horse of the desert helped Egyptian horse breeders to convince their government of the need to preserve the best of their own remaining pure Arabian bloodstock that descended from the horses collected over the previous century by Muhammad Ali Pasha , Abbas Pasha and Ali Pasha Sherif . The government of Egypt formed the Royal Agricultural Society ( RAS ) in 1908 , which is known today as the Egyptian Agricultural Organization ( <unk> ) . RAS representatives traveled to England during the 1920s and purchased eighteen descendants of the original Blunt exports from Lady Wentworth at Crabbet Park , and returned these bloodlines to Egypt in order to restore bloodlines had been lost . Other than several horses purchased by Henry Babson for importation to the United States in the 1930s , and one other small group exported to the USA in 1947 , relatively few Egyptian @-@ bred Arabian horses were exported until the overthrow of King Farouk I in 1952 . Many of the private stud farms of the princes were then confiscated and the animals taken over by the <unk> . In the 1960s and 1970s , as oil development brought more foreign investors to Egypt , some of whom were horse fanciers , Arabians were exported to Germany and to the United States , as well as to the former Soviet Union . Today , the designation " Straight Egyptian " or " Egyptian Arabian " is popular with some Arabian breeders , and the modern Egyptian @-@ bred Arabian is an outcross used to add refinement in some breeding programs . 
 = = Arrival in Europe = = 
 Probably the earliest horses with Arabian bloodlines to enter Europe came indirectly , through Spain and France . Others would have arrived with returning Crusaders — beginning in 1095 , European armies invaded Palestine and many knights returned home with Arabian horses as spoils of war . Later , as knights and the heavy , armored war horses who carried them became obsolete , Arabian horses and their descendants were used to develop faster , agile light cavalry horses that were used in warfare into the 20th century . 
 Another major infusion of Arabian horses into Europe occurred when the Ottoman Turks sent 300 @,@ 000 horsemen into Hungary in 1522 , many of whom were mounted on pure @-@ blooded Arabians , captured during raids into Arabia . By 1529 , the Ottomans reached Vienna , where they were stopped by the Polish and Hungarian armies , who captured these horses from the defeated Ottoman cavalry . Some of these animals provided foundation bloodstock for the major studs of eastern Europe . 
 = = = Polish and Russian breeding programs = = = 
 With the rise of light cavalry , the stamina and agility of horses with Arabian blood gave an enormous military advantage to any army who possessed them . As a result , many European monarchs began to support large breeding establishments that crossed Arabians on local stock , one example being <unk> , the royal stud of Polish king Zygmunt II August , and another the Imperial Russian Stud of Peter the Great . 
 European horse breeders also obtained Arabian stock directly from the desert or via trade with the Ottomans . In Russia , Count Alexey Orlov obtained many Arabians , including <unk> , an Arabian stallion who became a foundation sire of the Orlov trotter . Orlov then provided Arabian horses to Catherine the Great , who in 1772 owned 12 pure Arabian stallions and 10 mares . By 1889 two members of the Russian nobility , Count Stroganov and Prince <unk> , established Arabian stud farms to meet the continued need to breed Arabians as a source of pure bloodstock . 
 In Poland , notable imports from Arabia included those of Prince Hieronymous Sanguszko ( 1743 – 1812 ) , who founded the <unk> stud . Poland 's first state @-@ run Arabian stud farm , Janów Podlaski , was established by the decree of Alexander I of Russia in 1817 , and by 1850 , the great stud farms of Poland were well @-@ established , including <unk> , owned by the Polish Count Potocki ( who had married into the Sanguszko family ) ; later notable as the farm that produced the stallion Skowronek . 
 = = = Central and western Europe = = = 
 The 18th century marked the establishment of most of the great Arabian studs of Europe , dedicated to preserving " pure " Arabian bloodstock . The Prussians set up a royal stud in 1732 , originally intended to provide horses for the royal stables , and other studs were established to breed animals for other uses , including mounts for the Prussian army . The foundation of these breeding programs was the crossing of Arabians on native horses ; by 1873 some English observers felt that the Prussian <unk> mounts were superior in endurance to those of the British , and credited Arabian bloodlines for this superiority . 
 Other state studs included the <unk> Stud of Hungary , set up in 1789 , and the Weil stud in Germany ( now Weil @-@ Marbach or the Marbach stud ) , founded in 1817 by King William I of Württemberg . King James I of England imported the first Arabian stallion , the Markham Arabian , to England in 1616 . Arabians were also introduced into European race horse breeding , especially in England via the Darley Arabian , <unk> Turk , and Godolphin Arabian , the three foundation stallions of the modern Thoroughbred breed , who were each brought to England during the 18th century . Other monarchs obtained Arabian horses , often as personal mounts . One of the most famous Arabian stallions in Europe was Marengo , the war horse ridden by Napoleon Bonaparte . 
 During the mid @-@ 19th century , the need for Arabian blood to improve the breeding stock for light cavalry horses in Europe resulted in more excursions to the Middle East . Queen Isabel II of Spain sent representatives to the desert to purchase Arabian horses and by 1847 had established a stud book ; her successor , King Alfonso XII imported additional bloodstock from other European nations . By 1893 , the state military stud farm , <unk> Militar was established in Córdoba , Spain for breeding both Arabian and Iberian horses . The military remained heavily involved in the importation and breeding of Arabians in Spain well into the early 20th century , and the <unk> Militar is still in existence today . 
 This period also marked a phase of considerable travel to the Middle East by European civilians and minor nobility , and in the process , some travelers noticed that the Arabian horse as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare , inbreeding and other problems that were reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate . By the late 19th century , the most farsighted began in earnest to collect the finest Arabian horses they could find in order to preserve the blood of the pure desert horse for future generations . The most famous example was Lady Anne Blunt , the daughter of Ada Lovelace and granddaughter of Lord Byron . 
 = = = Rise of the Crabbet Park Stud = = = 
 Perhaps the most famous of all Arabian breeding operations founded in Europe was the Crabbet Park Stud of England , founded 1878 . Starting in 1877 , Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt made repeated journeys to the Middle East , including visits to the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif in Egypt and to Bedouin tribes in the Nejd , bringing the best Arabians they could find to England . Lady Anne also purchased and maintained the Sheykh <unk> stud farm in Egypt , near Cairo . Upon Lady Anne 's death in 1917 , the Blunts ' daughter , Judith , Lady Wentworth , inherited the Wentworth title and Lady Anne 's portion of the estate , and obtained the remainder of the Crabbet Stud following a protracted legal battle with her father . Lady Wentworth expanded the stud , added new bloodstock , and exported Arabian horses worldwide . Upon her death in 1957 , the stud passed to her manager , Cecil Covey , who ran Crabbet until 1971 , when a motorway was cut through the property , forcing the sale of the land and dispersal of the horses . Along with Crabbet , the Hanstead Stud of Lady Yule also produced horses of worldwide significance .

 In the early 20th century , the military was involved in the breeding of Arabian horses throughout Europe , particularly in Poland , Spain , Germany , and Russia ; private breeders also developed a number of breeding programs . Significant among the private breeders in continental Europe was Spain 's Cristóbal Colón de Aguilera , XV Duque de Veragua , a direct descendant of Christopher Columbus , who founded the Veragua Stud in the 1920s . 
 = = = Modern warfare and its impact on European studs = = = 
 Between World War I , the Russian Revolution , and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire , many historic European stud farms were lost ; in Poland , the <unk> and <unk> Studs were wiped out except for five mares . Notable among the survivors was the Janów Podlaski Stud . The Russian Revolution , combined with the effects of World War I , destroyed most of the breeding programs in Russia , but by 1921 , the Soviet government reestablished an Arabian program , the Tersk Stud , on the site of the former Stroganov estate , which included Polish bloodstock as well as some importations from the Crabbet Stud in England . The programs that survived the war re @-@ established their breeding operations and some added to their studs with new imports of desert @-@ bred Arabian horses from the Middle East . Not all European studs recovered . The Weil stud of Germany , founded by King Wilhelm I , went into considerable decline ; by the time the Weil herd was transferred to the Marbach State Stud in 1932 , only 17 purebred Arabians remained . 
 The Spanish Civil War and World War II also had a devastating impact on horse breeding throughout Europe . The Veragua stud was destroyed , and its records lost , with the only survivors being the broodmares and the younger horses , who were rescued by Francisco Franco . Crabbet Park , Tersk , and Janów Podlaski survived . Both the Soviet Union and the United States obtained valuable Arabian bloodlines as spoils of war , which they used to strengthen their breeding programs . The Soviets had taken steps to protect their breeding stock at Tersk Stud , and by utilizing horses captured in Poland they were able to re @-@ establish their breeding program soon after the end of World War II . The Americans brought Arabian horses captured in Europe to the United States , mostly to the Pomona U.S. Army Remount station , the former W.K. Kellogg Ranch in California . 
 In the postwar era , Poland , Spain , and Germany developed or re @-@ established many well @-@ respected Arabian stud farms . The studs of Poland in particular were decimated by both the Nazis and the Soviets , but were able to reclaim some of their breeding stock and became particularly world @-@ renowned for their quality Arabian horses , tested rigorously by racing and other performance standards . During the 1950s , the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs . 
 = = = After the Cold War = = = 
 While only a few Arabians were exported from behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War , those who did come to the west caught the eye of breeders worldwide . Improved international relations between eastern Europe and the west led to major imports of Polish and Russian @-@ bred Arabian horses to western Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s . The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991 , greater political stability in Egypt , and the rise of the European Union all increased international trade in Arabian horses . Organizations such as the World Arabian Horse Association ( WAHO ) created consistent standards for transferring the registration of Arabian horses between different nations . Today , Arabian horses are traded all over the world .

 The first horses on the American mainland since the end of the Ice Age arrived with the Spanish Conquistadors . Hernán Cortés brought 16 horses of Andalusian , Barb , and Arabian ancestry to Mexico in 1519 . Others followed , such as Francisco Vásquez de Coronado , who brought 250 horses of similar breeding to America in 1540 . More horses followed with each new arrival of Conquistadors , missionaries , and settlers . Many horses escaped or were stolen , becoming the foundation stock of the American Mustang .

 Colonists from England also brought horses of Arabian breeding to the eastern seaboard . One example was Nathaniel Harrison , who imported a horse of Arabian , Barb and Turkish ancestry to America in 1747 .

Other Presidents are linked to ownership of Arabian horses ; in 1840 , President Martin Van Buren received two Arabians from the Sultan of Oman , and in 1877 , President Ulysses S. Grant obtained an Arabian stallion , Leopard , and a Barb , Linden Tree , as gifts from Abdul Hamid II , the " Sultan of Turkey . " 
 A. Keene Richard was the first American known to have specifically bred Arabian horses . He traveled to the desert in 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock , which he crossed on Thoroughbreds , and also bred purebred Arabians . Unfortunately , his horses were lost during the Civil War and have no known purebred Arabian descendants today . Another major U.S. political figure , William H. Seward purchased four Arabians in Beirut in 1859 , prior to becoming Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln . 
 Leopard is the only stallion imported prior to 1888 who left known purebred descendants in America . In 1888 Randolph Huntington imported the desert @-@ bred Arabian mare * Naomi , and bred her to Leopard , producing Leopard 's only purebred Arabian son , Anazeh , who sired eight purebred Arabian foals , four of whom still appear in pedigrees today .

 In 1908 , the Arabian Horse Registry of America was established , recording 71 animals , and by 1994 , the number had reached half a million . Today there are more Arabians registered in North America than in the rest of the world put together . 
 The origins of the registry date to 1893 , when the Hamidie Society sponsored an exhibit of Arabian horses from what today is Syria at the World Fair in Chicago . This exhibition raised considerable interest in Arabian horses . Records are unclear if 40 or 45 horses were imported for the exposition , but seven died in a fire shortly after arrival . The 28 horses that remained at the end of the exhibition stayed in America and were sold at auction when the Hamidie Society went bankrupt . These horses caught the interest of American breeders , including Peter Bradley of the Hingham Stock Farm , who purchased some Hamidie horses at the auction , and Homer Davenport , another admirer of the Hamidie imports . 
 Major Arabian importations to the United States included those of Davenport and Bradley , who teamed up to purchase several stallions and mares directly from the Bedouin in 1906 . Spencer Borden of the Interlachen Stud made several importations between 1898 and 1911 ; and W.R. Brown of the Maynesboro Stud , interested in the Arabian as a cavalry mount , imported many Arabians over a period of years , starting in 1918 . Another wave of imports came in the 1920s and 30s when breeders such as W.K. Kellogg , Henry Babson , Roger Selby , James Draper , and others imported Arabian bloodstock from Crabbet Park Stud in England , as well as from Poland , Spain and Egypt . The breeding of Arabians was fostered by the U. S. Army Remount Service , which stood purebred stallions at public stud for a reduced rate . 
 Several Arabians , mostly of Polish breeding , were captured from Nazi Germany and imported to the U.S.A. following World War II . In 1957 , two deaths in England led to more sales to the United States : first from Crabbet Stud on the demise of Lady Wentworth , and then from Hanstead with the passing of Gladys Yule . As the tensions of the Cold War eased , more Arabians were imported to America from Poland and Egypt , and in the late 1970s , as political issues surrounding import regulations and the recognition of stud books were resolved , many Arabian horses were imported from Spain and Russia .

 In the 1980s , Arabians became a popular status symbol and were marketed similarly to fine art . Some individuals also used horses as a tax shelter . Prices skyrocketed , especially in the United States , with a record @-@ setting public auction price for a mare named NH Love Potion , who sold for $ 2 @.@ 55 million in 1984 , and the largest syndication in history for an Arabian stallion , Padron , at $ 11 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . The potential for profit led to over @-@ breeding of the Arabian . When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 closed the tax @-@ sheltering " passive investment " loophole , limiting the use of horse farms as tax shelters , the Arabian market was particularly vulnerable due to over @-@ saturation and artificially inflated prices , and it collapsed , forcing many breeders into bankruptcy and sending many purebred Arabians to slaughter . Prices recovered slowly , with many breeders moving away from producing " living art " and towards a horse more suitable for amateur owners and many riding disciplines . By 2003 , a survey found that 67 % of purebred Arabian horses in America are owned for recreational riding purposes . As of 2013 , there are more than 660 @,@ 000 Arabians that have been registered in the United States , and the US has the largest number of Arabians of any nation in the world .

 = = = Early imports = = = 
 Arabian horses were introduced to Australia in the earliest days of European Settlement . Early imports included both purebred Arabians and light Spanish " <unk> " from Andalusia , many Arabians also came from India . Based on records describing stallions " of Arabic and Persian blood " , the first Arabian horses were probably imported to Australia in several groups between 1788 and 1802 . About 1803 , a merchant named Robert Campbell imported a bay Arabian stallion , Hector , from India ; Hector was said to have been owned by Arthur Wellesley , who later became known as the Duke of Wellington . In 1804 two additional Arabians , also from India , arrived in Tasmania one of whom , White William , sired the first purebred Arabian foal born in Australia , a stallion named Derwent . 
 Throughout the 19th century , many more Arabians came to Australia , though most were used to produce crossbred horses and left no recorded purebred descendants . The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James <unk> , who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt 's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England . Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses and some of them became quite famous as such ; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book ( for Thoroughbred racehorses ) . The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding <unk> horses , especially around World War I. They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian , including the Australian Pony , the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse . 
 = = = In the 20th and 21st centuries = = = 
 In the early 20th century , more Arabian horses , mostly of Crabbet bloodlines , arrived in Australia . The first Arabians of Polish breeding arrived in 1966 , and Egyptian lines were first imported in 1970 . Arabian horses from the rest of the world followed , and today the Australian Arabian horse registry is the second largest in the world , next to that of the United States . 
 = = Modern breeding = = 
 Arabian horses today are found all over the world . They are no longer classified by Bedouin strain , but are informally classified by the nation of origin of famed horses in a given pedigree . Popular types of Arabians are labeled " Polish " , " Spanish " , " Crabbet " , " Russian " , " Egyptian " , and " Domestic " ( describing horses whose ancestors were imported to the United States prior to 1944 , including those from programs such as Kellogg , Davenport , Maynesboro , Babson , Dickenson and Selby ) . In the USA , a specific mixture of Crabbet , Maynesboro and Kellogg bloodlines has acquired the copyrighted designation " CMK . " 
 Each set of bloodlines has its own devoted followers , with the virtues of each hotly debated . Most debates are between those who value the Arabian most for its refined beauty and those who value the horse for its stamina and athleticism ; there are also a number of breeders who specialize in preservation breeding of various bloodlines . Controversies exist over the relative " purity " of certain animals ; breeders argue about the genetic " purity " of various pedigrees , discussing whether some horses descend from " impure " animals that cannot be traced to the desert Bedouin . The major factions are as follows : 
 The Arabian Horse Association ( AHA ) states , " The origin of the purebred Arabian horse was the Arabian desert , and all Arabians ultimately trace their lineage to this source . " In essence , all horses accepted for registration in the United States are deemed to be " purebred " Arabians by AHA . 
 The World Arabian Horse Association ( WAHO ) has the broadest definition of a purebred Arabian . WAHO states , " A Purebred Arabian horse is one which appears in any purebred Arabian Stud Book or Register listed by WAHO as acceptable . " By this definition , over 95 % of the known purebred Arabian horses in the world are registered in stud books acceptable to WAHO . WAHO also researched the purity question in general , and its findings are on its web site , describing both the research and the political issues surrounding Arabian horse bloodlines , particularly in America . 
 At the other end of the spectrum , organizations focused on bloodlines that are the most meticulously documented to desert sources have the most restrictive definitions . For example , The Asil Club in Europe only accepts " a horse whose pedigree is exclusively based on Bedouin breeding of the Arabian peninsula , without any crossbreeding with non @-@ Arabian horses at any time . " Likewise , the Al Khamsa organization takes the position that " The horse ... which are called " Al Khamsa Arabian Horses , " are those horses in North America that can reasonably be assumed to descend entirely from bedouin Arabian horses bred by horse @-@ breeding bedouin tribes of the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula without admixture from sources unacceptable to Al Khamsa . " Most restrictive of all are horses identified as " straight Egyptian " by the Pyramid Society , which must trace in all lines to the desert and also to horses owned or bred by specific Egyptian breeding programs . By this definition , straight Egyptian Arabians constitute only 2 % of all Arabian horses in America . 
 Ironically , some pure @-@ blooded desert @-@ bred Arabians in Syria had enormous difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians because many of the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of their horses . However , eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association ( WAHO ) in 2007 . 
 = = Influence on other horse breeds = = 
 Because of the genetic strength of the desert @-@ bred Arabian horse , Arabian bloodlines have played a part in the development of nearly every modern light horse breed , including the Thoroughbred , Orlov Trotter , Morgan , American Saddlebred , American Quarter Horse , and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner . Arabian bloodlines have also influenced the development of the Welsh Pony , the Australian Stock Horse , Percheron draft horse , Appaloosa , and the Colorado Ranger Horse . 
 Today , people cross Arabians with other breeds to add refinement , endurance , agility and beauty . In the USA , Half @-@ Arabians have their own registry within the Arabian Horse Association , which includes a special section for Anglo @-@ Arabians ( Arabian @-@ Thoroughbred crosses ) . Some crosses originally registered only as Half @-@ Arabians became popular enough to have their own breed registry , including the National Show Horse ( an Arabian @-@ Saddlebred cross ) , the <unk> ( Arabian @-@ Quarter Horse ) , the <unk> the Welara ( Arabian @-@ Welsh Pony ) , and the <unk> ( Arabian @-@ Morgan ) . In addition , some Arabians and Half Arabians have been approved for breeding by some Warmblood registries , particularly the Trakehner registry . 
 There is intense debate over the role the Arabian played in the development of other light horse breeds . Before DNA @-@ based research developed , one hypothesis , based on body types and conformation , suggested the light , " dry " , oriental horse adapted to the desert climate had developed prior to domestication ; DNA studies of multiple horse breeds now suggest that while domesticated horses arose from multiple mare lines , there is very little variability in the Y @-@ chromosome between breeds . Following domestication of the horse , due to the location of the Middle East as a crossroads of the ancient world , and relatively near the earliest locations of domestication , oriental horses spread throughout Europe and Asia both in ancient and modern times . There is little doubt that humans crossed " oriental " blood on that of other types to create light riding horses ; the only actual questions are at what point the " oriental " prototype could be called an " Arabian " , how much Arabian blood was mixed with local animals , and at what point in history . 
 For some breeds , such as the Thoroughbred , Arabian influence of specific animals is documented in written stud books . For older breeds , dating the influx of Arabian ancestry is more difficult . For example , while outside cultures , and the horses they brought with them , influenced the predecessor to the Iberian horse in both the time of Ancient Rome and again with the Islamic invasions of the 8th century , it is difficult to trace precise details of the journeys taken by waves of conquerors and their horses as they traveled from the Middle East to North Africa and across Gibraltar to southern Europe . Mitochondrial DNA studies of modern Andalusian horses of the Iberian peninsula and Barb horses of North Africa present convincing evidence that both breeds crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and influenced one another . Though these studies did not compare Andalusian and Barb mtDNA to that of Arabian horses , there is evidence that horses resembling Arabians , whether before or after the breed was called an " Arabian " , were part of this genetic mix . Arabians and Barbs , though probably related to one another , are quite different in appearance , and horses of both Arabian and Barb type were present in the Muslim armies that occupied Europe . There is also historical documentation that Islamic invaders raised Arabian horses in Spain prior to the Reconquista ; the Spanish also documented imports of Arabian horses in 1847 , 1884 and 1885 that were used to improve existing Spanish stock and revive declining equine populations . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Arabians are versatile horses that compete in many equestrian fields , including horse racing , the horse show disciplines of saddle seat , Western pleasure , and hunt seat , as well as dressage , cutting , reining , endurance riding , show jumping , eventing , youth events such as <unk> , and others . They are used as pleasure riding , trail riding , and working ranch horses for those who are not interested in competition . 
 = = = Competition = = = 
 Arabians dominate the sport of endurance riding because of their stamina . They are the leading breed in competitions such as the Tevis Cup that can cover up to 100 miles ( 160 km ) in a day , and they participate in FEI @-@ sanctioned endurance events worldwide , including the World Equestrian Games . 
 There is an extensive series of horse shows in the United States and Canada for Arabian , Half @-@ Arabian , and Anglo @-@ Arabian horses , sanctioned by the USEF in conjunction with the Arabian Horse Association . Classes offered include Western pleasure , reining , hunter type and saddle seat English pleasure , and halter , plus the very popular " Native " costume class . " Sport horse " events for Arabian horses have become popular in North America , particularly after the Arabian Horse Association began hosting a separate Arabian and Half Arabian Sport Horse National Championship in 2003 that by 2004 grew to draw 2000 entries . This competition draws Arabian and part @-@ Arabian horses that perform in hunter , jumper , sport horse under saddle , sport horse in hand , dressage , and combined driving competition . 
 Other nations also sponsor major shows strictly for purebred and partbred Arabians , including Great Britain France , Spain , Poland , and the United Arab Emirates . 
 Purebred Arabians have excelled in open events against other breeds . One of the most famous examples in the field of western riding competition was the Arabian mare Ronteza , who defeated 50 horses of all breeds to win the 1961 <unk> Cow Horse championship at the Cow Palace in San Francisco , California . Another Arabian competitive against all breeds was the stallion <unk> who won an all @-@ breed cutting horse competition at the Quarter Horse Congress in the 1950s . In show jumping and show hunter competition , a number of Arabians have competed successfully against other breeds in open competition , including the purebred gelding Russian Roulette , who has won multiple jumping classes against horses of all breeds on the open circuit , and in eventing , a purebred Arabian competed on the Brazilian team at the 2004 Athens Olympics . 
 Part @-@ Arabians have also appeared at open sport horse events and even Olympic level competition . The Anglo @-@ Arabian <unk> was ridden to an Olympic silver medal for France in Dressage in 1928 and 1932 , as well as a team gold in 1932 , and another French Anglo @-@ Arabian , <unk> , was ridden to a team gold medal and an individual silver in dressage at the 1948 Olympics . At the 1952 Olympics , the French rider Pierre d <unk> won the Gold individual medal in show jumping on the Anglo @-@ Arabian Ali Baba . Another Anglo @-@ Arabian , <unk> , ridden by William Fox @-@ Pitt , represents the United Kingdom in FEI and Olympic competition , winning many awards , including first place at the 2004 Badminton Horse Trials . More recently a gelding named Theodore O 'Connor , nicknamed " Teddy " , a 14 @.@ 1 ( or 14 @.@ 2 , sources vary ) hand pony of Thoroughbred , Arabian , and Shetland pony breeding , won two gold medals at the 2007 Pan American Games and was finished in the top six at the 2007 and 2008 Rolex Kentucky Three Day <unk> competition . 
 = = = Other activities = = = 
 Arabians are involved in a wide variety of activities , including fairs , movies , parades , circuses and other places where horses are showcased . They have been popular in movies , dating back to the silent film era when Rudolph Valentino rode the Kellogg Arabian stallion <unk> in 1926 's Son of the Sheik , and have been seen in many other films , including The Black Stallion featuring the stallion Cass Ole , The Young Black Stallion , which used over 40 Arabians during filming , as well as Hidalgo and the 1959 version of Ben @-@ Hur . 
 Arabians are mascots for football teams , performing crowd @-@ pleasing activities on the field and sidelines . One of the horses who serves as " Traveler " , the mascot for the University of Southern California Trojans , has been a purebred Arabian . " Thunder " , a stage name for the purebred Arabian stallion J B Kobask , was mascot for the Denver Broncos from 1993 until his retirement in 2004 , when the Arabian gelding Winter Solstyce took over as " Thunder II " . Cal Poly Pomona 's W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center Equestrian Unit has made Arabian horses a regular sight at the annual Tournament of Roses Parade held each New Year 's Day in Pasadena , California . 
 Arabians also are used on search and rescue teams and occasionally for police work . Some Arabians are used in polo in the USA and Europe , in the Turkish equestrian sport of <unk> ( pronounced [ <unk> ] ) , as well as in circuses , therapeutic horseback riding programs , and on guest ranches .

 " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " marked the first collaboration between rapper Jay @-@ Z and R & B singer Beyoncé . While listening to Shakur 's The Don Killuminati : The 7 Day Theory , producer Kanye West suggested that American rapper Tupac Shakur 's song " Me and My Girlfriend " would make a good sample to use on Jay @-@ Z 's duet with Beyoncé . West told MTV News that Jay @-@ Z had asked him on the telephone for a duet for him and Beyoncé : " We got this joint , it has to be the best beat you ever made . " He continued :

I brought it to Hov that night , he heard it , he thought of the video treatment before he thought of the rap . He just knew it was gonna be the one . 
 Tensions arose during the conception of " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " over the sampling of " Me and My Girlfriend . Senior Vice President of A & R Tina Davis commented on the issue , " We only had one day to clear the [ Tupac Shakur ] sample [ from ' Me and my Girlfriend ' ] that was used on ' <unk> Bonnie and Clyde ' last year with Jay @-@ Z and Beyoncé [ Beyoncé ] . We were back and forth with Afeni Shakur all day until we got the clearance . And then it 's a hit . " 
 " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " was released on October 10 , 2002 , as the lead single from Jay @-@ Z 's album The Blueprint ² : The Gift & the Curse .

 On October 8 , 2003 , Toni Braxton and her team released a statement claiming that Jay @-@ Z 's song " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " had stolen Braxton 's idea to sample the 1996 Tupac Shakur song " Me and My Girlfriend " . Braxton sampled Shakur 's song on the track " Me & My Boyfriend " , included on Braxton 's album , More Than a Woman ( 2002 ) . In a call to a New York radio station , Braxton stated that " Jay @-@ Z and Beyoncé are messing with my money . They 're trying to steal my mojo " . Braxton said her song was recorded over the summer of 2002 , and alleged that Jay @-@ Z only decided to do " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " after she played her version of the song for Def Jam Recordings .

Roc @-@ A @-@ Fella Records ' Co @-@ CEO responded to Braxton 's claims : 
 Jay is a talented dude . I don 't think he would steal anything intentionally . It 's an ill coincidence , and things happen for a reason . We 'll see what happens behind it ... I read it in the paper , and Jay and I were talking about it this morning and it was a little funny . I know he didn 't intentionally make the same record she made . I don 't think he even heard it . [ My ] reaction is , ' Sorry , it wasn 't intentional . ' Jay makes records and puts them out . This [ sh-- ] is music . It 's just music . We don 't sit around and have a blueprint to [ f--- ] anybody 's life up . The music business has been good to us . I 'm not getting into any beef or nothing over music . 
 Speaking for MTV News , Jay @-@ Z responded to Braxton 's claims : " I wouldn 't want to take it from her . I don 't even think like that . My first thought would be , ' Maybe I could call her up , maybe I could get on that record . ' The most obvious [ explanation ] is it 's neither one of our records . It 's not like you made an original idea . She 's not in hip @-@ hop , but it happens in hip @-@ hop often . We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first . I 'm sorry . What can I do ? " He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song , he would have arranged a duet with her .

 = Tony King ( EastEnders ) = 
 Tony King is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders , played by Chris Coghill . He was the partner of established character Bianca Jackson ( Patsy Palmer ) , and a father @-@ figure to her four children . Tony sexually abused Bianca 's stepdaughter , Whitney Dean ( Shona McGarty ) , and began grooming her school @-@ friend Lauren Branning ( Madeline Duggan ) , before his predatory nature was uncovered and he was arrested for his crimes . Tony appeared between 12 September and 12 December 2008 and returned in December 2009 to stand trial . 
 The child sexual abuse storyline marked the first time the subject matter had been broached in a UK soap opera , and was researched and developed with advice and approval from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children . The abusive nature of Tony and Whitney 's relationship resulted in over 200 complaints being made to the BBC and television regulatory body Ofcom by members of the public , with the storyline deemed " horrifying " by the Daily Mail 's Lizzie Smith , and " one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted " by The Mirror 's Beth Neil . The NSPCC however praised the storyline for " helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of sexual abuse " . The storyline also gained EastEnders a Royal Television Society Programme Award in March 2009 in the Soap and Continuing Drama category .

 After being released from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned Whitney Dean ( Shona McGarty ) , Tony joins his partner Bianca Butcher ( Patsy Palmer ) and her family in Walford , including her son Morgan Jackson @-@ King , whom he has adopted .

He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney , despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance , insisting she remove her make @-@ up and jewellery . When Whitney gets a role in the school play , Romeo and Julie , Tony is angry about having less time with her , becoming jealous of her co @-@ star Peter Beale ( Thomas Law ) . Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen . Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return , which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat . Tony assaults Peter as a result of his growing jealousy , and is nearly reported to the police by Peter 's sister Lucy Beale ( Melissa Suffield ) . Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police , but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened . When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore , he realizes he is no longer attracted to her . 
 Tony begins grooming fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Lauren Branning , supporting her when her mother Tanya Branning ( Jo Joyner ) is arrested for the attempted murder of her father . He plans to take her to a concert , but Lauren 's father Max Branning ( Jake Wood ) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend . When Whitney 's sixteenth birthday arrives , she books flights so they can run away together . Attempting to foil her plan , Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned . On her birthday , Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony , believing that they are going to leave together . Horrified , Bianca calls the police , and Tony is arrested . He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police .

 Tony was first mentioned in EastEnders in April 2008 , when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine @-@ year absence from the show . It was established that although Tony was currently in prison , he and Bianca were in a relationship , and that he acted as a father @-@ figure to her children Whitney Dean , Liam Butcher ( James Forde ) and Tiffany Dean ( Maisie Smith ) . It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca 's youngest son , mixed @-@ race Morgan Jackson @-@ King ( Devon Higgs ) , which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill , who is white , had been cast in the role . The show 's producers explained that Tony was not really Morgan 's father , and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival . 
 Although Tony did not appear in the show until September 2008 , his arrival was anticipated from April of that year , when EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer commented that the series was building a picture of his character , and that it would be interesting to see him on @-@ screen . It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a child sexual abuse storyline involving Whitney . BBC News described the plot as an ongoing " predatory paedophile storyline " , noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera . 
 An EastEnders spokesperson stated that programme @-@ makers were working in close conjunction with the NSPCC in order to portray the subject matter accurately and sensitively , commenting that the show aims to raise awareness of real @-@ life issues , and has in the past similarly drawn attention to issues such as domestic violence , rape and HIV . John Grounds , the NSPCC 's director of communications , praised the soap for raising awareness of the issue . Sara Nathan of The Sun reported that the story had been planned since the previous year , and would begin with Whitney worrying about Tony 's release from prison and the effect it would have on her family . 
 The storyline was first conceived when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed a documentary about homelessness , featuring a mother and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go . Ashdown questioned what might happen if a child sex offender were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child , and related the scenario to Bianca 's return to the soap . BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented " drew a sharp intake of breath . Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath , so they 're always the kind of stories you look for . " Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction Jane Tranter on 2 June 2008 . Tranter explained that : " I thought it was a fantastically good idea . The big moments in EastEnders , those iconic pieces of television history , tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle , and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise in the context of a family sitting room . [ ... ] Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives , and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits , difficult bits , taboo bits . But if a soap doesn 't hold up that mirror , then actually , what is it ? It will have no depth . "

 Coghill was cast as Tony on 20 June 2008 . He deemed the role the most challenging he had ever played , but hoped that it would help to raise public awareness of child abuse . Of his off @-@ screen relationship with McGarty , Coghill explained that it helped that she does not look or act like a young child , deeming her " fantastic to work with " , as well as " very natural , very instinctive and a natural actress " , commenting : " There isn 't any uncomfortable feeling at all . " Having undergone a thorough characterisation session , Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008 , and first appeared on @-@ screen on 12 September 2008 . 
 Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney as soon as he met Bianca , ingratiating himself so as to become the family 's " hero figure " and " saviour " . Coghill elucidated : " The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she 's 16 they 'll run away together and start a new life . But Tony 's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children . Whitney is beginning to pass her sell @-@ by date with him . [ ... ] He feels like he 's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out . " As Tony began to lose interest in Whitney , he started grooming her 14 @-@ year @-@ old school @-@ friend Lauren Branning . A show @-@ insider commented that Tony had been getting away with abusing Whitney for years , but was escalating as one young girl was no longer enough to satisfy him . 
 Tony left the soap on 12 December 2008 , after his true nature was exposed . It was announced on 7 September 2009 that he would return to EastEnders to be put on trial . Coghill was pleased to return , believing it right that Tony 's story arc should conclude realistically , giving closure to the storyline and continuing to raise awareness of the issue . Santer commented : " One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years . Chris agreeing to come back for these episodes will enable us to continue showing the long @-@ term consequences of Tony 's abuse of Whitney and – I hope – continue to do justice to the issue of child sex abuse . " Grounds praised Tony 's trial , stating that it demonstrated the importance for children of having their abusers brought to justice . Palmer felt that : " If one person out there who 's been abused saw that [ the legal system ] go out of their way to make it easier on the victim – Whitney 's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it . "

 The BBC and television regulatory body Ofcom received 70 complaints after Whitney 's first scenes with Tony aired . A BBC spokesman responded : " This is a difficult and challenging storyline , but one which keeps with the tradition of the show for tackling difficult social issues such as domestic abuse and mental health in the past . All the content on screen adheres to the BBC 's editorial guidelines . " The Guardian 's Aida <unk> said of the beginning of the storyline : " what is most disturbing , watching [ Tony and Whitney 's ] first scenes together , is not the sexuality of the situation per se , though that is uncomfortable - it 's the subtle blackmail with which he keeps her in line . As it 's combined with the emotional manipulation native to soaps , the viewer starts to feel a bit bullied , too " . Numbers of viewer complaints rose within days to over 200 . New Statesman journalist Jeremy Sare commented on the public outrage and defended EastEnders decision to air the storyline , writing : 
 Sare quoted a BBC spokeswoman as saying : " we appreciate that for some viewers this storyline will have particular resonance and significance . In running it , it 's certainly not our intention to cause distress or upset , either to those who 've suffered from sexual abuse or their families . Our aim is instead to raise awareness of this very sensitive issue " , concluding his article with the summation : " The producers ’ dilemma is instructive to children ’ s charities and Ministers alike on how to confront the issue in a digestible manner which can stimulate an objective debate . " 
 The Mirror 's Beth Neil branded the plot strand " one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted " , with critic Jim Shelley deeming it to be a " new low " for EastEnders . Shelley wrote of Whitney 's abuse : " You 've really got to hand it to EastEnders . Just when you thought the show couldn 't get any more miserable , the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline . Thanks for that ! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week : gathering the telly to watch a grubby , <unk> thug drooling over a 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl who ( as luck would have it ) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she 's not at school . And they say family entertainment 's dead . " Shelley refuted the BBC 's claims that the storyline had educational value as " totally bogus " , observing that " At 7 @.@ 30 or 8pm , the " action " has to be so coded as to be pointless " . Deborah Orr , writing for The Independent , similarly disagreed with the BBC 's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders ' " rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues " , writing that : 
 The Daily Mail 's Lizzie Smith deemed the storyline " horrifying " , while The Guardian 's Julie Raeside has questioned : " Is this latest sexual abuse storyline a good thing to position in a pre @-@ watershed soap opera , or should the EastEnders storyliners stick to a less controversial brand of misery ? " However , in contrast to public and media dissent , the NSPCC 's director of communications , John Grounds , has praised the storyline for " helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of sexual abuse " , deeming it to be " vital in persuading people to take action to stop it and encouraging children to speak out . " Episodes from the storyline were submitted to the Royal Television Society Programme Awards 2008 for a panel to judge in the category Soap and Continuing Drama . EastEnders was presented with the award in March 2009 , beating Coronation Street and The Bill . Members of the judging panel described the submitted episodes as " the culmination of a particularly challenging and controversial storyline which the production team , writers and cast pulled off triumphantly . " In addition , the storyline was nominated for Best Storyline at the 2009 Inside Soap Awards and the character was nominated for the Villain of the Year award at the 2009 British Soap Awards .

 = Boniface of Savoy ( bishop ) = 
 Boniface of Savoy ( c . 1217 – 18 July 1270 ) was a medieval Bishop of <unk> in France and Archbishop of Canterbury in England . He was the son of Thomas , Count of Savoy , and owed his initial ecclesiastical posts to his father . Other members of his family were also clergymen , and a brother succeeded his father as count . One niece was married to King Henry III of England and another was married to King Louis IX of France . It was Henry who secured Boniface 's election as Archbishop , and throughout his tenure of that office he spent much time on the continent . He clashed with his bishops , with his nephew @-@ by @-@ marriage , and with the papacy , but managed to eliminate the archiepiscopal debt which he had inherited on taking office . During Simon de Montfort 's struggle with King Henry , Boniface initially helped Montfort 's cause , but later supported the king . After his death in Savoy , his tomb became the object of a cult , and he was eventually beatified in 1839 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Boniface and his elder brother Amadeus IV , Count of Savoy , were sons of Thomas I , Count of Savoy , and Margaret of Geneva . He is thus not to be confused with his nephew , and fellow member of the House of Savoy , Count Boniface of Savoy , the son of Amadeus IV . The elder Boniface was born about 1207 in Savoy . He was the eleventh child of his parents . Some sources state that at a young age he joined the Carthusian Order . However , there is no evidence of this , and it would have been very unusual for a nobleman to enter that order with its very strict discipline . He also had a brother Peter of Savoy who was named Earl of Richmond in 1240 and yet another brother William of Savoy , who was Bishop of Valence and a candidate to be Bishop of Winchester in England . 
 = = Ecclesiastical career = = 
 Boniface was the Prior of <unk> in 1232 along with the bishopric of <unk> in Burgundy . When his father died , he received the castle of Ugine as his inheritance , and he surrendered any entitlement to any other inheritance in 1238 . After the marriage of his niece , Eleanor of Provence to King Henry III of England , Henry attempted to have Boniface elected Bishop of Winchester , but was unable to get the cathedral chapter to elect Boniface . On 1 February 1241 he was nominated to the see of Canterbury . Pope Innocent IV confirmed the appointment on 16 September 1243 , as an attempt to placate Henry . Boniface did not , however , come to England until 1244 and was present , in the following year 1245 , at the First Council of Lyon . There , he was consecrated by Innocent IV on 15 January at Lyons , but it was only in 1249 that he returned to England and was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 1 November 1249 . Before he returned in 1249 , he helped arrange the marriage another of his nieces , Beatrice of Provence , the sister of Queen Eleanor , to Charles of Anjou , the brother of King Louis IX of France . 
 The medieval chronicler Matthew Paris said that Boniface was " noted more for his birth than for his brains . " He showed little concern for the spiritual duties of his office . His exactions and his overbearing behaviour , combined with the fact that he was a foreigner , offended the English . He was heavily involved in advancing the fortunes of his family on the continent , and spent fourteen of the twenty @-@ nine years he was archbishop outside England . He made strenuous efforts to free his office from debt , as he had inherited a see that was in debt over 22 @,@ 000 marks , but managed to clear the debt before his death . He did this by securing the right to tax his clergy , for seven years , from the papacy . When a number of bishops refused to pay , they were suspended from office . He also worked for the canonisation of Edmund Rich while he was at the papal court @-@ in @-@ exile at Lyon from 1244 to 1249 . 
 In 1244 , Boniface rejected Robert Passelewe , who had been selected as Bishop of Chichester , on the grounds that Passelewe was illiterate . Boniface then nominated his own candidate , Richard of Chichester , and although the king objected , Pope Innocent IV confirmed Richard 's election . In 1258 , Boniface objected to the selection of Hugh de <unk> as Bishop of Ely , and tried to elevate Adam Marsh instead , but Hugh appealed to Rome , which upheld Hugh 's election . Boniface held church councils to reform the clergy , in 1257 at London , in 1258 at Merton , and in 1261 at Lambeth . 
 During his archiepiscopate , a provincial court was established in the archdiocese of Canterbury , with a presiding <unk> appointed by Boniface . 
 = = Controversies = = 
 Boniface was energetic in defending the liberties of his see , and clashed with King Henry over the election of Henry 's clerk Robert Passelewe to the see of Chichester . Robert Grosseteste , the Bishop of Lincoln , had examined Passelewe , and found him unfit for episcopal office , and Boniface then quashed the election in 1244 . He was also involved in disputes with the king 's half @-@ brothers , especially Aymer de Valence , who was Bishop of Winchester . He also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops , who resented his attempts to supervise their affairs closely . In 1250 Boniface attempted a visitation of his province , and this disturbed his suffragan bishops , who protested that Boniface was taking exorbitant amounts of money during his visits . They appealed to the pope , who reaffirmed the right of Boniface to conduct his visitation , but set a limit on the amount that could be taken from any monastery or church . After the visitation , Boniface left England again , and only returned in 1252 , after the pope had decided the bishops ' appeal in Boniface 's favour . After his return , he continued to assert his rights and settled a number of disputes with his bishops . He secured professions of obedience from all but three of the 37 bishops consecrated during his time as archbishop . He also set up a court at Canterbury that heard appeals from the ecclesiastical courts of his suffragan bishops . 
 Boniface clashed with Henry 's half @-@ brothers , the Lusignans , who arrived in England in 1247 and competed for lands and promotions with the queens ' Savoy relatives . Boniface 's quarrel with Aymer de Valence over the a hospital in Southwark led to the archbishop 's palace at Lambeth being plundered and one of Boniface 's functionaries being kidnapped . The dispute with Aymer was only settled in early 1253 . Boniface was once more absent from England from October 1254 to November 1256 , and spent most of that time in Savoy where he attempted to help his brothers rescue their eldest brother Thomas who was being held captive at Turin . 
 In 1258 and 1259 , Boniface was a member of the Council of Fifteen , which conducted business for Henry III under the Provisions of Oxford . This Council consisted of the earls of Leicester , Gloucester , Norfolk , Warwick , Hereford , the Count of Aumale , Peter of Savoy , John <unk> , Peter de Montfort , Richard Grey , Roger Mortimer , James Audley , John Maunsell , Walter de Cantilupe , Bishop of Worcester as well as Boniface . One of the actions of this council was to send the Lusignans into exile . In April 1260 , Boniface worked with Richard of Cornwall to broker a peace between King Henry and Prince Edward . 
 He accompanied the queen and Prince Edward to Burgos for the marriage of Edward to Eleanor of Castile and Edward 's knighting . But in 1261 Boniface held a church council at Lambeth , where a series of ecclesiastical laws were published which denounced any royal limitations on ecclesiastical courts . These decrees were done without royal consent and thus was tantamount to an ecclesiastical revolt against royal authority similar to the baronial opposition movement that had begun in 1258 . 
 During the Second Barons ' War , Boniface seems to have sided first with the English bishops against King Henry , but later he sided with Henry . In 1262 , he went to France , where he excommunicated the barons opposing the king . He was not summoned to the Parliament at London in January 1265 because he was abroad . On the triumph of the king 's party in 1265 , he returned to England , arriving there in May 1266 . 
 = = Death and aftermath = = 
 The Early English Gothic chapel of Lambeth Palace dates from work carried out while Boniface was archbishop . Boniface left England in November 1268 , and never returned . He died 18 July 1270 , in Savoy . He was buried with his family in the Cistercian abbey of <unk> in Savoy . In his will , he left legacies to all the houses of the Franciscans and Dominicans in the diocese of Canterbury . His will had differing provisions for his burial depending on whether he died in England , France , or near the Alps . Oddly enough , his official seal included a head of the pagan god Jupiter Serapis along with the usual depiction of the archbishop in full vestments . 
 After his death , his tomb was the center of a cult , and when the tomb was opened in 1580 , his body was found to be perfectly preserved . The tomb and effigy was destroyed in the French Revolution , his remains were reburied and a new tomb built in 1839 . He was beatified by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 , and his feast day is 14 July . 
 Although Matthew Paris disapproved of him , modern historians have seen him as a responsible archbishop . The historian D. A. Carpenter says that Boniface " became a respected and reforming archbishop " . His episcopal registers do not survive . 
 = I Can Only Imagine ( MercyMe song ) = 
 " I Can Only Imagine " ( sometimes shortened to " Imagine " ) is a single recorded by Christian rock band MercyMe . Written and composed by Bart Millard , the song , based around a main piano track , was inspired by the death of Millard 's father and considers what it would be like in Heaven and to be standing before God . The song was first issued as a track on MercyMe 's 1999 album The Worship Project , which was released on an independent record label . The song was re @-@ recorded and included on their 2001 major @-@ label debut album Almost There as the fifth song on the album . 
 " I Can Only Imagine " was released in 2001 as the album 's lead single . It gained significant airplay on Christian radio formats before crossing over to mainstream radio formats such as adult contemporary and Top 40 in late 2003 and into 2004 ; to aid in promotion to these markets , a double A @-@ side physical single ( combined with " Word of God Speak " ) was released in 2003 . It charted on several formats , including the Billboard Adult Contemporary ( where it peaked at No. 5 ) and the Hot 100 ( where it peaked at No. 71 ) . In 2002 , " I Can Only Imagine " earned the Dove Awards for ' Pop / Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year ' and ' Song of the Year ' ; Millard earned the Dove Award ' Songwriter of the Year ' at the same ceremony . The song has been certified 2x platinum RIAA for sales of over two million digital downloads , and is the first ( and so far only ) Christian single to reach that milestone .

 " I Can Only Imagine " was the debut single for United States contemporary Christian and Christian rock band MercyMe . The father of Bart Millard , the band 's vocalist , died in 1991 . Millard was 18 at the time . Millard began writing the words " I can only imagine " on items when he was thinking about his father . During the recording of the band 's 1999 independent album The Worship Project , MercyMe needed one more song to fill out the album . Millard , alone on a bus in the middle of the night , finally wrote the lyrics to the song by drawing on his thoughts and personal faith about what one would experience standing before God in Heaven . Millard attests that " [ ' I Can Only Imagine ' ] is one of the only songs I have ever written where there wasn 't any mistakes , it was just written the way it is and left at that " , and estimated that it took him only ten minutes to write the lyrics . 
 In writing the music for the song , however , the band faced more difficulty ; Millard noted that " at first it was a fast song ... it was all these random ideas " . Keyboardist Jim Bryson noted that " we were literally tearing down the stuff ... [ Millard ] and I were talking about arranging it differently and doing a slower version , so we just tried out a piano intro ... it was literally the first thing I played . It wasn 't anything to do with me , I think it was just a God thing . [ Millard ] said ' here it is , this is what 's going to happen ' , and we laid the song down in about five minutes . " At that time , the other MercyMe members were Robby Shaffer on drums and percussion , Nathan Cochran on bass guitar and Michael Scheuchzer on guitar . This line @-@ up recorded the first version of the song for The Worship Project . In 2006 , it was included in the ' Platinum Edition ' of Almost There . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " I Can Only Imagine " is a ballad with a length of four minutes and eight seconds . The song is set in the key of E major and has a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute with a vocal range from B3 – G ♯ 5 . The song opens up with only a piano , and builds up to include guitar and drums . Millard is credited with both the lyrics and music to the song . The song was produced by Pete Kipley , who had worked with MercyMe previously as well as with artists including Rebecca St. James , Phil Wickham and Lincoln Brewster . 
 The lyrics to the song are based around the narrator wondering what it will be like in Heaven and to be standing before God . Regarding this theme , Millard explained to Fox News that " I was always told that if he could choose , he would rather be in Heaven than here with me . As a Christian I believed that , but as an 18 @-@ year @-@ old it was a little hard to swallow . So the questions in the song came from me asking God what was so great about Him that my dad would rather be there . "

 " I Can Only Imagine " was re @-@ recorded for their major @-@ label debut record Almost There and released as its lead single in 2001 . The album was recorded in various locations : Ivy Park , The Indigo Room , Paradise Sound and IBC Studios . The single gained radio airplay on some contemporary Christian formats ; by November , it peaked at number @-@ one on the Radio & Records Christian AC format and in the top twenty of the Radio & Records Christian CHR chart . 
 In 2003 , a Dallas mainstream radio station , 100 @.@ 3 Wild @-@ FM , first played the song on its morning show , The Fitz Radio Program . They had responded to a caller 's repeated requests and the urgings of the program 's producer , Todd Sheppard . The song soon became the most requested and most played song on the station . After hearing the song played on the station , Millard called @-@ in and spoke with the crew ; MercyMe then came in and played the song live . 
 As other stations around the country caught on , MercyMe 's label , INO Records , partnered with Curb Records . They marketed the single to wider audiences , such as Top 40 radio . In September , INO and Curb also released a double A @-@ side physical single , " I Can Only Imagine / Word of God Speak " . The latter track was co @-@ written by Millard with the band 's producer , Kipley . Eventually , the song cracked into secular charts , including the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts . 
 = = Impact = = 
 MercyMe did not expect " I Can Only Imagine " to gain mainstream success , in part due to its explicit references to Jesus and Heaven . Millard noted that the band joked around about " the top five songs never to cross over , and they had included " I Can Only Imagine " on that list . Millard also believed some radio stations were playing the song to prove it could not succeed on mainstream radio . The song had a significant effect on the band 's musical image ; in an interview , Millard commented that " We were a rock band when we started 11 years ago . But we kind of became the ' adult contemporary poster child ' when ' I Can Only Imagine ' took off " .

 A music video was released for " I Can Only Imagine " . Millard recalled the video 's inspiration : " I just kept seeing all these people holding picture frames [ at MercyMe concerts ] that are empty because we all carry these people with us in some way . I 've had so many people after a show pull out a picture of someone they 've lost . These people embrace these photos and I just thought how can we tap into that " . The video features everyday people as well as several music artists including Michael Tait , Tammy Trent , Bob Herdman , and Jesse Katina , each holding an empty picture frame to signify their loss of a loved one ; as the video progresses , they are holding pictures of their loved ones including Millard with his father 's photograph . 
 The video opens with a shot of an empty room and a chair , shifting to show a young boy climbing up a flight of stairs . The camera then shifts to the band before returning to the boy , now in an attic which is filled with many empty picture frames . The video alternates between shots of the boy and the band before shifting to individual shots of other people , each holding an empty picture frame . As the other instruments join in , the camera comes back to the band , focusing on them before returning to shots of the people , whose picture frames now contain pictures of deceased relatives . At the end of the video , the camera returns to the boy , now running down a street with an empty frame , climaxing with him lying down in a field with the empty frame .

 = Iravan = 
 Iravan ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् , <unk> ) , also known as Iravat ( <unk> ् , <unk> ) and Iravant , is a minor character from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata . The son of Pandava prince Arjuna ( one of the main heroes of the Mahabharata ) and the Naga princess Ulupi , Iravan is the central deity of the cult of Kuttantavar ( Tamil : <unk> ் <unk> ் <unk> ் ) — which is also the name commonly given to him in that cult — and plays a major role in the cult of Draupadi . Both these cults are of South Indian origin , from a region of the country where he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan ( <unk> ் , <unk> ) . He is also a patron god of well @-@ known transgender communities called Ali ( also <unk> in South India , and Hijra throughout South Asia ) . 
 The Mahabharata portrays Iravan as dying a heroic death in the 18 @-@ day Kurukshetra War ( Mahabharata war ) , the epic 's main subject . However , the South Indian cults have a supplementary tradition of honouring Aravan 's self @-@ sacrifice to the goddess Kali to ensure her favour and the victory of the Pandavas in the war . The Kuttantavar cult focuses on one of the three boons granted to Aravan by the god Krishna in honour of this self @-@ sacrifice . Aravan requested that he be married before his death . Krishna satisfied this boon in his female form , Mohini . In Koovagam ( <unk> ் ) , Tamil Nadu , this incident is re @-@ enacted in an 18 @-@ day festival , first by a ceremonial marriage of Aravan to Alis and male villagers ( who have taken vows to Aravan ) and then by their widowhood after ritual re @-@ enactment of Aravan 's sacrifice . 
 The Draupadi cult emphasizes another boon : Krishna allows Aravan to witness the entire duration of the Mahabharata war through the eyes of his severed head . In another 18 @-@ day festival , the ceremonial head of Aravan is hoisted on a post to witness the ritual re @-@ enactment of the Mahabharata war . The head of Aravan is a common motif in Draupadi temples . Often it is a portable wooden head ; sometimes it even has its own shrine in the temple complex or is placed on the corners of temple roofs as a guardian against spirits . Aravan is worshipped in the form of his severed head and is believed to cure disease and induce pregnancy in childless women . 
 Iravan is also known in Indonesia ( where his name is spelled Irawan ) . An independent set of traditions have developed around Irawan on the main island of Java where , for example , he loses his association with the Naga . Separate Javanese traditions present a dramatic marriage of Irawan to Titisari , daughter of Krishna , and a death resulting from a case of mistaken identity . These stories are told through the medium of traditional Javanese theatre ( Wayang ) , especially in shadow @-@ puppet plays known as Wayang <unk> . 
 = = Etymology and other names = = 
 According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit – English Dictionary ( 1899 ) , the name Iravan , also spelt Irawan , is formed from the root Iravat ( <unk> ् , <unk> ) , also spelt <unk> . In turn , the root Iravat is derived from <unk> ( <unk> ) — closely linked with Iḍā ( <unk> ) — meaning " possessing food " , " endowed with provisions " or , by extension , " comfortable " ( as used in the Mahabharata and the Rig and Atharva vedic scriptures ) . Alf Hiltebeitel , George Washington University professor of religion , suggests that the Sanskrit name Iravan or Iravant is derived from Iḍā @-@ <unk> , " one who possessed Iḍā " . The French Indologist Madeleine Biardeau describes religious use of the word Iḍā as reference to an " <unk> substance consumed by the participants from which comes all fecundity of the sacrifice " . Based on this definition , Biardeau concludes that Iravant means sacrificial victim in the Mahabharata . Iḍā is also used elsewhere to denote a substance that Devas ( demi @-@ gods ) and Asuras ( demons ) vie for . 
 Iravan is generally known as Aravan , also spelt as <unk> in South India . He is revered as a deity in two southern Indian Hindu cults : the Kuttantavar cult ( dedicated solely to Aravan ) , and the cult of Draupadi ( Aravan 's stepmother and Arjuna 's wife ) . In his own cult , Aravan is also known as Kuttantavar ( <unk> ் <unk> ் <unk> ் ) , originating from the legend of Kuttantavar killing the demon Kuttacuran . This name is sometimes spelled as <unk> , <unk> or <unk> . 
 The South Indian , Tamil name , Aravan , is popularly believed to be derived from the word <unk> ( <unk> ் ) ( snake ) . Aravan 's association with snakes is also apparent in his iconography . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 Aravan is always worshipped in temples in the form of his severed head . He is usually depicted with a moustache , pronounced eyes and large ears . Typically , he also wears a conical crown , a Vaishnava tilak mark on his forehead and earrings . Aravan is often depicted with a cobra hood over his crown , cobra heads sprouting through the crown , or a snake emerging from behind the crown . Even the chief Koovagam icon features a serpent on Aravan 's crown . 
 Another distinctive feature of Aravan 's iconography is the presence of demonic canine teeth . Although the central Koovagam icon does not feature such demonic teeth , they are a regular feature of most Draupadi cult images , where Aravan 's demonic features are emphasized . 
 Aravan @-@ head icons are either painted or unpainted portable ones for processions ; they are housed together in the temples of his shrines . Koovagam , <unk> , <unk> and Pillaiyarkuppam have icons painted with a red face and multi @-@ coloured ornamentation . Unpainted black stone images of the Aravan @-@ head are seen in <unk> , <unk> and Pillaiyarkuppam . 
 Some paintings also depict the sacrifice of Aravan . In these scenes , he is often depicted bowing to Kali , while his head is about to be severed ; or , as in one Sowcarpet painting , a self @-@ decapitated Aravan holds both a sword and his own severed head , offering the latter to the goddess . 
 = = Historical development = = 
 Iravan first appears as a minor character in the Mahabharata as the son of Arjuna , the chief hero of the epic . The background to the Mahabharata infers a date that is " after the very early Vedic period " and before " the first Indian ' empire ' was to rise in the third century B.C. " , so " somewhere in the eighth or ninth century . " It is generally agreed , however , that " Unlike the Vedas , which have to be preserved letter @-@ perfect , the epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style . " The earliest surviving components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than the earliest external references to the epic , which may include an allusion in Panini 's 4th @-@ century grammar manual Ashtadhyayi ( 4 : 2 : 56 ) . It is estimated that the Sanskrit text probably reached something of a " final form " by the early Gupta period ( about the 4th century CE ) . The editor of the first great critical edition of the Mahabharata commented : " It is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally original shape , on the basis of an archetype and a stemma <unk> . What then is possible ? Our objective can only be to reconstruct the oldest form of the text which it is possible to reach on the basis of the manuscript material available . " 
 Iravan is also mentioned , as the son of Arjuna and Ulupi , in passing references in two Puranas ( " sacred texts " ) known as the Vishnu Purana ( 4 : 20 : 12 ) — also with a text history from the late Vedic through the Gupta periods — and the Bhagavata Purana ( 9 : 22 : 32 ) — traditionally dated to the Vedic period but dated by modern scholars to the 9th or 10th century CE . 
 Although the original Sanskrit version of the Mahabharata records Iravan 's ( Sanskrit name ) death during the 18 @-@ day Mahabharata war , the Tamil versions discuss Aravan 's ( Tamil name ) ritual self @-@ sacrifice to Kali before the war . Hiltebeitel relates this to the South Indian glorification of " heroic " self @-@ mutilation and self @-@ decapitation before a goddess . He takes particular note of a scene towards the end of a puranic text , Devi Mahatmyam , in interpreting old Tamil sculptures depicting a warrior king spilling his own blood , as in the Purana , in adoration of a goddess of victory . In the Tamil sculptures , the goddess is Korravai , who became associated with Durga and hence Kali . He also finds parallels in the Telugu legend of the sacrifice of <unk> — another Mahabharata character — and its variants in Rajasthan ( see also : <unk> ) , Himachal Pradesh , Garhwal , Kurukshetra , Bundelkhand and Orissa . Most notable among the similarities between Aravan and <unk> is the boon to witness the entire duration of the Mahabharata war — through the eyes of the severed head , despite the sacrifice . 
 The first account of Aravan 's sacrifice is found in Parata Venpa — the earliest surviving Tamil version of the Mahabharata — by Peruntevanar ( 9th century ) . The tale is later retold by Villiputuralvar in his 14th @-@ century <unk> and by <unk> in the 18th century . The legend is also mentioned in the text <unk> Sthala Purana , associated with the shrine of Kuttantavar . 
 Another source of Aravan traditions is the folk @-@ theatre of Tamil Nadu , called koothu . Aravan Kalappali ( or Aravan <unk> ) , " Aravan 's Battlefield Sacrifice " , is a popular theme of the traditional <unk> ( " street theatre " ) . Aravan Kalappali tells the story of Aravan 's pre @-@ battle self @-@ sacrifice to the goddess Kali to win her support , guaranteeing victory for the Pandavas ( Arjuna and his brothers ) in the Mahabharata war . Aravan Kalappali is staged annually in the villages of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , according to various forms of the koothu folk @-@ theatre . In <unk> , Aravan Kalappali is performed as part of the cult of Draupadi , on the 18th day of an annual festival ( April – May ) , to please the goddess . 
 In modern interpretations , Aravan 's head symbolizes not only self @-@ sacrifice but also regeneration and continuity , because of his ability to see the war after his sacrifice . For example , <unk> 's <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 1963 ) — which narrates the tale of Aravan — ends with the conclusion that Aravan continues to live on as a folk hero in Tamil Nadu , because he embodies " the ideal of self @-@ sacrifice . " Aravan is considered to be a representation of the cost of war ; he evokes the " countless innocent " reluctantly sent by their mothers " to be consumed by the insatiable Goddess of War . " Indologist David Shulman , on the other hand , considers Aravan 's sacrifice to be a reworking of the serpent sacrifice in the Tamil epic tradition . 
 = = Mahabharata = = 
 While the marriage of Iravan 's parents is mentioned in the first book of the Mahabharata , Adi Parva ( the Book of Beginnings ) , both the birth and death of Iravan are mentioned later , in the sixth book , Bhishma Parva ( the Book of Bhishma ) . In this sixth book of the epic , Arjuna , the third Pandava brother , is exiled from Indraprastha ( the capital city of the Pandava kingdom ) to go on a one @-@ year pilgrimage as a penance for violating the terms of his marriage to Draupadi , the Pandava brothers ' common wife . Arjuna reaches the north @-@ east region of present @-@ day India and falls in love with Ulupi , a widowed Naga princess . The two get married and have a son named Iravan ; later , Arjuna proceeds with his pilgrimage , leaving Iravan and Ulupi behind in Nagaloka , the abode of the Nagas . Iravan is described as being born <unk> , literally " in a region belonging to another person " , interpreted by Hiltebeitel as " upon the wife of another " . Iravan grew up in Nagaloka , protected by his mother , but was rejected by his maternal uncle because of the latter 's hatred of Arjuna . After reaching maturity , Iravan , hoping to be reunited with his father , departs for <unk> , the abode of the god Indra , who is also Arjuna 's father . Upon meeting his adult son , Arjuna requests his assistance in the Kurukshetra War . 
 Thus Iravan finally reaches the battlefield of Kurukshetra to assist his father and Pandavas against their cousins and opponents , the Kauravas . On the first day of war , Iravan fights a duel with <unk> , a Kshatriya king who had been a <unk> ( demon ) called <unk> in a prior incarnation . <unk> is later killed by Arjuna . On the seventh day of war , Iravan also defeats Vinda and <unk> , the princes of Avanti , who are later killed by Arjuna . 
 On the eighth day of the war , Iravan combats the princes of Gandhara , sons of king <unk> , and the younger brothers of Shakuni , the treacherous maternal uncle of the Kauravas . The brothers Gaya , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Suka attack Iravan , supported by the whole Kaurava army , but Iravan 's army of Nagas slays all but one of their opponents . Iravan , the " <unk> of foes " — versed in maya ( illusion ) — slays five of the Gandhara princes in a sword fight ; <unk> alone escapes death . 
 Agitated by this reversal , the eldest Kaurava , Duryodhana , orders the rakshasa ( giant ) <unk> ( or Alambusha ) , son of <unk> , to kill Iravan . This time Alambusha , as well as Iravan , uses illusion in combat . Alambusha attacks Iravan with a bow , but Iravan counters , breaking Alambusha 's bow and slicing the giant into several pieces . Alambusha 's body , however , <unk> itself . Then Iravan assumes the form of the serpent Shesha ( Ananta ) , and his serpent army surrounds him to protect him . Alambusha counters this by assuming the form of Garuda ( the eagle @-@ man ) , the eternal foe of the serpents , and devours the serpent army . Ultimately , Alambusha kills Iravan by cutting off his head , though Iravan is later avenged when Ghatotkacha , his cousin , finally kills Alambusha .

 = = = Selection as sacrificial victim = = = 
 The earliest source of Tamil traditions regarding Aravan is found in Peruntevanar 's Parata Venpa , a 9th @-@ century Tamil version of the Mahabharata . One of the features of this work is its reference to a rite it calls kalappali ( " sacrifice to the battlefield " ) , a term found only in Tamil versions of the Mahabharata . This is a ritual performed before battle to ensure victory . In Peruntevanar 's narrative , just before the Mahabharata war , Duryodhana — the leader of the Kauravas and opponent of the Pandavas — learns from the Pandava 's expert astrologer , <unk> , that the day of the new moon , indeed the very next day , would be the most auspicious time for a kalappali . Consequently , Duryodhana approaches and convinces Aravan to be the sacrificial victim for the kalappali . 
 The god Krishna , who is a close friend of and advisor to the Pandavas , hears of Duryodhana 's plan , and devises one of his own , to ensure that Aravan will give himself as a sacrifice on behalf of the Pandavas rather than the Kauravas . Krishna first discusses the issue with Yudhishthira ( Dharma or Dharmaraja ) , the eldest of the Pandavas , recommending the sacrifice to Kali as a part of an <unk> @-@ puja ( " worship of the weapons " ) . Krishna establishes that there are four candidates most suited to being offered as the victim : Shalya , who is on the side of Kauravas ; Arjuna , the commander of the Pandavas ; Aravan ; and Krishna himself . From this shortlist , Krishna finally narrows the best choice down to Aravan . Aravan agrees to undergo the kalappali on behalf of the Pandavas but mentions his prior commitment to Duryodhana . 
 Later Tamil sources provide variants to Peruntevanar 's version . In Villiputuralvar 's 14th @-@ century version , Krishna first offers himself as the sacrificial victim , but Aravan volunteers to replace him . There is no mention of Duryodhana in this version of the legend . In other accounts , Aravan is sacrificed in order to counteract the Kauravas ' sacrifice of a white elephant . In the traditions of the village of <unk> , in the Thanjavur district , Aravan is described as being so strong that he could slay all the <unk> at once , thus preventing any war from happening . So Krishna prescribes the human sacrifice of Aravan in order that " the greater sacrifice of the war can take place " . 
 In <unk> performances , at the time of Aravan 's sacrifice , he is often compared to Puru and Bhishma , characters in the Mahabharata who gave up their youth and sexual fulfilment for the sake of their respective fathers , Yayati and <unk> . In the drama , after acquiring Aravan 's approval , Krishna approaches Aravan 's mother , Ulupi — <unk> or <unk> ( " Serpent maiden " ) in Tamil , for her consent . At first she strongly opposes her son 's proposed sacrifice but finally relents when Aravan appeals to her , explaining that he belongs to Kali alone . 
 Finally , in all versions of the tale , Krishna tricks the gods Surya ( the Sun ) and Chandra ( the Moon ) to co @-@ ordinate their movements so that the day of the new moon will fall one day earlier — the current day . This allows Aravan to make the initial sacrifice of flesh on behalf of the Pandavas , only making the rest @-@ offering on behalf of Duryodhana the following day , yet fulfilling his promise to Duryodhana by doing so . 
 = = = Three boons = = = 
 In Parata Venpa , Aravan asks Krishna to grant him the boon of a heroic death on the battlefield at the hands of a great hero . Although Parata Venpa mentions only one boon , the overall Tamil tradition preserves a total of three distinct boons associated with Aravan . The single boon of Parata Venpa , according to Hiltebeitel , indicates an early ( 9th @-@ century ) effort to harmonize the Tamil tradition of Aravan 's pre @-@ battle sacrifice with the original Sanskrit account of his death during the battle at the hands of Alambusha ( <unk> in Tamil ) . 
 In both the Kuttantavar and Draupadi cults , Aravan is believed to have been granted a second boon — to see the entire 18 @-@ day war . A second boon is indeed found in Villiputuralvar 's 14th @-@ century version of the Mahabharata . In this version , Aravan is granted boons of watching the battle for a " few days " and of dying gloriously after killing many enemies , though Villiputuralvar does not actually specify whether Aravan 's head survives to see the complete battle after his bodily death on the eighth day . 
 The third boon is found only in the folk rituals . This third boon provides for Aravan to be married before the sacrifice , entitling him to the right of cremation and funerary offerings ( bachelors were buried ) . However , no woman wanted to marry Aravan , fearing the inevitable doom of widowhood ( see also sati ) . In the Kuttantavar cult version , Krishna solves this dilemma by taking on his female form , Mohini the enchantress , marrying Aravan , and spending that night with him . The Koovagam version additionally relates Krishna 's mourning as a widow after Aravan 's sacrifice the next day , after which he returns to his original masculine form for the duration of the war . The terukuttu performance presents a stylised wedding ceremony followed by Mohini 's abrupt departure , which is taken to signify that the marriage is unconsummated . Another version , popular with transsexuals , cites the reason behind Aravan 's wish to be " coital bliss " and tells explicitly about consummation of the marriage . This third marriage boon is not , however , uniform across all the folk traditions . In other legends , Krishna arranges some other pre @-@ war marriages . In Thanjavur , the marriage of Aravan and Mohini is unknown ; instead it depicts Aravan as married to <unk> , the daughter of Krishna 's younger cousin @-@ brother Satyaki . 
 Hiltebeitel theorizes that both the first ( heroic @-@ death ) and third ( marriage ) boons originated with the Kuttantavar cult , while the second boon originated with the Draupadi cult . The Kuttantavar cult <unk> both the heroic death and the marriage ceremony — enacted by ali ( officially , " eunuchs " in Tamil Nadu ) . Whereas , in the Draupadi cult it is the clay head of Aravan , fixed on a <unk> and witnessing the re @-@ enactment of the 18 @-@ day war , that is prominently ritualized . Additionally , Draupadi @-@ cult texts from Thajavur concentrate only on this second boon , omitting the other two . 
 The pre @-@ battle sacrifice is incompatible with the first and second boons , but the cults have their own explanations . The self @-@ sacrifice prior to the war is incompatible with dying a heroic death during the war and both are incompatible with living to see the full duration of the war . The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma , holding that Aravan 's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to die a heroic death on the eighth day of the war . The Kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about the second boon of Aravan 's continued observation of the war . On the other hand , the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death ; they resolve the second dilemma , regarding Aravan 's continued observation of the war , holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head . A third view harmonizes all the boons , holding that Aravan 's body reconstituted after the sacrifice ; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day , observing the remainder of the war through the eyes of his severed head . 
 In any case , the pre @-@ battle sacrifice is the common element in the Tamil traditions . After Aravan requested and was granted his boons , he was ready for the sacrifice . He proceeds to the Kurukshetra battlefield . While Yudhishthira is worshipping Kali in his " hall of weapons " , Aravan removes his epaulettes and chest plate . He then cuts his body into 32 pieces — one cut for each of his 32 bodily perfections — which are offered by Yudhishthira to Kali . In a terukuttu performance , this is depicted by covering the actor playing Aravan with a white cloth from the neck down . It is also believed that Aravan 's spirit may possess the actor at this point . Sometimes a chicken is sacrificed on stage in a terukuttu performance to signify the sacrifice . In Villiputuralvar 's retelling , an elephant is sacrificed to the goddess , complementing Aravan 's own self @-@ sacrifice . 
 Aravan , after being stripped of his flesh , has only his head and skeleton remaining . Krishna advises him to pray to the Naga , Adi @-@ Shesha , his grandfather , and father of Ulupi . Adi @-@ Shesha coils himself around Aravan , becomes his flesh and restores his body . To fulfil the second boon , Krishna orchestrates the heroic death by making one of the enemy strong enough to defeat the mighty Aravan . Krishna selects Alambusha . Then , depending on the version of the story , Krishna either advises Alambusha to assume the form of Garuda via a heavenly voice , or he sends the true Garuda to assist Alambusha . At the sight of Garuda — his perennial " eagle " adversary — Shesha <unk> in fear , leaving Aravan unprotected and leading ultimately to Alambusha beheading the weakened Aravan . 
 = = = Aravan to Kuttantavar = = = 
 A traditional story local to Koovagam describes how Aravan came to be known as Kuttantavar . After the war , while the Pandavas are boasting about vanquishing the Kauravas , Krishna asks Aravan — the sole witness of the entire war , " who was truly responsible for winning this war ? " Aravan replies that he saw two things : Krishna 's discus decapitating the enemy , and his conch shell collecting their blood . This reply is understood to give all the credit for the victory to Krishna . 
 Aravan 's opinion enrages the proud and quick @-@ tempered Bhima , whose influence in deciding the outcome of the battle is covered at great length in the Mahabharata . However , before Bhima can wound Aravan , Krishna orders Aravan 's head to be dropped in the river <unk> , where he assumes the form of a child , and is eventually found by the king of Chandragiri , a city on the river bank . The child cries " <unk> <unk> " , when picked up by the king , who therefore names the location <unk> ( Koovagam ) . The king also names the child Carapalan ( " reed @-@ child " ) . 
 The tradition goes on to relate that Carapalan grew up , going on to kill the demon Kuttacuran , who had wounded his adopted father in battle . Draupadi — identified in this tradition with the Supreme Goddess — blesses Carapalan with the new name Kuttantavar — the slayer of Kuttacuran — and grants him a temple in Koovagam . 
 There are variants within this tradition . Some versions give the credit for finding the child to Queen <unk> of Chandragiri . Others omit mention of the king of Chandragiri altogether , and omit reference to the Koovagam temple . Instead they focus on the demon Kuttacuran and an apparently impossible boon granted to him that he will be killed by a person having only a head and who was born from water . Vishnu , incarnated as Krishna , informs the gods that Aravan will kill this demon . With this in mind , the head of Aravan is consigned to the river and is transformed into a child called Kuttan ( " born from water " ) , who kills the demon .

 Hiltebeitel argues that the Kuttantavar cult might represent the original Tamil tradition regarding Aravan , however it is no longer the only tradition that venerates Aravan . The Draupadi cult has developed traditions and rituals of its own . 
 Most Kuttantavar devotees reside in the Tamil Nadu districts of Cuddalore , Thiruvannamalai , Vellore and Villupuram . Draupadi 's devotees have also spread across these districts , as well as into the Kanchipuram ( former Chingleput ) district . Her temples can also be seen in the Thanjavur district and beyond , to the southern districts of the states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka . The temples of Kuttantavar are fewer than the Draupadi temples and are restricted to a belt running from the Cuddalore and Villupuram districts through to Coimbatore . Thirty @-@ two of these temples are particularly prominent ; Koovagam is the foremost . The 32 temples are : 
 The severed head of Aravan is a common motif in Draupadi 's temples . Often it is a portable wooden head ; sometimes this even has its own shrine in the temple complex . Icons of Aravan 's head are also often placed on the corners and edges of Draupadi temple roofs . As a <unk> or <unk> ( spirit ) , Aravan acts as a guardian against other spirits , for the temple itself , and also for the <unk> ceremony . <unk> , in the Draupadi cult , is the symbolic ground on which the Mahabharata war is ritually re @-@ enacted . In the taluks of Thajavur , Kumbhakonam and <unk> , Aravan 's head is enshrined permanently in a mandapa or within a temple niche . The largest known Aravan head is found at the <unk> Teru temple in Kumbhakonam . 
 = = = Kuttantavar cult rituals = = = 
 Aravan is known as Kuttantavar in the cult which bears his name , and in which he is the chief deity . His main temple is in Koovagam , Tamil Nadu . Here , the marriage of Aravan and Mohini , Krishna 's female form , and her widowhood and mourning , after Aravan 's sacrifice , forms the central theme of an 18 @-@ day annual festival either side of the night of the full moon in the Tamil month of <unk> ( April – May ) . The day of the full moon is the central day of the festival , when Aravan 's sacrifice is ritually re @-@ enacted . 
 Alis , who call themselves <unk> or <unk> ( <unk> ் <unk> ) in this geographic area , take part in the Koovagam festival by re @-@ enacting the marriage of Aravan and Mohini . The Alis participate in similar Kuttantavar festivals , of smaller scale , in other villages like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — 5 miles ( 8 km ) north @-@ west of Chidambaram — and <unk> ( all in Tamil Nadu ) and also in Pillaiyarkuppam , in Puducherry . Although local Alis have been part of this festival for many years , since the 1960s , a large number of Alis have come to the festival from further afield : from throughout Tamil Nadu , from the whole of India , and even from as far away as Singapore . About 25 @,@ 000 transvestites , including the Alis , visit the festival . Francis 's account of 1906 records men dressed as women , from <unk> and other Shudra castes , becoming part of the festival — a " popular feast of Shudras " , but there is no explicit mention of Alis . It also records that the ritual marriage of the men to Kuttantavar and their widowhood occurred on the last day of the festival , unlike the present form of the festival , which has the marriage ceremony on the 14th day , and the widowhood ceremony on the 16th day . 
 During the first six days of the Kuttantavar festival , Aravan 's head ( <unk> ) is " danced " around the streets of <unk> , with music and fireworks accompanying it . Each household offers a puja ( a kind of devotional ceremony ) to Aravan , with lamp @-@ waving , coconut @-@ offerings and other rituals . Traditionally , goats and chickens are sacrificed . On the 13th day , Aravan 's " soul " is ritually transferred from his head to a pot , and the head is repainted . On the evening of the 14th day , a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) high post is erected on a processional chariot . The post will support Aravan 's head and body later in the festival . After the post @-@ setting ceremony ( <unk> <unk> ) , young and middle @-@ aged men ( farmers and traders from Koovagam and surrounding villages ) who have vowed to marry Aravan purchase thalis — the traditional mark of a married woman , in this case a pendant with a piece of turmeric at its centre . The priest , representing Aravan , ties the thalis around their necks in the inner sanctum of the temple . Even married men and men afflicted with diseases , all dressed as women , are described as ritually " marrying " Aravan in the festival , to please the deity . 
 The Alis arrive in increasing numbers from the 14th through the 16th day . Late on the 15th night , they dance with the flower @-@ crown ( <unk> ) of Aravan , which is believed to possess his power . After this dance , the priest marries the Alis to Aravan through the traditional thali @-@ tying ceremony . The Alis then conduct sex work , symbolic of consummating their ritual marriage . A " night of wild revelry and sexual promiscuity " follows for the Alis . However , the villagers who married Aravan are not described as having sex in any of the accounts . While Alis wear women 's clothes and jewellery , villagers marrying Aravan on account of wish @-@ fulfilment vows made to him retain their ordinary men 's clothes . 
 Early on the 16th day , the " soul " of Aravan is transferred back to his repainted head and the <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " opening of the god 's holy eyes " ) ceremony is performed with painting of the pupils . The head is then paraded around the village on a portable platform called a <unk> . The <unk> is accompanied by two other platform @-@ chariots , one holding the chest plate and epaulettes of Aravan — without which the festival is considered incomplete ; the other carries his flower @-@ crown . The ceremony ends with a sacrificial offering of roosters . Aravan 's head is fixed on the post , with his large epaulettes and chest plate fixed to his body , which is made of straw and surrounded by a garland . The image is then paraded across the village in preparation for his kalappali and ritual re @-@ enactment of his death on the eighth day of the war . At noon his chariot turns north , a symbolic gesture representing his kalappali and then he is turned to face the ceremonial Kurukshetra battlefield , symbolizing his entry onto the battlefield to die at the hands of Alambusha . On arrival in Kurukshetra , the garlands are removed , indicating the removal of his flesh and his defeat on the eighth day of war . 
 Returning from the battlefield , the chariot turns towards the location prepared for the ceremonial mourning rituals , the " weeping ground " ( alukalam ) . The " widowed " Alis , with their hair dishevelled , lament the death of their " husband " as he performs the kalappali . The garlands from Aravan 's image are thrown at devotees one by one , symbolizing his gradual loss of vitality . At this " weeping ground " , the Alis mourn Aravan 's death by breaking their bangles , beating their breasts and discarding their bridal finery , like the legendary Mohini @-@ Krishna . They cut their thalis , which are flung at a post erected for the ceremony ( <unk> ) . After bathing , they put on white saris as a mark of their widowhood . The Alis bear these signs of widowhood for a month before re @-@ adorning themselves with bangles and coloured saris again . 
 At mid @-@ afternoon , as the chariot reaches alukalam , Aravan is stripped to his skeletal straw body . Most Alis have left and men wedded to Aravan also break their thalis and bangles and perform all the rites of widowhood ( the <unk> rites ) before the image of Aravan . Meanwhile , a <unk> ( Mahabharata @-@ reciter ) tells the story of the culmination of the war , symbolic of Aravan fulfilling his wish of seeing the war . Hiltebeitel suggests that while the Alis weep for Aravan 's kalappali , the villagers weep for the death of an ancestor , as life leaves Aravan 's head at the end of the war . 
 Also at the alukalam , a symbolic sacrifice of cooked " blood rice " is distributed in honour of the deceased Aravan . This rice is believed to make childless women conceive . After the death rites at dusk , the chariot is now considered a " house of death " , and the lifeless head is removed from the frame of its skeletal body , then covered by a cloth , and finally paraded around the village as though at a funeral . The head is taken to the temple of Kali , where is it " revived " . In a ceremony called <unk> ( " the return dance " ) , the head is once more danced around the village , right up until early morning on the 17th day . On the 18th and final day , the head is decorated and paraded around the village a final time . In the evening , the pujari ( " priest " ) as Yudhishthira ( Dharmaraja ) crowns Aravan 's head in a coronation ceremony held in the inner sanctum of his temple . 
 = = = Draupadi cult rituals = = = 
 Devotees of Draupadi commemorate the Mahabharata war by conducting an annual festival known as patukalam . This festival usually begins with a kuttu ( " drama " ) re @-@ enacting Draupadi 's wedding . During the festival , the actor playing the part of Draupadi ( and other women participating in the public ceremonies ) lament the death of Aravan and the other heroes of the war . There is some variation in the length of the patukalam festival and in the day allocated to performing the kuttu of " Aravan 's sacrifice " ( kalappali ) , but wherever the ritual kalappali is performed , that place is declared to be , symbolically , the battlefield of Kurukshetra . 
 In <unk> , Tamil Nadu , this kuttu is usually performed 16 days before " patukalam day " , the last day of an 18 @-@ day festival . In Singapore , however , the kuttu is performed on the day of the new moon in the Tamil month of <unk> ( September – October ) . In shorter 10 @-@ to @-@ 12 day festivals , the kuttu and <unk> of Aravan 's kalappali are performed on the concluding night of the festival , as can be observed in Bangalore and in and around Chennai — at Sowcarpet , Alantur and Punamalli . 
 There is also variation in how Aravan is represented in the festivities . While permanent wooden Aravan heads are used in temples in Chennai and Puducherry , in rural areas the head and body of Aravan are made of clay ; both are destroyed at the end of the festival . At <unk> , a headless clay and bamboo body of Aravan is modelled , showing him in a heroic position , kneeling on his left knee and holding a bow . A clay head is then ceremoniously fixed , making the effigy about 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) tall . The officiating priest first takes a sword , striking pieces from the head . Then , a pumpkin is sliced into 32 pieces , symbolizing 32 pieces of Aravan 's sacrificed body . Next , Aravan is fed his own " blood " , represented by the blood of goat , sacrificed to Aravan beforehand . Aravan 's body from the neck downwards is then covered with a bloodstained white cloth . Finally , blood @-@ soaked rice is sprinkled on Aravan 's face . Devotees , as in the Kuttantavar cult , believe eating this rice from Aravan 's face , recovered after the ceremony , can induce pregnancy . 
 In <unk> <unk> , near Kumbhakonam , a 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) statue of Aravan is constructed horizontally and placed on the ground . Aravan 's story is then re @-@ enacted ; one of the actors , believed to be possessed by Kali , kills a rooster over the statue 's neck , symbolizing the sacrifice . Again , blood @-@ soaked rice is distributed to devotees , especially childless women . Similar rituals associated with a symbolic sacrifice and blood @-@ soaked rice are performed in <unk> , Alantur , Punamalli and Villupuram . At Alantur and Punamalli , a goat is sacrificed , in Cuddalore , <unk> and Villupuram , a cock is sacrificed . In the districts of Cuddalore , Thanjavur and Villupuram , Aravan 's head is hoisted to an elevated position to watch over the patukalam and the symbolic re @-@ enactment of the Mahabharata war . 
 = = Javanese traditions = = 
 The Indonesian island of Java , run by the Srivijaya dynasty of Sumatra from the 7th century , partly practised Hinduism . This included transmission and adoption of the Mahabharata traditions . " The earliest evidence of the penetration of the Sanskrit epics into rural areas is found in the <unk> copper plate inscription issued in the name of King <unk> in AD 907 . " A " rendering of the Mahābhārata ( IAST original ) into Javanese was undertaken under the patronage of King <unk> <unk> ( AD 990 – 1016 ) " , culminating in " a recital of the <unk> for ' one month minus one evening ' — commencing on 14 October and ending on 12 November 996 . " This first translation into Javanese was " abbreviated " and in " prose " . However , East Javanese poets later started producing native metered <unk> , expanding on themes from the <unk> ( " books " or " chapters " ) of the Mahabharata , and freely importing these into Javanese settings . Petrus Josephus <unk> commented : " These men and women with their Indian names are essentially Javanese , acting like Javanese , thinking like Javanese and living in a Javanese environment . " 
 The stories of Iravan , usually spelled Irawan in Java , along with others from the Javanese version of the Mahabharata , are told in traditional Javanese theatre ( wayang ) , as well as shadow @-@ puppet plays known as wayang kulit . As in India , Irawan is described as a son of Ardjuna ( Arjuna ) and Ulupi . While in India , Irawan 's mother Ulupi is a Naga ( serpent ) , in Javanese legends she is the daughter of the sage <unk> ( <unk> in puppetry ) of the <unk> hermitage . Irawan is born and brought up in the hermitage under the care of his mother and grandfather , away from his father . Irawan and his stepbrother <unk> ( Abhimanyu ) or <unk> are the protagonists of more than 40 <unk> ( " scenes " , " dramas " or " plays " ) set in the <unk> Period , the era of the <unk> ( Pandavas ) . In these <unk> , Irawan is depicted as a <unk> character — " a small , extremely refined , controlled character , whose manner is modest " . In the wayang kulit , he is referred to as a <unk> ( " refined knight " ) , depicted with a white face and dubbed with a light , floating voice . Irawan is also described as determined and calm . 
 Irawan Rabi 
 A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ( " Irawan 's wedding " ) tells about the love of Irawan and Titisari , a daughter of Kresna ( Krishna ) . While Titisari is engaged to Irawan , <unk> ( <unk> ) , Kresna 's brother and an ally of the Kurawas ( Kauravas ) , wants her to marry Lesmana <unk> , the son of <unk> ( Duryodhana ) , initiating a dramatic conflict . The conflict that ensues ends up being three @-@ sided , among the <unk> , Kurawas and the ogre @-@ kingdom , whose evil ogre @-@ king <unk> plans to kidnap Titisari . The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas . Siti Sendari , the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of <unk> , takes advantage of the situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together , while also mending her relationships with her husband . Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon , in reality they are mere spectators , not the movers , in the play . Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character . Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others , which is common in South Asian theatre . Another lakon called Serat <unk> <unk> <unk> also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari . 
 Serat Gambiranom 
 In a lakon called Serat Gambiranom , written in <unk> verse by <unk> IV 's court poet R. M. Ng . <unk> in 1883 , and embellished by anonymous later poets , Irawan becomes the king of <unk> Kencana and earns the title <unk> Gambiranom . Yet another lakon , Irawan Maling , discusses a duel between Irawan and <unk> . 
 Irawan ( an ) taka 
 The <unk> text Irawan ( an ) taka ( " Death of Irawan " ) , also known as <unk> ( " Arjuna 's Victory " ) , describes Irawan 's death in the Bharatayuddha ( Mahabharata war ) . At the beginning of the Bharatayuddha , Irawan advances to the battlefield along with his brothers . Together , they kill many Kurawas . Later , the demon ( <unk> ) Kalasrenggi encounters Irawan . Kalasrenggi , whose father was killed by Ardjuna , mistakes Irawan for Ardjuna because of the similarity of their appearance and kills him . Arjuna then kills Kalasrenggi to avenge Irawan 's death . The death of Irawan is placed at the very beginning of the war in the Javanese version of the Mahabharata . The puppetry version of the story places this encounter between Irawan and Kalasrenggi even before Irawan 's meeting with his father , ahead of the Bharatayuddha . 
 = Shangani Patrol = 
 The Shangani Patrol ( or Wilson 's Patrol ) , comprising 34 soldiers in the service of the British South Africa Company , was ambushed and annihilated by more than 3 @,@ 000 Matabele warriors during the First Matabele War in 1893 . Headed by Major Allan Wilson , the patrol was attacked just north of the Shangani River in Matabeleland in Rhodesia ( today Zimbabwe ) . Its dramatic last stand , sometimes called " Wilson 's Last Stand " , achieved a prominent place in the British public imagination and , subsequently , in Rhodesian history , mirroring events such as the Battle of <unk> in Japan , the Alamo massacre in Texas and the ancient Greeks ' last stand at Thermopylae . 
 The patrol comprised elements of the Mashonaland Mounted Police and the Bechuanaland Border Police . Scouting ahead of Major Patrick Forbes 's column attempting the capture of the Matabele King Lobengula ( following his flight from his capital Bulawayo a month before ) , it crossed the Shangani late on 3 December 1893 . It moved on Lobengula the next morning , but was ambushed by a host of Matabele riflemen and warriors near the king 's wagon . Surrounded and outnumbered about a hundred @-@ fold , the patrol made a last stand as three of its number broke out and rode back to the river to muster reinforcements from Forbes . However , the Shangani had risen significantly in flood , and Forbes was himself involved in a skirmish near the southern bank ; Wilson and his men therefore remained isolated to the north . After fighting to the last cartridge , and killing over ten times their own number , they were annihilated . 
 The patrol 's members , particularly Wilson and Captain Henry Borrow , were elevated in death to the status of national heroes , representing endeavour in the face of insurmountable odds . The anniversary of the battle on 4 December 1893 became an annual public holiday in Rhodesia two years later , and was an official non @-@ work day until 1920 . A historical war film depicting the episode , Shangani Patrol , was produced and released in 1970 . 
 Controversy surrounds the breakout before the last stand — which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion — and a box of gold sovereigns , which a Matabele inDuna ( leader ) later claimed had been given to two unidentified men from Forbes 's rear guard on 2 December , along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him . Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold , keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message , but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial ; the convictions were ultimately overturned . 
 = = Background = = 
 Amid the Scramble for Africa during the 1880s , the South African @-@ based businessman and politician Cecil Rhodes envisioned the annexation to the British Empire of a swathe of territory connecting the Cape of Good Hope and Cairo — respectively at the southern and northern tips of Africa — and the concurrent construction of a line of rail linking the two . On geopolitical maps , British territories were generally marked in red or pink , so this concept became known as the " Cape to Cairo red line " . In the immediate vicinity of the Cape , this ambition was challenged by the presence of independent states to the north @-@ east of Britain 's Cape Colony : the Boer republics , and to the north of these the Kingdom of Matabeleland under Lobengula . Having secured the Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula on 30 October 1888 , Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889 . The Company was empowered under this charter to trade with local rulers , form banks , own and manage land , and raise and run a police force : the British South Africa Company 's Police , renamed the Mashonaland Mounted Police in 1892 . 
 In return for these rights , the Company would govern and develop any territory it acquired , while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers , and upholding free trade within its borders . The first settlers referred to their new home as " Rhodesia " , after Rhodes . Though the Company made good on most of its pledges , the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders , particularly regarding mining rights , was often evaded , misrepresented or simply ignored . It also offended Lobengula by demanding that he stop the customary Matabele raids on the Mashona people who inhabited the white @-@ governed areas . Angered by the Company 's attitude towards his authority , Lobengula made war on the new arrivals and the Mashonas in 1893 . Matabele warriors began the wholesale slaughter of Mashonas in the vicinity of Fort Victoria in July that year , and an indaba ( tribal conference ) organised by Company official Leander Starr Jameson to end the conflict ended with violence , and dispersion by force . The First Matabele War had started . 
 Company columns rode from Fort Salisbury and Fort Victoria , and combined at Iron Mine Hill , around the centre point of the country , on 16 October 1893 . Together the force totalled about 700 men , commanded by Major Patrick Forbes , and equipped with five Maxim machine guns . Forbes 's combined column moved on the Matabele king 's capital at Bulawayo , to the south @-@ west . The Matabele army mobilised to prevent Forbes from reaching the city , and twice engaged the column as it approached : on 25 October , 3 @,@ 500 warriors assaulted the column near the Shangani River . Lobengula 's troops were well @-@ drilled and formidable by pre @-@ colonial African standards , but the Company 's Maxim guns , which had never before been used in battle , far exceeded expectations , according to an eyewitness " mow [ ing ] them down literally like grass " . By the time the Matabele withdrew , they had suffered around 1 @,@ 500 fatalities ; the Company , on the other hand , had lost only four men . A week later , on 1 November , 2 @,@ 000 Matabele riflemen and 4 @,@ 000 warriors attacked Forbes at <unk> , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) north @-@ east of Bulawayo , but again they were no match for the crushing firepower of the major 's Maxims : about 2 @,@ 500 more Matabele were killed . 
 Lobengula fled Bulawayo as soon as he heard the news from <unk> . On 3 November 1893 , with the column on the outskirts of the city , he and his subjects left , torching the royal town as they went . In the resultant conflagration , the city 's large store of ivory , gold and other treasure was destroyed , as was its ammunition magazine , which exploded . The flames were still rising when the whites entered the settlement the next day ; basing themselves in the " White Man 's Camp " already present , they set about extinguishing the fire which engulfed the town . Using a tree to improvise a flagstaff , they hoisted first the Company flag , then the Union Jack . The reconstruction of Bulawayo began almost as soon as the blaze was out , with a new white @-@ run city rising atop the ruins of Lobengula 's former residence . Jameson , who now based himself in Bulawayo , wrote the following letter to the Matabele king on 7 November 1893 , in English , Dutch and Zulu : 
 This letter , carried by John <unk> , a coloured man from the Cape , reached Lobengula near Shiloh Mission , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) north of Bulawayo . The king replied in English : 
 Jameson did not regard this ambiguity as a proper answer , and impatiently waited for further word from the king . After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing , he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him , and using the extra time to distance himself from his former capital . Jameson therefore made good on his pledge , and called for volunteers ; he assembled a host of about 470 men , mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police , the Bechuanaland Border Police , and Raaff 's Rangers , an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff . This force was placed under Forbes 's command , with three Maxim guns attached . Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor , with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula , and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893 . 
 = = Prelude : Forbes 's pursuit of Lobengula = = 
 The column left Bulawayo heading north , and , in an attempt to expedite its progress , reorganised itself into a more compact 290 @-@ man force at Shiloh . Lobengula , meanwhile , rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon , which left obvious tracks in its wake . Following the wagon tracks , Forbes 's men were soon hot on the trail , routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps , provisions and stragglers . Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers , and led Forbes to split his force again ; moving on with a flying column of 160 men , he sent the rest back with the wagons . He pushed on , and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani , from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi ( regiment ) of warriors . The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed the fact that they had just crossed . Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river , Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers , and told him to return by nightfall . 
 Meanwhile , Forbes formed a laager ( improvised fort ) about 200 yards ( 180 m ) from the southern bank . There , he interrogated a captive Matabele , the son of an inDuna ( tribal leader ) , who said that the king was indeed where Wilson had gone , and was ill ( the exact ailment was not known for sure , the prisoner said , but was suspected to be gout ) . The inDuna 's son said that Lobengula had with him a force of about 3 @,@ 000 warriors , about half of whom were armed with Martini @-@ Henry rifles . They were mixed together from various regiments of the previously routed Matabele army , and largely demoralised , but still fiercely determined to prevent Lobengula 's capture . Most prominent were the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Regiments ; the <unk> , Lobengula 's favourite , was generally considered the strongest . After three weeks in pursuit of the king , Forbes 's rations were running perilously short . He therefore resolved to attack the next day ( 4 December ) , hoping to be able to turn back for Bulawayo with Lobengula in custody before nightfall . 
 Wilson 's men remained north of the river far longer than expected , and had still not returned when darkness fell . Forbes , meanwhile , received a report that most of Lobengula 's force , commanded by inDuna Mjaan , had separated from the king and was moving to attack the laager the same night ( this was actually an exaggeration ; only about 300 riflemen had split from the main Matabele force , though they were indeed south of the river , undetected by Forbes ) . Visibility was poor by now , and rain periodically fell . The laager received no word from Wilson until about 21 : 00 , when Sergeant @-@ Major Judge and Corporal <unk> arrived from across the river to tell Forbes that Wilson had found Lobengula 's tracks , and followed him for 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) . Wilson regarded the chances of taking the king alive as so good that he was going to remain north of the river overnight . He asked Forbes to send more men and a Maxim gun in the morning , but did not explain what he planned to do with them . 
 The Shangani Patrol continued its approach during the late evening , and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula . Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language , Sindebele , but received no reply from the Matabele leaders , who remained silent and hid themselves . The patrol 's actions confused the Matabele , who could not understand why there appeared to be so few Company soldiers , nor why they would reveal their position like this . They concluded that it must be a trap , and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson 's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times . Following the fifth call from Napier , Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol , intending to pocket it . Noticing this , Wilson ordered a retreat , and took up a well @-@ covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak . When Lieutenant <unk> and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night , Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them . 
 On returning to his bush camp , Wilson sent a further message to the laager , which reached its destination at around 23 : 00 : Napier , Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners . Wilson repeated that he was going to stay north of the river overnight , close to the king , and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04 : 00 in the morning . Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night , which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred , but also felt he could not recall Wilson , as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure . 
 As a compromise , Forbes sent Captain Henry Borrow across with 21 men at 01 : 00 on 4 December , and told Borrow to relay to Wilson that the laager was surrounded , and " expected to be attacked any moment " . Forbes apparently intended for Borrow 's reinforcements to secure Wilson 's position , but historian W D Gale writes that this was a serious tactical error on Forbes 's part : the addition of Borrow 's men made Wilson 's patrol too large to be a mere reconnoitring force , but still too small to overpower the Matabele and capture the king . Indeed , Wilson and his officers looked on gloomily when Borrow 's men arrived soon after dawn , fewer in number than expected and without the requested Maxim gun . Only 20 of the reinforcements ( including Borrow himself ) reached Wilson — Troopers Landsberg and Nesbitt became separated from the main group along the way , and eventually rejoined Forbes during the morning . Trooper Robertson returned to Wilson with Borrow , giving the patrol a total of 37 men , including its officers .

 Wilson conferred with his officers , none of whom was particularly optimistic about their prospects : " This is the end " said one . British soldier and historian Roger Marston postulates that the patrol might still have been safe had it not now pursued the king , but Wilson decided to proceed : " Let 's ride on Lobengula , " he said . Several analysts comment that this was perhaps excessively rash . Marston says that Wilson 's actions " had a flavour of doomed resignation about them " , and suggests that the major believed no other path was open , and was therefore going for broke . The Matabele hovered around the vicinity , waiting to see what Wilson would do next . On the southern side of the river , the 300 Matabele riflemen took up a well @-@ covered position near the riverbank , about 300 yards ( 270 m ) to the left of Forbes 's position . Hidden by a patch of scrub , they remained undetected by the Company troops . 
 Wilson , Borrow and the 35 others made for Lobengula 's enclosure . The king 's wagon was still there , but when Wilson called to him , there was no answer . The king had moved on during the night . At that moment , the troopers heard the sound of rifles being cocked in the wood surrounding them . A Matabele inDuna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to " see if the white men were afraid to die . " He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men . A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed , but most of the shots went too high ; no Company trooper was hit . The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol 's horses . Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back , first to an <unk> , then to a thick wood . Three of them were wounded during this retreat , but none fatally so . 
 Hearing the shots from the northern side of the river , Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank , intending to cross and help Wilson . However , Forbes 's fears of an ambush proved to be well @-@ founded ; at an opportune moment , the Matabele in the scrub opened fire , catching the column in the open . The ambushers ' shots were initially wild and inaccurate , but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses , forcing the troopers to retreat to cover . Five Company soldiers were injured . The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour , by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream , causing it to flood . 
 Meanwhile , Wilson marched his officers and men back towards the river , hoping to reunite with Forbes . They moved on for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , but soon noticed that a line of Matabele warriors was blocking their way to the river . Wilson refused to sacrifice his wounded by attempting to break through . In an act of desperation , he instead sent three of his men — American scouts Frederick Russell Burnham and Pearl " Pete " Ingram , and Australian Trooper William Gooding — to charge through the Matabele line , cross the river and bring reinforcements back to help , while he , Borrow and the rest made a last stand . Burnham , Ingram and Gooding broke through while the Matabele closed in on the pocketed patrol from a distance , and began to fire on it from cover , killing several of its men . After a while , Mjaan ordered his men to charge forward and finish them off , but the Matabele soon fell back , having taken about 40 fatalities . 
 Burnham , Ingram and Gooding reached the Shangani about 08 : 00 , but quickly saw that the water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance . Realising the futility of turning back to Wilson without help , they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway , and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty . They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still ongoing . On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath , Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes : " I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party , " he quietly confided , before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish .

 What happened to the Shangani Patrol after this point is known only from Matabele sources . According to these accounts , the warriors offered the remaining whites their lives if they surrendered , but Wilson 's men refused to give up . They used their dead horses for cover , and killed more than ten times their own number ( about 500 , Mjaan estimated ) , but were steadily whittled down as the overwhelming Matabele force closed in from all sides . The Company soldiers continued fighting even when grievously wounded , to the astonishment of the Matabele , who thought the whites must be bewitched : " These are not men but magicians , " said one Matabele inDuna . 
 Late in the afternoon , after hours of fighting , Wilson 's men ran out of ammunition , and reacted to this by rising to their feet , shaking each other 's hands and singing a song , possibly " God Save the Queen " . The Matabele downed their own rifles and ended the battle charging with assegai spears ; some of the whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide . According to an eyewitness , " the white inDuna " ( Wilson ) was the last to die , standing motionless before the Matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body . After a few moments of hesitation , a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai . The Matabele usually mutilated the bodies of their foes after a victory , but on this occasion they did not : " The white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do the cowardly Mashonas and others , " an inDuna explained . At Mjaan 's orders , the bodies of the patrol were left untouched , though the whites ' clothes and two of their facial skins were collected the next morning to serve as proof to Lobengula of the battle 's outcome . " I had two sons killed that day , " <unk> warrior M <unk> later said , " and my brother was shot in the stomach . The <unk> [ whites ] were brave men ; they were warriors . " 
 = = Men of the Shangani Patrol = = 
 Of the 43 men involved in Wilson 's patrol ( including the major himself ) , 37 were present when the battle began . This was reduced to 34 when Wilson ordered Burnham , Ingram and Gooding to break out . Those left behind were all killed in action . Though the men of the patrol came from several parts of the British Empire as well as other countries , most were born in Britain itself : Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Hugh Marshall Hole writes that of these " over a dozen were English Public School and University men " . Wilson himself was originally Scottish , while Borrow was born in Cornwall . Also represented in the patrol were South Africa ( several members , most prominently Captain William Judd ) , the United States ( Burnham and Ingram ) , India ( Troopers Dillon and Money ) , Canada ( Scout Robert Bain ) , Australia ( Gooding ) and New Zealand ( Trooper Frank Vogel ) . No member of the patrol was born in Rhodesia .

 After the battle on the southern side of the Shangani was over , Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson 's party , but , unable to cross the river , could see nothing to tell them what had happened . Guessing ( correctly ) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed , they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion , their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn . 
 Matabele raiding parties attacked the retreating column six times during its two @-@ week journey back to Bulawayo . In pouring rain , the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot , existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets . Forbes felt so humiliated by the events that he retreated from command in all but name , surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff . In leading the column back to Bulawayo , Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo @-@ Zulu War to ensure the survival of the haggard men : he avoided several Matabele ambushes , and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day , wasting much of their ammunition . 
 On the column 's inglorious return to Bulawayo on 18 December 1893 , Forbes was received in muted disgrace . The officers and men stood on parade for Cecil Rhodes , and the Company chief passed the major without a word . Raaff , on the other hand , was publicly commended by Rhodes , and thanked for ensuring the column 's safe return . 
 Meanwhile , Lobengula moved to the north @-@ east , now well out of the Company 's reach for the foreseeable future . However , his sickness , which turned out to be smallpox , sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894 . With the king dead , Mjaan , the most senior of the izinDuna , took command of the Matabele . Mjaan was an old man , and his only son had been killed in the war . He wished to make peace . In late February 1894 , he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson , a trader known to them for many years , who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company . The izinDuna unanimously accepted . They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol , and led him to the battle site to survey it , as well as to examine and identify the largely <unk> bodies of the soldiers , which still lay where they had fallen . Dawson was the first non @-@ Matabele to learn of the last stand .

 News of the patrol 's fate was quickly relayed from Rhodesia to South Africa , and then on to the rest of the British Empire and the world . In England , a patriotic play overtly influenced by the incident , Cheer , Boys , Cheer ! , was written by Augustus Harris , Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton , and staged at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , starting in September 1895 . The show tells the story of a young colonial army officer in South Africa and Rhodesia , culminating in the third act with a fictionalised account of the First Matabele War . This itself climaxes with a scene strongly reminiscent of Wilson 's last stand . The production ran for nearly six months in London , and then toured the British provinces for more than two years , reportedly drawing large crowds . According to historian Neil Parsons , it contributed to the patrol " fast gain [ ing ] mythological status " . 
 In historical terms , the Shangani Patrol subsequently became an integral part of Rhodesian identity , with Wilson and Borrow in particular woven into the national tapestry as heroic figures symbolising duty in the face of insuperable odds . Their last stand together became a kind of national myth , as Lewis Gann writes , " a glorious memory , [ Rhodesia 's ] own equivalent of the bloody Alamo massacre and Custer 's Last Stand in the American West " . In 1895 , 4 December was declared " Shangani Day " , an annual Rhodesian public holiday which endured until 1920 , when it was folded into Occupation Day , a national non @-@ work day which commemorated several early colonial events together . Shangani Day remained part of the national calendar , however , and was still marked each year . 
 The remains of the patrol 's members were buried on 14 August 1894 , in the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe . Rhodes later wrote into his will that he wished to have the patrol re @-@ interred alongside him at World 's View , in the Matopos Hills , when he died ; this was done in 1904 , two years after Rhodes 's death . Also according to Rhodes 's wishes , a memorial to the Shangani Patrol was erected at World 's View in July 1904 , and dedicated by Bishop Gaul of Mashonaland . The monument , called the Shangani Memorial , is an oblong , flat @-@ topped structure , about 33 feet ( 10 m ) tall and made from granite from a nearby kopje . It was designed by Herbert Baker , and based on the Pedestal of Agrippa at the Athens Acropolis . Each of the memorial 's four sides bears a bronze panel by John Tweed , depicting members of the patrol in relief . The main inscription reads , " To Brave Men " , with a smaller dedication given beneath : " Erected to the enduring memory of Allan Wilson and his Men who fell in fight against the Matabele on the Shangani River December 4th , 1893 . There was no survivor " .

 = = = Lobengula 's box of sovereigns = = = 
 Soon following the end of the war , one of Lobengula 's izinDuna told Dawson that just before Forbes 's column had reached the Shangani , two Matabele messengers , Petchan and Sehuloholu , had been given a box of gold sovereigns by Lobengula , and instructed to intercept the column before it reached the river . They were to tell the whites that the king admitted defeat and offered this tribute , totalling about £ 1 @,@ 000 , on the condition that the column immediately turn back and cease harassing him . " Gold is the only thing that will stop the white men , " Lobengula reportedly concluded . According to the inDuna , Petchan and Sehuloholu reached the column on 2 December 1893 , the day before it reached the Shangani , and hid in the bush as it went by . They then caught up with it and gave the money and the message to two men in the rear guard . 
 Dawson relayed this story to Bulawayo , where Company authorities made enquiries . No man who had been attached to the column corroborated the account . The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this , however , and angrily speculated that if it were true , then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river , and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided ( though , as historian Robert Cary writes , this <unk> ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula , not end the war ) . Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894 . 
 Two officers ' batmen , William Charles Daniel and James Wilson ( no relation to Allan Wilson ) , soon became prime suspects , with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator . They were accused of accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu , then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message . Both men denied all charges . Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December , though either or both could have been there at some point during the day . No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo , where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors . 
 The evidence against the batmen was largely circumstantial : both had been seen to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column 's return , and both had since bought farming rights , paying cash . Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards , while Wilson claimed to have brought his with him when he came to Rhodesia . Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp , in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part , both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns . Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele , but neither of the accused men knew the language , and the only member of the column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard . The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met , pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic , and did not imply a profound understanding of the language . 
 Unable to definitely prove to the court where their money had come from , Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty , and sentenced to 14 years ' hard labour . However , the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months , and in 1896 they were released at the order of the High Commissioner for Southern Africa , Sir Henry Brougham Loch . The High Commissioner 's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether , saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive . The existence of Lobengula 's box of sovereigns was never proven either way , and the incident never explained beyond doubt . 
 = = = Burnham , Ingram and Gooding = = = 
 The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham , Ingram and Gooding , the Matabele present at the battle ( particularly inDuna Mjaan ) , and the men of Forbes 's column . Burnham , Ingram and Gooding 's stories closely corroborate each other ; their version of events was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893 . First @-@ hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan 's , which were first recorded during 1894 , appear to confirm the character of the break @-@ out , saying that three of the white men they were fighting — including Burnham , whom several of them recognised — left during a lull in the battle , just after Wilson withdrew to his final position . 
 While all of the direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry , some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham , Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help , and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough . Proponents of this desertion theory frequently portray Burnham as a man who embellished facts and coerced eyewitnesses into falsifying statements . The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan , a cousin of Southern Rhodesia 's first Prime Minister , Charles Coghlan . John Coghlan wrote to a friend , John Carruthers , on 14 December that year that " a very reliable man informed me that <unk> @-@ Sampson told him " that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed ( in 1899 ) that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson , and had simply left on their own accord . This double hearsay confession , coming from an anonymous source , is not mentioned in Gooding 's 1899 obituary , which instead recounts the events as generally recorded . 
 Peter Emmerson , a historian and supporter of the desertion theory , asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment . J P Lott , another historian , comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night , when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men ; he surmises that it would not be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again . In his evaluation John O 'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans ; surely Burnham and Ingram , both seasoned scouts , were enough ? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes , and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him . The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram , and Borrow asked Gooding to go too . Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding . 
 Burnham , Ingram and Gooding each received the British South Africa Company Medal for their service in the First Matabele War , and all three subsequently served in the Second Matabele War of 1896 – 97 . All of the officers and troopers of Forbes ' column reported high praise for Burnham 's actions and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later . One member of the column , Trooper M E Weale , told the Rhodesia Herald on 22 December 1944 that once Commandant Raaff took over command it was greatly due to Burnham 's good scouting that the column managed to get away : " I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men , to whom we owed our lives on that occasion . " Burnham proceeded to become a key figure for a number of commanding officers , including Frederick Carrington , Robert Baden @-@ Powell , and Frederick Roberts . Carrington called him " the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa . He was my Chief of Scouts in ' 96 in Matabeleland and he was the eyes and ears of my force " . The US President Theodore Roosevelt described him in 1901 as " a scout and a hunter of courage and ability , a man totally without fear , a sure shot , and a fighter ... the ideal scout . " While fighting with the British Army in the Second Boer War , Burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order , then Britain 's second highest military honour .

 The last stand of the patrol was re @-@ enacted once more at the 1899 Greater Britain Exhibition in London , during which scenes from the Matabele wars were re @-@ created as part of a play called Savage South Africa : A Vivid , Realistic and Picturesque Representation of Life in the Wilds of Africa , culminating in " Major Wilson 's Last Stand " . The show featured Lobengula 's son , Peter Lobengula — described as " Prince Lobengula , the redoubtable warrior chieftain " . A short war film based the show 's version of the final engagement , Major Wilson 's Last Stand , was released by Levi , Jones & Company studios in 1899 . A song about the events , " Shangani Patrol " , was written by the Rhodesian singer @-@ songwriter John Edmond , and first recorded by the South African singer Nick Taylor in 1966 as the B @-@ side for another Edmond composition , " The UDI Song " , about Rhodesia 's 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence . The patriotic record topped the Rhodesian hit parade for four weeks . A historical war film , also called Shangani Patrol , was filmed on location and released in 1970 . The author Alexander Fullerton wrote a novel about the patrol 's last stand , entitled The White Men Sang ( 1958 ) . 
 Though much of the mythology surrounding the patrol and the site has dissipated in the national consciousness since the country 's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980 , World 's View endures as a tourist attraction to this day . A campaign in the 1990s to dismantle the monument and remove the graves met with strong opposition from both local residents and the Department of National Museums and Monuments , partly because of the income it brings from visitors , and partly out of respect for the site and the history surrounding it .

It was the first playoff series win for the franchise . In the second round of the playoffs , the Braves and Boston Celtics would once again battle . After four games , the series was even at two wins each . Once again the Celtics would take the series in six games . 
 The season was marked in controversy . Ernie DiGregorio was benched and McAdoo was suspended . Following the season the Braves allowed coach Jack Ramsay to depart for the head coaching job with the Portland Trail Blazers . The team did not resign its auditorium lease and went through the season without a contract . Subsequently the team was sold , the city sued and the sale was not consummated .

 Coach Ramsay had been hired in 1972 to a three @-@ year contract . He served the 1975 – 76 season on a one @-@ year extension . His contract was not renewed . Ramsay had guided the Braves to the playoffs three years in a row after enduring a 21 – 61 season , accumulating a 158 – 170 overall record . Local reports noted a personality conflict with owner Snyder . The Braves promoted assistant coach <unk> Locke and signed him to a two @-@ year contract . 
 Snyder threatened to sell the Braves if they did not sell 5 @,@ 000 season tickets by June 12 , 1976 . However the season ticket drive by the Chamber of Commerce and other civic groups only resulted in 2 @,@ 552 sales by the deadline date . In June 1976 , Diplomat Hotel owner Irving Cowan obtained an option to purchase the Braves for $ 6 @.@ 1 million , and planned to bring them to South Florida and the Hollywood <unk> . Pledges of more than 8 @,@ 000 season tickets were received in Florida . On June 15 , Snyder announced the planned sale . The Wall Street Journal estimated the sale price to be in the $ 7 – 8 million range . However , the next day the city of Buffalo sued the Braves for breach of contract and sought a restraining order preventing the move . The suit was filed in New York Supreme Court for seeking $ 10 million from the Braves and the NBA for breaking a promise to sign a new 15 @-@ year lease . Another suit was filed as an anti @-@ trust case in United States district court against the rest of the NBA seeking $ 48 million in damages in the event of a move . The anti @-@ trust case alleged that the move was an attempt to eliminate competition against a future Toronto NBA franchise and to discourage expansion of the American Basketball Association to southern Florida . The damages arose as treble damages related to a March 1 promise to sign a lease . Although Cowan claimed the move would still take place , the effort collapsed under the weight of the lawsuit and the Braves ended up signing a new lease with the city of Buffalo . In July , the Braves signed a new lease with the city for the Memorial Auditorium with the understanding that there was an ongoing effort to sell the team to local interests . The signing of the lease settled the lawsuits .

 = Germany women 's national football team = 
 The Germany women 's national football team ( German : Deutsche <unk> der Frauen ) represents Germany in international women 's association football and is governed by the German Football Association ( DFB ) . 
 The German national team is one of the most successful in women 's football . They are two @-@ time world champions , having won the 2003 and 2007 tournaments . They are also the only nation to have won both the men 's and women 's tournament . The team has won eight of the eleven UEFA European Championships , claiming the last six consecutive titles . Again , being the only nation to win both the men 's and women 's European tournament . Germany has won three bronze medals at the Women 's Olympic Football Tournament , finishing third in 2000 , 2004 and 2008 . Birgit Prinz holds the record for most appearances and is the team 's all @-@ time leading goalscorer . Prinz has also set international records ; she has received the FIFA World Player of the Year award three times and is the joint second overall top goalscorer at the Women 's World Cup . 
 Women 's football was long met with skepticism in Germany , and official matches were banned by the DFB until 1970 . However , the women 's national team has grown in popularity since winning the World Cup in 2003 , as it was chosen as Germany 's Sports Team of the Year . Silvia Neid has been the team 's head coach since 2005 , succeeding Tina Theune after nine years as her assistant . As of July 2015 , Germany is ranked No. 2 in the FIFA Women 's World Rankings . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 In 1955 , the DFB decided to forbid women 's football in all its clubs in West Germany . In its explanation , the DFB cited that " this combative sport is fundamentally foreign to the nature of women " and that " body and soul would inevitably suffer damage " . Further , the " display of the body violates etiquette and decency " . In spite of this ban , more than 150 unofficial international matches were played in the 1950s and 1960s . On 30 October 1970 , the ban on women 's football was lifted at the DFB annual convention . 
 Other football associations had already formed official women 's national teams in the 1970s , the DFB long remained uninvolved in women 's football . In 1981 , DFB official Horst R. Schmidt was invited to send a team to the unofficial women 's football world championship . Schmidt accepted the invitation but hid the fact that West Germany had no women 's national team at the time . To avoid humiliation , the DFB sent the German club champions <unk> Gladbach 09 , who went on to win the tournament . Seeing a need , the DFB established the women 's national team in 1982 . DFB president Hermann Neuberger appointed Gero Bisanz , an instructor at the Cologne Sports College , to set up the team . 
 = = = 1982 – 1994 : Difficult beginnings and first European titles = = = 
 In September 1982 , Bisanz organised two scouting training courses from which he selected a squad of 16 players . The team 's first international match took place on 10 November 1982 in Koblenz . Following the tradition of the men ’ s team , Switzerland was chosen as West Germany 's first opponent . Doris <unk> scored the first international goal in the 25th minute . In the second half , 18 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Neid contributed two goals to the 5 – 1 victory ; Neid later became the assistant coach in 1996 and the head coach in 2005 . 
 With five draws and one defeat , West Germany failed to qualify for the inaugural 1984 European Championship , finishing third in the qualifying group . In the beginning , Bisanz 's primary objective was to close the gap to the Scandinavian countries and Italy – then the strongest teams in Europe . He emphasized training in basic skills and the need for an effective youth programme . Starting in 1985 , Bisanz increasingly called @-@ up younger players , but at first had little success with this concept , as West Germany again failed to qualify for the 1987 European Championship finals . 
 Undefeated and without conceding a goal , the German team qualified for the European Championship for the first time in 1989 ; the tournament was played on home soil in West Germany . The semi @-@ final against Italy was the first international women 's football match shown live on German television . The game was decided by a penalty shootout , in which goalkeeper Marion <unk> saved three penalty kicks and scored the winning penalty herself . On 2 July 1989 in Osnabrück , West Germany played Norway in the final . Before a crowd of 22 @,@ 000 , they beat favourites Norway and won 4 – 1 with goals from Ursula <unk> , Heidi Mohr and Angelika <unk> . This victory marked the team 's first international title . 
 After the German reunification , the East German football association joined the DFB . The East German women 's national football team had played only one official international match , losing 0 – 3 to Czechoslovakia in a friendly match on 9 May 1990 . The unified German team defended their title successfully at the 1991 European Championship . After winning all games in the qualifying group , Germany again met Italy in the semi @-@ final , this time winning 3 – 0 . On 14 July 1991 , the German team once more faced Norway in the final . The game went to extra time , during which Heidi Mohr and Silvia Neid scored for Germany and secured the 3 – 1 victory . 
 In November 1991 , Germany participated in the first Women 's World Cup in China . Following victories over Nigeria , Taiwan and Italy , the German team reached the quarter @-@ final without conceding a single goal . Silvia Neid scored the first German World Cup goal on 17 November 1991 against Nigeria . Germany won the quarter @-@ final against Denmark 2 – 1 after extra time , but lost 2 – 5 in the semi @-@ final to the United States , who went on to win the tournament . Following a 0 – 4 defeat in the third @-@ place match against Sweden , Germany finished fourth in the tournament . 
 The German team failed to defend their title at the 1993 European Championship , suffering a semi @-@ final defeat to Italy in a penalty shootout , and later losing 1 – 3 against Denmark in the third @-@ place playoff . Despite the disappointing result , new talents such as Steffi Jones , Maren Meinert and Silke Rottenberg made their tournament debut and later became key players for the German team .

 The German women 's national football team wears white shirts with black shorts and white socks , following the tradition of the German men 's team – black and white are the colours of Prussia . The current change kit is red and black , with black shorts and red socks . In the past , Germany also used green shirts with white shorts and green socks as the away kit . 
 The women 's national team originally played with the emblem of the German men 's team , a variation of the DFB logo with the Federal Eagle of Germany ( <unk> ) and three stars at the top for the men 's 1954 , 1974 and 1990 World Cup titles . Since their first Women 's World Cup win in 2003 , the team displays its own World Cup titles ; initially with one star , and since 2007 , with two stars at the top of the emblem . While being reigning world champions , Germany also displayed the newly created " FIFA Women 's World Champions Badge " on their shirts from 2009 until 2011 when they were succeeded by Japan . 
 In accordance with the rules of the International Olympic Committee , Germany does not wear its official uniform with the logo of the German Football Association while competing at the Summer Olympics . Instead , the DFB badge is replaced by the coat of arms of Germany . Like all DFB squads , the women 's national team is supplied by Adidas , which had provided a specifically designed female football jersey since 1999 . The team 's main sponsor is the German insurance company Allianz .

 For most of the 20th century , women 's football was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon . When the DFB appointed Gero Bisanz to coach the newly founded women 's national team , he was initially very reluctant about his assignment and feared it would harm his reputation . Winning the 1989 European Championship was the team 's first international success , but it had little lasting effect on their popularity . As a gift for the first European trophy , every player received a tea set , which is often cited as an example of male chauvinism and general lack of interest in the women 's national team at that time . This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last two decades , in particular during the term of Theo <unk> as DFB president , an outspoken supporter of women 's football . Each member of the 2003 Women 's World Cup squad received a prearranged bonus of 15 @,@ 000 euros for winning the tournament ; four years later the players received 50 @,@ 000 euros for their successful title defense . In 2009 , one million of the 6 @.@ 7 million DFB members were female . 
 The 2003 World Cup title marked the breakthrough for the women ’ s national football team in Germany . The final was watched by 10 @.@ 48 million viewers on German television ( a 33 @.@ 2 percent market share ) and the German team was welcomed home by almost 10 @,@ 000 fans at Frankfurt 's city hall . Later that year , they were honoured as the 2003 German Sports Team of the Year . Nia <unk> 's World Cup winning golden goal was voted Germany 's 2003 Goal of the Year , the first time the award was won by a female player . Since 2005 , almost all of the women ’ s national football team 's matches have been shown live on German television . 
 The final of the 2007 Women 's World Cup was seen by 9 @.@ 05 million television viewers ( a 50 @.@ 5 percent market share ) . After the team returned to Germany , they were celebrated by a crowd of 20 @,@ 000 in Frankfurt . In December 2007 , all players of the World Cup squad received the <unk> Lorbeerblatt ( Silver Laurel Leaf ) , the highest state decoration for athletes in Germany . National coach Silvia Neid was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit on ribbon by German president Horst Köhler . 
 In 2009 , the team 's six home matches had an average attendance of 22 @,@ 753 . In a survey of German football fans , 65 percent of the male and 62 percent of the female respondents said they were interested in women 's football . However , this popularity is mostly limited to international matches . Although the number of spectators in the women 's Bundesliga has more than doubled since 2003 , the average attendance in the 2007 – 08 season ( 887 ) was still less than three percent of that of the men 's Bundesliga ( 38 @,@ 612 ) . 
 Today , women 's football is socially accepted in Germany , although one of the main points of criticism remains the alleged lack of quality compared to the men ’ s game . The German women ’ s national team has played several exhibition matches against male teams , most notably losing 0 – 3 to the VfB Stuttgart Under @-@ 17 squad in preparation for the 2003 World Cup . Most German players dismiss comparisons between the quality of men 's and women 's football ; Renate Lingor has said they are " two entirely different sports " . Players such as Simone <unk> , Ariane <unk> and Melanie Behringer have stated that men ’ s football is played at a much faster pace , but also has more interruptions and brutal tackling than the women 's game . Linda <unk> has said she generally prefers to watch men 's football .

 Head coach : Silvia Neid 
 = = Records = = 
 Birgit Prinz , a former team captain who retired after the 2011 World Cup , holds the record for Germany appearances , having played 214 times from 1994 to 2011 . She is one of 16 German players to have reached 100 caps . Kerstin Stegemann is second , having played 191 times . Bettina Wiegmann , Germany 's team captain during the 2003 World Cup win , comes fourth with 154 games . Prinz exceeded Wiegmann ’ s record as the most capped player in November 2006 . Wiegmann is the only honorary captain of the German women ’ s national football team . 
 The title of Germany ’ s highest goalscorer is also held by Prinz . She scored her first goal in July 1994 against Canada and finished her career with 128 goals ( averaging 0 @.@ 60 goals per game ) . Heidi Mohr , as well as being the second @-@ highest scorer , is also the most prolific with 83 goals coming from 104 games ( averaging 0 @.@ 80 goals per game ) . Two players share the record for goals scored in one match : Conny <unk> scored five goals in October 2001 against Portugal , and Inka Grings scored five times in February 2004 , again facing Portugal . Silvia Neid , the current German national coach , is the fifth highest goalscorer with 48 goals in 111 games . 
 The largest margin of victory achieved by Germany is 17 – 0 against Kazakhstan during a European Championship qualifying game in November 2011 . The record defeat , a 0 – 6 deficit against the United States , occurred during a friendly match in March 1996 . 
 Silke Rottenberg has the most appearances for a goalkeeper with 126 caps and 67 games without conceding a goal . Current goalkeeper Nadine Angerer is second , with 124 games ( 80 without conceding a goal ) . Bettina Wiegmann holds the record of 14 goals from penalty kicks ; Renate Lingor comes in second with 8 goals . Tina Wunderlich scored the team 's only own goal in the semi @-@ final of the 2000 Summer Olympics against Norway ; it was the game 's only goal . 
 The German team also holds several international records . In 2007 , they were the first to win two consecutive Women 's World Cup titles and they achieved the biggest win in tournament history by beating Argentina 11 – 0 . Germany is also the only team to win either the men 's or women 's World Cup without conceding a goal and the only country to win both World Cups . With 14 goals , Prinz became the overall top goalscorer at the Women 's World Cup in 2007 , and she and Brazilian Marta are the only women to have received the FIFA World Player of the Year award at least three times .

 = New Don Pedro Dam = 
 New Don Pedro Dam , often known simply as Don Pedro Dam , is an earthen embankment dam across the Tuolumne River , about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) northeast of La Grange , in Tuolumne County , California . The dam was completed in 1971 , after four years of construction , to replace the 1924 concrete @-@ arch Don Pedro Dam . 
 The dam serves mainly for irrigation water storage , flood control and hydroelectricity production , and impounds Don Pedro Reservoir in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada . 
 The New Don Pedro Dam is owned and operated by the Modesto Irrigation District ( MID ) and Turlock Irrigation District ( TID ) . At 585 feet ( 178 m ) tall , the dam is the tenth highest in the U.S. and its reservoir is the sixth largest artificial lake in California . 
 The original dam was named for the old mining town of Don <unk> Bar on the Tuolumne River , which in turn takes its name from prospector Pierre " Don Pedro " <unk> . 
 = = Background = = 
 Shortly after their formation in 1887 , the MID and TID acquired water rights to the Tuolumne River to secure a water supply for their combined 1 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 600 km2 ) service area in the San Joaquin Valley . After selling revenue bonds totaling $ 4 @.@ 1 million , the two irrigation districts began construction of the Don Pedro Dam ( now known as Old Don Pedro Dam ) in 1921 , about one and a half miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) upriver of the present location of New Don Pedro Dam . Upon its completion in 1923 , this 284 @-@ foot ( 87 m ) concrete gravity arch dam was the highest dam in the world , forming a 289 @,@ 000 @-@ acre @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 356 km3 ) reservoir with a surface area of 3 @,@ 086 acres ( 1 @,@ 249 ha ) . The dam 's 15 megawatt ( MW ) hydroelectric plant , later expanded to 37 @.@ 5 MW , delivered its first power in October 1923 . 
 Expanding Don Pedro or constructing a new dam altogether was first seriously considered in the 1940s because the existing dam could only store a year 's supply of water for valley farmers , with no guarantee that a multiyear drought could be weathered . An enlarged Don Pedro would provide a " bank " of water storage for prolonged droughts , capture more spring runoff , and provide increased flood control . Another proponent of a high dam was the city of San Francisco , which also sought a share of the Tuolumne 's water and decided to cooperate with the irrigation districts to construct the new dam . The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation made tentative studies for a high dam on the Tuolumne River as part of its Central Valley Project , though it later dropped the plans in favor of other sites . 
 = = Construction = = 
 In 1961 , an overwhelming majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance the construction of a new dam . The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966 , but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project . In fact , it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission ( now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro . 
 The $ 49 @.@ 7 million primary construction contract for the dam was awarded to Guy F. Atkinson Company on August 22 , 1967 . When he first saw the dam site , chief engineer John Goodier was reported to have said " [ it 'd be a ] tough nut to crack " . Clearing the dam site began immediately afterwards , in addition to the construction of access roads and a camp for construction workers . Construction of the dam 's service spillway began a week later on August 29 . On September 22 , 1967 , work began on the diversion tunnel that would allow the river to bypass the construction site . The 3 @,@ 415 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 041 m ) tunnel was fully excavated by March 13 of the following year and lined with reinforced concrete by August . On September 7 , a 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) cofferdam was constructed and the diversion tunnel began to carry the flow of the Tuolumne . As the dam site dried out , the foundations were excavated down to bedrock ; cracks in the rock were injected with so @-@ called " dental concrete " to stabilize the foundation . 
 Construction of the embankment began on September 16 , 1968 using the hydraulic fill method . The dam 's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19 , 1969 . However , severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam and all of the construction site 's bridges , putting work a month behind schedule . Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam 's core commenced on February 27 . For the next fifteen months , a fleet of massive 125 @-@ ton ( 113 t ) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site , and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) per day . The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid @-@ 1969 and on December 10 , the service spillway was completed . On May 28 , 1970 , the embankment was finally topped out with the last of over 250 @,@ 000 truckloads of material . 
 After the clearing of over 7 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 800 ha ) of the future reservoir site and the relocation of several roads that ran through it , the diversion tunnel was closed and water began to rise behind New Don Pedro . The rising lake submerged Old Don Pedro Dam on April 12 , 1970 and inundated the Gold Rush town of Jacksonville by June . The powerhouse and penstocks were completed by August 1970 , after lengthy delays and setbacks due to the sheer scale of the generators , pipes and gates used in their construction . Some of the individual components were so heavy that a truck delivering one of the penstock sections sank up to its trailer bed in the road , and another was crushed when the driver braked , inadvertently snapping the chains that held the load in place . 
 The total cost of the New Don Pedro Dam project , including site preparations , reservoir clearing and road relocations , was $ 115 @,@ 679 @,@ 000 . The dam was formally dedicated on May 22 , 1971 to a crowd of over 3 @,@ 000 people . Among the dedication ceremonies were a speech by San Francisco mayor Joseph Alioto and a beef barbecue hosted by TID . 
 = = Design and usage = = 
 Rising 585 feet ( 178 m ) above its foundations and 560 feet ( 170 m ) above the Tuolumne River , New Don Pedro is a massive earth and rock fill structure containing 16 @,@ 750 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 12 @,@ 810 @,@ 000 m3 ) of material . The 1 @,@ 900 @-@ foot ( 580 m ) long dam is 40 feet ( 12 m ) wide at the crest and over 2 @,@ 800 feet ( 850 m ) wide at the base . High water releases are controlled by four sets of gates . A set of internal gates in the diversion tunnel can release up to 7 @,@ 370 cubic feet per second ( 209 m3 / s ) , while a hollow jet valve at the base of the dam can discharge 3 @,@ 100 cubic feet per second ( 88 m3 / s ) . The service spillway , controlled by three 45 @-@ by @-@ 30 @-@ foot ( 13 @.@ 7 m × 9 @.@ 1 m ) radial gates , has a capacity of 172 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 4 @,@ 900 m3 / s ) , and finally the emergency spillway , a 995 @-@ foot ( 303 m ) long concrete overflow structure , can discharge more than 300 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 8 @,@ 500 m3 / s ) . 
 The hydroelectric plant at the base of the dam has four generators capable of producing 203 MW combined . The TID 's share is 139 MW or 68 @.@ 47 % , while MID receives 64 MW or 31 @.@ 53 % . Three generators , each with a capacity of 55 MW , were included in the original design of the dam while an additional 38 MW generator was incorporated in 1989 . The plant generates an average of 618 @.@ 4 million kilowatt hours ( KWh ) of electricity each year , equal to an average output of 70 @.@ 6 MW . The cities of Modesto and Turlock receive a large share of their power supplies from New Don Pedro Dam . 
 Don Pedro Reservoir has a capacity of 2 @,@ 030 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 2 @.@ 50 km3 ) , of which 340 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 0 @.@ 42 km3 ) is reserved for flood control and 1 @,@ 381 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 1 @.@ 703 km3 ) is available for irrigation , municipal water supply , and hydroelectric generation . The flood control reservation is one of the smallest among major California reservoirs because it allows for more water to be stored for power generation , but this has often resulted in inadequate flood protection such as in 1997 when the dam released more than 50 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 1 @,@ 400 m3 / s ) – almost six times the capacity of downstream levees . The bottom 309 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 0 @.@ 381 km3 ) is considered dead storage , or the lowest point at which water can be released to generate power . At an elevation of 804 feet ( 245 m ) ( service spillway crest ) , the reservoir is 25 miles ( 40 km ) long , and has an area of 12 @,@ 960 acres ( 5 @,@ 240 ha ) with 160 miles ( 260 km ) of shoreline . The maximum elevation of the reservoir at the crest of the emergency spillway is 830 feet ( 250 m ) above sea level . 
 During construction of the dam , it was anticipated that the large size and scenic location of the reservoir , coupled with its proximity to urban centers , would make it a large tourist draw . A $ 40 @,@ 000 plan was put forth to develop the reservoir for recreational activities . This entailed the construction of campsites , picnic areas , boat ramps , a landing strip , and hiking trails , including on 14 of the 33 islands in the lake . Don Pedro has become a popular summer destination in Central California , attracting 360 @,@ 000 – 400 @,@ 000 visitors each year . 
 = = Future development = = 
 In 1923 , the same year that Old Don Pedro was completed , the City of San Francisco finished construction of O 'Shaughnessy Dam , which forms a reservoir in the upper Tuolumne River 's Hetch Hetchy Valley and is the focus of one of the most longstanding environmental controversies in United States history . Proponents of the dam 's removal , including former Sierra Club president David Brower , suggest raising New Don Pedro Dam to replace the storage that would be lost with the draining of Hetch Hetchy . Increasing the height of New Don Pedro by just 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) would add about 360 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 0 @.@ 44 km3 ) to the reservoir 's storage capacity , replacing most of the storage in Hetch Hetchy , though new tunnels would have to be built to deliver water from Don Pedro Reservoir to the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct and there would be a net loss of hydroelectric generation from O 'Shaughnessy . Of note is that San Francisco is already entitled to 453 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 0 @.@ 559 km3 ) of the water stored in Don Pedro , although this allocation is overruled by the senior water rights of the irrigation districts during dry years . 
 TID is currently investigating the feasibility of constructing a large pumped @-@ storage hydroelectric plant on Lake Don Pedro in order to better meet peaking power demands without releasing extra water at New Don Pedro Dam . The proposed Red Mountain Bar Project would involve building a 465 @-@ foot ( 142 m ) high dam across a canyon adjacent to Lake Don Pedro , creating a reservoir with a capacity of 25 @,@ 000 to 42 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 0 @.@ 031 to 0 @.@ 052 km3 ) . Water would be pumped into this new reservoir using power generated at New Don Pedro Dam during periods of low electricity demand , while during high demand water would be released through a penstock to an 880 MW generating facility . As of September 2011 , poor economic conditions had put the project " on hold indefinitely " . 
 = Walt Whitman = 
 Walter " Walt " Whitman ( / <unk> / ; May 31 , 1819 – March 26 , 1892 ) was an American poet , essayist , and journalist . A humanist , he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism , incorporating both views in his works . Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon , often called the father of free verse . His work was very controversial in its time , particularly his poetry collection Leaves of Grass , which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality . 
 Born in Huntington on Long Island , Whitman worked as a journalist , a teacher , a government clerk , and — in addition to publishing his poetry — was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War . Early in his career , he also produced a temperance novel , Franklin Evans ( 1842 ) . Whitman 's major work , Leaves of Grass , was first published in 1855 with his own money . The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic . He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892 . After a stroke towards the end of his life , he moved to Camden , New Jersey , where his health further declined . When he died at age 72 , his funeral became a public spectacle .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Walter Whitman was born on May 31 , 1819 , in West Hills , Town of Huntington , Long Island , to parents with interests in Quaker thought , Walter and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman . The second of nine children , he was immediately nicknamed " Walt " to distinguish him from his father . Walter Whitman , Sr. named three of his seven sons after American leaders : Andrew Jackson , George Washington , and Thomas Jefferson . The oldest was named Jesse and another boy died unnamed at the age of six months . The couple 's sixth son , the youngest , was named Edward . At age four , Whitman moved with his family from West Hills to Brooklyn , living in a series of homes , in part due to bad investments . Whitman looked back on his childhood as generally restless and unhappy , given his family 's difficult economic status . One happy moment that he later recalled was when he was lifted in the air and kissed on the cheek by the Marquis de Lafayette during a celebration in Brooklyn on July 4 , 1825 . 
 At age eleven Whitman concluded formal schooling . He then sought employment for further income for his family ; he was an office boy for two lawyers and later was an apprentice and printer 's devil for the weekly Long Island newspaper the Patriot , edited by Samuel E. Clements . There , Whitman learned about the printing press and typesetting . He may have written " sentimental bits " of filler material for occasional issues . Clements aroused controversy when he and two friends attempted to dig up the corpse of Elias Hicks to create a plaster mold of his head . Clements left the Patriot shortly afterward , possibly as a result of the controversy . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 The following summer Whitman worked for another printer , Erastus Worthington , in Brooklyn . His family moved back to West Hills in the spring , but Whitman remained and took a job at the shop of Alden Spooner , editor of the leading Whig weekly newspaper the Long @-@ Island Star . While at the Star , Whitman became a regular patron of the local library , joined a town debating society , began attending theater performances , and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the New York Mirror . At age 16 in May 1835 , Whitman left the Star and Brooklyn . He moved to New York City to work as a compositor though , in later years , Whitman could not remember where . He attempted to find further work but had difficulty , in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district , and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the Panic of 1837 . In May 1836 , he rejoined his family , now living in Hempstead , Long Island . Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838 , though he was not satisfied as a teacher . 
 After his teaching attempts , Whitman went back to Huntington , New York to found his own newspaper , the Long Islander . Whitman served as publisher , editor , pressman , and distributor and even provided home delivery . After ten months , he sold the publication to E. O. Crowell , whose first issue appeared on July 12 , 1839 . There are no known surviving copies of the Long @-@ Islander published under Whitman . By the summer of 1839 , he found a job as a typesetter in Jamaica , Queens with the Long Island Democrat , edited by James J. Brenton . He left shortly thereafter , and made another attempt at teaching from the winter of 1840 to the spring of 1841 . One story , possibly apocryphal , tells of Whitman 's being chased away from a teaching job in Southold , New York in 1840 . After a local preacher called him a " <unk> " , Whitman was allegedly tarred and feathered . Biographer Justin Kaplan notes that the story is likely untrue , because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter . Biographer Jerome Loving calls the incident a " myth " . During this time , Whitman published a series of ten editorials , called " Sun @-@ Down Papers — From the Desk of a Schoolmaster " , in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841 . In these essays , he adopted a constructed persona , a technique he would employ throughout his career . 
 Whitman moved to New York City in May , initially working a low @-@ level job at the New World , working under Park Benjamin , Sr. and Rufus Wilmot Griswold . He continued working for short periods of time for various newspapers ; in 1842 he was editor of the Aurora and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the Brooklyn Eagle . 
 He also contributed freelance fiction and poetry throughout the 1840s . Whitman lost his position at the Brooklyn Eagle in 1848 after siding with the free @-@ soil " <unk> " wing of the Democratic party against the newspaper 's owner , Isaac Van Anden , who belonged to the conservative , or " <unk> " , wing of the party . Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the Free Soil Party . 
 In 1858 , Whitman published a 47 @,@ 000 word series called Manly Health and Training under the pen name Mose Velsor . Apparently he drew the name Velsor from Van Velsor , his mother 's family name . This self @-@ help guide recommends beards , nude sunbathing , comfortable shoes , bathing daily in cold water , eating meat almost exclusively , plenty of fresh air , and getting up early each morning . Present @-@ day writers have called Manly Health and Training " quirky " , " so over the top " , " a pseudoscientific tract " , and " wacky " .

 Whitman claimed that after years of competing for " the usual rewards " , he determined to become a poet . He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres which appealed to the cultural tastes of the period . As early as 1850 , he began writing what would become Leaves of Grass , a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death . Whitman intended to write a distinctly American epic and used free verse with a cadence based on the Bible . At the end of June 1855 , Whitman surprised his brothers with the already @-@ printed first edition of Leaves of Grass . George " didn 't think it worth reading " . 
 Whitman paid for the publication of the first edition of Leaves of Grass himself and had it printed at a local print shop during their breaks from commercial jobs . A total of 795 copies were printed . No name is given as author ; instead , facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel <unk> , but 500 lines into the body of the text he calls himself " Walt Whitman , an American , one of the roughs , a <unk> , disorderly , fleshly , and sensual , no sentimentalist , no <unk> above men or women or apart from them , no more modest than immodest " . The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines . The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled <unk> lines — 1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem , later called " Song of Myself " . The book received its strongest praise from Ralph Waldo Emerson , who wrote a flattering five @-@ page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends . The first edition of Leaves of Grass was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest , in part due to Emerson 's approval , but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly " obscene " nature of the poetry . Geologist John Peter Lesley wrote to Emerson , calling the book " trashy , profane & obscene " and the author " a pretentious ass " . On July 11 , 1855 , a few days after Leaves of Grass was published , Whitman 's father died at the age of 65 . 
 In the months following the first edition of Leaves of Grass , critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes . Though the second edition was already printed and bound , the publisher almost did not release it . In the end , the edition went to retail , with 20 additional poems , in August 1856 . Leaves of Grass was revised and re @-@ released in 1860 again in 1867 , and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman 's life . Several well @-@ known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman , including Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau . 
 During the first publications of Leaves of Grass , Whitman had financial difficulties and was forced to work as a journalist again , specifically with Brooklyn 's Daily Times starting in May 1857 . As an editor , he oversaw the paper 's contents , contributed book reviews , and wrote editorials . He left the job in 1859 , though it is unclear if he was fired or chose to leave . Whitman , who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals , left very little information about himself in the late 1850s . 
 = = = Civil War years = = = 
 As the American Civil War was beginning , Whitman published his poem " Beat ! Beat ! Drums ! " as a patriotic rally call for the North . Whitman 's brother George had joined the Union army and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front . On December 16 , 1862 , a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the New York Tribune included " First Lieutenant G. W. Whitmore " , which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George . He made his way south immediately to find him , though his wallet was stolen on the way . " Walking all day and night , unable to ride , trying to get information , trying to get access to big people " , Whitman later wrote , he eventually found George alive , with only a superficial wound on his cheek . Whitman , profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs , left for Washington on December 28 , 1862 with the intention of never returning to New York . 
 In Washington , D.C. , Whitman 's friend Charley Eldridge helped him obtain part @-@ time work in the army paymaster 's office , leaving time for Whitman to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals . He would write of this experience in " The Great Army of the Sick " , published in a New York newspaper in 1863 and , 12 years later , in a book called Memoranda During the War . He then contacted Emerson , this time to ask for help in obtaining a government post . Another friend , John Trowbridge , passed on a letter of recommendation from Emerson to Salmon P. Chase , Secretary of the Treasury , hoping he would grant Whitman a position in that department . Chase , however , did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as Leaves of Grass . 
 The Whitman family had a difficult end to 1864 . On September 30 , 1864 , Whitman 's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia , and another brother , Andrew Jackson , died of tuberculosis compounded by alcoholism on December 3 . That month , Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum . Whitman 's spirits were raised , however , when he finally got a better @-@ paying government post as a low @-@ grade clerk in the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior , thanks to his friend William Douglas O 'Connor . O 'Connor , a poet , <unk> and an editor at the Saturday Evening Post , had written to William Tod Otto , Assistant Secretary of the Interior , on Whitman 's behalf . Whitman began the new appointment on January 24 , 1865 , with a yearly salary of $ 1 @,@ 200 . A month later , on February 24 , 1865 , George was released from capture and granted a furlough because of his poor health . By May 1 , Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship and published Drum @-@ Taps . 
 Effective June 30 , 1865 , however , Whitman was fired from his job . His dismissal came from the new Secretary of the Interior , former Iowa Senator James Harlan . Though Harlan dismissed several clerks who " were seldom at their respective desks " , he may have fired Whitman on moral grounds after finding an 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass . O 'Connor protested until J. Hubley Ashton had Whitman transferred to the Attorney General 's office on July 1 . O 'Connor , though , was still upset and vindicated Whitman by publishing a biased and exaggerated biographical study , The Good Gray Poet , in January 1866 . The fifty @-@ cent pamphlet defended Whitman as a wholesome patriot , established the poet 's nickname and increased his popularity . Also aiding in his popularity was the publication of " O Captain ! My Captain ! " , a relatively conventional poem on the death of Abraham Lincoln , the only poem to appear in anthologies during Whitman 's lifetime . 
 Part of Whitman 's role at the Attorney General 's office was interviewing former Confederate soldiers for Presidential pardons . " There are real characters among them " , he later wrote , " and you know I have a fancy for anything out of the ordinary . " In August 1866 , he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of Leaves of Grass which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher . He hoped it would be its last edition . In February 1868 , Poems of Walt Whitman was published in England thanks to the influence of William Michael Rossetti , with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved . The edition became popular in England , especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer Anne Gilchrist . Another edition of Leaves of Grass was issued in 1871 , the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident . As Whitman 's international fame increased , he remained at the attorney general 's office until January 1872 . He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother who was now nearly eighty and struggling with arthritis . He also traveled and was invited to Dartmouth College to give the commencement address on June 26 , 1872 . 
 = = = Health decline and death = = = 
 After suffering a paralytic stroke in early 1873 , Whitman was induced to move from Washington to the home of his brother — George Washington Whitman , an engineer — at 431 Stevens Street in Camden , New Jersey . His mother , having fallen ill , was also there and died that same year in May . Both events were difficult for Whitman and left him depressed . He remained at his brother 's home until buying his own in 1884 . However , before purchasing his home , he spent the greatest period of his residence in Camden at his brother 's home in Stevens Street . While in residence there he was very productive , publishing three versions of Leaves of Grass among other works . He was also last fully physically active in this house , receiving both Oscar Wilde and Thomas Eakins . His other brother , Edward , an " invalid " since birth , lived in the house . 
 When his brother and sister @-@ in @-@ law were forced to move for business reasons , he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street ( now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . Boulevard ) . First taken care of by tenants , he was completely bedridden for most of his time in Mickle Street . During this time , he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis — the widow of a sea captain . She was a neighbor , boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street . She moved in with Whitman on February 24 , 1885 , to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent . She brought with her a cat , a dog , two <unk> , a canary , and other assorted animals . During this time , Whitman produced further editions of Leaves of Grass in 1876 , 1881 , and 1889 . 
 While in Southern New Jersey Whitman spent a good portion of his time in the then quite pastoral community of Laurel Springs between 1876 and 1884 , converting one of the Stafford Farm buildings to his summer home . The restored summer home has been preserved as museum by the local historical society . Part of his Leaves of Grass was written here , and in his Specimen Days he wrote of the spring , creek and lake . To him , Laurel Lake was " the prettiest lake in : either America or Europe . " 
 As the end of 1891 approached , he prepared a final edition of Leaves of Grass , a version that has been nicknamed the " <unk> Edition . " He wrote , " L. of G. at last complete — after 33 y 'rs of <unk> at it , all times & moods of my life , fair weather & foul , all parts of the land , and peace & war , young & old . " Preparing for death , Whitman commissioned a granite mausoleum shaped like a house for $ 4 @,@ 000 and visited it often during construction . In the last week of his life , he was too weak to lift a knife or fork and wrote : " I suffer all the time : I have no relief , no escape : it is monotony — monotony — monotony — in pain . " 
 Whitman died on March 26 , 1892 . An autopsy revealed his lungs had diminished to one @-@ eighth their normal breathing capacity , a result of bronchial pneumonia , and that an egg @-@ sized abscess on his chest had eroded one of his ribs . The cause of death was officially listed as " pleurisy of the left side , consumption of the right lung , general miliary tuberculosis and <unk> nephritis . " A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home ; over one thousand people visited in three hours . Whitman 's oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him . Four days after his death , he was buried in his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden . Another public ceremony was held at the cemetery , with friends giving speeches , live music , and refreshments . Whitman 's friend , the orator Robert Ingersoll , delivered the eulogy . Later , the remains of Whitman 's parents and two of his brothers and their families were moved to the mausoleum . 
 = = Writing = = 
 Whitman 's work breaks the boundaries of poetic form and is generally prose @-@ like . He also used unusual images and symbols in his poetry , including rotting leaves , tufts of straw , and debris . He also openly wrote about death and sexuality , including prostitution . He is often labeled as the father of free verse , though he did not invent it . 
 = = = Poetic theory = = = 
 Whitman wrote in the preface to the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass , " The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it . " He believed there was a vital , symbiotic relationship between the poet and society . This connection was emphasized especially in " Song of Myself " by using an all @-@ powerful first @-@ person narration . As an American epic , it deviated from the historic use of an elevated hero and instead assumed the identity of the common people . Leaves of Grass also responded to the impact that recent urbanization in the United States had on the masses . 
 = = Lifestyle and beliefs = = 
 = = = Alcohol = = = 
 Whitman was a vocal proponent of temperance and in his youth rarely drank alcohol . He once stated he did not taste " strong liquor " until he was thirty and occasionally argued for prohibition . One of his earliest long fiction works , the novel Franklin Evans ; or , The Inebriate , first published November 23 , 1842 , is a temperance novel . Whitman wrote the novel at the height of popularity of the Washingtonian movement though the movement itself was plagued with contradictions , as was Franklin Evans . Years later Whitman claimed he was embarrassed by the book and called it a " damned rot " . He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while he was under the influence of alcohol himself . Even so , he wrote other pieces recommending temperance , including The Madman and a short story " Reuben 's Last Wish " . Later in life he was more liberal with alcohol , enjoying local wines and champagne . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Whitman was deeply influenced by deism . He denied any one faith was more important than another , and embraced all religions equally . In " Song of Myself " , he gave an inventory of major religions and indicated he respected and accepted all of them — a sentiment he further emphasized in his poem " With Antecedents " , affirming : " I adopt each theory , myth , god , and demi @-@ god , / I see that the old accounts , bibles , genealogies , are true , without exception " . In 1874 , he was invited to write a poem about the Spiritualism movement , to which he responded , " It seems to me nearly altogether a poor , cheap , crude humbug . " Whitman was a religious skeptic : though he accepted all churches , he believed in none . God , to Whitman , was both immanent and transcendent and the human soul was immortal and in a state of progressive development . American Philosophy : An Encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who " took a more pantheist or <unk> approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world . " 
 = = = Sexuality = = = 
 Though biographers continue to debate his sexuality , he is usually described as either homosexual or bisexual in his feelings and attractions . However , there is disagreement among biographers as to whether Whitman had actual sexual experiences with men . Whitman 's sexual orientation is generally assumed on the basis of his poetry , though this assumption has been disputed . His poetry depicts love and sexuality in a more earthy , individualistic way common in American culture before the medicalization of sexuality in the late 19th century . Though Leaves of Grass was often labeled pornographic or obscene , only one critic remarked on its author 's presumed sexual activity : in a November 1855 review , Rufus Wilmot Griswold suggested Whitman was guilty of " that horrible sin not to be mentioned among Christians . " Whitman had intense friendships with many men and boys throughout his life . Some biographers have suggested that he may not have actually engaged in sexual relationships with males , while others cite letters , journal entries , and other sources that they claim as proof of the sexual nature of some of his relationships . English poet and critic John Addington Symonds spent twenty years in correspondence trying to pry the answer from him . In 1890 he wrote to Whitman , " In your conception of <unk> , do you contemplate the possible intrusion of those semi @-@ sexual emotions and actions which no doubt do occur between men ? " In reply , Whitman denied that his work had any such implication , asserting " [ T ] hat the calamus part has even allow 'd the possibility of such construction as mention 'd is terrible — I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be even mention 'd for such gratuitous and quite at this time entirely <unk> 'd & <unk> 'd possibility of morbid inferences — wh ' are disavow 'd by me and seem damnable , " and insisting that he had fathered six illegitimate children . Some contemporary scholars are skeptical of the veracity of Whitman 's denial or the existence of the children he claimed . 
 Peter Doyle may be the most likely candidate for the love of Whitman 's life . Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866 , and the two were inseparable for several years . Interviewed in 1895 , Doyle said : " We were familiar at once — I put my hand on his knee — we understood . He did not get out at the end of the trip — in fact went all the way back with me . " In his notebooks , Whitman disguised Doyle 's initials using the code " 16 @.@ 4 " ( P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet ) . Oscar Wilde met Whitman in America in 1882 and told the homosexual @-@ rights activist George Cecil Ives that Whitman 's sexual orientation was beyond question — " I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips . " The only explicit description of Whitman 's sexual activities is secondhand . In 1924 , Edward Carpenter told Gavin Arthur of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman , the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal . Late in his life , when Whitman was asked outright whether his " Calamus " poems were homosexual , he chose not to respond . The manuscript of his love poem " Once I Pass 'd Through A Populous City " , written when was Whitman was 29 , indicates it was originally about a man . 
 Another possible lover was Bill Duckett . As a teenager , he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman , living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles . Duckett was fifteen when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street . From at least 1880 , Duckett and his grandmother , Lydia Watson , were boarders , <unk> space from another family at 334 Mickle Street . Because of this proximity , it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors . Their relationship was close , with the youth sharing Whitman 's money when he had it . Whitman described their friendship as " thick " . Though some biographers describe him as a boarder , others identify him as a lover . Their photograph [ pictured ] is described as " modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait " , part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends , and encrypting male – male desire . Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford , with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek , and whom he first met when Stafford was 18 , in 1876 . Whitman gave Stafford a ring , which was returned and re @-@ given over the course of a stormy relationship lasting several years . Of that ring , Stafford wrote to Whitman , " You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me , and that was death . " 
 There is also some evidence that Whitman may have had sexual relationships with women . He had a romantic friendship with a New York actress , Ellen Grey , in the spring of 1862 , but it is not known if it was also sexual . He still had a photograph of her decades later , when he moved to Camden , and he called her " an old sweetheart of mine " . In a letter , dated August 21 , 1890 , he claimed , " I have had six children — two are dead " . This claim has never been corroborated . Toward the end of his life , he often told stories of previous girlfriends and sweethearts and denied an allegation from the New York Herald that he had " never had a love affair " . As Whitman biographer Jerome Loving wrote , " the discussion of Whitman 's sexual orientation will probably continue in spite of whatever evidence emerges . " 
 = = = <unk> and swimming = = = 
 Whitman reportedly enjoyed bathing naked and sunbathing nude . In his work Manly Health and Training written under the pseudonym Mose Velsor , he advises men to swim naked . In A Sun @-@ bathed Nakedness , he wrote , 
 Never before did I get so close to Nature ; never before did she come so close to me … Nature was naked , and I was also … Sweet , sane , still Nakedness in Nature ! – ah if poor , sick , prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more ! Is not nakedness indecent ? No , not inherently . It is your thought , your sophistication , your fear , your respectability , that is indecent . There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear , but are themselves indecent . 
 = = = Shakespeare authorship = = = 
 Whitman was an adherent of the Shakespeare authorship question , refusing to believe in the historic attribution of the works to William Shakespeare of Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon . Whitman comments in his November <unk> ( 1888 ) regarding Shakespeare 's historical plays : 
 <unk> 'd out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism — personifying in unparalleled ways the medieval aristocracy , its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste , with its own peculiar air and arrogance ( no mere imitation ) — only one of the " wolfish earls " so <unk> in the plays themselves , or some born descendant and knower , might seem to be the true author of those amazing works — works in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature . 
 = = = Slavery = = = 
 Whitman opposed the extension of slavery in the United States and supported the Wilmot Proviso . At first he was opposed to abolitionism , believing the movement did more harm than good . In 1846 , he wrote that the abolitionists had , in fact , slowed the advancement of their cause by their " <unk> and <unk> " . His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process , as did the refusal of the Southern states to put the interests of the nation as a whole above their own . In 1856 , in his unpublished The Eighteenth Presidency , addressing the men of the South , he wrote " you are either to abolish slavery or it will abolish you " . Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African @-@ Americans should not vote and was concerned at the increasing number of African @-@ Americans in the legislature . 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 Walt Whitman has been claimed as America 's first " poet of democracy " , a title meant to reflect his ability to write in a singularly American character . A British friend of Walt Whitman , Mary Smith <unk> Costelloe , wrote : " You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman , without Leaves of Grass ... He has expressed that civilization , ' up to date , ' as he would say , and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him . " Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman " America 's poet ... He is America . " Andrew Carnegie called him " the great poet of America so far " . Whitman considered himself a messiah @-@ like figure in poetry . Others agreed : one of his admirers , William Sloane Kennedy , speculated that " people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ " . 
 The literary critic , Harold Bloom wrote , as the introduction for the 150th anniversary of Leaves of Grass : 
 If you are American , then Walt Whitman is your imaginative father and mother , even if , like myself , you have never composed a line of verse . You can nominate a fair number of literary works as candidates for the secular Scripture of the United States . They might include Melville 's Moby @-@ Dick , Twain 's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , and Emerson 's two series of Essays and The Conduct of Life . None of those , not even Emerson 's , are as central as the first edition of Leaves of Grass . 
 In his own time , Whitman attracted an influential coterie of disciples and admirers . Some , like Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter , viewed Whitman both as a prophet of a utopian future and of same @-@ sex desire – the passion of comrades . This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism . 
 Whitman 's vagabond lifestyle was adopted by the Beat movement and its leaders such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac in the 1950s and 1960s as well as anti @-@ war poets like Adrienne Rich and Gary Snyder . Lawrence Ferlinghetti numbered himself among Whitman 's " wild children " , and the title of his 1961 collection Starting from San Francisco is a deliberate reference to Whitman 's Starting from <unk> . Whitman also influenced Bram Stoker , author of Dracula , and was the model for the character of Dracula . Stoker said in his notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which , to Stoker , was Whitman , with whom he corresponded until Whitman 's death . Other admirers included the Eagle Street College , an informal group established in 1885 at the home of James William Wallace in Eagle Street , Bolton , to read and discuss the poetry of Whitman . The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or <unk> . Its members held an annual ' Whitman Day ' celebration around the poet 's birthday . 
 Whitman 's poetry has been set to music by a large number of composers ; indeed it has been suggested his poetry has been set to music more than any other American poet except for Emily Dickinson and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . Those who have set his poems to music have included John Adams , Ernst Bacon , Leonard Bernstein , Benjamin Britten , Rhoda Coghill , Ronald Corp , George Crumb , Frederick Delius , Howard Hanson , Karl Amadeus Hartmann , Hans Werner Henze , Paul Hindemith , Ned Rorem , Ralph Vaughan Williams , Kurt Weill , and Roger Sessions . " Crossing , " an opera composed by Matthew Aucoin and inspired by Whitman 's Civil War diaries , premiered in 2015 . 
 On May 16 , 1957 , the Walt Whitman Bridge , which crosses the Delaware River near his home in Camden , was opened . 
 In 1997 , the Walt Whitman Community School opened , becoming the first private high school catering to LGBT youth . 
 In 2009 , Whitman was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame . 
 In 2013 , Whitman was inducted into the Legacy Walk , an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people . 
 Based on Kai <unk> 's German translation of the cycle in 2005 , a radio feature and bilingual " Kinder Adams / Children of Adam " double @-@ CD audio book , including a complete reading by Iggy Pop was released by <unk> Hamburg , Germany in 2014 , also featuring Marianne <unk> , Martin Wuttke , Birgit <unk> , Alexander Fehling , Lars Rudolph , Volker Bruch , Paula Beer , Josef <unk> , Ronald <unk> , Jule <unk> and Robert <unk> . 
 In 2014 composer John Zorn released On Leaves of Grass , an album inspired by and dedicated to Whitman .

 = = Plot = = 
 After much anticipation , Brian receives an invitation to an award ceremony celebrating his novel , Faster Than the Speed of Love , by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence . Convinced he is a great writer , Brian attempts to gain the family 's interest but fails to do so . Once he arrives at the " award ceremony " however , he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word " special " , prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he 's not a writer at all , but a big fat joke . He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog . He secretly buries the dead dog 's body outside the Griffins ' home and tries to keep quiet about it . Stewie , having witnessed his deed , begins to toy with Brian 's guilt , eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to " murder " . However , when he confesses to Joe and the Griffin family , they all laugh , saying that no one cares if a dog or any other animal is killed , especially by another animal . 
 Outraged , Brian starts a support group , and decides to call it " The Quahog Animal Equal Rights League , " to convince the town that the lives of animals should be of equal value to humans ' . As the town citizens learn more about it , however , none of them are keen on changing their lifestyles if it means no processed meats and medical research on animals , and even become interested in how dogs taste after Brian mentions they are eaten in some cultures . Refusing to listen any further , they chase after Brian in an attempt to eat him . 
 Brian realizes that if no one cares about the lives of animals , then he is worthless to the Griffin family and everyone else . Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub , and , seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him , Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar ( which Brian hadn 't been wearing ) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire . The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian 's supposed death , and realize how close a friend he was to them . Seeing this , Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him , regardless of his species . Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him , and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer . 
 Meanwhile , Quagmire accidentally knocks over a carton of Kool @-@ Aid mix on the kitchen floor of the Griffin 's house and leaves Peter to take the blame . Frustrated with having to clean Peter 's messes , Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house . But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn , refusing to leave after her work hours and sleeping at the Griffins ' house overnight , much to Peter and Lois ' annoyance . They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave , but she still refuses ( though she takes the money they offer her anyway ) . In a last @-@ ditch attempt , Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief , and leaves her in a basket on Joe 's front porch . 
 At the end , Peter lets us know that everyone at Family Guy respects all living beings and assures the viewers that no animals were harmed in the making of the episode , but they did hurt the feelings of an Italian opera singer by prematurely dropping the curtain on his performance .

 First announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International in San Diego , California on July 25 , 2009 , by future showrunner Steve Callaghan , the episode was directed by series regular , and former King of the Hill and The Oblongs director , Julius Wu , and written by Callaghan before the conclusion of the eighth production season . The episode saw the reintroduction of the recurring character Consuela , a Hispanic maid whose first appearance was in the sixth season episode " Believe It or Not , Joe 's Walking on Air " . The character is voiced by main cast member Mike Henry . 
 " Dog Gone " , along with seven other episodes from Family Guy 's eighth season , was released on a three @-@ disc DVD set in the United States on June 15 , 2010 . The sets included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes , a collection of deleted scenes , a special mini @-@ feature which discussed the process behind animating " Road to the Multiverse " , and a mini @-@ feature entitled Family Guy Karaoke . 
 In addition to the regular cast , anchor and political commentator Chris Matthews , voice actor Fred Tatasciore , opera singer Nathan Gunn , radio personality Eddie Sotelo and Kel MacFarlane , webmaster of the Seth MacFarlane fan site , guest starred in the episode . Recurring guest voice actors Ralph Garman , writer John Viener , writer Mark Hentemann , actress Alex Breckenridge , writer Alec Sulkin and writer Danny Smith also made minor appearances . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 In the opening scene of the episode , Stewie is seen going through Brian 's internet history , which includes searches about himself on the internet search engine Google . Later , after going to the bar to drink , Brian talks to Bill , the father from The Family Circus syndicated comic strip . After Bill tells him he should have tried harder on writing his book , Brian responds by yelling that all Bill does is " judge " other people , and demands for him to go home and " fuck [ his ] wife in the face " , to which Bill agrees . This is also later recognized by Peter the next day , when he is seen reading the <unk> , and murmurs to himself , " this is a very shocking Family Circus . " 
 News anchor and political commentator Chris Matthews ' show entitled Hardball with Chris Matthews is referenced by Stewie when he suggests Brian is getting a big head , with the guest , United States Senator Harry Reid , then appearing on Matthews ' forehead , suggesting Matthews is self @-@ centered . After Reid continues to interrupt him , however , Matthews cuts to actor Kurtwood Smith , in which Matthews appears on Smith 's forehead instead . 
 Once Consuela is hired as the family maid , she first begins to annoy Peter by listening to stereotypical Latin music played loudly on a portable radio , in which the singer repeats the Spanish phrase " ¡ Muchos horn @-@ os ! " which literally translates to " many ovens " but within the context of the show is actually meant to be Spanglish for " many horns . " In Consuela 's final appearance in the episode , she is seen watching a commercial , which parodies local commercials urging viewers to hire a lawyer if they are in a car accident . 
 In an attempt to try to prove that an animal has the same rights as humans , Brian starts an advocacy group , and is suggested by Lois to join PETA , but she is unable to enunciate the word differently from how she pronounces " Peter , " leading her husband to become confused . The end of the gag has Chris stating his belief that Betty White is a member of the organization , with his wording prompting Peter to yell , " That doesn 't even make sense ! " Brian goes on to create a public service announcement regarding animal rights , one of which involves a dog being " tortured " by having to listen to the radio show All Things Considered on National Public Radio , which the dog 's owner leaves on for him before leaving the house .

 In an improvement over the previous four episodes , the episode was viewed in 8 @.@ 48 million homes in its original airing , according to Nielsen ratings , despite airing simultaneously with Sunday Night Football , the television movie A Dog Named Christmas on CBS and Desperate Housewives on ABC . The episode also acquired a 4 @.@ 4 rating in the 18 – 49 demographic , beating The Simpsons , The Cleveland Show and American Dad ! , but was ultimately edged out slightly by The Simpsons in total viewership . 
 Reviews of the episode were highly positive , citing the Brian and Stewie storyline as a " solid attempt to tell a good story , " and the Consuela scenes as " terrific . " Ahsan Haque of IGN also noted that " the writers deserved some credit " for the episode , saying that , in comparison to past episodes the episode did not " come across as a haphazardly assembled string of [ random ] jokes . " Jason Hughes of TV Squad also found the Consuela scenes to be " hilarious , " but found the final scene to be " strangely [ ... ] uncomfortable , " expecting Meg to be pushed out of the family hug . Todd VanDerWerff of the The A.V. Club praised the handling of Brian 's character in the episode , and called the Peter and PETA gag " pretty cheap , but quite funny , " giving the episode a B rating overall . 
 In February 2010 , for " rais [ ing ] public awareness of animal issues " , " Dog Gone " won a Genesis Award for television comedy , winning over South Park episode ' Whale Whores " and Monk episode " Mr. Monk and the Dog " . In a post on PETA 's official blog , Amanda <unk> , however , was highly critical of the episode for its " myriad of violent deaths of cartoon dogs . " In addition , she called for the show to " hire [ writers ] who can generate material that doesn 't make us roll our eyes . "

 Chambers was born in Islington and raised in Finsbury , London . Running was a part of his family life : his older sister Christine won the senior 100 metres finals at the English Schools Championships in 1986 and 1987 and competed in the European Athletics Junior Championships . As a schoolboy he was coached by Selwyn Philbert who devoted himself to the young sprinter . Chambers first athletic success came at the 1994 English Schools ' Athletic Association Championships , where he won the boys ' intermediate 100 m race with a time of 10 @.@ 64 seconds . International medals followed at the 1995 European Junior Championships , at which he won the 100 m and the 4 × 100 metres relay . He defended these titles at the 1997 European Junior Championships and set a then world junior record in the 100 m with a time of 10 @.@ 06 s . 
 Chambers transitioned into the senior ranks soon after , taking the 100 m silver medal behind his British team mate Darren Campbell at the 1998 European Championships . He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with a run of 10 @.@ 03 s for third place and won a relay gold medal . At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100 m semi finalist and set a games record as part of the 4 × 100 m relay team . His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane , who became his coach . He came first in the 100 m in the 1999 European Cup , then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter ( after Linford Christie ) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9 @.@ 99 s . Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9 @.@ 98 s in Lausanne soon after , becoming the third Briton to break the barrier . In spite of this , Chambers remained some distance behind his North American counterparts . 
 = = = Seville World Championships to Sydney Olympics = = = 
 In his first major outing on the world stage , Chambers attained a new personal best at the 1999 World Championships in Seville , registering a time of 9 @.@ 97 s for third place in the 100 m final . This made the 21 @-@ year @-@ old the youngest ever World Championships 100 m medallist . North Americans dominated the event as Maurice Greene and Bruny Surin took first and second place respectively , with record runs of 9 @.@ 80 s and 9 @.@ 84 s , respectively . The British sprint team Chambers , Gardener , Campbell and Marlon Devonish performed well in the 4 × 100 metres relay event as runners @-@ up in a time of 37 @.@ 73 s behind the US team led by Greene . World record holder Maurice Greene was hitting his peak , winning three gold medals in Seville . However , at 21 years old , Chambers had achieved more than Greene had at that age : Greene 's best was 10 @.@ 08 s in 1996 and he had never reached a major final . 
 With the 2000 Sydney Olympics approaching , Chambers studied the technique of other sprinters . In an interview with BBC journalist Tom Fordyce , Chambers commented on the stamina Greene and Surin had gained from running in the 200 metres event and Jason Gardener 's improved acceleration through running the 60 metres event . He experimented with distances at the beginning of 2000 , sprinting over 50 , 60 and 200 m in various competitions . He set a personal best of 6 @.@ 55 s in the 60 m event in Ghent in February . A hamstring injury caused him to miss six weeks of training and when he returned his 100 m performances were lacklustre . He finished ninth at the Golden Gala in Rome with a slow time of 10 @.@ 41 s and was seventh in a tame 10 @.@ 30 s at the London Grand Prix , results that led him to consider quitting the season altogether . A late rejuvenation at the British Olympic trials guaranteed his selection as he snatched first place with 10 @.@ 11 s ( just one hundredth of a second ahead of Darren Campbell ) . Victory against in @-@ form world record holder Maurice Greene in Gateshead raised Chambers ' confidence and he stated his aim to take home a medal from the Games . 
 The 2000 Sydney Olympics saw Chambers come close to the podium . He easily qualified through the heat stages and achieved a season 's best of 10 @.@ 08 s in the 100 m final finishing fourth behind Greene , Ato Boldon and Obadele Thompson . Chambers was the best European 100 m performer , but after disqualification in the relay he left the games without a medal . 
 = = = Edmonton World championships = = = 
 He made his fastest opening to a season in 2001 by winning the 100 m for his club Belgrave Harriers at the European Clubs Cup with a meet record time of 10 @.@ 12 s . At the Amateur Athletics Association ( AAA ) trials in Birmingham his run of 10 @.@ 01 s was the fastest ever wind @-@ legal time recorded in Britain by a British sprinter . Chambers ran with consistency in the summer of 2001 : he won at the Seville Grand Prix in 10 @.@ 01 s and finished third in ten seconds flat at the Athletissima meet . In the run up to the 2001 IAAF Edmonton World Championships Chambers compared his own performances to the British record holder : " I am very consistent in the <unk> this year , and that bodes well for the Worlds . If you are running as fast as Linford Christie in his prime , it gives you a lot of confidence . " 
 Chambers also competed over 200 m and a personal best run of 20 @.@ 31 s earned him selection in both sprints for the World Championships . In an interview with Tom Fordyce , Chambers stated that Maurice Greene 's strong presence and mind games undermined the competition both physically and mentally . " You have to get out in front of him and hold on for dear life " he said of the world record holder . 
 Chambers broke the ten second barrier twice in the 2001 World Championships with a personal best of 9 @.@ 97 s in the quarter finals and a run of 9 @.@ 99 s in the final . This was not enough for a medal in a strong race which featured five sprinters running under ten seconds and saw Greene defend his title . Chambers was later upgraded to fourth place after silver medallist Tim Montgomery tested positive for banned substances . A hamstring injury in the final ruled him out of the 200 m event . Chambers ended his season at the 2001 Goodwill Games in Brisbane and finished in first place in the absence of an injured Greene , who commentated on his European rival 's victory .

 Chambers ' coach Mike McFarlane struggled with the workload of full @-@ time training . Frustrated by the distance between himself and the top sprinters , Chambers decided to relocate to California to work with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte . After parting ways with American sprinter Tim Montgomery , Conte looked to Chambers to fill the athlete 's berth . In the run up to the year 's major events , Chambers was in fine form and recorded a 200 m personal best of 20 @.@ 27 s in Athens on 10 June 2002 . Montgomery , impressed by Chambers ' training regime , tipped the Briton to win the gold at the forthcoming 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester , England .
