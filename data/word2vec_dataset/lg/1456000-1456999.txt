 " There the king , the fierce , the extraordinary king , cut down the Turks in every direction , and none could escape the force of his arm , for wherever he turned , brandishing his sword , he carved a wide path for himself : and as he advanced and gave repeated strokes with his sword , cutting them down like a reaper with his sickle , the rest , warned by the sight of the dying , gave him more ample space , for the corpses of the dead Turks which lay on the face of the earth extended over half a mile . " 
 Alert to the danger presented to his scattered ranks , Richard , prudent as ever , halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit . The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again , showing they still had stomach to renew the fight . However , a third and final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions , showing no inclination to continue the conflict . Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp . During the night the Saracen dead were looted . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As always with medieval battles , losses are difficult to assess with any precision . The Christian chroniclers claim that Saladin 's force lost 32 emirs and 7 @,@ 000 men , but it is possible that the true number may have been fewer . Baha al @-@ Din mentions only three deaths amongst the leaders of the Ayyubid army : <unk> , Grand @-@ Emir of the Kurds , <unk> el <unk> and <unk> . Richard 's own dead are said to have numbered no more than 700 . The only Crusader leader of note to be killed was James d <unk> . 
 Arsuf was an important victory . The Ayyubid army was not destroyed , despite the considerable casualties it suffered , but it did rout ; this was considered shameful by the Muslims and boosted the morale of the Crusaders . A contemporary opinion stated that , had Richard been able to choose the moment to unleash his knights , rather than having to react to the actions of an insubordinate unit commander , the Crusader victory might have been crushingly decisive . After the rout Saladin was able to regroup and attempted to resume his skirmishing method of warfare but to little effect ; shaken by the Crusaders ' sudden and devastatingly effective counterattack at Arsuf , he was no longer willing to risk a further full @-@ scale attack . Arsuf had dented Saladin 's reputation as an invincible warrior , and proved Richard 's courage as a soldier and his skill as a commander . Richard was able to take , defend and hold Jaffa – a strategically crucial move toward securing Jerusalem . Also Saladin had to evacuate and demolish most of the fortresses of southern Palestine : Ascalon , Gaza , Blanche @-@ Garde , Lydda and Ramleh , as he realised he could not hold them . Richard took the fortress of Darum , the sole fortress that Saladin had garrisoned , with only his own household troops , so low had Saracen morale been reduced . By depriving Saladin of the coast , Richard seriously threatened Saladin 's hold on Jerusalem . 
 Although the Third Crusade , in the end , failed to retake Jerusalem , a three @-@ year truce was eventually negotiated with Saladin . The truce , known as the Treaty of Jaffa , ensured that Christian pilgrims from the west would once again be allowed to visit Jerusalem . Saladin also recognised the Crusaders ' control of the Levantine coast as far south as Jaffa . Both sides had become exhausted by the struggle , Richard needed to return to Europe in order to protect his patrimony from the aggression of Philip of France , and Palestine was in a ruinous state .

 = The Burns Cage = 
 " The Burns Cage " is the seventeenth episode of the twenty @-@ seventh season of the animated television series The Simpsons , and the 591st episode of the series overall . It aired in the United States on Fox on April 3 , 2016 . 
 In the episode , Waylon Smithers finally comes out as gay to his boss Mr. Burns , who rejects his love . Other characters attempt to find a boyfriend for Smithers , and he falls for Julio . Meanwhile , Milhouse competes against a new boy for the lead role in a school production of Casablanca , so he can act alongside his own unrequited love , Lisa . Openly gay actor George Takei makes a cameo as himself , and the episode features a variety of cultural references , including to Grindr , Vladimir Putin , Equus and the films of Humphrey Bogart . 
 The episode was written by Rob LaZebnik , inspired by when his teenage son came out . Critical reception was mixed : the emotionally touching aspects of LaZebnik 's script and Harry Shearer 's portrayal of Smithers were praised . However , criticisms included the plot possibly ending the innuendo @-@ driven humor involving Smithers ' secret love of Burns , and an assumption that the character was being retconned due to changing attitudes on homosexuality since the series ' debut . The episode was covered by international media . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Smithers declares his love for Mr. Burns after he saves Burns ' life in a skydiving accident , but Burns reaffirms his contempt for him . Angry , Smithers treats Homer , Lenny and Carl harshly , so they determine finding Smithers a boyfriend will ease the ill @-@ treatment . They invite potential partners to meet Smithers at a gay men 's singles ' party , where a neck massage from Julio snaps Smithers out of his bad mood . The two fall in love , and Smithers leaves his job at the power plant . 
 Smithers becomes troubled on a trip to Julio 's homeland of Cuba when Julio 's carnival outfit resembles Burns ; Julio notices and asks Smithers if he is committed to their relationship , and Smithers admits that he is not . Back in Springfield , Burns ' attempts to find a new assistant prove disastrous , and his only option is to rehire Smithers . He meets Smithers with money and other enticements to lure him back , but Smithers states that he is not swayed . Burns then says he has kept a secret bottled up : that Smithers ' performance review is " excellent " . They hug and reconcile . 
 Meanwhile , Springfield Elementary put on a production of Casablanca , in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa . Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa , but he is challenged by a new boy , Jack <unk> , who dresses , acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart . Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack , but Jack wins the fight . Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack ; Lisa is angered as she does not believe that he is a good actor . Marge tells Lisa that it is important to tell people who are not skilled that they are , using the example of Homer . The production is a success , but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse ; he and Lisa leave hand @-@ in @-@ hand . 
 In an epilogue Milhouse goes to Moe 's Tavern , where Smithers teaches him that romantic setbacks make love feel better when it arrives . Moe tells the pair that he only searches for gold , not girls , and embarks on a treasure @-@ hunt with Jack and Groundskeeper Willie . 
 = = Production = = 
 Smithers ' unrequited love for Mr. Burns is a long @-@ running gag on The Simpsons ; the producers once joked that he was not gay , but " Burns @-@ sexual " . Rolling Stone described the character 's sexual orientation as the show 's " worst @-@ kept secret " , noting how in one episode he had a vacation at an all @-@ male resort , and in another he wore " rainbow @-@ striped short shorts " in Springfield 's gay district . In September 2015 , in an interview to promote the 27th season , executive producer Al Jean announced that " we actually do a lot with Smithers this year " , adding that two episodes would deal with the character 's sexuality , including one in which he becomes tired of Burns not appreciating him . 
 Writer Rob LaZebnik told the New York Post that the episode was inspired by his son Johnny , who came out as gay while at high school : " I am a Midwestern guy , so I don ’ t tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve , but I thought , ' What better way to tell my son I love him than to write a cartoon about it ? ' " . He added that he pitched the storyline three years earlier , and got approval for his script from his son . Smithers ' coming out is low @-@ key , as was Johnny 's ; he told the Post that as he was " the gayest little kid " , his parents were not surprised by his sexual orientation . The episode aired five days before Johnny 's 22nd birthday , and he said he would have a viewing party because the episode would be " particularly meaningful " to him . The elder LaZebnik stated his opinion that LGBT @-@ related television can have a " real impact on people 's thinking " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode 's title comes from the 1996 LGBT @-@ related comedy film The Birdcage , in which Simpsons voice actor Hank Azaria plays a Guatemalan housekeeper ; his portrayal of Cuban bartender Julio in this episode is similar . 
 In the chalkboard gag in the episode 's opening sequence , Bart backs the Villanova Wildcats , who won the 2016 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship Game the day after the episode aired . Fans wondered why the show 's staff were supporting Villanova over the North Carolina Tar Heels ; one Internet writer hypothesized that it was a reference to the season 9 episode " The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson " , in which after one of his typical alcoholic binges , Barney Gumble can only recall " giving a guest lecture at Villanova , or maybe it was a street corner . " 
 The episode includes a variety of cultural references . Among Smithers ' paintings of Burns is a parody of a photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin riding a horse while bare @-@ chested . Smithers likens Homer , Lenny and Carl to The Three Stooges , and Homer chooses Smithers ' potential partners via the gay dating app Grindr . At the party , George Takei asks another man if he wants to hear " horror stories " about his Star Trek co @-@ star William Shatner , and he is pleased that the man does not know who Shatner is . A billboard outside the school 's production of Casablanca advertises that the kindergarten are putting on a production of <unk> @-@ themed play Equus the following night . The end sequence with the treasure hunt pays homage to Bogart 's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The African Queen . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " The Burns Cage " scored a 1 @.@ 0 rating in the 18 – 49 demographic , and was watched by 2 @.@ 32 million viewers , making it Fox 's highest rated show of the night . 
 Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B + , commenting that casual viewers would have already presumed that Smithers had come out . He described Harry Shearer 's performance and LaZebnik 's script as " touching " . Tony Sokol of Den of Geek felt that Smithers coming out was good for social acceptance , but would end the comedy around his sexuality , which is based on double entendre . He wrote that the love story had " a few subversive laugh lines " but more " missed opportunities " . He added that the school 's production of Casablanca was disappointing compared to the series ' previous adaptations of A Streetcar Named Desire and Planet of the Apes , and gave his opinion that the Bogart homages ruined the opportunity to do better parodies of his films . However , he noted that the season had a better quality of animation . 
 Writing in British progressive magazine the New Statesman , Anna Leszkiewicz felt that the episode was not about " coming out " , as the innuendo concerning Smithers ' sexuality had been running for decades . She felt it was retconning the series , which had made arguably homophobic jokes around the character , for modern sensitivities ; this was likened to how Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling revealed that Albus Dumbledore was gay after the series had finished . Leszkiewicz concluded that it was progress – for the show more than for the LGBT community – that homosexuality was being treated in a more mature way on The Simpsons , but that the change should have been made at least a decade ago . 
 The episode was covered by international media outlets including the BBC , The Australian , Die Welt , La Stampa , Jornal de Notícias , El Mundo , L 'Avenir , and <unk> . 
 = California State Route 52 = 
 State Route 52 ( SR 52 ) is a state highway in San Diego County , California , that extends from La Jolla Parkway at Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) in La Jolla , San Diego , to SR 67 in Santee . It is a freeway for its entire length and serves as a major east – west route through the northern part of the city of San Diego . The road connects the major north – south freeways of the county , including I @-@ 5 , I @-@ 805 , SR 163 , I @-@ 15 , SR 125 , and SR 67 . SR 52 passes north of the Rose Canyon Fault before traversing Marine Corps Air Station Miramar ( MCAS Miramar ) . East of Santo Road and west of SR 125 , the highway goes through Mission Trails Regional Park , a large open preserve . SR 52 is also known as the Soledad Freeway and the San Clemente Canyon Freeway . 
 Plans for a route between La Jolla and Santee date from 1959 , and SR 52 was officially designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering . Construction began in 1966 at the I @-@ 5 interchange with Ardath Road leading to La Jolla . It continued with the building of San Clemente Canyon Road , which was later widened to become SR 52 . The freeway was completed east to I @-@ 805 in 1970 , and was built in two stages from there to Santo Road east of I @-@ 15 ; the last phase was completed in 1988 . 
 The freeway east of Santo Road encountered delays from environmentalists over the endangered least Bell 's vireo , a songbird which faced habitat destruction , as well as those concerned with the destruction of homes and businesses for the freeway right @-@ of @-@ way . The extension to Mission Gorge Road opened in 1993 , and SR 52 was completed to SR 125 in 1998 . Funding issues delayed the completion of the entire route until 2011 , more than fifty years after construction began ; until then , the city of Santee faced traffic snarls . A widening project was completed in 2007 between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard ; further expansion has been put on hold due to state budget concerns .

 SR 52 begins just west of I @-@ 5 at the eastern end of La Jolla Parkway . Before entering San Clemente Canyon , the road becomes a freeway as it intersects I @-@ 5 . The canyon is part of Marian Bear Natural Park . The freeway runs north of the Rose Canyon Fault , composed of Late Cretaceous rock estimated to be 90 million years old , and Mount Soledad . Following exits with Clairemont Mesa Boulevard / Regents Road and Genesee Avenue , SR 52 intersects I @-@ 805 before exiting the canyon and traveling along the southern edge of the MCAS Miramar military base . 
 From I @-@ 805 to SR 163 , the highway goes through an area with visible Pliocene sedimentary rocks estimated to be 10 million years old . After passing the Miramar Recycling Center and an interchange with Convoy Street , SR 52 intersects SR 163 , a freeway heading towards downtown San Diego . SR 52 intersects Kearny Villa Road before an interchange with I @-@ 15 . A collector @-@ distributor road serves these three interchanges . 
 After this interchange , the freeway leaves the edge of the military base and enters the San Diego neighborhood of Tierrasanta , where there is a junction with Santo Road , before traversing Mission Trails Regional Park , an open space preserve , for a few miles . The freeway ascends to Mission Trails Pass , north of the 1 @,@ 230 @-@ foot ( 370 m ) summit of Fortuna Mountain . The mountain is part of the Peninsular Range ; the highway cuts through Eocene rocks estimated to be 50 million years old and marine fossils . The road on the eastern side of the mountain is carved out of " igneous granitic rocks " that are thought to be 150 million years old , an unusual formation compared to the Eocene layer . 
 A dedicated two @-@ way bicycle path exists on the northern side of the roadway between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard , with access possible from both terminii . East of the Mast Boulevard interchange , SR 52 crosses and begins to parallel the San Diego River . The freeway enters the city of Santee , where SR 52 was built alongside Mission Gorge Road . SR 52 intersects the northern end of SR 125 , where SR 52 traffic can exit south onto SR 125 . The freeway continues east through Santee , with interchanges at <unk> Drive , Cuyamaca Street , and Magnolia Avenue , before it comes to an end at SR 67 . 
 SR 52 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System ; however , it is not a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans because it has not successfully been through the nomination process . SR 52 is not part of the National Highway System , a network of roads that are important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The entire route is known as both the Soledad Freeway and the San Clemente Canyon Freeway . In 2013 , SR 52 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 69 @,@ 000 at the eastern terminus with SR 67 , and 103 @,@ 000 between Convoy Street and SR 163 , the lowest and the highest AADT for the highway , respectively .

 In 1959 , Legislative Route 279 was designated as a highway from La Jolla to Santee and incorporated into the California Freeway and Expressway System . In the 1964 state highway renumbering , this became SR 52 . However , SR 52 took more than fifty years to be constructed , due to delays in the planning and construction phases . 
 = = = I @-@ 5 to I @-@ 805 = = = 
 A public hearing on Legislative Route 279 and on the Ardath Road connection to La Jolla was held on November 15 , 1961 . At the hearing , there were concerns expressed regarding destruction of vegetation . City and state officials indicated that the Soledad Freeway would be constructed in the northern part of the canyon to minimize environmental damage . On November 9 , 1966 , the I @-@ 5 interchange with Ardath Road opened at the western end of what would become SR 52 . The original goal was to connect the interchange with San Clemente Canyon Road , which served as a predecessor to SR 52 ; plans were to widen the road to four lanes and designate it as SR 52 . The connecting ramps were not opened that day because the aluminum guard rails had not been delivered on time . Estimates indicated that each resident of La Jolla would save 80 hours per year by using Ardath Road . A ramp from southbound I @-@ 5 to westbound Ardath Road was never completed because of a hairpin turn that would be necessary due to the towering cliff on the west side of I @-@ 5 that Ardath Road ascends as it continues to La Jolla . On November 18 , San Clemente Canyon Road was connected to I @-@ 5 when the aluminum guard rails arrived and were subsequently installed . San Clemente Canyon Road was not fully opened until 1967 . That year , citizens expressed opposition to the construction of the Soledad Freeway because some wanted the land to be used for a park , and did not view the freeway as " necessary . " 
 Formal bids began in February 1969 for the first section of SR 52 between I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 805 . The state ordered the construction of this section on April 28 , 1969 . On Thursday , May 28 , 1970 , the Soledad Freeway opened , connecting Regents Road and Genesee Avenue with I @-@ 5 ; however , it did not connect to the unopened I @-@ 805 . The road was built by <unk> , Ball and Yeager for $ 3 @.@ 9 million ( about $ 41 @.@ 5 million in 2015 dollars ) . The construction firm deposited dirt into " an unnamed finger canyon " against the conditions of the city permit , and the city ordered the firm to remove it . The section of I @-@ 805 from SR 52 to El Cajon Boulevard was scheduled to be dedicated on March 20 , 1972 . 
 Ardath Road was renamed La Jolla Parkway on October 15 , 2002 , for two reasons : a nearby residential street was also named Ardath Road , and there was a desire to draw attention to this primary route to downtown La Jolla . This required the city of San Diego to pay $ 20 @,@ 000 ( about $ 29 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) to replace the signs on SR 52 .

 The second phase of SR 52 from I @-@ 805 to 1 @.@ 1 miles ( 1 @.@ 8 km ) past U.S. Route 395 ( which became I @-@ 15 in 1974 ) was projected to cost $ 29 @.@ 4 million ( about $ 313 million in 2015 dollars ) . The new freeway was to provide access to Tierrasanta and reduce the traffic on I @-@ 8 . The U.S. Navy was consulted in the planning process due to the road 's proposed routing through MCAS Miramar that would provide a delineation against further urban development . There were no concerns expressed at the public hearing on November 17 , 1970 ; however , construction did not begin for more than ten years , as California governor Jerry Brown stalled the construction of SR 52 from Santo Road to SR 67 . In 1977 , the county supervisor , a San Diego City councilman , and the mayors of La Mesa and National City wrote a letter to Brown to ask for the construction of this portion of SR 125 and other freeways , due to concerns about the types of congestion seen in Los Angeles coming to San Diego due to the incomplete freeway system . San Diego City Councilman Tom Gade wrote a telegram to Caltrans Director Adriana Gianturco about the possible deletions ; in response , Gianturco clarified that the plans were only being reconsidered and had not been removed , and a CHC member criticized the tone of the original telegram , calling it " intemperate " . In 1984 , Leo <unk> , the Caltrans Director under California governor George Deukmejian , requested to the California Transportation Commission ( CTC ) that " formal studies toward this end be initiated immediately . Route 52 has a high statewide priority . " The CTC followed the director 's wishes , approving the studies . 
 The first part of this phase , from I @-@ 805 to Convoy Street , began construction in December 1986 . It was dedicated at a community celebration on July 11 , 1987 , and was scheduled to open to traffic a few weeks later . The first <unk> in San Diego County were installed on SR 52 near Convoy Street on June 20 , 1988 . On June 30 , 1988 , SR 52 from Convoy Street to Santo Road opened to traffic . The I @-@ 15 interchange was built with state funds from the CTC . 
 In 2000 , Hazard Construction Company added a single westbound lane on SR 52 from SR 163 to I @-@ 805 , a distance of 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) , at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 7 million ( about $ 2 @.@ 6 million in 2015 dollars ) . In 2006 , the Metropolitan Transit System , in cooperation with the San Diego Association of Governments ( SANDAG ) , Caltrans , and the California Highway Patrol , began a pilot program to run transit buses along the shoulders of SR 52 between Kearny Villa Road and I @-@ 805 . During rush hour , buses were able to use these shoulders to bypass slow traffic in the main lanes . The trial was considered successful as more than 99 percent of trips arrived on time , customer feedback was favorable and no safety concerns were encountered . On May 9 , 2007 , the San Diego Union @-@ Tribune published a story which raised reader concerns about a dangerous dip in the freeway . The dip had developed in a section of the highway constructed on top of the Miramar Landfill , and had been caused by trash settling ; it was repaired by the next day . 
 = = = Planning for eastern portion = = = 
 The planning process for the remainder of SR 52 began as early as 1970 , when the initial plan was to route the freeway through the city of Santee along Mission Gorge Road and the San Diego River . Planning was delayed until 1984 , along with the construction of the I @-@ 805 to Santo Road segment . The City of Santee opposed the original plans , hoping to route the freeway on Prospect Avenue or north of the San Diego River . By April 1985 , a second route along Prospect Avenue , proposed by Caltrans , earned the support of the City Council ; however , the required demolition of many small businesses led many of those affected to start a petition against this route . On the other hand , there were objections about the " river route " costing approximately $ 15 million more ( about $ 45 @.@ 9 million in 2015 dollars ) and cutting through a future " Town Center development " . The Lakeside Chamber of Commerce preferred the route along the San Diego River , citing the proximity to that city . The environmental impact report was found to be deficient by the Federal Highway Administration in late 1986 . 
 In January 1987 , the Santee City Council voted to commence a study of a more northern route , even though local residents and workers objected that this would postpone construction . In March , the study , done by BSI Inc . , supported the Caltrans decision to abandon plans for the northern path due to the increased cost from the " mountainous , undeveloped " terrain . The council voted to support a southern alignment through the town , with both the Prospect Avenue and San Diego River alternatives still viable . In the same month , the mayor of La Mesa , Fred Nagel , started a petition drive supporting the extension of the freeway due to the recurring traffic on I @-@ 8 . The Caltrans environmental impact report indicated that the Prospect Avenue route would cost $ 89 million ( about $ 248 million in 2015 dollars ) , compared to the river route 's $ 121 million ( about $ 337 million in 2015 dollars ) . The city council of El Cajon publicly supported the Prospect Avenue routing ; however , some employees of the City of Santee , including some city planners and engineers , were concerned that portions of the report were " outdated . " The petitions were given to the CTC in May , when San Diego officials made several arguments in support of the construction . 
 In June 1987 , the CTC staff initially recommended against allocating money for the SR 52 segment ; however , SANDAG agreed to fund the project with $ 1 million ( about $ 2 @.@ 78 million in 2015 dollars ) . Residents of Santee opposed the possible routes through the city at a public forum on June 10 because of the necessary destruction of homes to build on those routes . In late June , Caltrans considered making small modifications to the Prospect Avenue alignment to destroy fewer homes , including those in mobile home parks . On June 25 , 1987 , the CTC voted to support the SR 52 extension , with the requirement that $ 4 @.@ 8 million ( about $ 13 @.@ 3 million in 2015 dollars ) come from local funding sources . Finally , on September 23 , the City of Santee recommended the Prospect Avenue Route to the CTC . 
 In July 1987 , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service expressed concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing might result in the destruction of the endangered least Bell 's vireo habitat . Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course , which the public opposed . In April 1988 , the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route ; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course . Environmental concerns raised in June 1988 related to the least Bell 's vireo included decrease of insects , a darker environment after overpasses are constructed , and the fragmenting of habitat . Nevertheless , Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a more expensive and less traveled northern route . Upset because of the delays , the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston , asking for their assistance . Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections . 
 In March 1989 , the Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to the project , on the conditions of altering the route to cross the San Diego River and pass east of the center of the town , and constructing 44 acres of additional habitat as mitigation . SANDAG voted against building a full bicycle lane along the route in July 1989 , citing the high costs . Finally , on July 27 , the final routing of SR 52 was determined , running along Prospect Avenue . In May 1990 , Santee councilman Roy Woodward was censured for having a conflict of interest in voting to support the proposals for the freeway because he " held interests " in three properties that would benefit from the freeway , thus violating the Political Reform Act as these interests exceeded $ 10 @,@ 000 . One of the holdings was near Cuyamaca Street , the location of an offramp on a path that he voted to support . He was fined $ 2 @,@ 000 ( about $ 4 @,@ 700 in 2015 dollars ) for each property , for a total of $ 6 @,@ 000 ( about $ 14 @,@ 000 in 2015 dollars ) .

 In April 1990 , the Santee City Council agreed to begin purchasing land , over the environmental concerns of Councilman Jim Bartell . Construction finally began on the four @-@ lane section of SR 52 between Santo Road and Mission Gorge Road on July 19 , 1991 . The work was projected to cost $ 52 million ( about $ 119 million in 2015 dollars ) . For environmental mitigation , a new 45 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 070 sq mi ) songbird habitat was constructed that cost $ 8 @.@ 3 million ( about $ 19 million in 2015 dollars ) . Fossils of " small foraging mammals " were discovered during construction in late 1991 . The construction company , HDB Construction , was required to keep noise below 61 decibels to protect the birds . The project was funded primarily with revenue from a voter @-@ approved sales tax in 1987 . The opening of this portion was scheduled for December 16 , 1993 . This new segment ended just southeast of the Mast Boulevard interchange , after the San Diego River overpass . 
 The opening of this stretch of SR 52 had many effects on the transportation of the East County region . Traffic decreased significantly on I @-@ 8 in early 1994 , with an estimated 30 @,@ 000 commuters switching from I @-@ 8 to SR 52 . Fewer cars traveled on the western part of Mission Gorge Road , leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along that road . On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee , much more traffic was present , leading to residents complaining to the city . In 1998 , the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and <unk> Road to handle the extra traffic from the incomplete SR 52 . 
 The year after the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the military erected a fence to block a deer tunnel underneath the freeway that connected the base and Mission Trails Regional Park , since the tunnel could be used to gain unauthorized access to the base . In 2006 , construction began to add a third lane on westbound SR 52 between Mast Boulevard and Santo Road . The expansion cost $ 3 @.@ 4 million ( about $ 4 @.@ 09 million in 2015 dollars ) and was funded by the state and the county TransNet sales tax . The new lane opened on May 8 , 2007 ; however , the widening generated complaints from angry commuters facing a " bottleneck " at Santo Road . Because the additional lane was constructed in portions , the opening of the third lane between Santo Road and the existing third lane closer to I @-@ 15 was delayed ; however , construction for the missing 2 @,@ 100 feet ( 640 m ) was approved in April 2007 . The extension opened on July 20 , 2007 . 
 = = = Mission Gorge Road to SR 67 = = = 
 Construction on the next portion of SR 52 , from Mission Gorge Road to SR 125 , was scheduled to begin in late 1995 , at a total cost of $ 60 million ( about $ 116 million in 2015 dollars ) for the entire project . Property acquisition began in 1994 , with many property owners along the south side of Mission Gorge Road being forced to move out of the way of the freeway and subsequent road construction , as Mission Gorge Road was moved south to accommodate the new freeway . About $ 40 million ( $ 77 @.@ 6 million in 2015 dollars ) was spent on the property acquisition . After weather @-@ related construction delays due to the El Niño season of the winter of 1997 – 1998 , the extension of SR 52 between Mission Gorge Road and SR 125 was dedicated on May 9 , 1998 . The eastbound lanes were scheduled to be opened a few days later , and the westbound lanes were to be opened in mid @-@ July of that year . L.R. Hubbard Construction Company built the portion for $ 17 million ( about $ 28 @.@ 8 million in 2015 dollars ) . 
 The city of Santee faced problems in the construction of the freeway from SR 125 to SR 67 . As early as 1995 , it was clear that the environmental impact report was delayed and that there would be funding difficulties . SANDAG allocated $ 23 million dollars ( about $ 37 @.@ 1 million in 2015 dollars ) in 1999 to purchase properties needed for the right @-@ of @-@ way . In 2001 , SANDAG gave $ 138 million ( about $ 207 million in 2015 dollars ) to the expansion of SR 52 to SR 67 , which was necessary for extending the freeway past Cuyamaca Street . But by 2003 , the transportation committee of SANDAG voted to delay the project due to decreased state funding . The city of Santee was required to make improvements to Forester Creek to accommodate potential flooding , which cost $ 30 million ( about $ 37 @.@ 8 million in 2015 dollars ) ; the work began in May 2006 . Funding issues were finally resolved in 2006 with voter @-@ approved statewide transportation bonds . In 2007 , highway construction costs increased ; that year , the SANDAG transportation committee voted to fund the construction , taking money from a planned reversible lanes project on SR 52 . 
 " Heavy construction " of SR 52 from SR 125 eastward to SR 67 began in February 2008 . More than 360 properties were acquired to build the freeway ; at least 60 were mobile homes . This portion was divided into three construction projects : from SR 125 to Cuyamaca Street , from there to Magnolia Avenue , and the interchange with SR 67 , which began construction in mid @-@ June 2008 . The middle project had to be shut down briefly in February 2009 due to funding issues . Completion was scheduled for 2010 , but was postponed to early 2011 due to weather @-@ related delays . This new portion was opened to traffic on March 29 , 2011 . The cost of this project was $ 525 million , funded with state and federal funds as well as TransNet revenue . The opening was predicted to reduce traffic on I @-@ 8 as well as Mission Gorge Road and other Santee thoroughfares . The official " ribbon cutting " ceremony took place on March 19 , 2011 on the freeway at the Cuyamaca Street interchange . 
 Reactions to the extension between SR 125 and SR 67 were mixed . There were reports of faster transportation through the East County area , yet commuters noted a rush hour backup at SR 125 headed westbound because there were only two lanes traveling west through the interchange . Traffic along Mission Gorge Road was reported to have decreased by 20 percent . 
 = = Future = = 
 There are plans to add one lane in each direction , as well as two reversible lanes , from I @-@ 15 to SR 125 . These plans were put on hold in 2008 due to a budget shortfall . Completion is scheduled to take place by 2040 . Caltrans recommends adding two more lanes between I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 805 , and two HOV lanes between I @-@ 805 and I @-@ 15 .

 = Carex binervis = 
 Carex binervis , the green @-@ ribbed sedge , is a European species of sedge with an Atlantic distribution . It is found from Fennoscandia to the Iberian Peninsula , and occurs in heaths , moorland and other damp , acidic environments . It typically grows to a height of 15 – 120 cm ( 6 – 50 in ) , and has inflorescences comprising one male and several female spikes , each up to 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) long . The utricles have two conspicuous green veins , which give rise to both the scientific name and the common name of the species . In the vegetative state , it closely resembles C. bigelowii , a species that usually grows at higher altitude . C. binervis was first described by James Edward Smith in 1800 , and is classified in Carex sect . <unk> ; several hybrids with other Carex species are known .

 The culms of Carex binervis are 15 – 150 centimetres ( 6 in – 4 ft 11 in ) tall , although typically less than 120 cm ( 3 ft 11 in ) . They are triangular in section with rounded corners and often a single furrow . The leaves are 7 – 30 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 11 @.@ 8 in ) long and 2 – 6 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 08 – 0 @.@ 24 in ) wide , light green and shiny on the underside , but dark green and matt on the upper surface . The leaves are flat or slightly keeled , and taper abruptly to a fine point . 
 The roots of C. binervis are 1 – 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 – 0 @.@ 08 in ) in diameter , with the root hairs mostly occurring on the short lateral rootlets . The rhizomes run 25 – 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) below the soil surface , and are light brown and approximately 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) in diameter . The whole root system reaches a maximum depth of 18 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) , spreading more widely than Juncus squarrosus , another dominant plant in Atlantic wet heaths . 
 In the vegetative state , C. binervis is difficult to distinguish from C. bigelowii , a species that tends to grow at higher altitudes than C. binervis . They differ in that C. bigelowii has glaucous leaves and purplish @-@ brown scales on the rhizome , whereas C. binervis has orange @-@ brown rhizome scales , and leaves which are not glaucous . The leaves of C. binervis also develop " wine @-@ red " patches on aging , which are never seen in C. bigelowii . 
 = = = Reproductive parts = = = 
 The inflorescence of C. binervis may be up to half the length of the stem . The lower bracts resemble the leaves , while the upper bracts are more like the <unk> . The inflorescence comprises a single terminal male spike , and 2 – 4 lateral female spikes . The male spike is 20 – 45 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 8 in ) long , with purplish <unk> which are 4 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 18 in ) long and have a paler midrib . The female spikes are 15 – 45 mm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 8 in ) long and cylindrical . Their peduncles are half sheathed , and up to 10 cm ( 4 in ) long , such that the lower female spikes tend to be nodding , while the upper female spikes are erect . 
 The utricles ( seeds ) of C. binervis are 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 14 – 0 @.@ 18 in ) long and broadly elliptical , with a rough , notched beak 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 – 0 @.@ 06 in ) long . They are purplish brown or sometimes partly green , and both the plant 's scientific and common names refer to the fact that the utricles are marked with two conspicuous green veins ( from the Latin roots bis , " two " , and <unk> , " nerve " ) . C. binervis has a chromosome number of 2n = 74 . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Carex binervis has an oceanic distribution , occurring only in areas of high rainfall , from Finland and Norway , through the British Isles , Germany , Belgium and France , to Spain and Portugal . Within the British Isles , Carex binervis has a westerly and northerly distribution , and is more abundant in the Scotland , Wales and Ireland than in England . Plants from Morocco that were previously referred to C. binervis are now treated as a separate species , C. <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 Carex binervis grows in acidic , siliceous environments , including " damp heaths , moors , rocky places and mountainsides " ; together with species such as Deschampsia flexuosa , it is a " useful indicator of acid substrate " . The species has been recorded at altitudes of up to 930 metres ( 3 @,@ 050 ft ) on <unk> Fach in north Wales , and there are reports of occurrences up to 975 m ( 3 @,@ 200 ft ) in the Scottish Highlands . Although sedges are chiefly wind pollinated , insect pollinators have been observed to visit C. binervis occasionally .

 In 1800 , James Edward Smith published an article in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London , titled " Descriptions of five new British species of Carex " , which included the first descriptions of Carex <unk> , C. binervis , C. tomentosa ( a synonym of C. filiformis ) , C. <unk> ( a synonym of C. <unk> ) and C. laevigata . After the Latin diagnosis of Carex binervis , Smith writes : 
 This species appears to have been confounded with C. distans ; and from Lightfoot 's description of the green angles of the fruit , I presume it to have been what he intended under that name . It is considerably larger than the real distans , the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish , and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base . Its most essential and decisive character however consists in the two strong deep @-@ green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally near the edge . The <unk> is also broader and more compressed than in C. distans . 
 Carex binervis is classified in Carex subsection <unk> , part of Carex section <unk> , alongside C. laevigata and other species . Natural hybrids are known between C. binervis and various other Carex species , including C. laevigata ( forming C. × <unk> ) , C. <unk> ( forming C. × <unk> ) , C. punctata and C. flava .

 = = Plot = = 
 The parks department performs in the annual Pawnee City Government Follies that riffs local politics , including one sketch that skewers Councilman Bill Dexhart ( Kevin Symons ) , who was recently discovered to be involved in many bizarre sex scandals . Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) is later asked to meet Dexhart for lunch , where she learns the sketch was accidentally accurate about another bizarre sex scandal that has not been made public . After assuring Dexhart that it was merely a coincidence , Leslie discovers that the local tabloid , The Pawnee Sun , has taken pictures of their lunch and is reporting that Leslie is Dexhart 's new mistress . 
 The speculation about Dexhart and Leslie quickly spins out of control , upsetting Leslie because it is distracting her from overseeing the Christmas village that she set up in Lot 48 . Ron ( Nick Offerman ) decides to give Leslie the day off to lie low and distributes her daily duties among the rest of the staff . Everyone is amazed how much Leslie does by herself each day and the entire group struggles to complete their tasks . Leslie has lunch with Dave ( Louis C.K. ) , who reveals that his unit in the US Army Reserve has been called up to active duty in San Diego for a year to eighteen months , and he invites Leslie to join him since he has fallen in love with her . Leslie confides to Ann ( Rashida Jones ) that she is considering the move , as the treatment of her in the media has soured her on Pawnee . 
 The local show " Pawnee Today " digs up an old video of Leslie shaking hands with Dexhart and <unk> every aspect of the short clip . Ann brings Dexhart to her home , where Ann and Leslie demand he clear Leslie 's name . Dexhart refuses because the fake scandal is so docile compared to his real transgressions that it is actually positive press for him . Soon after , Ann is horrified to discover that a news crew secretly followed Dexhart to her home and took a photograph of the meeting , resulting in speculation that Ann is Leslie 's lesbian lover in a three @-@ way relationship with Dexhart . A furious Leslie schedules an appearance on " Pawnee Today " to clear her name once and for all . On the show , host Joan Callamezzo ( Mo Collins ) surprises Leslie by bringing out Dexhart , who tries to prove their affair by claiming that Leslie has a mole on her buttocks . To finally end the scandal , Leslie pulls down her pants on live television and moons Callamezzo . Since there is no mole , Dexhart is forced to admit that he fabricated the sex scandal . 
 Over dinner , Leslie tells Dave that she will not move to San Diego with him , as her life is in Pawnee . Dave , although sad , understands her choice and the two split up amicably . At Pawnee 's tree lighting ceremony , Leslie is congratulated by everyone , including Leslie 's mother Marlene , who is proud that her daughter successfully fought off the media .

 " Christmas Scandal " was written by series co @-@ founder Michael Schur and directed by Randall Einhorn . The episode featured the last of a string of guest performances by stand @-@ up comedian Louis C.K. , who reprised his recurring role as Dave Sanderson , Leslie 's police officer boyfriend . Louis C.K. left the show to devote more time to his own upcoming series , Louie , which was to air in early 2010 . Louis C.K. was widely praised for his brief stint on the show , where he adopts a deadpan , technical tone of voice far different from his usual comedy persona . Matt Fowler of IGN said , " Louis C.K. , known for being a raucous , raunchy comic , is almost frightening in his ability to play against his stage persona and give us a wonderfully caring , and deadpan , character " . 
 " Christmas Scandal " also featured Kevin Symons as Pawnee Councilman Bill Dexhart . Dexhart was previously introduced in " Practice Date " , where his sex scandals served as a parody of the real @-@ life 2009 scandal of South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford , who publicly admitted to a long @-@ time extramarital affair with an Argentinian woman . Jay Jackson also reprised his prior role as Perd Hapley , a Pawnee television news reporter . " Christmas Scandal " is the first episode to feature the former Pawnee pit location serving a legitimate town purpose . Filling a giant construction pit and turning it into a park had been a central plot @-@ point of Parks and Recreation throughout the first season and the first half of the second season . The pit was filled in the episode " Kaboom " , and the space is turned into the town 's Winter Wonderland Christmas village in " Christmas Scandal " . The Christmas village scenes were filmed in the same location as the past pit scenes in Van Nuys , a district of Los Angeles , California . During one scene , Ron expresses concern about dangerous raccoons at the Christmas village . This is a reference to a running gag , established from the series , that Pawnee has a terrible raccoon infestation problem .

 The episode received generally positive reviews . The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said the story in " Christmas Scandal " was so busy that it risked running awry , but was kept together by a number of strong comedic moments and subplots .

 = Triangle ( The Beau Brummels album ) = 
 Triangle is the fourth studio album by American rock band The Beau Brummels . Produced by Lenny Waronker and released in July 1967 , it was the band 's first album to include songs that vocalist Sal Valentino and guitarist Ron Elliott composed together . The band incorporated fantasy elements and surreal characters into the album 's song titles and lyrics , and worked with a variety of session musicians to create Triangle 's psychedelic musical style . The Beau Brummels were reduced to a trio — Valentino , Elliott , and Ron Meagher — at the time Triangle was recorded , as former group members Don Irving ( guitars ) and John Petersen ( drums ) left the band following the release of the group 's previous album , Beau Brummels ' 66 . 
 Triangle reached number 197 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and received mostly positive reviews ; critics commended Elliott as a songwriter and compared Valentino 's vocals to those of Bob Dylan . The single " Magic Hollow " was ranked one of " The 100 Greatest Psychedelic Classics " in a 1997 issue of Mojo magazine . Warner Japan released this album as <unk> @-@ 5252 in 1993 . Collectors ' Choice Music reissued the album in 2002 .

 In July 1966 , the Beau Brummels released their third album , and first with Warner Bros. Records . Titled Beau Brummels ' 66 , the album was a collection of cover songs and was a commercial disappointment . Critics questioned Warner Brothers ' decision to not release the band 's original material , which had been recorded by the band in early 1966 as their previous label , Autumn Records , collapsed . These recordings eventually appeared on the 2005 compilation album San Fran Sessions . Following the release of Beau Brummels ' 66 , guitarist Don Irving left the group when he received an induction notice into the armed forces . Drummer John Petersen quit to join pop rock band Harpers Bizarre . By early 1967 , the three remaining members — vocalist Sal Valentino , guitarist Ron Elliott , and bassist Ron Meagher — quit touring to focus on studio work . For their next album , Triangle , the band met with Warner Bros. producer Lenny Waronker , who gave the band freedom to resume recording original material . According to Elliott , " Lenny Waronker wanted to do something creative , and I was up for that . " During the album 's recording sessions , Meagher left the group when he was called to active duty in the Army Reserves . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Valentino said Triangle was partially inspired by several day trips he took to the California Palace of the Legion of Honor , a fine art museum in San Francisco . He admired the collection of 17th century Flemish portraits and landscape paintings at the museum , from which dark yet incandescent hues emanated . Elliott described the album as a " mythological cartoon about love written from some weird spaces " , and explained it as " sort of a mood swing into the world that was around us at the time . It was sort of dissolving into this drug culture . So the music became very ethereal , mystic , and mysterious " . In contrast with the band 's generally straightforward recordings for the Autumn label , Triangle 's lyrics are more abstract , containing <unk> fantasy elements and dream @-@ like characters , such as the gypsy in " Only Dreaming Now " , the " Painter of Women " , " The Keeper of Time " , and " The Wolf of Velvet Fortune " , as well as the destination of " Magic Hollow " . 
 Elliott , the band 's principal composer , sought to move away from the formulaic songs that Autumn Records wanted . Having regained artistic freedom in the studio , and with the band no longer touring , Elliott and Valentino focused on creating an album of songs which were written and recorded specifically for that purpose . The resulting sessions for Triangle saw Elliott and Valentino collaborate as songwriters for the first time . Four of the album 's tracks were written by Elliott with frequent collaborator Bob Durand . The album also contained the Randy Newman composition " Old Kentucky Home " and a cover version of Merle Travis 's " Nine Pound Hammer " , both of which hinted at the country rock direction explored more heavily by the band on their 1968 album , Bradley 's Barn . Session musicians included guitarist James Burton , drummer Jim Gordon , bassist Carol Kaye , and Van Dyke Parks , who played harpsichord on " Magic Hollow " , adding to the album 's psychedelic musical style . Elliott returned the favor , playing guitar on Parks ' 1968 debut album , Song Cycle . Triangle also features strings , brass , accordion , woodwinds , and numerous types of percussion .

 Released in July 1967 , Triangle spent two weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart , peaking at number 197 . Though not a commercial success , the album gained an underground following and received critical acclaim . Sal Valentino 's " expressive " vocals were compared to those of Bob Dylan by Crawdaddy ! ' s Paul Williams in 1968 and by Perfect Sound Forever 's Steve Cooper in 2004 . A 2007 review in Electric Roulette stated that Valentino 's voice resembles Gene Clark of The Byrds , " but superior in tone and emotion " . Williams , Cooper , and Allmusic 's Stansted Montfichet praised Ron Elliott as a songwriter , with Montfichet adding that Elliott 's " lyrical imagery ... is particularly striking " in the songs " Only Dreaming Now " , " Painter of Women " , and " The Wolf of Velvet Fortune " . Australian journalist and author Lillian Roxon wrote in her 1969 Rock Encyclopedia that Triangle " was the album that astonished everyone and blew a million minds " . Music journalist Jon Savage named the song " Magic Hollow " in his list of the " 100 Greatest Psychedelic Classics " in the June 1997 issue of Mojo magazine . In 2006 , Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle called the album a " cult classic " , while SF Weekly 's Justin F. Farrar remarked that it " has aged far more gracefully than that almighty concept record from ' 67 , Sgt. Pepper 's [ Lonely Hearts Club Band ] . " Brendan McGrath of The Rising Storm wrote in a 2007 review that " Triangle has everything : it 's a tightly produced country record that is rooted in rock ; it 's straight and folky and underlined by psychedelic imagery " . Author Tom Moon selected the album for his 2008 book , 1 @,@ 000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die , in which he wrote that Triangle " captured the crisscrossing events of 1967 " and was " the rare bridge between the sunny straightforwardness of mid @-@ 60s pop and the fuzzy opaqueness of psychedelia " . During a 2005 broadcast of Fresh Air , National Public Radio 's Ken Tucker said that Triangle comes " perilously close to stuffy art rock . " The album was re @-@ released in 2002 by Collectors ' Choice Music . Kim Cooper of <unk> magazine said the reissue was " long overdue " and noted that " the remaster really brings out the arrangements ' complexity " .

 A right @-@ arm fast bowler of express pace , Lindwall was widely regarded as the greatest pace bowler of his era and one of the finest of all time . Together with Keith Miller , Lindwall formed a new @-@ ball pairing regarded as one of the greatest to have played cricket . Lindwall was known for his classical style , with a smooth and rhythmic run @-@ up and textbook side @-@ on bowling action , from which he generated his trademark outswinger which moved away late at high pace . Lindwall mixed his outswinger with a searing yorker , subtle changes of pace and an intimidating bouncer that skidded at the heads of opposing batsmen . Later in his career , Lindwall developed an inswinger , which together with his variety , pace and control made him the most feared paceman of his time . Lindwall was a fine all round cricketer ; he was a hard @-@ hitting batsman who scored two centuries at Test level and often improved Australia 's position with his lower order batting . Lindwall 's best known performance was his role in leading the Australian bowling during the 1948 tour of England under Don Bradman ; the 1948 Australian team went through the tour undefeated and gained the sobriquet The Invincibles which saw it regarded as one of the finest teams in cricketing history . Lindwall 's place in Australian cricket history saw him inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members . In 2000 , Lindwall was named in the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century . 
 One of five children of Irish @-@ Swedish descent , Lindwall had a difficult childhood during the Great Depression , with both parents dying before he finished high school . Lindwall was inspired in his childhood after watching England 's Harold Larwood , the fastest bowler of the era , terrorise the Australian batsmen during the notorious Bodyline series of 1932 – 33 with short @-@ pitched intimidatory bowling . During his teenage years , Lindwall rose through the ranks of Sydney Grade Cricket at St. George under the tutelage of Test leg spinner Bill O 'Reilly , who was regarded as the finest bowler in the world at the time . Lindwall made his first @-@ class debut for New South Wales in 1941 – 42 . At the same time , Lindwall , a fine athlete , was playing for St. George in the first @-@ grade of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership as a full back . With the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , interstate cricket was cancelled and in 1943 , Lindwall joined the army and served in New Guinea until 1945 . Lindwall returned to Australia still suffering from the after @-@ effects of tropical disease , but he quickly made an impact upon the resumption of first @-@ class cricket . He did well enough to gain selection a tour of New Zealand , where he made his Test debut in March 1946 in a match that was retrospectively accredited . Lindwall returned to Australia and spent the winter playing football for St. George , helping his team to the grand final of the 1946 NSWRFL season , after which he retired to concentrate solely on cricket . 
 Lindwall began his celebrated opening partnership with Miller during the 1946 – 47 season which saw the first Ashes series against England . Lindwall brought up his maiden Test century in the Second Test and was the leading wicket @-@ taker as Australia established its ascendancy in the post @-@ war era . He topped the bowling the following season against India and then led the Australian attack during its celebrated Invincibles tour of England . He took 86 wickets for the tour , including 27 in the Tests , the most by any bowler . He was at his best in the Fifth Test at The Oval , when England were skittled for only 52 , taking 6 / 20 as the hosts were unable to cope with his high @-@ pace swing . Lindwall 's efforts saw him named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year . 
 Following the Invincibles tour , Lindwall found the pitches in South Africa in 1949 – 50 less to his liking and was dropped for the final Test . He returned in the following season against England , regularly taking wickets in another series win . The following year , he played a major part in stopping the much vaunted West Indian batsmen , but he was criticised for his prolific use of short @-@ pitched bowling . In 1952 , Lindwall played in the Lancashire League in England , where he developed his inswinger . He returned to 1953 with an aging national team in decline and despite the loss of the Ashes , commentators felt that Lindwall was at his zenith in terms of his bowling craft . Upon returning to Australia , Lindwall moved north to Queensland due to work commitments and then suffered a season of injury and illness in 1954 – 55 which saw him perform poorly as England retained the Ashes easily . After a strong performance in the Caribbean , Lindwall missed half of the 1956 English tour with injury and was otherwise ineffective as Australia lost its third consecutive Ashes series . During the return trip to Australia , Lindwall captained Australia for the only time in a Test match against India in Mumbai , after injuries forced out regular captain Ian Johnson . Following the repeated defeats to England , the Australian selectors instituted generational change and gambled on a radical youth policy which saw Lindwall dropped for the 1957 – 58 tour of South Africa . Lindwall forced his way back into the Test team at 37 years of age in the following season , breaking Clarrie Grimmett 's Australian Test record of 216 wickets . He retired from Test cricket after the tour of the Indian subcontinent in the following season , with a total of 228 Test wickets . In retirement , Lindwall mentored Test world @-@ record holder Dennis Lillee and also served as a national selector . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Lindwall was born at Mascot , Sydney , New South Wales , the fourth of five children . He had one younger sister , two older sisters and an older brother . The grandson of Swedish and Irish immigrants , Lindwall had a difficult childhood with his mother Catherine dying of pneumonia when he was seven . His father Arthur had a job at the Water and Sewerage Board , but the children were aware that their father could not financially support them beyond school @-@ leaving age . 
 At the age of 11 , Lindwall and his elder brother Jack were spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground on the second day of the First Test of the 1932 – 33 Ashes series . The series saw the usage of the notorious Bodyline tactics by England 's pace battery led by Harold Larwood under the captaincy of Douglas Jardine . Larwood , a small man like Lindwall , was less than six feet and intimidated opposition batsmen with express pace bowling , aiming short pitched bouncers at their upper body . Larwood also had a smooth , rhythmic run @-@ up and a classical side @-@ on action , something for which Lindwall became famous . The match was also remembered for Stan McCabe 's much @-@ celebrated 187 not out , aggressively resisting the Bodyline tactics as Australia fell to a heavy ten wicket defeat . 
 The Lindwall brothers returned to their home in Hurstville , where Ray henceforth attempted to emulate Larwood . He wanted to replicate the physical threat posed by Larwood to batsmen , as well as the dynamic batting of McCabe . Lindwall attempted to copy Larwood 's action in his routine street cricket matches , before terrorising his classmates at primary school . Lindwall said that " he was the most famous fast bowler in the world and I naturally wanted to copy him " . Lindwall 's formal cricket education began the following year when he commenced his secondary schooling at Marist Brothers Kogarah . The school had teachers that had a habit of scouting around for athletic boys who could bring sporting honour to the institution . The headmaster , Brother Aidan O 'Keefe , was a competent player and invested time into training Lindwall . O 'Keefe taught Lindwall batting repertoire while also encouraging him to remain aggressive . He taught Lindwall to add accuracy and variation to his raw speed . By the age of 13 , Lindwall was leading the under @-@ 15 school team , opening both the batting and bowling . Aged 14 , Lindwall played in two distinct Saturday competitions – in the morning against schoolboys and with adults in the afternoon in a B @-@ grade competition with Carlton Waratahs . On one outing , he scored 219 and an unbeaten 110 in two different matches on the same day . 
 Lindwall 's physique had matured by the time he was 15 , and he was also successful at athletics and swimming . Aware that he needed a good education with his family in poverty during the Great Depression , Lindwall lifted himself for his final year of junior high school and won a half @-@ scholarship to Marist Brothers Darlinghurst for 1937 and 1938 . However , Lindwall 's focus on rugby league and cricket saw him fail his Leaving Certificate in his final year . 
 = = Grade cricket under O 'Reilly = = 
 During his secondary school years , Lindwall focused on his batting and gained a reputation as a dynamic <unk> . In early October 1938 , with his final school year drawing to a close , Lindwall was among a group of young cricketers who received an invitation to practise at the SCG with the state team . Lindwall was the first to volunteer to bowl to Jack Fingleton , who was one of Australia 's first @-@ choice opening batsmen , having just returned from the 1938 Ashes tour . Lindwall peppered Fingleton with a series of yorkers , bouncers and outswingers . In the space of 15 minutes , Lindwall bowled Fingleton four times and beat the bat on several other occasions . When questioned by his coach , Fingleton brushed off Lindwall 's performance , noting " I 'm just off the boat . I 'm not seeing the ball . " Lindwall was stung by the comments , noting that it taught him to hate all batsmen . 
 Lindwall was only in the Third XI of St. George at the time , but by December , he was in the First XI along with future Invincibles team @-@ mate Arthur Morris . The senior team was captained by Bill O 'Reilly , a leg spin bowler who represented Australia in Tests and was regarded as the best bowler in the world . O 'Reilly was a firm man and came to be a father figure for Lindwall . Lindwall came into the team seeing himself as an into @-@ the @-@ wind swing bowler . O 'Reilly felt that pace bowlers were only useful for a few overs with new ball , so he instructed Lindwall to lengthen his run @-@ up and bowl as fast as possible . O ’ Reilly also decided that the team needed more bowlers . He placed Lindwall low in the batting order , where he often did not get an opportunity to bat . Lindwall did not bother protesting , realising that dissent against the autocratic O ’ Reilly would be futile . O 'Reilly also reversed Morris from a bowler into a batsman . Both Morris and Lindwall became world @-@ leading players in the fields that O ’ Reilly chose for them . By the end of the 1938 – 39 season , Lindwall had not yet established himself as a cricketer . Former Test batsman Charlie Macartney lamented what he perceived as a lack of talent and substance at St. George . Lindwall returned to school , attempting to obtain his Leaving Certificate while also playing third @-@ grade rugby . In July , Lindwall 's father died , leaving him and his four siblings orphaned . 
 = = Juggling work , war and first @-@ class rugby league and cricket = = 
 At the end of the year , Lindwall gained his Leaving Certificate . This made him eligible to study at university , but this clashed with his desire to play sport and earn money to help support his parentless family . He thus took an office job with Commercial Steel and Forge Company , which manufactured aeroplane parts and bomb fuses . During the 1939 – 40 season , Lindwall 's bowling was only moderately successful , with 16 wickets at 34 @.@ 93 . A highlight of the season was an unbeaten 49 as St. George won the grade final . 
 In the winter of 1940 Lindwall made his first grade rugby league debut in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the St. George club alongside his older brother Jack , who had been with the club since 1938 . He played at fullback and assumed goal @-@ kicking responsibilities . Lindwall 's cricketing improved during the 1940 – 41 season , taking 34 wickets at 16 @.@ 45 , approximately doubling his wickets while halving their cost . By this time , many of his colleagues had enlisted in the armed services and the competition was beginning to thin out during World War II . Lindwall missed the 1941 NSWRFL season due to illness , and in doing so missed out on the team that won the premiership that season . In October 1941 , Lindwall was selected to make his first @-@ class cricket debut against Queensland in Brisbane , just after turning 20 . Playing along his childhood hero McCabe , Lindwall put in a wayward performance . He conceded an expensive 81 runs in 15 wicketless overs and made just one run with the bat . The Sheffield Shield season was cancelled a month later after the December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack , that signalled the widening of the war into the Pacific arena . The Sydney grade cricket competition continued , and Lindwall helped St. George to a hat @-@ trick of premierships with 27 wickets at 22 @.@ 19 and 405 runs at 27 @.@ 00 . 
 During the winter of 1942 , Lindwall helped the St. George Dragons rugby league team to reach the grand final for the second consecutive year and also finished the season as the League 's top point @-@ scorer . Lindwall and his brother Jack , who played on the wing , scored all of the team 's points in the grand final , Jack scoring a try and Ray kicking three goals . However they were denied by a last @-@ minute penalty goal and St. George were defeated by Canterbury @-@ Bankstown 11 – 9 . All the while , the Japanese were inching ever closer to Australia . Malaya had fallen and the northern Australian city of Darwin had been the subject of Japanese air raids . 
 Army commitments intervened during the 1943 season . Lindwall had attempted to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force , but he was rejected because the employees of his firm were exempted from military service . Thus Lindwall resigned his job in order to join the army . As part of his Anti @-@ aircraft and Fortress Signal unit , he was deployed in May 1943 to New Guinea as the Japanese reached the Kokoda Trail close to Port Moresby . Lindwall 's unit were bombed while they were ashore and he was lucky not to be killed . In 1945 , he returned from the Solomon Islands , where he was believed to have contracted malaria and Dengue fever , although medical tests did not confirm this , he needed injections and atebrin tablets to aid him in recovering from bouts of minor illness for some time afterwards , and he resumed State cricket in 1945 – 46 , despite the rigours of war having reduced him to just 73 kg , which was thin for his height of 178 cm . 
 = = Post @-@ war Test cricket debut = = 
 Lindwall resumed his first @-@ class cricket career steadily against Queensland and South Australia . Lindwall gave his first indications of cricketing potential on a 38 degree day in the second innings of a match against Victoria . A day after suffering a mild malaria attack , Lindwall gave a spell of four overs which netted him three wickets , bowling at speeds not seen in Australia since Larwood . An innings of 134 not out in just 180 minutes against Queensland at the SCG underlined by cutting and driving exhibited his batting skill , and with a haul of 9 / 77 against South Australia further underlining his allround credential . Lindwall gained further attention when he turned out for New South Wales against the feted Australian Services team of Lindsay Hassett that had played in the 1945 Victory Tests in England . Lindwall 's hostile bowling delivered three wickets in each innings , finishing with match figures of 6 / 95 , leading Hassett to rate him as the best fast @-@ bowling prospect in a decade . With 33 wickets for the season , Lindwall as selected for an Australian team tour of New Zealand under Bill Brown . He played in a Test against New Zealand , which was not awarded Test status until 1948 . In a match in which Australia fielded seven Test debutants , Lindwall opened the bowling with state team @-@ mate Ernie Toshack . Lindwall had limited opportunities on a sticky wicket which favoured the slower bowling of O ’ Reilly and Toshack , who took eight and seven wickets respectively . He took 1 / 13 and 1 / 16 as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs . Lindwall made a duck in Australia 's only innings . 
 Lindwall returned to Australia and resumed his rugby league career with St. George in the 1946 NSWRFL season after a two @-@ year absence , starting in reserve grade . His strong performances saw him promoted to first grade and that season St. George Dragons qualified for the grand final against the Balmain Tigers . Lindwall 's <unk> abilities were not on display that day , as Balmain won the game 13 – 12 , scoring three tries to St George 's four , with Lindwall missing every kick at goal . He retired from competitive rugby on the advice of <unk> to concentrate on cricket . Lindwall played 31 first @-@ grade rugby league games for St George , scoring seven tries ( then worth three points ) and kicking 123 goals for a total of 267 career points . The narrow losses in the 1942 and 1946 grand finals prevented him from emulating Herbie Collins ' unique feat of following a New South Wales Rugby League premiership victory with captaining the Australian cricket team . Lindwall 's brother Jack was , at the time of his retirement , the club 's leading try @-@ scorer with 110 . 
 = = Test career = = 
 Having retired from rugby league , Lindwall was selected to make his Ashes and home soil debut in the First Test against England in Brisbane . It was his first Test under the captaincy of Don Bradman , universally regarded as the best batsman in history . Bradman had just returned from a break . Lindwall was a fan of Bradman 's leadership , recalling that " he put me at ease straight away " and that " his presence was inspiring for all the team " . Lindwall waited for over two days to see action , coming to bat after Australia had reached 7 / 599 . He scored his first runs with 31 as Australia reached 645 . He bowled only briefly in the first innings , with 0 / 23 before being forced from the field with chickenpox , which prevented him from bowling in the second innings as Australia secured a heavy innings victory . The illness prevented Lindwall from playing in the Second Test in Sydney in what would have been his first Test in his home town . 
 Lindwall returned for the Third Test at Melbourne which saw 343 @,@ 675 spectators - second only to the 350 @,@ 534 at the Third Test on the same ground in 1936 @-@ 37 - with record receipts of £ 44 @,@ 063 . Lindwall was dismissed for only nine in Australia 's first innings , bowled by Alec Bedser . He set up a successful fast bowling partnership with Keith Miller , known for giving the English batsmen an " opening blitz " , especially Len Hutton . One English pressman wrote that this was Bodyline , to the anger of Vic Richardson , Alan Kippax and Clarrie Grimmett who had seen the real thing . Lindwall took his first Ashes wicket , having Test world record holder Len Hutton caught for two by a diving Colin McCool before having Bill Edrich leg before wicket . Lindwall later dismissed English captain Wally Hammond in the second innings . However , it was Lindwall 's batting in the second innings that was the highlight of the Test , scoring his first Test century . Lindwall and wicketkeeper Don Tallon ( 92 ) produced a counterattacking eighth wicket partnership of 154 in only 87 minutes . Lindwall was on 80 when Tallon fell and was still 19 runs short when last man Toshack came to the crease . Toshack defended grimly as Lindwall attacked and reached 100 before being caught . Lindwall brought up his century by walking three metres out of his crease and straight @-@ driving Alec Bedser to the fence . Lindwall 's innings lasted only 113 minutes and 90 balls , the second fastest in Australian Test history after Jack Gregory 's 67 @-@ ball effort in 1920 – 21 . 
 In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Lindwall came the closest to a hat @-@ trick in his entire Test career . He finished England 's innings by clean bowling three batsmen in four deliveries , with the unsuccessful ball barely missing Doug Wright 's stumps to end with 4 / 52 . Lindwall took the last four wickets in two overs , conceding two runs . He took 2 / 60 and scored 20 in another drawn match . Lindwall came into the final Test on his home ground in Sydney with a match haul of 10 / 73 in a Shield match . He continued his productive series with 7 / 63 in the first innings on a flat pitch , managing to generate enough pace to knock the bat out of Denis Compton 's hands . Lindwall took two further wickets in the second innings as Australia took a 3 – 0 series win with another innings victory . Lindwall topped the bowling averages on either side with 18 wickets at 20 @.@ 38 , in addition to his 160 runs at 32 @.@ 00 . 
 In the 1947 – 48 season , the tour by the Indian cricket team saw Lindwall take his career best bowling figures of 7 / 38 at the Adelaide Oval in the second innings of the Fourth Test . Lindwall was again the leading wicket @-@ taker for the series , with 18 wickets at 16 @.@ 88 , in addition to his 70 runs at 14 @.@ 00 . 
 In the First Test at the Gabba , Lindwall removed Vinoo Mankad and Gul Mohammad in the first over on a sticky wicket , precipitating a collapse which saw India skittled for 58 . 
 = = Invincibles = = 
 As a result , Lindwall was selected as part of Sir Donald Bradman 's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948 . There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead @-@ up to the start of the tour . Lindwall was carrying an injured leg tendon and his foot drag in the delivery stride led to <unk> in the media and among umpires as to its legality . Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders , who had Lindwall 's leg back to prime condition in a fortnight . On the public relations front . Bradman stated his firm belief that Lindwall 's delivery was fair . During the lengthy boat journey to England , Bradman emphasized to Lindwall the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action . Bradman advised Lindwall to keep his dragging rear right foot even further than usual , to avoid being no @-@ balled , and to avoid bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his action . Bradman assured Lindwall that he was an automatic selection for the Tests even if he did not take a wicket in the lead @-@ in tour matches , telling him that being passed by the umpires was the first priority . Bradman recalled how Ernie McCormick had been no @-@ balled 35 times in traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 tour , destroying his confidence . Lindwall was not no @-@ balled in the first match at Worcester , and so it remained for the rest of the tour . 
 With matters now turned to actual bowling , Lindwall 's classical bowling action evoked as much public interest as his captain 's batting . In a match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge he took 6 / 14 , to gain a psychological blow for the forthcoming Test at the same venue . Three of his victims were castled by his yorker . In the following match he twice skittled Sussex with match figures of 11 / 59 , five of whom were bowled by yorkers , as the hosts were bowled out for 86 and 138 respectively . 
 Lindwall lined up for the First Test at Trent Bridge , where he had taken six wickets in the tour game . Australia bowled first , and Lindwall took the wicket of Cyril Washbrook , before he was forced to leave the field with a groin strain with figures of 1 / 30 . Lindwall returned in Australia 's innings , batting at No. 9 without a runner , where he partnered vice @-@ captain Hassett ( 137 ) in a century partnership to lift Australia 's score to 509 to take a 344 run lead . Lindwall could not bowl in the second innings as Australia completed an eight wicket victory . 
 Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the morning of the Second Test at Lord 's two weeks later , the home of cricket . Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall 's fitness , but the bowler 's protestations was sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat , allowing Lindwall further time to recover . Lindwall contributed 15 to Australia 's total of 350 . He then took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball to Hutton . Despite this , Lindwall persevered through the pain . He had Washbrook caught behind in his fourth over and then clean bowled Edrich and Tom Dollery in the space of three balls . England were 4 / 46 and Australia firmly in control . He later returned to bowl English captain Norman Yardley after an 87 run stand with Compton , before finishing with 5 / 70 as Australia took a 135 first innings lead . Lindwall then contributed 25 as Australia declared at 7 / 460 immediately upon his dismissal , leaving England to chase a world @-@ record 596 for victory . Lindwall removed Hutton with the new ball and later returned to remove Dollery and Jim Laker without the addition of a single run to take 3 / 61 as Australia took a 409 run victory . In later years , Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice Lindwall 's pain . Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury , but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax . 
 When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test , Hutton had been dropped . The reason was said to be Hutton 's struggles with Lindwall 's short @-@ pitched bowling . The Australians were pleased , feeling that Hutton was England 's best batsman . England batted first and made 350 , with Compton making an unbeaten 145 despite being felled by a Lindwall bouncer . This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2 / 33 . Lindwall then removed George Emmett , Edrich and Jack Crapp to leave England at 5 / 119 before Compton returned to revive the innings as Lindwall ended with 4 / 99 . Lindwall came into bat at 6 / 172 with Sid Barnes forced to retire hurt and Australia facing the prospect of the follow on . He then received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich , one of which hit him in the hand , evoking cheers from the home crowd . Lindwall made 23 as Australia struggled to 221 and avoided the follow on . Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck in the second innings , bringing his tormentor Edrich to the crease . Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich , fearing that it would be interpreted as retaliation and lead to a negative media reaction . The match petered into a draw after the entire fourth day was washed out . 
 Hutton returned for the Fourth Test at Headingley and an opening partnership of 168 resulted until he was bowled by Lindwall . England ran up a large score of 496 , with Lindwall taking 2 / 79 . In reply , Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall came in at 6 / 329 . With the fall of Sam Loxton and Ron Saggers , Australia was at 8 / 355 with only Bill Johnston and Ernie Toshack remaining . Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 , an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling , dominating in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively , leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings . Lindwall took 2 / 84 before England declared on the final day , leaving Australia to chase a world Test record of 404 for victory , which they did successfully . Centuries to Bradman and Morris in a 301 @-@ run stand saw Australia seal the series 3 – 0 with a world record . 
 The final Test at The Oval saw Lindwall at his best . English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain affected pitch . Lindwall had Compton dismissed before lunch after Morris had taken a difficult catch . After the break , England had struggled to 4 / 35 , before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker . He then had Godfrey Evans , Alec Bedser and Jack Young all yorked in the space of two runs . The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket @-@ keeper Don Tallon , who caught the ball one handed at full stretch to his left . Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen . In his post @-@ lunch spell , Lindwall bowled 8 @.@ 1 overs , taking five wickets for eight runs , finishing with 6 / 20 in 16 @.@ 1 overs . Bradman described the spell as " the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket " . After Australia had replied with 389 , England were bowled out for 188 in their second innings , giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4 – 0 . Lindwall took 3 / 50 to give him 9 / 70 for the match . He ended the series as the leading wicket @-@ taker with 27 wickets at 19 @.@ 62 , and scored 191 runs at 31 @.@ 83 . The English were unable to cope with his swing , with 43 of his wickets coming after the batsmen had missed the ball and were bowled . For the entire tour , Lindwall took 86 wickets at 15 @.@ 68 and scored 405 runs at 24 @.@ 17 . Lindwall 's Test haul of 27 scalps equalled the record for an Australian fast bowler in England . Wisden recognised him by naming him as one of its five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949 , citing his ability to allow Australia to seize the initiative in all but one of the Tests by achieving early breakthroughs against their batting . Wisden said that " by whatever standard he is judged " , Lindwall must " be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers " , attributing his success to " superb control of length and direction , his change of pace and general skill , the like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning " . The ferocity of Lindwall 's bouncer often prompted opposing batsmen to retreat onto the back foot even before he had released the ball . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Upon the return of the Invincibles to Australian soil , Lindwall played in Bradman 's Testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948 . Lindwall featured prominently on the first day , smashing 104 in 86 minutes for Hassett 's XI . The match raised around 10 @,@ 000 pounds . 
 The following season in 1949 – 50 , the Australians headed to South Africa for a five Test tour . Lindwall 's partnership with Miller was broken up when the latter was omitted from the touring squad . Miller stated that he wished to be considered only as a batsman and his omission caused great controversy . In any case , Miller was drafted in as cover after Johnston was involved in a car accident at the start of the tour , although both went on to play in all five Tests . Lindwall started the tour on a poor note in the First Test at Wanderers in Johannesburg , scoring 21 and then going wicketless as Australia completed an innings victory . It was the first time that Lindwall had failed to take a wicket in both innings of a Test . His wicketless run persisted until the second innings of the Second Test in Cape Town , where he took 5 / 32 after the hosts had been forced to follow on , as Australia completed another easy victory . Lindwall then took match figures of 4 / 54 as Australia completed a hat @-@ trick of victories at Durban . Lindwall took 3 / 82 in South Africa 's only innings in the Fourth Test at Johannesburg , but was dropped for the Fifth Test , something that surprised cricket commentators . His tour had been intermittently interrupted by groin problems , fibrositis and a stomach disorder , and his 12 wickets at an average of 20 @.@ 66 at three wickets per match was below his customary rate . Overall , when fit , he was effective , with 50 wickets at 14 @.@ 58 . Lindwall forced his way back into the XI for the First Test of the 1950 @-@ 51 Ashes series against Freddie Brown 's England team . Australia struggled to 228 in its first innings with Lindwall making the second top @-@ score of 41 in supporting Neil Harvey ( 74 ) in a rearguard action . Lindwall was not required as Miller and Johnston 's medium pace reduced England to 7 / 68 on a sticky wicket before Brown declared , forcing the Australian to bat on the unfavourable pitch . Australia then declared at 7 / 32 . Lindwall yorked Reg Simpson first ball and Australia seized the initiative , reducing England to 6 / 30 before bowling them out for 122 to take the match by 70 runs . Lindwall took five wickets in the Second Test in Melbourne , two of which came in the closing stages of the English run @-@ chase . Chasing 178 , England lost Brown and Evans in consecutive overs to the second new ball and ended 28 runs short of victory . Australia went on seal the series with an innings victory in the Third Test in Sydney – Lindwall bowled Brown and Bedser before breaking Trevor Bailey 's thumb in the first innings to help Australia seize control . In the Fourth Test in Adelaide , Lindwall took 3 / 51 in England 's first innings before scoring a patient 31 in Australia 's second innings , helping to set up at target that was 274 runs too much for Brown 's men . The Fifth and final Test of the summer was to be the first Test defeat for Lindwall in the first 24 Tests of his career . Despite taking 3 / 77 in the first innings to complement the four wickets of Miller – the most in an innings by the pair during the series – England took their first win over Australia since 1938 . Lindwall had taken 15 wickets at 22 @.@ 93 for the series . 
 The 1951 – 52 season saw the arrival of the West Indies for the first time in two decades . The Caribbeans has just defeated England in England and were expected to test Australia , with the series seen as the battle between the best two teams in the world . Their batting was led by the celebrated batting trio , the three W 's : Frank Worrell , Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott . Lindwall entered the First Test in Brisbane in good form , having taken nine wickets in a Sheffield Shield match against Queensland in the lead @-@ up . His pace caught the tourists off guard , having not faced a bowler of such speed before . He took 4 / 62 in the first innings before top @-@ scoring with 61 as Australia struggled and managed to only post a first innings lead of 10 runs . Lindwall was wicketless in the second innings and Australia faced 236 to win . They were again struggling at 6 / 149 , before a sixth wicket stand of 54 between Lindwall ( 29 ) and Graeme Hole ( 45 * ) saw Australia secure a narrow three wicket victory . The Second Test in Sydney saw an increase in the amount of short @-@ pitched deliveries , leading Wisden to bemoan the " relentless bumper tactics " . Lindwall 's bowling unsettled the West Indian batsmen but their captain John Goddard felt that the tactics were legitimate and that his batsmen should counter @-@ attack . Lindwall took 4 / 66 in the first innings before scoring 48 as Australia took a 155 first innings lead . In the second innings , Lindwall took two further wickets and struck vice @-@ captain Jeff Stollmeyer in the head . At one stage , Lindwall bowled 15 bouncers in five overs . Australia went on to win the match by seven wickets . The Third Test was an uneventful one for Lindwall , taking a solitary wicket as the tourists took a six wicket victory on a sticky pitch . Lindwall had another unspectacular match in the Fourth Test with combined figures of 3 / 131 , before contributing 29 in the run chase of 260 . Australia narrowly made the target with one wicket in hand , allowing them to take a 3 – 1 series lead instead of a 2 – 2 result . The series ended with a controversial battle between Lindwall and Weekes on the final day of the Fifth Test in Sydney . The tourists resumed at 2 / 112 in pursuit of 416 for victory and were repeatedly bounced by Lindwall and Miller . During Lindwall 's sixth over , Weekes missed an attempted hook shot after hesitating . His batting partner Stollmeyer ordered him not to play the hook , something that Lindwall overheard . Lindwall responded by bowling further bouncers , which elicited uncertain responses from the batsman . Weekes repeatedly positioned himself to hook , before restraining himself , leading to further instructions from Stollmeyer and taunting from the Australians . Lindwall bowled his fourth consecutive bouncer and managed to extract an uncertain hook shot from Weekes , which resulted in his dismissal behind the wicket . Lindwall went on to take 5 / 52 for the innings and 7 / 72 for the match , securing a 4 – 1 series win . Lindwall had contributed heavily to the team 's success with bat and ball , with 21 wickets at 23 @.@ 04 and 211 runs at 26 @.@ 37 , but he was also criticised for his use of the short ball . 
 Lindwall accepted an offer to play in the Lancashire League in England during the Australian winter of 1952 , joining Nelson Cricket Club for a sum of 600 pounds and bonuses , which did not include the boat fares for him and his wife . Lindwall took 96 wickets at 8 @.@ 37 during the season and developed an inswinger on the advice of a local umpire who adamantly refused to give leg before wicket decisions to outswingers . Lindwall returned to Australia with a newborn son who has been born during his stay in Lancashire , and he was greeted by media speculation as to whether his professional sojourn had improved or detracted from his capabilities . Lindwall 's form leading into the Tests against South Africa in 1952 – 53 prompted observers to opine that he was bowling better than ever , reinforced with the inswinger and his trademark Yorker . Lindwall made 70 from a total of 148 on a sticky wicket against South Australia in Adelaide that led Miller to regard it as the best innings he had seen under such conditions . He made the score after being sent in to open the batting in the absence of Sid Barnes . 
 Lindwall showed his versatility again in the First Test in Brisbane , scoring an unbeaten 38 in the second innings to extend Australia 's lead to 373 . When South Africa attempted to chase the target , Lindwall took 5 / 60 to cut them down 96 runs short of victory . Lindwall was reunited with Miller when the latter returned from injury for the Second Test at Melbourne , and despite the old combination taking 12 wickets , with Lindwall taking match figures of 5 / 116 , Australia fell 82 runs short and South Africa had its first Test win against Australia in 42 years . The teams moved to the home ground of Miller and Lindwall for the Third Test in Sydney , and the local pair delivered , taking seven wickets between them to skittle the tourists for 173 , with Lindwall taking 4 / 40 . With Australia having taken a 270 first innings lead , Lindwall allowed Australia to seize the initiative , removing both openers in his first three overs , before ending with 4 / 72 to ensure an innings victory and a 2 – 1 series lead . The value of Lindwall and Miller were demonstrated during the final two Tests . At the Fourth Test in Adelaide , both broke down mid @-@ game and left Australia two bowlers short . Chasing 377 , the South Africans managed to stave off the bowling and secure a draw . Both were absent for the Fifth Test in Melbourne and South Africa capitalised , defeating the Australians by six wickets despite the home side having scored 520 in their first innings . The absence of Lindwall and Miller 's new ball partnership allowed South Africa to fight back and draw the series 2 – 2 , making it the first series that Australia had not won since 1938 . Lindwall had taken 19 wickets at 20 @.@ 16 in just three and a half Tests for the series , and Australia seemed unlikely to find replacements for their leading strike pair anytime soon ; their eventual successors Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson were still to become regular internationals . 
 = = 1953 : Lindwall 's peak = = 
 Lindwall returned to England in 1953 , the site of his triumph five years earlier . Lindwall was to exhibit performances that were rated higher than during the Invincibles tour . Roland Perry wrote that Lindwall " reached his zenith , producing a sustained , sensational season of brilliant , powerful and intelligent fast bowling " . In the tour matches leading up to the Test , Lindwall set about gaining a psychological advantage over England 's leading batsmen . In doing so , he could leave them in a poor state leading up to the Test , potentially curtailing their ability to win matches . In a match against Yorkshire , Lindwall bowled Hutton with an inswinger yorker , something he had developed the previous year . During a match against the country champions Surrey at The Oval , Lindwall came across Peter May , who was regarded as the best young English batsman to emerge from the post @-@ war era . Lindwall 's first over to May consisted of three inswingers and three outswingers , leaving him perplexed and uncertain about his position at top level cricket . Although Lindwall did not dismiss May , he regarded it as his best over at any level of cricket . The unsettled May was bowled in the following over by Ron Archer . Lindwall 's performances saw him regarded as the finest fast bowler of his time . 
 After Australia had been bowled out for 249 in the first innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge , Lindwall 's high paced swing yielded 5 / 57 and cut England down for 144 . However , Australia were then bowled out for only 123 , leaving England 228 for victory . They were 1 / 120 with Lindwall wicketless as rain curtailed the match . In the Second Test at Lord 's , England had reached 1 / 177 at stumps on the second day in reply to Australia 's 346 . The following day , Lindwall yorked rising star Tom Graveney and took 5 / 66 to restrict England to a lead of 26 runs . In Australia 's second innings , Lindwall scored the fastest half @-@ century in Ashes history . He took just 48 minutes to reach the mark , with two sixes and five fours . The match was drawn with Lindwall taking 2 / 26 in the second innings . Lindwall had helped to reduce England to 3 / 12 at stumps on the fourth day after removing Don Kenyon and Hutton with the new ball , but defiant batting on the final day saved the English . The Third Test was again drawn due to heavy rain , with Lindwall failing to pass double figures in either innings and taking 2 / 30 in the first innings . Hassett won the toss for the fourth consecutive Test at Headingley and sent England into bat . In front of his home crowd in Yorkshire , Hutton was yorked second ball from a pacy <unk> yorker . Lindwall produced a display of fast and accurate pace bowling , taking 5 / 54 from 35 overs as England managed only 169 . After Australia took a 97 run lead , Lindwall took 3 / 104 to help leave the tourists with a victory target of 177 . This was not before dour English all rounder Trevor Bailey attempted to stone @-@ wall an Australian victory by batting for over four hours for 38 runs . Along with Miller , the pair took 14 wickets between them , displaying their pivotal role in Australia 's bowling attack , especially in the absence of the injured Johnston , who was unavailable for most of the tour . Hutton ordered Bedser and Bailey to bowl leg theory from a long run , sending balls down the leg side to prevent the Australians from scoring . England held on for a draw with Australia 30 runs short when time ran out . The teams met at The Oval for the deciding Test and Australia could manage 275 after winning the toss with Lindwall striking a quickfire 62 noted for an array of off drives to top score and push the total to respectability . Lindwall then took 4 / 70 but it was not enough to prevent England taking a 31 run lead . Australia collapsed for 162 in the second innings , with the Surrey spin twins of Jim Laker and Tony Lock taking nine wickets between them . This left England 132 to win , something they achieved with eight wickets intact . Lindwall was unable to remove any of the Englishmen . 
 The 1 – 0 loss was Australia 's first series defeat since the notorious Bodyline series twenty years earlier that had motivated Lindwall to take up fast bowling . Despite Australia 's troubles , Lindwall maintained his high standards , taking 26 wickets at an average of only 18 @.@ 84 , as well as contributing two fifties for a total of 159 runs at 17 @.@ 66 . For the entire tour , he had taken 85 wickets at 16 @.@ 40 , only one less than in 1948 . At 32 years of age , Lindwall still maintained his high pace , but had developed more subtleties and an inswinger . Fingleton , now a journalist said " One wonders once more at Lindwall 's amazing capacity to bowl this ball whenever he feels like it " . 
 = = Transfer to Queensland = = 
 In November 1953 , Lindwall was given employment in Brisbane for the bus company Cobb and Co . , but continued to play for New South Wales for the remainder of the 1953 – 54 season before being dropped for the final match of the domestic season . The move generated criticism from the cricketing community who felt that Lindwall 's service merited a more dignified farewell . Lindwall had a mediocre season by his standards , taking only 22 wickets at 30 @.@ 14 . His batting was even more ineffective , scoring only 14 runs in six innings . Such performances led to media speculation that Lindwall was in decline . Lindwall began his career for Queensland at the start of the 1954 – 55 season and did well enough to retain his place for the First Test of England 's Ashes tour . In front of his adopted home crowd , Lindwall returned to form with the bat , scoring an unbeaten 64 as Australia amassed 8 / 601 after being sent in by Hutton . Lindwall compounded Hutton 's match by removing him for four and finished with 3 / 27 as England were skittled for 190 and forced to follow on . He took two further wickets as England fell to an innings victory . After the match , English paceman Frank Tyson asked Lindwall for advice on how to bowl a more effective bouncer . Lindwall promised that he would show Tyson on their next meeting , which happened to be the Second Test in Sydney . Lindwall bowled Tyson in the first innings and in the second innings , Lindwall gave him a bouncer which skidded towards Tyson 's throat . Tyson turned his head and was hit the back of the skull , His batting partner Bill Edrich shouting " My God , Lindy , you 've killed him ! " . Tyson was taken to hospital for X @-@ rays and was bowled upon his return by Lindwall . He later said " thanks so much for showing me the bouncer " . Lindwall took five wickets for the match but Tyson returned to win the low scoring match for England . Lindwall struggled in the Third Test while carrying a leg strain and a bout of hepatitis , taking only 1 / 111 for the match as England won again . He then pulled a muscle in the Sheffield Shield match and was sidelined as England sealed the series with a third consecutive win . Lindwall returned for the Fifth Test and dismissed Hutton early , before ending with 3 / 77 . The third of his wickets was Bailey , giving Lindwall his 100th wicket in Ashes Tests . England amassed their highest total of the series but Australia managed to hang on for a draw after being forced to follow on . Lindwall ended with 14 wickets at 27 @.@ 21 for the season , which was below his usual standards as Australia were convincingly defeated 3 – 1 . The critics called for sweeping changes to the team . O 'Reilly , Lindwall 's mentor , was now a journalist and called for new selectors , claiming that Australia was at its worst for four decades . 
 Lindwall had no intentions to retire . He continued onto the early 1955 tour of the West Indies , the first by an Australian team to the Caribbean . Lindwall was determined to enjoy himself , having recovered from his recent illness . By day , he and Miller battled with the three W 's but at night they socialised . However , Lindwall needed respite and dietary discipline in order to completely ward off his hepatitis . He was no longer the <unk> that Miller once knew . After Australia had made 9 / 515 , Lindwall took a match total of 6 / 124 , as the hosts were forced to follow on in the First Test at Sabina Park in Kingston , Jamaica . Australia went on to win by nine wickets . The team 's travelled to Queen 's Park in Trinidad for the Second Test , where the West Indies batted first and made 382 . This time Lindwall bowled a long spell of 24 @.@ 5 overs , and eventually prized out six of the West Indians for the cost of 95 runs . The culmination of this was a spell of 4 / 16 . Australia replied with 9 / 600 , with Lindwall contributing an unbeaten 37 with the bat . Lindwall 's match soured in the second innings when he broke down with an achilles tendon problem as the match ended in a draw . Lindwall recovered for the start of the Third Test at Bourda in Georgetown , Guyana . Lindwall had a quiet time in a spin dominated game , taking two wickets in an eight @-@ wicket Australian victory . Australia won the toss and batted in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown , Barbados . Australia had already reached 6 / 439 when Lindwall came to the crease . In a highly aggressive innings , he reached his fifty in 69 minutes and was unbeaten on 80 at stumps . The next morning , he went on the make his second Test century , scoring 118 with two sixes and 16 fours . It was his second century at Test level , eight years after his first , but showed the same counter @-@ attacking aggression . Lindwall had another quiet match with two wickets in another high scoring draw with both teams amassing more than 500 in the first innings . Lindwall finished the series with four wickets in the Fifth Test in Jamaica as Australia completed a 3 – 0 series win with another innings triumph . In a high scoring series , Lindwall had taken 20 wicket at 31 @.@ 85 while also scoring 187 runs at 37 @.@ 40 , a strong all round performance . 
 Lindwall performed steadily during the 1955 – 56 , which was purely domestic . Lindwall was appointed the Queensland captain , and he took 30 wickets at 28 @.@ 97 and made 383 runs at 32 @.@ 55 . Lindwall was duly selected for the 1956 Ashes tour . Like the rest of the team , Lindwall had a poor tour on a series of dry and underprepared pitches designed to favour the Surrey spin twins of Laker and Lock . Lindwall 's tour was further compounded by a recurrence of his groin injury . He took 0 / 43 in the first innings of the opening Test at Trent Bridge and broke down , being unable to bowl in the second innings . This forced him to miss the Second Test at Lord 's , and he returned for a disastrous Third Test at Headingley . Although Lindwall took 3 / 67 in the first innings , Australia was forced to follow on and fell to its first innings loss since 1938 , as Laker and Lock ravaged the Australians . Lindwall took two wickets in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford but the results were the same ; Australia suffered another innings defeat in what was known as " Laker 's Test " – the off @-@ spinner took 19 of the Australian wickets to fall . Lindwall bade farewell to Test cricket in England at The Oval , taking two wickets . Overall , it had been a disappointing tour ; Lindwall had been fit for three and a half Tests and managed only seven wickets at 34 @.@ 14 Lindwall 's performance reignited calls for the aging paceman to be axed from the team . Lindwall however , had other ideas . 
 Following the England tour , the Australians returned home via a tour to the Indian subcontinent . The first stop was Karachi , where Australia played its first ever Test against Pakistan . Lindwall 's poor run continued , scoring two and a duck and taking match figures of 1 / 64 as Australia fell to a nine wicket defeat . The team travelled to Madras for the first of three Tests in India . Lindwall briefly bowled on the first morning without success before succumbing to a severe stomach bug . He took no further part in the first innings and spent the next two days in bed . Lindwall briefly got out of his bed on day three to bat , making only eight as Australia took a 158 run first innings lead . He hauled himself out of bed on the fourth day , and cut through the Indians in three spells , taking 7 / 43 in an innings victory . 
 The Second Test in Bombay was the only time that Lindwall was to captain Australia in a Test match . Captain Johnson and his deputy Miller were both injured , leaving the bowling depleted . Ron Archer was injured and unavailable as Australia bowled first in extremely hot conditions . The situation worsened throughout the match as pacemen Alan Davidson and Pat Crawford were hindered by stomach bugs and hip strains respectively during the game . Leg spinner Richie Benaud could not bowl for part of the match after being affected by a fever and left arm orthodox spinner John Wilson pulled a muscle midway through his debut . This left Lindwall and batting all rounder Ken Mackay as the only fully fit bowling options . Australia bowled out India for 251 , before a strong batting effort led by Neil Harvey and Jim Burke , both of whom made centuries , saw Australia make 7 / 523 . Lindwall contributed a hard @-@ hitting unbeaten 48 at the end . Australia 's depleted bowling told in the home side 's second innings , as the visitors were only able to prise out five wickets and match ended in a draw , with Indian captain Polly Umrigar batting for six hours for a defiant 78 . Lindwall finished the tour with scores of eight and 28 in the Third Test in Madras . In a low scoring match in which all four innings finished under 190 , Lindwall took match figures of 3 / 41 in a 94 run victory . It was a successful series for Lindwall , taking 12 wickets at 16 @.@ 58 and scoring 92 runs at 30 @.@ 66 . 
 = = Omission and comeback = = 
 The end of the tour represented a changing of the guard in Australian cricket . In their late 30s , Johnson and Miller retired from first @-@ class cricket . In the 1956 – 57 season , Lindwall took 27 wickets at 23 @.@ 74 and made 243 runs at 27 @.@ 00 . Having had a successful series in the most recent international fixtures , Lindwall had no reason to expect anything but a continuation of his senior role in the team . Furthermore , having captained the team in the absence of Johnson and Miller , Lindwall was the now the player with the most seniority in terms of leadership . However , when the team for the 1957 – 58 South African tour was announced , Lindwall 's name was omitted altogether . Lindwall heard the news on the radio while he was working , having not being given prior notice . After three consecutive Ashes defeats during Australia 's decline in the mid @-@ 1950s , the selectors had turned to a radical youth policy in an attempt to reverse the slide . Ian Craig was made youngest Australia 's captain at the age of 22 , having played only six Tests without securing a regular place in the team . The pacemen selected were Davidson , Ian Meckiff , Ron Gaunt and John Drennan . Davidson had managed only 16 wickets at 34 @.@ 06 in 12 Tests , while the remaining three had yet to play a Test . While Craig 's men defeated South Africa 3 – 0 , Lindwall continued his consistent performances for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield , with 26 wickets at 25 @.@ 77 and 274 runs at 34 @.@ 25 . During the seasons , Lindwall broke Ernie Jones ' record of 209 wickets in Shield competitions in his 54th match in the competition . 
 During the winter of 1958 , nearing his 37th birthday , Lindwall stepped up his bid to reclaim his Test place . He committed him to an intense fitness program that included a 5 km daily run followed by vigorous exercises to increase his abdominal and back strength . He set up equipment in his garage . Lindwall was determined to add to his Test tally of 212 wickets , which was just four behind the Australian record of Clarrie Grimmett . He was unmoved by a 6000 @-@ pound offer from an English newspaper to cover the 1958 – 59 Ashes series as a journalist , instead wanting to play in the series . 
 The fruit of Lindwall 's fitness regime ripened in the early Shield matches of the 1958 – 59 season and he sent a message to the selectors when England arrived in Brisbane for a tour match before the First Test . Lindwall took 5 / 57 in the first innings , dismissing Watson , Milton , Colin Cowdrey , Trevor Bailey and Jim Laker . He removed both openers for seven in the second innings before rain curtailed the match , leaving Lindwall with match figures of 7 / 73 . Unfortunately from his point of view , none of the selection committee attended the match . Lindwall was overlooked as the selectors persisted with the winning combination that toured South Africa . His prospects of a recall appeared even more remote after Australia won both of the first two Tests , with Davidson and Meckiff <unk> England for 87 in the second innings of the Second Test , taking nine wickets each for the match . Meckiff was injured during the Third Test , leaving him in doubt for the Fourth Test . In the meantime , Lindwall had a Shield match away against South Australia to make a final claim for a recall . The hosts batted first in stifling heat around 42 degrees on a batting pitch , and Lindwall delivered 41 eight @-@ ball overs to take 7 / 92 . Lindwall received a standing ovation for his performances in unfavourable conditions and was greeted by Bradman , the chairman of selectors . Lindwall avoided Bradman 's inquiries as to whether he had any injury worries , fearing it would hinder his chances of selection . 
 Lindwall was rewarded with a recall for the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval at the age of 37 . After scoring 19 in Australia 's first innings of 476 , Lindwall was restored to his role of opening the bowling , this time with Davidson . He took match figures of 3 / 136 as Australia took a 3 – 0 lead . This left Lindwall one wicket short of Grimmett , with Meckiff recovered and ready to resume his place in the Fifth Test in Melbourne . The selectors retained Lindwall for the final match , instead dropping batsman Les Favell to accommodate Meckiff . Australia bowled first and Lindwall equalled Grimmett 's record by having Bailey caught in the slips by Davidson . He took two difficult low slips catches but could not take the wicket that would move him ahead of Grimmett , finishing with 1 / 36 . Lindwall opened the bowling in the second innings with 28 @,@ 000 fans awaiting a new record . He beat Bailey with two outswingers in his first over before bowling him for a duck to move ahead of Grimmett . Lindwall took two further wickets to end with 3 / 37 as Australia completed a 4 – 0 series victory . Lindwall finished his resurgent season with 40 wickets at 20 @.@ 55 . 
 At the age of 38 , Lindwall made his final appearances for Australia during the 1959 – 60 tour of the Indian subcontinent , which saw three and five Tests against Pakistan and India respectively . The tour was marred by illness and injury , allowing him to play in only half of the Tests . Lindwall played in two Tests against either nation with only moderate results : he took nine wickets at 38 @.@ 22 and scored 38 runs at 12 @.@ 66 . Lindwall finished with 228 Test wickets , eight wickets behind Alec Bedser 's then world record of 236 wickets . In his last Test innings , Lindwall scored ten , which took his tally to 1502 runs , making him the first player to score 1500 runs and take 200 wickets in Test cricket .

 Lindwall , widely regarded as one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time , bowled with a classical and artistic side @-@ on bowling action . David Frith wrote that " there was a balance , rhythmic run , a build @-@ up " and an " ecstasy " in his smooth delivery action . Richie Benaud said that Lindwall was " technically the best fast bowler " that he ever saw . During the 1950s , Lindwall 's action was copied by young children and a number of first @-@ class Australian bowlers , including Ron Gaunt , John Power and Barry Fisher consciously copied his action . Alan Davidson , who succeeded Lindwall as Australia 's pace spearhead , labelled him as " the best fast bowler I ever saw " . Lindwall 's childhood hero Harold Larwood rated Dennis Lillee to be equal to Lindwall " but not ahead of him " . Following Lindwall 's tour of England in 1953 , his English counterpart Alec Bedser said that Lindwall was " the best fast bowler I 've seen , because of his variety and control " . Lindwall was particularly known for his trademark outswinger , which swung late and at high pace . Fred Trueman believed that Lindwall 's ability to simultaneously swing the ball and at such pace and accuracy was matched only by himself and Wes Hall . Frank Tyson wrote that " he appears to be just jogging his fifteen yards up to the stumps - until the last couple of strides of his approach , when he suddenly explodes into his delivery stride ... when he releases the ball , his bowling arm is so low that it borders on the round @-@ arm " . Lindwall 's ability to swing the ball at high pace allowed him to repeatedly breach the defences of his opponents ; of his 228 Test wickets , 98 were bowled and another 31 were leg before wicket . Lindwall 's repertoire was reinforced with a dangerous yorker and bouncer , and changes of pace . As Tyson said " who is not ' Lindy 's bunny ' when he slots his yorker in the right spot ? " . In 1952 he developed an inswinger and then coupled it with his yorker , which homed into the feet of batsmen at high pace . Denis Compton said that Lindwall had the subtleties of a slow bowler , saying that he " raised what is considered to be the labouring force of cricket [ fast bowling ] to an artform with his tactical shrewdness , control and variations " . Lindwall 's emergence after the Second World War along with his new ball partner Keith Miller heralded a new era in cricket . The pair were regarded as the two best fast bowlers of their era , and signalled a change in the cricket landscape , which had been dominated during the interwar period by batsmen . Together the pair formed a new ball fast @-@ bowling combination regarded as one of the best in Test history . During the 1948 tour of England , the hosts had agreed to have a new ball available every 55 overs , and the Australians used this to unleash Lindwall and Miller on the Englishmen with a shiny new ball . The pair often targeted the leading opposition batsmen , particular England 's Len Hutton and Denis Compton with large amounts of short @-@ pitched bowling , raising fast bowling to a new standard . Hutton 's battles with Lindwall were regarded as one of the key match @-@ ups in Anglo @-@ Australian battles of the time , and Hutton said his opponent had the ability to " strike at will " . Hutton felt that Lindwall 's bouncers were the best that he faced , saying of their accuracy : " You had to play them or be hit " . Lindwall refused to bowl bouncers at tailenders , saying that " If the day ever came when I have to bowl bouncers at tailenders then I won 't deserve to play for Australia " . When England developed quality pace bowlers of their own in the 1950s , Hutton was captain and he implemented a similar strategy to that executed by Lindwall and Miller . In retirement , Lindwall went on to mentor Lillee , who went on to break the Test world record for wicket @-@ taking .

 Upon returning to Australia , Lindwall played in Queensland 's final Shield match of the season , before retiring from representative cricket . However , he continued to play for Northern Districts in Brisbane 's district competition , as well as making sporadic first class appearances for private teams , which played in New Zealand , the West Indies , Rhodesia , Kenya and Pakistan . 
 Lindwall , Miller and Arthur Morris were the first beneficiaries of the New South Wales Cricket Association players ' benefit payment plan , set up to reward New South Welshmen who had played for Australia in Tests . Lindwall was a Queensland selector for five seasons and an Australian selector from 1979 – 80 to 1982 – 83 . He was given life membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1960 , the NSWCA is 1979 and the Queensland Cricket Association in 1991 . In 1965 , he received an MBE for his services to cricket . In retirement , he and his wife Peggy ran a florist 's business after 1965 . He and Peggy had two children , a son and a daughter . In the early 1970s , Lindwall mentored upcoming Western Australian paceman Dennis Lillee , who went on to hold the world record for Test wickets . After the Seventh Test in the 1970 @-@ 71 Ashes series Lillee asked Keith Miller for Lindwall 's address as " He might just be able to teach me how to bowl " . He published two books , Flying Stumps in 1954 and The Challenging Tests in 1961 . Lindwall died at age 74 at <unk> , Brisbane , Queensland . Lindwall was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members . In 2000 , he was named in the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century as one of its opening bowlers .

 Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was an armored cruiser built for the French Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . She was the second and final member of the Edgar Quinet class , the last class of armored cruiser to be built by the French Navy . She was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient in June 1906 , launched in March 1908 , and commissioned in August 1911 . Armed with a main battery of fourteen 194 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) guns , she was more powerful than most other armored cruisers , but she had entered service more than two years after the first battlecruiser — HMS Invincible — had rendered the armored cruiser obsolescent . Waldeck @-@ Rousseau nevertheless proved to be a workhorse of the French Mediterranean Fleet . 
 After the outbreak of World War I , Waldeck @-@ Rousseau joined the main French fleet that blockaded the southern end of the Adriatic to prevent the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy from operating in the Mediterranean . In October and November , Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was twice attacked by Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boats but she escaped unscathed in both engagements . She thereafter alternated between stints in the southern Adriatic and patrols in the eastern Mediterranean once the Ottoman Empire joined the war in November . 
 After the war , the British and French intervened in the Russian Civil War ; this included a major naval deployment to the Baltic Sea , which included Waldeck @-@ Rousseau . Shortly after arriving , her crew mutinied due to poor living conditions and a desire to return to France . The unrest was quickly suppressed , and Waldeck @-@ Rousseau joined the effort to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks . In May 1929 , the ship was sent to French Indochina to serve as the flagship of the Far East squadron . She remained there until May 1932 , when she returned to France , where she was decommissioned and hulked . Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 1941 – 44 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was 158 @.@ 9 meters ( 521 ft ) long overall , with a beam of 21 @.@ 51 m ( 70 @.@ 6 ft ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 41 m ( 27 @.@ 6 ft ) . She displaced 13 @,@ 995 metric tons ( 13 @,@ 774 long tons ; 15 @,@ 427 short tons ) . Her power plant consisted of three triple @-@ expansion engines powered by forty coal @-@ fired Niclausse boilers , which were trunked into six funnels in two groups of three . Her engines were rated at 36 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and produced a top speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . She had a crew of between 859 and 892 officers and enlisted men . 
 Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was armed with a main battery of fourteen 194 mm ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) 50 @-@ caliber M1902 guns ; four were in twin gun turrets forward and aft , with three single gun turrets on either broadside . The last four guns were mounted in casemates abreast the main and aft conning towers . Close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of twenty 9 @-@ pounder guns in casemates in the ship 's hull . She was also equipped with two 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes submerged in the hull . She was protected with a armored belt that was 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick amidships . The gun turrets had 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick plating , while the casemates had marginally thinner protection , at 194 mm . The main conning tower had 200 mm thick sides . 
 During World War I , several 14 @-@ pounder and 9 @-@ pounder anti @-@ aircraft guns were added , with the older 9 @-@ pounder guns being removed to keep displacement down . In 1930 , she was modified to carry a reconnaissance seaplane .

 Waldeck @-@ Rousseau , named for the recently deceased Prime Minister of France , Pierre Waldeck @-@ Rousseau , was ordered on 31 July 1905 and was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient on 16 June 1906 . She was launched on 4 March 1908 , and fitting out work was completed in time to begin sea trials in January 1911 . While on her acceptance trials on 2 February , she struck a submerged object that bent her port propeller shaft and damaged the screw . Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was completed in August ; the ship was the most powerful armored cruiser completed by France , but she entered service two years after the British battlecruiser HMS Invincible , which rendered the armored cruiser obsolescent as a warship type . Her lengthy construction interfered with the scheduled keel @-@ laying for the new predreadnought battleship Mirabeau , which could not be started until Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was launched . After entering service the new cruiser was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet , based in Toulon . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was under repair at Toulon owing to a grounding incident off Golfe @-@ Juan during a hurricane on 22 February . Work was completed by 5 September , and by the end of the month she had joined the French fleet blockading the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy at the southern end of the Adriatic Sea . On 17 October she briefly engaged Austro @-@ Hungarian forces off Cattaro ; she fired at the Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boat SM U @-@ 4 that had tried to torpedo her and engaged several destroyers that were supported by an airplane before she broke off the action to rejoin the French fleet . She was unsuccessfully attacked a second time by an Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boat while on patrol on 4 November . On this occasion , she was patrolling with the cruiser Ernest Renan ; Waldeck @-@ Rousseau engaged the submarine and forced it to withdraw . 
 On 30 November , the cruiser was transferred to the Ionian Sea and was based in Salonika . While there , Waldeck @-@ Rousseau patrolled the eastern Mediterranean and the coast of the Levant . She returned to Malta on 13 December , where she resumed patrols in the southern Adriatic . In early March 1915 Waldeck @-@ Rousseau returned to the Ionian . From 25 April to 1 May she briefly patrolled in the Strait of Otranto at the southern end of the Adriatic , before returning to her station in the Ionian . On 8 January 1916 , Waldeck @-@ Rousseau , her sister Edgar Quinet , Ernest Renan and Jules Ferry embarked a contingent of Chasseurs <unk> ( mountain troops ) to seize the Greek island of Corfu . The cruisers sent the troops ashore on the night of 10 January ; the Greek officials on the island protested the move but offered no resistance . For the rest of the war , she patrolled in the Ionian and eastern Mediterranean but did not see further action .

 Starting in 1919 , the French Navy joined the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks . Waldeck @-@ Rousseau arrived in early 1919 , flying the flag of Admiral <unk> . While in Odessa on 26 – 29 April 1919 , sailors aboard Waldeck @-@ Rousseau mutinied ; the ship , which had just arrived from France with a fresh crew , had not yet had contact with Russian revolutionaries . Nevertheless , the crew had quickly grown weary of poor living conditions and wanted to return to France . After three days , the unrest was suppressed and she returned to service , though <unk> was relieved of command for failing to control his crew . The Vietnamese communist Tôn Đức Thắng , who was at that time serving in the French Navy , claimed to have participated in the mutiny , but French records do not list him as having been aboard Waldeck @-@ Rousseau at the time . At the same time , the crews of other French ships in Constantinople became restive , and so Admiral Jean @-@ Françoise @-@ Charles Amet refused to allow Waldeck @-@ Rousseau to join the rest of the fleet there , owing to her crew 's earlier mutiny . 
 On 26 March 1920 , Waldeck @-@ Rousseau provided gunfire support to White Russian forces outside Novorossiysk , along with the British dreadnought battleship Emperor of India . The Anglo @-@ French fleet then evacuated the White Russians from the city to the Crimean peninsula . Later in the year , she assisted in the evacuation of General Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel 's army . The motley collection of ships departed the Crimea on 14 November ; Waldeck @-@ Rousseau steamed at the rear of the fleet as it made its way to Constantinople . 
 Waldeck @-@ Rousseau remained in the Black Sea while the fleet continued on into the Mediterranean and eventually to internment at Bizerte in Algeria . On 16 December 1922 , the French transport SS Vinh Long caught fire while in the Sea of Marmara . The United States destroyer USS Bainbridge arrived on the scene first and took off the survivors , which numbered 482 of the 495 crew and passengers that had been aboard . Waldeck @-@ Rousseau arrived shortly thereafter , and the survivors were transferred to the larger cruiser , since she could better accommodate them . For his part in the rescue operations , the commander of Bainbridge — Lieutenant Commander Walter Edwards — was awarded the Medal of Honor , the French Legion of Honour , and the British Distinguished Service Order . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 She later served as the flagship of the French Far East squadron , having left France on 10 May 1929 . She arrived on 22 June and replaced the cruiser Jules Michelet as the flagship . Waldeck @-@ Rousseau served there until May 1932 , when she departed for France , having been replaced by the light cruiser Primauguet . Waldeck @-@ Rousseau reached France on 3 July . After returning to France , she was decommissioned and placed in reserve . On 14 June 1936 , she was stricken and subsequently converted into a hulk at <unk> , outside Brest . Waldeck @-@ Rousseau was scuttled on 18 June 1940 at Brest and ultimately broken up for scrap between 1941 and 1944 . 
 = John of Brittany , Earl of Richmond = 
 John of Brittany , called in French Jean de Bretagne ( c . 1266 – 17 January 1334 ) , 4th Earl of Richmond , was an English nobleman and a member of the Ducal house of Brittany , the House of Dreux . He entered royal service in England under his uncle Edward I , and also served Edward II . On 15 October 1306 he received his father 's title of Earl of Richmond . He was named Guardian of Scotland in the midst of England 's conflicts with Scotland and in 1311 Lord <unk> during the baronial rebellion against Edward II . 
 John of Brittany served England as a soldier and as a diplomat but was otherwise politically inactive in comparison to other Earls of his time . He was a capable diplomat , valued by both Edward I and Edward II for his negotiating skills . John was never married , and upon his death his title and estates fell to his nephew , John III , Duke of Brittany . Although he was generally loyal to his first cousin Edward II during the times of baronial rebellion , he eventually supported the coup of Isabella and Mortimer . After Edward II abdicated in favour of his son Edward III of England , John retired to his estates in France and died in his native Brittany in 1334 with no known issue . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John was the second surviving son of John II , Duke of Brittany , and his wife Beatrice , who together had three sons and three daughters who survived to adulthood . Beatrice was the daughter of Henry III of England , which made John the nephew of Henry 's son and heir Edward I. His father held the title of Earl of Richmond , but was little involved in English political affairs . John was raised at the English court together with Edward I 's son Henry , who died in 1274 . He participated in tournaments in his <unk> but never distinguished himself in his early roles as a soldier . 
 = = Service to Edward I = = 
 When in 1294 the French king confiscated King Edward 's Duchy of Aquitaine , John travelled to France but failed to take Bordeaux . During Easter of 1295 he had to flee the town of Rions . In January 1297 he shared defeat at the siege of Bellegarde with Henry de Lacy , Earl of Lincoln . After this defeat , he returned to England . 
 Despite his poor results in France he remained highly regarded by his uncle King Edward I , who treated him almost as a son . After his return to England John became involved in the Scottish Wars . He was probably at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 . He was certainly at the Siege of Caerlaverock in 1300 . The nobles who joined Edward I at the Siege of Caerlaverock , including John of Brittany , were commemorated in the Roll of Caerlaverock which named each noble and described their banner . In this roll , the banner and description of John of Brittany immediately follows that of his uncle King Edward I 
 His father , the Duke of Brittany , died in 1305 , and was succeeded as Duke by John 's elder brother , Arthur . The following year Edward I invested John with his father 's other title , Earl of Richmond . In addition Edward I appointed him Guardian of Scotland , a position which was confirmed upon the accession of Edward II in 1307 . 
 = = Service to Edward II = = 
 The English court viewed John of Brittany as a trusted diplomat . He was a skilled negotiator , and his French connections were a useful asset . By 1307 he was also one of the kingdom 's oldest earls . As the relationship between Edward II and his nobility deteriorated , Richmond remained loyal to the king ; in 1309 he went on an embassy to Pope Clement V on behalf of Edward 's favourite Piers Gaveston . John was allegedly Gaveston 's close personal friend , and did not share the antagonistic attitudes held by certain other earls . 
 = = = Lord Ordainers = = = 
 By 1310 the relationship between Edward II and his earls had deteriorated to the point where a committee of earls took control of government from the king . The earls disobeyed a royal order not to carry arms to parliament , and in full military attire presented a demand to the king for the appointment of a commission of reform . At the heart of the deteriorating situation was the peers ' opinion of Edward II 's relationship with Piers Gaveston , and his reputedly outrageous behavior . On 16 March 1310 , the king agreed to the appointment of Ordainers , who were to be in charge of the reform of the royal household . John of Brittany was one of eight earls appointed to this committee of 21 , referred to as the Lords Ordainers . He was among the Ordainers considered loyal to Edward II and was also by this time one of the older remaining earls . 
 John then travelled to France for diplomatic negotiations , before returning to England . Gaveston was exiled by the Ordainers but later made an irregular return . Gaveston was killed in June 1312 by Thomas of Lancaster and other nobles . It fell upon John , together with Gilbert de Clare , Earl of Gloucester , to reconcile the two parties after this event . In 1313 he followed Edward II on a state visit to France , and thereafter generally remained a trusted subject . In 1318 he witnessed the Treaty of Leake , which restored Edward to full power . 
 = = = War with Scotland = = = 
 In 1320 he again accompanied Edward II to France , and the next year he carried out peace negotiations with the Scots . When in 1322 Thomas of Lancaster rebelled and was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge , Richmond was present at his trial , and when Lancaster was sentenced to death . After this , the English invaded Scotland only to have their army starved when Robert the Bruce burned the country before them . The Bruce brought his army into England and crossed the Solway Firth in the west , making his way in a south @-@ easterly direction towards Yorkshire ; he brought many troops recruited in Argyll and the Isles . The boldness and speed of the attack soon exposed Edward II to danger , even in his own land . On his return from Scotland , the king had taken up residence at Rievaulx Abbey with Queen Isabella . His peace was interrupted when the Scots made a sudden and unexpected approach in mid @-@ October . All that stood between them and a royal prize was a large English force under the command of John of Brittany . John had taken up a position on <unk> Moor , between Rievaulx and Byland Abbey . To dislodge John from his strong position on the high ground , Bruce used the same tactics that brought victory at the earlier Battle of the Pass of Brander . As Moray and Douglas charged uphill a party of Highlanders scaled the cliffs on the English flank and charged downhill into John of Brittany 's rearguard . Resistance crumbled , and the Battle of Old Byland turned into a rout . John himself was taken prisoner and given a tongue lashing for his cowardice by Robert the Bruce . John remained in captivity until 1324 , when he was released for a ransom of 14 @,@ 000 marks . 
 After his release , he continued his diplomatic activities in Scotland and France . 
 = = Final Years = = 
 In March 1325 John of Brittany made a final return to France , where for the first time he made himself a clear opponent of Edward II . His lands in England were confiscated by the Crown . In France , John aligned himself with Queen Isabella , Edward II 's wife , who had been sent on a diplomatic mission to France , and had disobeyed her husband 's orders to return to England . . Later when Edward II was forced to abdicate and his son Edward III ascended to the English throne , John of Brittany 's English lands were restored . He spent his last years on his French estates , and he remained largely cut off from English political affairs . He died on 17 January 1334 , and was buried in the church of the Franciscans in Nantes . 
 John of Brittany never married and as far as is known had no issue . He was succeeded as Earl of Richmond by his nephew John ( Arthur 's son ) .

 = Dino Crisis = 
 Dino Crisis is a survival horror video game developed and produced by Capcom originally for the PlayStation console in 1999 . It is the first installment in the Dino Crisis series and was developed by the same team behind Capcom 's Resident Evil series , including director Shinji Mikami , and shares many similarities with it . The story follows Regina , a special operations agent sent with a team to investigate a secluded island research facility . Finding the place overrun with dinosaurs , Regina must fight through the facility to discover its secrets and ultimately escape alive . 
 Instead of the pre @-@ rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil games that preceded it , Dino Crisis uses an original real @-@ time engine with 3D environments . Gameplay features traditional survival horror mechanics including action and puzzles , and it was developed to have more consistent visceral terror with the dinosaurs being quick , intelligent , and violent . Capcom would later market the game as " panic horror " as opposed to " survival horror " due to these design changes . The team used carnivorous animals as references for animating the dinosaurs and programming their behaviors . Mikami 's vision for the game was not completely fulfilled , as he wanted to develop more complex dinosaur artificial intelligence . However , he did believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite hardware limitations . 
 Dino Crisis was a critical and commercial success , with the PlayStation version selling over 2 @.@ 4 million copies . Critics drew heavy comparisons to Resident Evil , with some describing it as " Resident Evil with dinosaurs . " They also praised the game 's intensity , graphics , and gameplay . Some criticism was directed towards the lack of dinosaur variety , repetitive environments , and tedious puzzles . Dino Crisis was ported to the Sega Dreamcast and Microsoft Windows in 2000 , and was re @-@ released for the PlayStation Network in 2006 . Two different versions for the Game Boy Color were in development , but both were cancelled . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Dino Crisis features survival horror gameplay that is very similar to Capcom 's early Resident Evil titles . Regina can walk , run , turn , <unk> , push and climb objects , and perform a 180 @-@ degree turn . A map is available which will show Regina 's location , destination , save points , and locked doors . Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them . Some doors are locked by a <unk> ( digital disk key ) device . To open these doors , the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door . There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders . 
 Regina 's inventory may include key items , weapons , ammo , and medical supplies — the latter two of which she can only hold a limited amount . She can also mix certain items in order to upgrade them or make completely new ones , such as anesthetic darts . These items can be stored in " emergency boxes " , which need be unlocked with special items called " plugs " before they are usable . Each emergency box is color coded as either red , green , or yellow . Each box can access the contents of any other unlocked box of the same color . 
 The player can move with weapons drawn and use automatic targeting functions . Enemies can knock Regina 's weapon out of her hand , at which point she 'll have to retrieve it . Sometimes " <unk> " may flash on the screen in perilous situations , at which point the player should push all the controller buttons as rapidly as possible to survive . If Regina becomes injured , she will hold her arm or struggle to walk . Med Paks can be used to heal Regina 's health . Sometimes a trail of blood may appear , indicating that Regina is bleeding and will continue to lose health . <unk> can be used to stop bleeding injuries . Two types of medical supplies are available in the game : Med Paks , which heals player health , and <unk> , which stop bleeding injuries . If Regina dies , the player may continue from the room she died in . After five " Continues " are exhausted , the player must continue from their last save point . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The story of Dino Crisis takes place on a fictional location known as Ibis Island in the year 2009 . The Secret Operation Raid Team ( SORT ) has sent an agent , Tom , to investigate a research facility . During the recon mission , he learns that Dr. Edward Kirk , a world @-@ renowned scientist who was reported dead three years ago , is leading a secret weapons project within the facility . SORT sends four agents ( Regina , Gail , Rick , and Cooper ) to acquire Kirk and return him to custody . The team arrives on the island under cover of darkness , dropping in via parachute . Cooper is blown off course and lands in the jungle away from the others . Lost in the dark , he is chased down by a Tyrannosaurus rex and eaten . The other three agents , unaware of his death , proceed with the mission . 
 Once inside the base , the agents discover the eviscerated and partially devoured corpses of security personnel and scientists . After splitting up to restore power to the facility , Gail goes missing . Whilst searching for him , Regina is confronted by a Velociraptor . Re @-@ uniting with Rick , the two determine it was the dinosaurs that caused the bloodbath at the base . Although their mission to recover Dr. Kirk still stands , it is now more important to signal for a rescue . Regina sets out to activate the main antenna to contact their airlift . On her way , she is attacked by another Velociraptor and is rescued by Gail , who then leaves to continue searching for Dr. Kirk . After restoring communications , Regina heads back to the control room and they receive a signal on their communicators . Believing it might be Cooper or Tom in trouble , Rick wants to investigate . Gail shoots down the idea , wanting to follow up on a closed @-@ circuit television sighting that might have been Kirk . The player must choose which course of action to follow . 
 If the player follows Gail , they go after an unknown man , but end up losing him . Rick then tells Regina that Tom 's dead . If the player follows Rick , they come across Tom , badly injured and near death . Rick takes him to the medical room , however a Velociraptor attacks them , but Tom sacrifices himself to kill it and save Rick . Later , Regina and the team manage to locate Kirk and apprehend him . As they are preparing to leave via helicopter , the T. rex returns and destroys the helicopter , forcing them to flee back into the base while Kirk manages to escape . Regina and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft , but find a vortex in the way of getting to it . Rick speculates this is the spacetime distortion that brought the dinosaurs back . The two split up to find an alternate route off the island , and Regina ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk . He is about to kill her when the gun is shot out of his hand by Gail , and they arrest him again . 
 Kirk reveals that the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an experiment he was running using his Third Energy technology . A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past , bringing dinosaurs back into their time . Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload , the energy coming from them and the vortex should cancel each other out if they come into contact . After Regina gets the stabilizer and <unk> and uses them to overload the reactors , the energy shakes the base , causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again . The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast , but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor . He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk , and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes . Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail , or escape with Rick . The story then takes one of three endings . 
 = = = Endings = = = 
 The three possible endings are based on choices made by the player . Near the end of the game , the player has the option to either go after Kirk or find a way off the island . 
 Chase Kirk : Regina and Gail chase and are successful in capturing Kirk . As a twist , Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and the government did not want Kirk , but instead wanted the Third Energy to use in warfare . Gail gives Regina a disk containing all the data on the Third Energy . Shortly afterward , Gail dies from injuries suffered when the vent fell on him . Regina , Rick , and Kirk , during their departure in a watercraft , battle with the T. rex . Regina kills it using a remote explosive , and they escape . 
 Escape the island : Regina , Gail , and Rick manage to escape without Kirk . During the final battle , Rick fires a rocket from a watercraft . The rocket hits a fuel tank , causing a massive overload in the Third Energy generator and completely disintegrating a portion of Ibis Island in the process killing the T. rex and all of the other dinosaurs . The three agents escape safely , however the status of Kirk is unknown although it 's likely he escaped . 
 The third ending can be achieved by choosing to escape the island , but instead chasing Kirk . Regina and Gail locate Kirk in a hangar , preparing a helicopter to escape in ( which becomes their only way of escape because the T. rex destroyed the hovercraft while she chased Kirk ) . Regina knocks Kirk out , and informs Rick of the situation . The T. rex chases Rick to Regina 's location . Then Regina , Gail and Rick board the helicopter and flee . During their escape , Rick drops a bomb from the helicopter onto the dinosaur , killing it . All three agents get out alive with Kirk .

 Dino Crisis was directed and produced by Shinji Mikami , and developed by a team that would later become part of Capcom Production Studio 4 . It is a pseudo @-@ sequel to Mikami 's popular Resident Evil series , which Mikami and his team wanted to move away from the fantasy elements of and make something more real . He cited The Lost World : Jurassic Park and Aliens as influences , and liked dinosaurs because they were large , strong , fearsome , and violent . The game was developed and marketed as " panic horror " as opposed to the " survival horror " branding of Resident Evil . It was made to have more consistent fright , with the dinosaurs being more intelligent , quick , and able to chase the player room @-@ to @-@ room . Mikami described Resident Evil as " horror in the fun house " and Dino Crisis as more visceral horror akin to riding a roller coaster . 
 Dino Crisis utilizes an original 3D engine with real @-@ time environments , as opposed to the pre @-@ rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series . Mikami chose a real @-@ time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible . However , with the real @-@ time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations , making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments . The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue . Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware 's polygon limitations . Like Resident Evil , the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment . Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings , thinking it was better to build fear . 
 Since it is unknown how dinosaurs moved in real life , the team had to use their imagination and animals such as crocodiles and dogs as reference . The animators first scanned in drawings , then used animation tools to see what was possible to animate . The dinosaur artificial intelligence was based on lions , tigers , and other carnivores that are not afraid of humans . Mikami 's vision for the dinosaurs was not completely fulfilled . He wanted to include more complex dinosaur artificial intelligence , with the dinosaurs each having individual personalities that could understand the player 's condition and ambush them . The dinosaur animations and cries also did not turn out as he originally envisioned them . The number of dinosaurs in the North American version was increased from the Japanese version , although the number of species remained the same . 
 Dino Crisis was first revealed at the 1999 Spring Tokyo Game Show . The game was initially released in Japan in July 1999 , two months before Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis . Ports were released for the Sega Dreamcast console and Microsoft Windows platform in 2000 . A top @-@ down interpretation of Dino Crisis was in development by UK company M4 for the Game Boy Color , but was cancelled . M4 would later develop Resident Evil Gaiden for the system instead . Another UK firm called Fluid Studios was also developing a version of the game for the Game Boy Color . It would have contained all four characters from the original version , as well as seven maps , a hundred different rooms , and five types of dinosaurs . However , this game was also canceled .

 Dino Crisis was met with mostly positive reviews . Critics compared Dino Crisis to the Resident Evil series while also drawing comparisons to Jurassic Park and describing the game as " Resident Evil with dinosaurs " . Despite these similarities , reviewers found the game " enhances and alters " the Resident Evil formula with " strength of its own merits . " The game was a commercial success , being a bestseller in Japan . The PlayStation version of the game has sold 2 @.@ 4 million copies worldwide , and is listed as the 19th best @-@ selling Capcom game of all @-@ time as of May 2016 . 
 Critics generally praised the action and intensity of the game , which was heightened by the real @-@ time engine and soundtrack . GamePro found the game to have a great mix of action and strategy , with dinosaur AI that keeps the action fresh . IGN described the game as " vicious , flesh @-@ tearing fright , " noting the fast @-@ paced gameplay during action sequences . Some praise was directed towards the realism of the game , with the dinosaur behaviors and bleeding mechanics noted . The real @-@ time graphics were generally liked , with critics describing them as " sharp " , " sterile " , and " clean " . GameSpot praised the character models , lighting effects , and found " the use of polygonal backgrounds enhances the feeling of fear even more than Resident Evil . " The dinosaurs were a consistent point of discussion among critics . GamePro found the dinosaurs " imbued with an excellent AI that keeps the action fresh and exciting " , although some found the variety of dinosaurs to be lacking . Despite the game being " 90 % Raptors " , which IGN found not as scary as monsters from Resident Evil , they found the dinosaur sound effects to be well done . 
 Game Revolution had a more critical review of Dino Crisis than others , saying the game expanded on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also ruining the good elements . They were impressed by the graphics but thought the environments looked too similar and got boring after a short time . Overall , they believed the game to be worse than Resident Evil 2 , pointing out the game 's shorter length , more tedious puzzles , weaker action , and lesser scare factor . 
 The Dreamcast and Windows ports received mixed reviews from multiple sources , criticized for adding very little enhancements to take advantage of their superior hardware . The graphics were viewed as dated on Windows , with IGN calling it " choppy " and pointing out the poor resolution upscaling . On the Dreamcast , Resident Evil - Code : Veronica , another Capcom survival horror game , was viewed as a superior experience .

 = Isaac B. Desha = 
 Isaac Bledsoe Desha ( January 1 , 1802 – August 13 , 1828 ) was a 19th @-@ century American tanner who was convicted of murdering one man in Kentucky , and confessed to murdering another in Texas . He was notable as the son of the Kentucky Governor , Joseph Desha . Shortly after his father 's election as governor in 1824 , Desha was accused of robbing and killing a man named Francis Baker , who was passing through Kentucky . Circumstantial evidence implicated Desha , who denied the crime . 
 Given the heated political environment of the Old Court @-@ New Court controversy , allies of his father claimed that the governor 's political enemies had framed his son . The governor 's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial , and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case . Isaac Desha was twice convicted , but both times , the judge in the case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds . While awaiting a third trial , Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat , but doctors saved his life , reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube . Shortly after the suicide attempt , Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son . 
 Isaac Desha left Kentucky and assumed an alias . He went to New Orleans . From there , he traveled with a man named Thomas Early to San Antonio , Texas . When Early went missing during their travels , Desha fell under suspicion . A former Kentuckian living in Texas recognized Desha . Arrested soon after Early 's body was found , Desha confessed to the murder after being recognized by a second man from Kentucky . A day before his trial was to start , Desha died of a fever . A legend soon arose that he had faked his death and fled to Hawaii , where he married a native woman and fathered several children . Later historians have debunked that myth . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Isaac Bledsoe Desha was born January 1 , 1802 ; he was one of thirteen children of Margaret ( Bledsoe ) and Joseph Desha . He was named for his maternal grandfather . Educated mostly in the local ( Maysville , Kentucky ) schools , for a time Isaac attended a school run by Mr. Bailey and boarded with Bailey 's father . In October 1817 , he was apprenticed to Archibald Logan , a tanner . He lived and studied with Logan until May 1821 .

 In November 1823 , the young man married Cornelia Pickett . Desha 's sister Ellen had previously married Pickett 's brother James . 
 = = Political environment = = 
 Desha 's father Joseph was elected as governor of Kentucky in August 1824 . The primary issue in the campaign was relief for the state 's large debtor class , still reeling from the Panic of 1819 . The state 's voters split between those supporting laws favorable to debtors – called the Relief Party – and those supporting laws that protected creditors – called the Anti @-@ Relief Party . Shortly before Desha 's election , the Kentucky Court of Appeals had struck down some legislation as unconstitutional that had been passed by the Relief Party , then a majority in the Assembly . 
 After Desha was elected , Relief legislators , who held majorities in both houses of the General Assembly , attempted to remove the offending judges from office . Failing to achieve the needed two @-@ thirds majority , the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court . Desha appointed justices favoring relief . The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state ; during what became known as the Old Court @-@ New Court controversy , both courts operated simultaneously , with both claiming legitimacy . It was a politically tumultuous time . 
 = = Murder of Francis Baker = = 
 On the night of November 1 , 1824 , Desha attended a celebration at a neighbor 's house . He later stayed the night at <unk> 's Tavern in Fairview , just over the county line in Fleming County . The next morning , he ate breakfast at the tavern , joined by eight other men , including Francis Baker . Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez , Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton , New Jersey to marry a young woman there . Over breakfast , Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend , Captain John Bickley , who lived in the area . Desha remarked that he knew where Bickley lived and , intending to ride in that direction , asked if Baker wanted to join him . Baker accepted , and the two men left about 8 a.m. toward Maysville . Desha rode his bay mare and Baker his gray mare , a fine horse that had already attracted much attention during his travel through Kentucky . 
 About 10 a.m. , one of Desha 's neighbors encountered the riderless gray mare , still rigged with saddle and bridle . Catching the horse , he rode it up the road , shortly finding Desha 's riderless bay ( which he recognized ) , with a saddle but no bridle . He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha 's horse . Further along , the neighbor encountered Desha on foot , carrying two saddlebags . Desha said that he had just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money . He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control , but mounted the gray mare and returned home . Later that day , friends at Desha 's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong . He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day . 
 His unusual behavior continued to the point that Desha 's pregnant wife Cornelia moved out of the house and refused to return . She later gave birth to their daughter and only child , who she named after her mother . She never returned to Desha . 
 Over the next few days , neighbors began to discover items along the route Desha and Baker had taken from <unk> 's Tavern to Maysville . These included a bloody glove , a pair of saddlebags with the bottoms cut out , and Desha 's missing horse bridle . On November 8 , three men discovered a man 's body – its upper half covered by a log – about 50 yards ( 46 m ) off the road on the Fleming County side . The men did not move the body , but reported it to local authorities , who returned to recover it . The victim had four or five bludgeon wounds to the head , stab wounds in the chest and shoulder , and his throat had been slit , severing his windpipe . The man wore a shirt , waistcoat , socks , and a single glove ; a search of the area yielded pantaloons and a coat . Authorities brought the body to town , where Captain John Bickley ( whom Baker had been riding to visit ) identified it as Francis Baker . 
 Investigators examined the body for several days before burying it on November 11 in a local church cemetery . Returning to search the area again , authorities found several changes of clothes and other accoutrements , all with marks identifying the owner cut out . Also located were several pieces of paper – one with the name " Baker " written on it – a hat , a pocketbook similar to the one Desha was known to carry , and lead and a cap from a riding whip , which Desha was also known to use . 
 = = Arrest and trials = = 
 With evidence strongly pointing to Desha as the murderer , General William Reed summoned Desha to his house on November 9 and ordered him to remain until an examining trial could be held . Desha complied , showed no emotion when viewing Baker 's body , and did not attempt to flee although left unguarded in the house . The examining trial resulted in Desha 's formal arrest , and he was imprisoned in Flemingsburg , Kentucky . Relief Party partisans said that Desha was innocent and his arrest was fabricated by the Anti @-@ Relief Party to embarrass his father Governor Desha and weaken him politically . 
 On November 24 , State Representative John Rowan – a Relief partisan – introduced legislation in the Kentucky General Assembly ordering the Fleming Circuit Court to convene a special session in December for Desha 's trial ; it provided that , at the trial , Desha would be given the option of a change of venue from Fleming County , where he lived and the murder was committed , to Harrison County , where his father lived . Governor Desha appeared before the committee reviewing the bill to advocate its passage . The bill was reported favorably by the committee , passed by both houses of the General Assembly , and signed by the governor on December 4 , 1824 . On December 20 , 1824 , the Fleming Circuit Court returned an indictment against Desha for the murder of Francis Baker . At that time , Desha requested the change of venue . 
 Judge John Trimble , the circuit court judge in Harrison County who would have presided over the case , was appointed before the trial by Governor Desha to a seat on the " New " Court of Appeals authorized by the Assembly . Trimble personally selected Judge George Shannon of Lexington to preside in his stead . 
 Desha 's trial began January 17 , 1825 , in <unk> . William K. Wall , Commonwealth 's Attorney for Harrison County , was the prosecutor , assisted by Fleming County Commonwealth 's Attorney ( and future Congressman ) John Chambers and Martin P. Marshall . Rowan , who had just been elected to the U.S. Senate , was Desha 's primary defense counsel , assisted by the governor 's Secretary of State ( and later U.S. Senator ) William T. Barry , former Congressman William Brown , T. P. <unk> , and James Crawford . It took two days to <unk> a jury . Witness testimony consumed the next week , and Governor Desha attended each day of the trial . The closing statements of Rowan and Barry , both known as outstanding orators , took several days , and Chambers spoke last . 
 The defense maintained that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial . They said that Desha 's personal items could easily have been planted where they were found . They pointed out that , despite the stab wounds on Baker 's body , no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it . Finally , they contended that , although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area , Baker 's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals , as might have been expected had it been there for six days , as the prosecution had charged . 
 On January 31 , 1825 , Desha was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging . The next day , Rowan filed a motion for a new trial , citing jury tampering , and Judge Shannon sustained Rowan 's motion . Throughout the court 's March and June terms , a jury was unable to be empaneled due to the extreme publicity the case received . 
 During the September term , a jury was finally selected , and the trial consumed the rest of the term . Much of the same evidence was presented , and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict . The date for Desha 's execution was set for July 14 , 1826 . Harry O. Brown , the judge in the case , had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy . He set aside the verdict , ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County , as charged in the indictment . The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted , the place of the murder was immaterial . 
 The process of selecting a third jury consumed a year and a half . During the delay , Desha attempted suicide by cutting his throat and severed his windpipe . Doctors used a silver tube to repair his windpipe , and Desha survived . On the last day of the court 's term in June 1827 , the judge announced another continuance , since the court had not yet empaneled a jury . Governor Desha stood and produced a pardon for his son . Although legend holds that Governor Desha resigned immediately after issuing the pardon , records show that he served out the rest of his term . The pardon damaged the governor 's reputation and that of the Relief Party , which lost a number of legislative seats in the subsequent elections . 
 = = Departure of Isaac Desha = = 
 Freed , Desha left Kentucky , traveling down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers . According to legend , he attempted to rob a flatboat skipper near Vicksburg , Mississippi . It happened the skipper was a longtime acquaintance of Desha , named G. W. Crawford . Crawford recognized Desha and asked why he would try to rob him . Desha confessed that he had been living as an outlaw since his father 's pardon . Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans , Louisiana . Desha accepted , telling Crawford that he planned to travel on to a distant place , assume a new name , and seek a fresh start . 
 In New Orleans , Desha assumed the name John Parker . Meeting an Ohio native named Thomas Early , he learned the man was carrying a substantial amount of money and was on his way to Texas to purchase some horses and mules . Desha joined Early , traveling with him on a schooner dubbed the Rights of Man across the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay . In April 1828 , Desha and Early disembarked at <unk> Point ( now Morgan 's Point , Texas ) , and from there , they traveled to San Felipe de Austin , arriving in early May . After a brief stay , the two set out on horseback toward San Antonio . By the time Desha reached Gonzales , he was traveling alone . 
 Desha continued on to San Antonio , where he lost a substantial amount of money playing Monte Bank . He decided to return to San Felipe . Meeting two Americans and a Mexican cigar maker travelling that way , with their permission , he traveled with them . After his return to San Felipe , the citizens began to suspect Desha of murdering Early . A few days after Desha 's arrival , Early 's clothing was found in a nearby creek . Scattered nearby , a search party located skeletal remains believed to be Early 's . 
 Thomas Duke Marshall , a nephew of Chief Justice John Marshall and former resident of Washington County , Kentucky , was living in San Felipe . He noticed that the man called John Parker bore a strong resemblance to the Desha family of Kentucky and that he breathed through a silver tube like the one used by Isaac Desha . Marshall arrested Desha . After another former Kentuckian in the area also said he believed the suspect was Isaac Desha , Desha admitted his identity and confessed to murdering Early . He said he had intended to rob the Americans who had traveled with him from San Antonio , but the Mexican had watched him too closely . Although there was no jail in the town , a local blacksmith was commissioned to construct irons to restrain Desha until his trial . 
 = = Death and legend of escape to Hawaii = = 
 Desha 's trial for Early 's murder was set for August 14 , 1828 , but he died of a fever the day before the trial was to start . He was buried in San Felipe de Austin . 
 After his death , a legend arose that he had not died , that his funeral was staged , and that he had escaped to Hawaii , married a native woman , and fathered several children with her . Andrew Forest Muir , writing in 1956 in the Filson Club History Quarterly , debunked this legend . He documented that the first <unk> in Hawaii did not arrive until nearly two decades after Isaac Desha 's death . At the time of Baker 's murder , the progenitor of the Hawaiian Desha family had been four years old . That progenitor was John R. <unk> Desha , a grandson of Governor Joseph Desha and nephew of Isaac Desha . In Honolulu , he helped establish Queen 's Hospital and worked there until his death . 
 = Burning Up ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Burning Up " is a song written and recorded by American singer Madonna from her eponymous debut studio album Madonna ( 1983 ) . It was released as the album 's second single on March 9 , 1983 , in some countries as a double @-@ A side single with " Physical Attraction " . The song was presented as an early recorded demo by Madonna to Sire Records who green @-@ lighted the recording of the single after the first single " Everybody " became a dance hit . Madonna collaborated with Reggie Lucas , who produced the single while John Benitez provided the guitar riffs and backing vocals . Musically , the song incorporates instrumentation from bass guitar , synthesizers and drums , and the lyrics talk of the singer 's lack of shame in declaring her passion for her lover . 
 Released with " Physical Attraction " on the B side , the song was given mixed reviews from contemporary critics and authors , who noted the song 's darker , urgent composition while praising its dance beats . The single failed to do well commercially anywhere , except the dance chart in the United States , where it peaked at three , and the Australian charts , where it was a top 20 hit . After a number of live appearances in clubs to promote the single , it was added to the set @-@ list of the 1985 Virgin Tour . An electric guitar version was performed on the 2004 Re @-@ Invention World Tour and the 2015 – 16 Rebel Heart Tour . 
 The accompanying music video of the song portrayed Madonna in the classic submissive female positions , while writhing in passion on an empty road , for her lover who appeared to come from her behind on a car . The video ended showing Madonna driving the car instead , thereby concluding that she was always in charge . Many authors noted that the " Burning Up " music video was a beginning of Madonna 's depiction of her taking control of a destabilized male sexuality . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1982 , Madonna was living in New York and trying to launch her musical career . Her Detroit boyfriend , Steve Bray , became the drummer for her band . Abandoning hard rock , they were signed by a music management company , Gotham records , and decided to pursue music in the funk genre . They soon dropped those plans . Madonna carried rough tapes of three songs with her : " Everybody " , " Ain 't No Big Deal " and " Burning Up " . Madonna presented " Everybody " to the DJ Mark Kamins who , after hearing the song , took her to Sire Records , where she was signed for a single deal . When " Everybody " became a dance hit , Sire Records decided to follow up with an album for her . However , Madonna chose not to work with either Bray or Kamins , opting instead for Warner Brothers producer Reggie Lucas . Michael Rosenblatt , the A & R director of Sire Records , explained to Kamins that they wanted a producer who had more experience in directing singers ; hence they appointed Lucas . He pushed Madonna in a more pop direction and produced " Burning Up " and " Physical Attraction " for her . 
 While producing the tracks , Lucas radically changed their structure from the original demo versions . Madonna did not accept the changes , so John " Jellybean " Benitez , a DJ at the Funhouse Disco , was called in to remix the tracks . He added some extra guitar riffs and vocals to " Burning Up " . Sire Records backed up the single by sending Madonna on a series of personal appearances in clubs around New York , where she performed the single . They also hired a stylist and jewelry designer called Maripol , who helped Madonna with the single cover . The cover for the 12 @-@ inch dance single for " Burning Up " was designed by Martin Burgoyne . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Musically , " Burning Up " has a starker arrangement brought about by bass , single guitar and drum machine . The guitar riffs in the songs were not characteristics of Madonna 's later records . The tom @-@ tom drum beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer Phil Collins . It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art synthesizers of that time . The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines of the lyrics , while the bridge consists of a series of double entendres in regards to the lyrics of the song which describes what she is prepared to do for her lover and that she is individualistic and shameless . 
 According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing , " Burning Up " is written in the time signature of common time with a dance beat tempo of 138 beats per minute . The song is composed in the key of B minor , with Madonna 's vocals ranging from the tonal nodes of A3 to B4 . " Burning Up " follows a basic sequence of Bm – Bm – A – E as its chord progression . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 " Burning Up " was released on March 9 , 1983 . Like its predecessor " Everybody " , the song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart , and " Burning Up " also did not chart in the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart . It did manage to peak at number three on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play , staying on the chart for 16 weeks . The song was a top 20 hit in Australia in June 1984 , peaking at number 13 , after having originally charted in the lower reaches of the top 100 in November 1983 . The song was also used as background music for a scene in the 1984 film The Wild Life . 
 Author Rikky Rooksby , in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , commented that the song was noticeably weaker compared to other singles like " Lucky Star " and " Borderline " . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine denoted the track as edgy and punk @-@ infused . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic commented that " Burning Up " and B side " Physical Attraction " had a darker , carnal urgency in their composition . Don Shewey from Rolling Stone called the song " simple stuff " while complimenting the B side , saying : " ' Physical Attraction ' is practically a capsule history of high @-@ school proms , with its sly references to The Association 's " Cherish " and Olivia Newton @-@ John 's " Physical . " Robert Christgau called the 12 @-@ inch pair of " Burning Up " and " Physical Attraction " <unk> . Santiago Fouz @-@ Hernández in his book Madonna 's drowned worlds complimented the song for having upbeat dance music . Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly commented that " Burning Up " proved that Madonna could rock also . 
 = = Music video = = 
 Sire Records commissioned a music video for the song to be directed by Steve Barron . Madonna 's friend Debi Mazar was hired as the make @-@ up artist for the video while Maripol was the stylist with Madonna 's then boyfriend Ken Compton appearing as her onscreen lover . By the time the video was released , MTV had begun to show dance music videos . Hence the music video of " Burning Up " became a minor hit on the channel . The narrative of the video shows Madonna in a white dress , as she sings the song proclaiming her helpless passion for her lover . She wore her famous rubber bracelets which were actually typewriter belts . Her love for the boy portrayed her as a helpless victim like the stereotyped female portrayed in many silent movies . At one point in the video Madonna is shown being hit by a car driven by a young man , played by Compton . By the end of the song Madonna is shown driving the car , with a knowing , defiant smile on her lips and has ditched the man , thereby giving the message that she was in charge , a theme recurrent throughout her career . Baron explained the development process behind the video : 
 I went to New York to meet ( Madonna ) , begrudgingly , and showed up at an address at SoHo , which turned out to be a squat basically . Madonna was scantily clad , working out to a massive disco track . She was charismatic . She kept putting her head down on the table and talking to me , very flirtatious , and that gave me the idea for the scene in " burning up " , where her face is on the road , and the camera 's really low and close . 
 Though the lyrics of the song like " Do you want to see me down on my knees ? " portray female helplessness , the video performance acts as a counter @-@ text to it . When this line is sung , Madonna is shown kneeling on the road in front of the advancing car , then turns her head back while exposing her throat back in a posture of submission . However , her voice tone and her look at the camera portray a hardness and defiance that contradict the submissiveness of her body posture and turn the question of the line into a challenge for her lover . 
 Author Andrew Morton , in his biography on Madonna , commented that the video was America 's first introduction to Madonna 's sexual politics . Author Robert Clyde Allen in his book Channels of Discourse compared the video with that of " Material Girl " . According to him both the videos have an undermining ending , while employing a consistent series of puns and exhibiting a parodic amount of excess associated with Madonna 's style . The discourses included in the video are those of sexuality and religion . Allen wrote that Madonna 's image of kneeling and singing about ' burning in love ' performed the traditional ideological work of using the subordination and powerlessness of women in Christianity to naturalize their equally submissive position in patriarchy . Author Georges @-@ Claude Guilbert in his book Madonna as postmodern myth commented that the representation of the male character becomes irrelevant as Madonna destabilizes the fixing and categorization of male sexuality in the video . Her utterance of having " no shame " was interpreted by author James B. Twitchell , in his book For Shame , as an attempt to separate herself from contemporary female artists of that era . 
 = = Live performances and covers = = 
 Before its release , Madonna promoted the single by performing at different clubs around New York . Madonna was a professional performer by that time and was assisted by dancers Erika Belle and Bags <unk> to promote it . After promoting in New York in numerous nightclubs and pubs , she traveled to London to promote it in clubs like Heaven , Camden Palace , <unk> Club as well as The Haçienda in Manchester . However , those performances were not well received by the British audience . The song was performed on The Virgin Tour in 1985 but was omitted from the Madonna Live : The Virgin Tour VHS released by Warner Home Video . Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that Madonna posed like Marilyn Monroe during the performance of the song . Mikel Longoria from The Dallas Morning News called the performance as " crisp and energetic " . 
 Madonna included the song on the set @-@ list of her 2004 Re @-@ Invention World Tour in the military segment . She was dressed in military garments and played the electric guitar for the performance . As she sang the song , the backdrops displayed scenes of war and sex which were scrambled to appear as if they have been shot with a camcorder . Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times described the performance and the video backdrops as being reminiscent of the prisons in Abu Ghraib . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that " it was a hoot to see her [ Madonna ] strap on an electric guitar and sing classics like ' Burning Up ' . " Madonna also included a remixed version of the song on the 2015 Rebel Heart Tour . Similar to the Re @-@ Invention World Tour , the singer played the electric guitar during the performance , dressed in a black short nun 's outfit . 
 During Madonna 's induction at the 2008 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , " Burning Up " was performed by Iggy Pop and the punk rock band The Stooges , along with " Ray of Light " . In 2010 , Jonathan Groff covered the song for American television show Glee . His version was included in the extended play titled Glee : The Music , The Power of Madonna , and it was also released as a bonus track to the iTunes Store . Singer Britney Spears covered " Burning Up " in 2011 during select shows , for her Femme Fatale Tour . The performance featured her straddling a giant , glittering guitar , ten feet high and twice as long . However , Barry Walters from Rolling Stone felt that the cover she sung on the tour , " lacked Madge 's [ Madonna 's ] authority . " Studio recording of the cover , described by Sarah Maloy of Billboard as " glammed @-@ up without a hint of the ' 80s to be found " , leaked on June 10 , 2011 . Singer <unk> included a cover of " Burning Up " as a bonus track on his 2006 compilation album , Scratching The Surface : Vol 2 Electro @-@ Voice Sampler .

 The Getty Research Institute ( GRI ) , located at the Getty Center in Los Angeles , California , is " dedicated to furthering knowledge and advancing understanding of the visual arts " . A program of the J. Paul Getty Trust , GRI maintains a research library , organizes exhibitions and other events , sponsors a residential scholars program , publishes books , and produces electronic databases ( Getty Publications ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The GRI was originally called the " Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities " , and was first discussed in 1983 . Located in Santa Monica , its first director ( beginning in 1985 ) was Kurt W. Forster . GRI 's library had 30 @,@ 000 volumes in 1983 , but grew to 450 @,@ 000 volumes by 1986 . 
 In a statement upon his departure in 1992 , Forster summarized his tenure as " Beginning with the rudiments of a small museum library ... the center grew ... to become one of the nation 's preeminent research centers for arts and culture ... " . In 1994 , Salvatore Settis , a professor of the history of classical art and archeology in Italy , became the director of the Center . By 1996 , the Center 's name had been changed to " Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities " , and by 1999 it was known simply as " Getty Research Institute " . 
 Among GRI 's special projects was " L.A. as Subject : The Transformative Culture of Los Angeles Communities " conducted between 1995 and 1999 , whose purposes included " <unk> [ ing ] existing resources and develop new resources that support new research scholarship on LA and also encourag [ ing ] the preservation , conservation , and display of local material culture " . In collaboration with local organizations , GRI published Cultural Inheritance / L.A. : A Resource Directory of Less Visible Archives and Collections in the Los Angeles Region in 1999 . In 2000 , the L.A. as Subject project was transferred to the University of Southern California , which continues to update and expand an online version of the resource directory . 
 When the Getty Information Institute ( formerly the Art History Information Program , established in 1983 ) was dissolved in 1999 as a " result of a change of leadership at the Getty Trust " , GRI absorbed " many of its functions " . 
 In 2000 , Thomas E. Crow was selected as GRI director to replace Settis who had resigned in 1999 . Crow announced in October 2006 that he would be leaving for New York University . Since November 2007 Thomas W. Gaehtgens has been GRI 's director ; he was previously ( 1985 – 86 ) a visiting scholar with the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities .

 = = = Library = = = 
 Among other holdings , GRI 's research library contains over 1 million volumes of books , periodicals , and auction catalogs ; special collections ; and two million photographs of art and architecture . 
 Already by 1985 , the Getty had acquired the complete archive of the American sculptor Malvina Hoffman . In 2011 , it acquired Harald <unk> ’ s substantial archive , consisting of more than 1 @,@ 000 boxes of correspondence , research files , drawings , and ephemera , as well as some 28 @,@ 000 books and 36 @,@ 000 photographs . It also owns several art dealers ' archives , including records for the Goupil & Cie and <unk> <unk> galleries , Knoedler Gallery , and the Duveen Brothers . 
 The library is located at the Getty Center , and does not circulate its collections , but does extend library privileges to any visitor . 
 = = = Exhibitions and other events = = = 
 GRI holds two public exhibitions per year in its two galleries which " focus primarily on the special collections of the Research Library or on work produced by artists in residence " . For example , in 2005 – 2006 GRI held an exhibition entitled " Julius Shulman , Modernity and the Metropolis " . The exhibition traveled to the National Building Museum and to the Art Institute of Chicago . 
 In addition to exhibitions , GRI organizes lectures ( open to the public ) , colloquia ( most open to the public ) , workshops ( by invitation only ) , and screenings of films and videos ( open to the public ) . 
 = = = Residential scholars program = = = 
 The residential scholars program seeks to " integrate the often isolated territory of art history into the wider sphere of the humanities " . The first class of scholars arrived in 1985 – 1986 ; they had their salaries paid for and their housing provided but were under " absolutely no obligation to produce " . Among the notable scholars was German writer Christa Wolf in 1993 – 1994 , who wrote the novel Medea : a modern retelling during her year at GRI . 
 Each year the scholars are invited to work on projects related to an annual theme . In 2008 – 2009 , the theme for the Getty Center was " Networks and Boundaries " and for the Getty Villa " The Power and Function of Ancient Images " . The lengths of stay vary : Getty scholars are in residence for three , six or nine months , visiting scholars for one to three months , and <unk> and postdoctoral fellows for a nine @-@ month academic year . In 2011 – 12 , the theme was " Artistic Practice " .

 = St Botolph 's Church , Quarrington = 
 St Botolph 's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington , part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire , England . The area has been settled since at least the Anglo @-@ Saxon period and a church existed there by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086 , when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey 's fee . It was granted to Haverholme Priory in c . 1165 , but the Bishop of Lincoln presented the rector during the early 16th century , before it passed to Robert Carre and his descendants . With capacity for 124 people , the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and , as of 2009 , has an average congregation of 50 . 
 Recognised for its age and tracery , the church has been designated a grade II * listed building . It consists of a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle spanning eastwards and ending at a chancel . The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century , although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century . Renovations followed and the local architect Charles Kirk the younger carried out restoration work in 1862 – 63 , when he added the chancel in his parents ' memory . The high interior spans three bays of arcading which complement the windows along either side of the nave 's south wall and north aisle ; those on the south wall are particularly unusual for their incorporation of hexagons and trefoils into the reticulated designs . 
 = = Description = = 
 St Botolph 's Church is the parish church of the benefice of Quarrington with Old Sleaford , which encompasses most of the village of Quarrington in the English non @-@ metropolitan county of Lincolnshire . The benefice is a rectory and falls within the deanery of Lafford and the archdeaconry and diocese of Lincoln ; the present priest @-@ in @-@ charge is Rev. Mark Stephen Thomson , who took over from Rev. Sandra Rhys Benham in 2016 . Dedicated to St Botolph , the church is on Town Road . The rectory was constructed in c . 2000 and has a study area used as the parish office . As of 2015 , services are scheduled for Sundays and Wednesdays : Holy Communion from 11 : 00 am on every second , third and fourth Sunday and every Wednesday at 10 : 00 am ; a family service on every first Sunday of the month at 11 : 00 am . 
 Along with 20 spaces in the choir stalls , the nave and aisle pews can comfortably seat 124 adults and " 149 at a pinch " ; as of 2009 , the average congregation size for the main Sunday service was 50 , about half of whom were retired and 1 – 3 were under 16 . In 2004 a log cabin @-@ style building was constructed by <unk> Ltd using funds from the Parochial Church Council . It serves as a robing space for choristers and can be used as a meeting room for up to 30 people . Equipped with disabled toilet facilities , the building also serves as a Sunday School .

 = = = Background , origins and advowson = = = 
 There is little evidence for prehistoric activity in the area and , despite the presence of Late Iron Age and Roman communities in Sleaford , only scattered Roman coins and pottery sherds have been uncovered around Quarrington . The first written record of the village occurs in the Domesday Book of 1086 , but the remains of an early and middle Anglo @-@ Saxon rural community have been discovered beneath fields around the village , along with evidence for pig and sheep @-@ rearing and metalworking . Ramsey Abbey possessed a manor at Quarrington from c . 1051 and , by the time Domesday was compiled , this included two churches . The antiquarian James <unk> suggested that the missing church was All Saints ' in Old Sleaford , where the Abbey held a manor as sokeland of Quarrington , while the antiquarian Edward Trollope thought it had been lost , buried " probably in a farm yard now occupied by Mrs. <unk> " . In 1909 , two amateur local historians , H. <unk> and F. <unk> , reckoned that both churches were lost and had stood on land marked by stone crosses near <unk> on the Sleaford – <unk> road and on Stump Cross Hill . But in 1979 , the local historians Christine Mahany and David Roffe reassessed the Domesday evidence and , after analysing the manorial structure , documentary evidence and the history of the advowson of All Saints ' , concluded that it was the second church in the Abbey 's manor of Quarrington . 
 Henry <unk> , a knight , held Quarrington of the Abbey and in c . 1165 granted it to Haverholme Priory , who presented Alexander de <unk> as rector in 1218 . The priory are known to have presented rectors in 1248 and 1269 as well . The Bishop of Lincoln , who had held a manor at Quarrington since Domesday , claimed the right to present its rector in the early 16th century . Bishop Holbeach alienated the manor to the Crown in 1547 and it was eventually purchased by the Sleaford merchant Robert Carre , but the Bishop still tried to present the rector ; Carre protested and the dispute was settled when Lord Chief Justice Coke ruled that Carre would present in future . 
 = = = Construction and later history = = = 
 A " very narrow " chancel arch existed until the mid @-@ 19th century and might have been pre @-@ Conquest , but the earliest visible part of the church is the 13th century north arcade , which may have been added to an earlier , now @-@ lost nave . The spire and tower date to the middle of the next century , roughly when the nave was rebuilt . Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century . Several medieval bequests are known : Olivia , wife of John Rossen of Quarrington left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412 ; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner , Joan , wife of William Ward , around the same time . Later , 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident . 
 In the latter half of the 16th century , the living of Old Sleaford became " extremely poor " and the church probably fell out of use . Some time afterwards , the rector of Quarrington obtained a presentation to Old Sleaford , but , discovering the lack of tithes , he left . Robert Carre convinced him to take in the parishioners of Old Sleaford at Quarrington in return for a yearly payment ; as of 2015 , the parishes are still combined . Amendments to the fabric of the church were made in the early modern period , beginning when the chancel was rebuilt on a smaller scale some time after the restoration and inset with 12th and 13th century stonework , the whole thing described as " very miserable " by Edward Trollope . This was replaced in 1812 by a Georgian @-@ style building , constructed under the guidance of the rector , Charles Blomfield . The North Aisle was rebuilt in 1848 and a new pulpit , screen and pews were added the following year . 
 The Victorian period witnessed extensive restoration work at Quarrington , where most of the nave 's windows were altered , and the chancel and part of the vestry were rebuilt by Charles Kirk in 1862 – 63 ; parts of the tower and spire were remodelled 24 years later . The Census of Religious Worship ( 1851 ) reveals that the Church had 120 sittings , attendances of 20 and 40 in the morning and afternoon respectively and 20 Sunday scholars . As Sleaford expanded , houses were built along London and Station Roads , pushing the town inside the Quarrington parish boundaries in what became New Quarrington . To deal with the growing population , a second church was designed in the early 1900s on donated land in the parish , to be built closer to Sleaford . Disruption during World War I , parish boundary changes in 1928 , and rising costs delayed the plans . Instead a church hall was built in 1932 on Grantham Road and is now used as a community centre . An extension to the Church was added in 2001 , providing a kitchen , disabled toilet and other facilities ; built in matching stone , it incorporated a stained glass window from the north aisle . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 St Botolph 's Church consists of a west tower adjoining a nave with a north aisle ; at the end of the nave is a chancel with a chapel on the north side . Owing to its age , the " excellent " tracery and a " very good " 14th century door , the church has been listed at grade II * on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest in the United Kingdom since 1949 , recognising it as " particularly important ... of more than special interest " . 
 Incorporating a window and two @-@ light openings for the bell , the tower and its spire have been dated to the mid @-@ 14th century , although its pinnacles were replaced in 1887 . Trollope did not like the spire 's design , saying that it " looks as if it had slipped down " . Built in a Decorated Gothic style , the tower joins to the nave with a triple @-@ <unk> arch . The nave has been heavily restored and contains elements from a range of periods . The architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner refers to the south wall as " puzzling " because of the tracery — it is unclear what is " Victorian fancy " and what is " correct restoration " . The wall itself is 14th century ( Pevsner suggests c . 1300 ) and incorporates a priest 's doorway with mouldings , capitals and a bust of a man ; the windows to its east have been restored , but follow a 14th @-@ century reticulated style , although unusually they feature hexagons with pointed trefoils : " the oddest patterns " , as Pevsner puts it . The north aisle is from the 13th century , although a 12th @-@ century doorway sits between its late @-@ 14th @-@ century windows . At the eastern end of the nave is the chancel , which has a polygonal ( <unk> ) apse and was constructed between 1862 and 1863 by Charles Kirk the younger in memory of his parents , the elder Charles Kirk and his wife Elizabeth . Its windows were made by Ward and Hughes . 
 Both Pevsner and Historic England regard the interior as high relative to the Church 's small size . The nave has arcading across three bays with chamfered arches and capitals ; the arcades on the north side are Early English and , dating to the 13th century , are the earliest visible parts of the church . Historic England suggest that this nave was likely added to an earlier , now @-@ lost nave . The westernmost arch is wider and shorter than the rest , giving what Trollope called " a very awkward appearance " . The chancel arch follows a 13th @-@ century style , although it was built with the 1862 – 63 work . Inside the chancel , shafts with floral capitals adorn the walls , while the tiled flooring and painted roof give it a " rich " appearance . The nave includes 19th and 20th century windows by H. Hughes ( 1877 ) and Burlison and Grylls , while another ( dated 1917 ) commemorates the Barrett family . Morris and Co. worked on a window in the north aisle in 1935 . 
 The church 's fixtures include a 19th @-@ century pulpit and choir stalls , and chancel screen in a Decorated style ; a font from the 14th century has foliage designs on the bowl , but lacks a base . The earliest record of an organ at St Botolph 's is from 1867 , when one was opened for the chancel by Bevington ; it has since been moved to Pointon . In 1915 , the church paid for organ bought from N. E. Snow to be fixed by <unk> at the cost of £ 130 . The present organ , however , was built in 1929 by J. J. Binns and has two manuals and a pedalboard . Some of the memorials in St Botolph 's date to the 18th and 19th century , although a plaque commemorating one Thomas Appleby dates to 1683 and several other 17th century tablets were noted by Gervase Holles . A tablet to Romaine Hervey ( d . 1837 ) by J. J. Saunders is inside the church ; elsewhere in the grounds are tombstones belonging to the Sharpe and Kirk families and markers to the <unk> , including the artist Charles <unk> Shannon ( d . 1937 ) , whose father , Rev. Frederick William Shannon , was rector of Quarrington and Old Sleaford from 1861 to 1910 . 
 = No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF = 
 No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 2 EFTS ) was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) pilot training unit that operated during World War II . It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia 's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme . No. 2 EFTS was established in November 1939 as No. 3 Flying Training School at Archerfield , Queensland , and partially utilised aircraft and facilities of the civilian air training organisations based there . The school was renamed No. 2 EFTS in January 1940 . It was disbanded in March 1942 , and its operations transferred to No. 5 Elementary Flying School at Narromine , New South Wales , and No. 11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla , Victoria . 
 = = History = = 
 Flying instruction in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II , in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . The Air Force 's pre @-@ war pilot training facility , No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , was supplanted in 1940 – 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . The EFTS provided a twelve @-@ week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF 's initial training schools . Flying training was undertaken in two stages : the first involved four weeks of instruction ( including ten hours of flying ) to determine trainees ' suitability to become pilots . Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training ( including sixty @-@ five hours of flying ) at the EFTS . Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators . 
 No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School was formed as No. 3 Flying Training School at Archerfield , Queensland , on 6 November 1939 . Its inaugural commanding officer was Flight Lieutenant T.C. Curnow . Archerfield was home to private aviation clubs and schools including the Queensland Aero Club and <unk> Ltd , and it was the airfield 's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in the state that led to it becoming the base for the second flying school the RAAF raised during World War II . The same principle was followed in establishing No. 2 Flying Training School ( later renamed No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School ) at Parafield , South Australia , No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School at Essendon , Victoria , and No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School at Mascot , New South Wales . 
 No. 3 Flying Training School was renamed No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School on 2 January 1940 . Its first fifteen de Havilland Tiger Moth training aircraft were delivered three days later . These were augmented by privately owned Tiger Moths and Gipsy Moths pressed into military service . The first training course , lasting eight weeks , began on 10 January ; twenty @-@ one students graduated . By the end of the month , the school 's strength included 105 officers and men , one civilian instructor , and twenty @-@ six students . The unit log book reported the lack of a telephone system , kitchen facilities , beds , desks , hot water , blackboards , typewriters , flags , maps , charts , and " clothing other than stockings " . A second civilian instructor , from the Queensland Aero Club , joined the school on 12 February 1940 . Later that month , No. 2 EFTS was assigned to the control of the proposed Northern Area Command , which was eventually formed in May 1941 . In the interim , all units in Queensland came under the control of Central Area Command , headquartered in Sydney . 
 The school 's inaugural EATS course consisted of thirty @-@ one students , who arrived at Archerfield on 29 April 1940 ; twenty @-@ four of the students graduated . The second EATS course commenced on 27 June ; eighteen of the twenty @-@ four students graduated . As of 15 July , responsibility for all aircraft maintenance at the school was assigned to the Queensland Aero Club . Squadron Leader Roy Phillipps , a fighter ace with the Australian Flying Corps in World War I , assumed command of No. 2 EFTS on 20 October 1940 . Phillipps died on 21 May 1941 , when a private plane in which he was a passenger crashed after taking off from Archerfield . Operations at No. 2 EFTS were increased twofold in August 1941 ; by 30 September its strength included 202 officers and men , 1 civilian , and 91 trainees . Cross @-@ country exercises could take students as far as Dalby and <unk> . Training accidents at the school were frequent , particularly from heavy landings , but did not result in any fatalities . 
 EATS training was put on hold in January 1942 , following the outbreak of war in the Pacific , but resumed the next month . Owing to urgent requirements to house other RAAF units and elements of the United States Army Forces in Australia ( USAFIA ) , No. 2 EFTS was disbanded on 31 March 1942 , and its operations transferred to No. 5 Elementary Flying School at Narromine , New South Wales , and No. 11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla , Victoria . By the time it closed , No. 2 EFTS had trained 806 EATS students , 610 of whom had gone on to SFTSs . 
 = The Last Story = 
 The Last Story ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Rasuto Sutōrī ) is a Japanese action role @-@ playing game , developed by Mistwalker and AQ Interactive for the Wii video game console . Nintendo published the title in all regions except for North America , where it was published by Xseed Games . Initially released in Japan in 2011 , the game was released in western territories through 2012 . The Last Story takes place upon the island @-@ like fortress of Lazulis , in a world that is slowly being drained of life by an unknown force . The story focuses on a group of mercenaries looking for work on Lazulis ; one of their number , Zael , dreams of becoming a knight . After receiving the mystical " Mark of the Outsider " , Zael becomes involved with a noblewoman named Calista in an ongoing war between humans and the beast @-@ like <unk> . During gameplay , the player controls protagonist Zael as he and the mercenary group to which he belongs undertake missions on Lazulis . Zael can command the rest of the mercenary squad during missions , and fights in battles that involve action , tactical and stealth elements . Multiple online multiplayer modes are also present . 
 The game was directed and co @-@ written by Hironobu Sakaguchi , the original creator of Final Fantasy , who had the initial idea for the title after seeing the mixed responses to Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey . Together with designer Takuya Matsumoto , Sakaguchi decided to make a game that would be different from his previous work and most other role @-@ playing games . Development took between three and four years according to different sources . Its story was originally based in science fiction , but at Nintendo 's insistence it was changed to be primarily based around fantasy . Among the staff were regular Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu , and illustrator Kimihiko Fujisaka . It was originally going to be exclusive to Japan , and later its North American release was in doubt after being announced for release in Europe and Australia . During this time , a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the title . The title was a commercial success , and received generally positive reviews worldwide : while the gameplay generally met with praise , opinions varied on the story and graphics . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The Last Story is an action role @-@ playing game ( <unk> ) incorporating elements of tactical and stealth gameplay . The player controls main protagonist Zael for the majority of the game . Zael is primarily controlled using the Wii Remote from a fixed third @-@ person view . The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk , or the Classic Controller . The game 's main hub is a public house on Lazulis Island , which also houses a save point for players . Lazulis City is the main setting for most of the game , which provides the player with story @-@ related and side quests . In addition to environments within missions such as ruins and forests where enemies are encountered and fought , there is an arena where the player can improve the party and their combat abilities . If the party is victorious , the party can pick up money and items from non @-@ playable characters betting on the fight . 
 In battle , the player controls Zael alone , with the rest of the party being controlled by the game 's artificial intelligence ( AI ) and directed by player commands . Parties are composed of up to six characters , each with five " lives " , with them automatically reviving after a certain time if Zael cannot revive them manually . The attack directions of both party characters and enemies are represented by lines connecting the different characters . Combat plays out in real @-@ time , with attacks either happening automatically when a character is within range or manually . Actions such as dodging and movement are done manually . Blocking and actions such as vaulting over low obstacles are performed by holding the B button . Zael can also move to take cover behind objects , which allows them to break an enemy 's line of sight on them or creep along walls . During combat , a character 's Tension gauge will fill , enabling the performance of special moves : these can vary from dealing damage to enemies across a wide area to reviving unconscious allies . 
 A skill unique to Zael is Gathering : when activated , all enemies within an area will focus their attention on him , allowing other team members to act without interruption . As the game progresses , Zael can issue commands to the other team members , with the perspective switching to a top @-@ down view for this action . In addition to standard combat , players can switch to a behind @-@ the @-@ shoulder perspective for manually firing Zael 's crossbow , which can launch a variety of ammunition at enemies and objects . Enemies in Zael 's sights will have their weaknesses and abilities revealed . In battle , destructible objects in the environment can be used by the party to defeat enemies ; these objects regenerate after a time rather than remaining destroyed . Magic cast by characters with that ability leave the casting area temporarily imbued with a spell 's elemental properties . These circles ' environmental effects can be combined and spread by using another spell , such as Zael using his " Wind " magic to spread the area of effect while the magic circle is active . In addition , characters can imbue their weapons with elemental properties from the circles . 
 In addition to the single @-@ player campaign , players have access to online multiplayer through the game 's main menu . The multiplayer features two modes : a competitive mode where players face each other in various stages , and a co @-@ op mode where a team of players face bosses from the single @-@ player campaign . For the competitive match , the player can choose from multiple allied and enemy characters , and all boons granted by equipment or experience levels are removed to level the playing field . Teams of up to six players can be formed for team matches . Players gain or lose points when they defeat or are defeated by an opponent , and defeated enemies respawn in the battlefield . When all opponents have been defeated , all players are awarded with items and equipment that can carry over into the single @-@ player campaign : those who performed the best receive higher @-@ quality equipment and " titles " ti distinguish them from other players . The co @-@ op battles allow players to carry over their equipment and character levels from single @-@ player , with the available characters being restricted to Zael 's mercenary group . Defeating a boss earns players items themed around it . In both modes , players communicate using a stock of scripted responses both taken from the single @-@ player campaign and specially created for multiplayer . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The Last Story is set on Lazulis Island , a vast seaborne fortress ruled by Count Arganan and allied to an unnamed human empire in the midst of crisis as the land decays and dies . The game begins with Dagran , the leader of a mercenary band , traveling to Lazulis in search of employment with fellow mercenaries Zael , Syrenne , <unk> , Lowell and <unk> . During the journey , Zael , who dreams of becoming a knight , encounters a mysterious force and is branded on the hand , granting him magical power . While on an errand in Lazulis , Zael runs into a woman named " Lisa " and helps her escape from pursuit by city guards . Employed as guards to Arganan for the royal wedding of Lady Calista and Lord Jirall , Zael encounters Calista and recognizes her as " Lisa " . The group also meet General Ashtar and his protegee Therius when Syrenne picks a fight with Therius . After revealing to Zael in private that hers is an arranged marriage , Lazulis is attacked by the Gurak , a race once banished from Lazulis by humans and now united under their ruler Zangurak . Zael , Calista and the rest of the mercenary group are forced to leave Lazulis in their pursuit of Zangurak . Zangurak escapes them , and the group are returned to Lazulis by the island 's knights . On Lazulis , the mercenaries are accused of aiding the Gurak by Jirall , but Dagran persuades Arganan to release them after showing him Zael 's mark , which is revealed to be a mystical " Mark of the Outsider " destined to save Lazulis from disaster . 
 Using Zael 's wish to become a knight as leverage , Arganan attempts to get Zael onto his side , including offering Calista 's hand in marriage . Zael reluctantly swears allegiance to Arganan , who orders Zael to direct Lazulis towards the Gurak lands , despite protests from Calista and reservations from Ashtar and Therius . During this time , Ashtar accepts him as a new pupal and gives him a medal following a successful sparring . Shortly after this , Gurak assassins attack and Ashtar is killed , warning Zael of a traitor before dying . Zael is accused of Ashtar 's murder by Jirall and imprisoned , but Calista frees him and , with secret help from Dagran , reveals that Jirall orchestrated Ashtar 's death . During these events , Calista and Zael come to love each other . When Lazulis arrives in Gurak lands and the attack begins , Zael is shocked to see the human troops killing Gurak women and children , and that the Gurak are suffering the same degradation of the land as humans are . While being comforted by Calista after the battle , his brand reacts with her blood and Ashtar 's medal to reveal a secret location on Lazulis . 
 Joined by Therius , they travel to the location and meet a Sorceress , who reveals the truth behind the land 's decay : the " Outsider " is an extraterrestrial being who crashed onto the planet , becoming split into two halves , now respectively controlled by humans and the Gurak . The death of the land is due to the Outsider absorbing its energy , and the two halves must be reunited and released to save the world . With this news , Zael refuses his knighthood and flees with Calista to free the Outsider . A Gurak attack reveals Lazulis ' half of the Outsider inside the island 's canon . Arganan first provokes into creating a great monster , then is killed when he attempts to absorb its power . The cannon 's firing having left Lazulis defenseless , Zael and the mercenaries aid the people while Therius holds off the attacking Gurak . Zael then heads out with Calista and the mercenaries to retrieve Zangurak 's half of the Outsider . Zael defeats Jirall , revealed to be a Gurak sympathizer , and then Zangurak ; during the latter battle , Lowell suffers fatal injuries . The group then find Dagran with the Outsider : claiming he used the mercenaries in his own quest for revenge against the Lazulis knights who killed his family , he absorbs the Outsider 's power . When defeated , he reconciles with the group before dying , then his spirit uses the Outsider 's energy to resurrect Lowell . Zael and Calista then free and reunite the two halves of the Outsider , which leaves the planet . Through Zael and Calista 's efforts , humans and Gurak manage to begin coexisting , sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact . In the epilogue , Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael 's care ; Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home ; the mercenaries hold a ceremony for Dagran ; and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista .

 The initial concepts for The Last Story came to Hironobu Sakaguchi after his departure from Square ( now Square Enix ) in 2003 . After a period working on games at his new studio Mistwalker , Sakaguchi realized that his style of game were not in tune with current gaming trends . Later , he elaborated that The Last Story was primarily born from reflecting on the design mistakes he made during the development of Blue Dragon ( 2006 ) and Lost Odyssey ( 2007 ) : while they tried to innovate with the story , they kept the gameplay very traditional . Sakaguchi drew up a design document for the game , and around that time met up with Takuya Matsumoto , a designer from AQ Interactive who had worked with Sakaguchi on Blue Dragon . They both realized that they held the same views on what was holding their games back in the current market , and decided to collaborate on the game with the goal of creating something new . In an interview with IGN , Sakaguchi said that development took three years : the first year was devoted to a trial @-@ and @-@ error development process devoted to the battle system . A longer development time of four years was reported by Matsumoto in a different interview with Gamasutra . According to Matsumoto , the team leads went to the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) each year and were assured that their game was in @-@ step with current gameplay trends . Production of The Last Story was a collaboration between Mistwalker , AQ Interactive and Nintendo , and was Sakaguchi 's first work as a director since Final Fantasy V ( 1992 ) . The game was going through its final development stages by April 2010 , and according to Sakaguchi was " complete " by December that year . 
 Although Sakaguchi 's previous RPGs from Mistwalker had been released for the Xbox 360 , The Last Story was created for the Wii . According to Sakaguchi , this was because Nintendo 's Shinji Hatano shared their vision of a role @-@ playing game that did not follow genre conversions , and so Sakaguchi accepted his offer of collaboration . After being contacted regarding both The Last Story and fellow Wii <unk> Xenoblade Chronicles , Hatano said that the games should be made for a wide audience and using a " romanticist approach " . When explaining why The Last Story was exclusive to the Wii , Sakaguchi said that it was because a large proportion of the late development staff , including the testers , came from Nintendo . In a later interview , he said that working with the Wii , which did not use high @-@ definition graphics , presented challenges as some of his ideas could not be implemented due to technical restrictions . Despite this , the team aimed to create a game that would look good when compared to games on high @-@ definition consoles . Matsumoto stated that Nintendo had a strong influence on the game , which did not always sit well with him despite their suggestions ultimately improving the game . He also stated that Nintendo 's creative and development aid in fine @-@ tuning the game was the reason for its extended development . 
 The basic story was conceived by Sakaguchi and Matsumoto , while the script was written by Sakaguchi , Masaru Hatano and Takatoshi Aoki . The story was contributed to by multiple staff members , which sometimes annoyed Sakaguchi when they suggested something that would be out of character for one of the cast . According to Sakaguchi , the initial version featuring a science fiction storyline was " shot down " by Nintendo , forcing the team to begin all over again with a new setting and characters . Despite the story still using science fiction elements , the team worked to distance the setting from those elements by focusing on bright , natural colors for the environments . The biographies of the main cast were put together during the story 's creation . Originally , according to Hatano , the game 's theme was to have been the " all @-@ important drama that takes place between a man and a woman " , but as development progressed it was changed to a theme of general companionship , although the original story remained the same . Hatano suggested incorporating dialogue into the gameplay rather than restricting it to cutscenes . This approach was inspired by both Uncharted and television series The West Wing . The concept was initially put forward as a joke about Zael 's habit of kicking doors open , and how his companions would comment on how he always did this . After receiving positive feedback , they implemented it and kept in Zael 's behavior . Sakaguchi used this in @-@ game dialogue to help convey the characters ' personalities : as part of this , adlibs from the actors were included , and continual adjustments were made to the script . The characters ' artwork also prompted Sakaguchi to make changes so the characters better fitted their presentation . The game 's voiced dialogue was estimated at 12 @,@ 000 lines . The option for players to skip through dialogue was a feature that Sakaguchi did not like , but he knew that some players would not like necessary long cutscenes , so gave them the option of going through them while still following the story . This meant that all the cutscenes needed to be done using the in @-@ game engine rather than pre @-@ rendered graphics . 
 The characters were designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka . Fujisaka , who was acquainted with Sakaguchi , was brought on board the project at the beginning . At that point , only a simple plot outline had been created , and Sakaguchi showed this to Fujisaka and asked what he visualized from it . Due to this , Fujisaka had a lot of leeway in his designs . Due to Sakaguchi living in Hawaii while the game was being developed , Fujisaka was initially nervous about working with him on the project , but ultimately he found their working relationship to be a positive one . An aspect that worried Fujisaka during the early stages was the decision to have the characters able to change their clothing : their original appearances had been designed in relation to their lines , and while designing extra outfits proved difficult , he ultimately enjoyed the experience . Fujisaka also worked as a world designer , initially feeling restricted by the console 's limited graphics . According to Fujisaka , the city hub began taking shape in 2009 , relatively early in development . The world design he initially created was fairly bleak , but after Nintendo insisted on the scenario being changed , he redesigned it around a brighter fantasy aesthetic . 
 Developing the gameplay began at the start of development , with a test environment being built to develop and refine the basics of the battle system . Work within the test build spanned approximately one and a half years . While creating the battle system , the staff decided that the key words should be " order " and " chaos " : whoever gained order on the battlefield would be the victor . One of the concepts that emerged from this was Gathering , Zael 's ability to direct all enemies ' attention towards him . At first , Gathering ended up generating an unwanted amount of chaos on the battlefield , and this resulted in the trial @-@ and @-@ error period for it running on for a long time . The biggest challenge , once the concept had been finalized , was adjusting its effectiveness on the battlefield depending on the situation and enemy types . A concept that did not make it into the final game was " Replay " : after an enemy successfully cast a spell , players could rewatch the last few seconds of battle from an overhead view to see what type it was and take that into their strategy . This slowed the pace of combat down too much , so the concept was entirely removed . <unk> of it include the ability to freeze time during certain actions , and the overhead perspective when commanding party members The cover system was designed around the limitations of the camera control born from the Wii Remote 's control scheme . 
 Matsumoto was responsible for the level design . While preparing destructible elements within the environment , the staff took care that they could be easily recognized by the player . So as to create a more direct experience than other Japanese RPGs , the camera view was deliberately restricted around Zael , so the player would be kept within his point of view . A difficult part of development was balancing story and gameplay , which sometimes caused clashes between Sakaguchi and Matsumoto , as Matsumoto would upset the balance and necessitate Sakaguchi re @-@ balancing it . The battle system and AI was refined by what Matsumoto described as " chaotic battles royal between over 20 people wielding swords , magic and guns or ally command systems " . The ability to fire projectiles had a big impact on the battle system 's design . This concept was a hangover from the game 's origins as a science fiction story . For the multiplayer , Sakaguchi avoided the potential for players to be rude to one @-@ another by restricting their dialogue to segments from the single @-@ player campaign . This was possible given the large amount of ambient dialogue in the game . 
 The game 's music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu , a long @-@ time collaborator with Sakaguchi who had worked on the Final Fantasy series , Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey . Uematsu initially had a rough time : the first three pieces of music he sent were rejected , and then Uematsu did not respond for some time . Sakaguchi worried that Uematsu might quit the project altogether . In fact , Uematsu realized Sakaguchi 's wishes for the title and had to rethink his approach entirely . With the second submission , Uematsu stated that he might leave if his music still did not fit , but it did and he remained as composer . In contrast to the majority of his earlier works , which made heavy use of purely melodic pieces and " jogging music " , Uematsu concentrated on a mixture between video game and film music to emphasize emotion and ambient sounds . He also worked to avoid creating signature jingles and fanfares . The most difficult pieces for him were battle tracks : the main battle theme was seven minutes long , but broken into small pieces that varied depending on situations and could be cued in depending on what was happening on the battlefield . The game 's theme song , " <unk> Mono " ( <unk> , lit . " The Flying One " ) , was composed by Uematsu with lyrics by Sakaguchi . Its lyrics are about the world someone is in not being where they are meant to be , with the phrase " going home " being used progressively through the song . According to Sakaguchi , the theme was quite personal for him , and also displays the " foreignness " of the game .

 Sakaguchi revealed that he was working on a new game in July 2009 . Initially targeted for a reveal that year , this was delayed for unknown reasons into 2010 . The game was announced by Nintendo in January 2010 , alongside its platform and logo . It was released on January 27 , 2011 . Despite prompting interest from genre fans in the west since its official announcement , shortly before its Japanese release , Nintendo announced that The Last Story would remain exclusive to Japan . Nintendo explained that the effort involved in bringing The Last Story overseas would be too much work on top of other important releases such as Kirby 's Epic Yarn and titles for the Nintendo 3DS . Despite this , Nintendo stated that there was a strong possibility of it releasing in the United Kingdom due to its growing RPG market . It was officially announced for Europe in June 2011 . The European localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe , using the same team that had done Xenoblade Chronicles . British voice actors were used for the dubbing , making use of various accents for the different characters . Some of the original programmers helped with the implementation of the localization , and it underwent unspecified adjustments . The game released in Europe on February 24 , 2012 . It received a limited edition , featuring a CD with seven music tracks and an artbook . It was also released in Australia on February 23 . 
 After a continued lack of confirmation of a North American release , including it not being included in Nintendo 's 2011 release schedule , a fan @-@ based movement called Operation Rainfall started a campaign to raise awareness for The Last Story , Xenoblade Chronicles , and another Wii RPG titled Pandora 's Tower . This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release . Despite acknowledging the effort , Nintendo stated that there were no plans for a North American release . Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought The Last Story would never make it to North America . At this point , Xseed Games , who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games , took an interest in publishing the title . Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011 , Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves . After playing through a Japanese copy of the game , and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game 's North American publishing rights . They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker . Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about The Last Story , and after being favorably impressed by their proposal , Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights . While a new localization for North America was considered , it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe 's localization as it better fitted the game 's atmosphere and aesthetic . It officially released in North America on August 14 , but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward .

 The story received mixed to positive reactions from critics . While they did not comment much on the story , Famitsu called The Last Story " very classical RPG " . Eurogamer 's Martin Robinson found the characters the most appealing part of the game , an opinion shared by Francesco <unk> of 1UP.com , who particularly cited Syrenne 's portrayal . GameSpot 's Mark Walton shared this opinion while also praising the story 's epic scale . IGN 's Keza MacDonald said that it presented a good story and characters within familiar themes and settings . Edge Magazine found the story fairly traditional despite a strong cast and emotional power , while Matthew Castle of Computer and Video Games praised the effort made to flesh out the party members in side @-@ missions despite referring to the main narrative as " tedious " . GameTrailers , while noting the familiar plotlines the game explored , said that The Last Story handled its plot better than others of its kind , praising its character development . Game Informer 's Joe Juba was fairly critical , finding the story overly predictable and the characters shallow . Jason <unk> of G4 was also critical of the characters and plot , calling the former " one @-@ note " despite convincing camaraderie and well @-@ written in @-@ game dialogue , and the latter impeded by problems with formulaic writing despite some late @-@ game twists . Simon Parkin , writing for Official Nintendo Magazine , found the characters likable despite a predictable story ; Nintendo Power shared points of praise with other reviewers , in addition to praising Zael and Calista 's romance , saying that it held the game together during some mid @-@ game stumbles . RPGamer 's Alex Fuller said that the story was great despite it using well @-@ worn cliches . Multiple critics gave high praise to the British @-@ voiced localization . 
 The gameplay was generally well received . Famitsu praised the battle system , saying that it was friendly towards casual gamers . MacDonald likewise praised the battle system as " one of the best combat systems I 've played with in any RPG , Japanese or otherwise " . Walton found the battle system fun and enjoyed the amount of side quests , while <unk> was highly positive about the game 's successful efforts in moving away from genre tradition . Juba enjoyed the multiplayer and praised the game for moving away from the genre 's traditional battle systems despite faults with their overall implementation , while Robinson found the gameplay suffered from the design goals that had fueled its creation . Castle was positive about the variety of gameplay and tactical elements despite some stiff combat mechanics , but noted the inability to alter difficulty being a point against the game . <unk> praised the fast pace and variety of the combat , but found that more cumbersome RPG elements and a lack of overall control negatively impacted the experience . GameTrailers generally praised about the way gameplay and combat was handled despite some " clunky " moments , but was less positive the multiplayer option 's balance and variety . Edge , while noting multiple core similarities with other games within the genre , found that other elements came together to make it a more fast @-@ paced cinematic experience than other traditional RPGs ; Fuller enjoyed the battle system , but thought that it lacked challenge and had difficulties with the camera . Parkin was generally positive about combat , particularly about the blending and gradual growth of character abilities , while Nintendo Power called the battle system " satisfying " and the multiplayer " surprisingly worthwhile " . Multiple reviewers commented on the game 's linear structure , with opinions ranging from indifferent to negative . 
 Opinions on the game 's visual style varied . Walton called the game 's visuals " some of the best ever seen on the Wii " , which was echoed to a degree by MacDonald . Castle was generally positive about the game 's aesthetics , citing the water effects as particularly good . Edge was fairly mixed , saying that well @-@ done environmental effects or the world @-@ building through character banter were spoiled by low @-@ quality textures and stilted character animations . Juba praised the character models , but found environments to be " ugly and muddy in comparison " ; Fuller , while not actively criticizing them , said that players used to high @-@ definition consoles would be disappointed . GameTrailers found the amount of detail put into environments " remarkable " for the Wii hardware despite a lack of scale , while Parkin found the visuals generally unimpressive despite a few stand @-@ out moments . Nintendo Power said that the graphics gave the game 's setting an " authentic " appearance despite some low @-@ resolution textures , while Eurogamer praised them for their " sepia tone " . Frame rate drops during moments of high activity were generally noted by reviewers . Uematsu 's incidental scoring also received praise from multiple critics .

In IGN 's " Best of 2012 " awards , it was awarded as " Best Wii U / Wii Sound " . 
 = Auriscalpium vulgare = 
 Auriscalpium vulgare , commonly known as the pinecone mushroom , the cone tooth , or the ear @-@ pick fungus , is a species of fungus in the family <unk> of the order Russulales . It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus , who included it as a member of the tooth fungi genus Hydnum , but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to contain it . The fungus is widely distributed in Europe , Central America , North America , and temperate Asia . Although common , its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily overlooked in the pine woods where it grows . A. vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture , but some historical literature says it used to be consumed in France and Italy . 
 The fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) grow on conifer litter or on conifer cones that may be partially or completely buried in soil . The dark brown cap of the small , spoon @-@ shaped mushroom is covered with fine brown hairs , and reaches a diameter of up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) . On the underside of the cap are a crowded array of tiny tooth @-@ shaped protrusions ( " teeth " ) up to 3 mm long ; they are initially whitish to purplish @-@ pink before turning brown in age . The dark brown and hairy stem , up to 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) long and 2 mm thick , attaches to one edge of the cap . The mushroom produces a white spore print out of roughly spherical spores . 
 High levels of humidity are essential for optimum fruit body development , and growth is inhibited by excesses of either light or darkness . Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development , which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release . The pure culture , cell division and the ultrastructure of A. vulgare 's hyphae and mycelia have been studied and described in search of potentially useful characters for phylogenetic analysis . When grown in culture , the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions . 
 = = History , taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described in the scientific literature by Carl Linnaeus under the name Hydnum auriscalpium in his 1753 Species Plantarum . Linnaeus placed three other tooth fungi in the genus Hydnum : H. imbricatum , H. repandum , and H. tomentosum . In 1821 Samuel Frederick Gray considered H. auriscalpium to be sufficiently distinct from the other Hydnum species to warrant the creation of a new genus , Auriscalpium , to contain it . In the process , its name was changed to Auriscalpium vulgare . 
 Otto Kuntze and Howard James Banker later independently sought to restore Linnaeus ' species name , but the resulting combination ( Auriscalpium auriscalpium ) is a tautonym and disallowed under the rules for botanical nomenclature ( ICBN 2005 rule 23 @.@ 4 ) , and these combinations are therefore no longer validly published . Other names given to the fungus and now considered synonyms include Hydnum <unk> , named by Josef Velenovský in 1922 , and later combinations based on this name . A. vulgare is the type species of the widely distributed genus of eight species that it belongs to . 
 Despite vast differences in appearance and morphology , A. vulgare is related to such varied taxa as the gilled fungi of Lentinus , the <unk> genus Albatrellus , the coral @-@ like <unk> , and fellow tooth fungus <unk> . The relationship of all of these taxa — members of the <unk> family of the order Russulales — has been demonstrated through molecular phylogenetics . 
 Auriscalpium vulgare is commonly known as the " pinecone mushroom " , the " cone tooth " , " pine cone tooth " , or the " ear @-@ pick fungus " . Gray called it the " common <unk> @-@ stool " ; it was also referred to as the " fir @-@ cone Hydnum " , when it was still considered to be a member of that genus . The specific epithet vulgare means " common " . The generic name Auriscalpium is Latin for " ear pick " and refers to a small , scoop @-@ shaped instrument used to remove foreign matter from the ear . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit body of A. vulgare is fibrous when fresh and becomes stiff when dry . It is small species rarely exceeding 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) in height , with a cap usually smaller than an adult 's fingernails : 0 @.@ 5 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) — although it has been known to reach up to 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) . 
 Auriscalpium vulgare usually has a single stem , but occasionally several stems arise from a thick common base . It attaches to the side of the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base . Its surface is covered with hairy fibers ( especially near the base ) , and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown . The cap is semicircular or kidney @-@ shaped , flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top . The surface is at first much like the stem : covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown . However , it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black . The cap margin is usually buff to light brown – roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center . It becomes rolled inward ( revolute ) and often wavy in maturity . The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips . White to light brown when young , they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray . Occasionally , fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely . 
 The cap flesh is composed of two distinct layers : a thin , compact , black @-@ brown and hairy upper layer , and a thick , soft , white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin , thread @-@ like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion . The stem is similarly divided , with a thin , dark and hairy cortical layer covered by hairs , which encircles inner ochre @-@ colored flesh . A drop of potassium hydroxide applied to the surface of the mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black . 
 The mushroom , which has no distinct taste or odor , is generally considered inedible because of its toughness and diminutive size . An 1887 textbook noted , however , that it was " commonly eaten in France and Italy " . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 Spore deposits are white . Viewed under a light microscope , the spores appear hyaline ( translucent ) , covered with minute wart @-@ like bumps , and are spherical or nearly so , with dimensions of 4 @.@ 6 – 5 @.@ 5 by 4 – 5 µm . They are amyloid ( reacting to Melzer 's reagent ) and cyanophilous ( staining in methyl blue ) . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells of the hymenium ) are four @-@ spored with basal clamps , and measure 15 – 24 by 3 – 4 µm , and sterigmata ( extensions of the basidia that bear the spores ) are swollen at the base and roughly 3 µm long . The hyphal system is dimitic , comprising both generative ( undifferentiated ) and skeletal ( structural ) hyphae . The thin @-@ walled generative hyphae are hyaline , and have clamp connections ; the thick @-@ walled skeletal hyphae are thicker overall and lack such connections . The cortex ( the tougher outer layer of flesh ) is made of parallel unbranched generative hyphae that are brown , thick @-@ walled , clumped together , and frequently clamped . The internal flesh is made of interwoven generative and skeletal hyphae . <unk> hyphae ( containing oily or granular contents ) are also present , protruding into the hymenium as club @-@ like or sharp @-@ pointed gloeocystidia . 
 The hyphae of <unk> fungi are partitioned by cross @-@ walls called septa , and these septa have pores that permit the passage of cytoplasm or protoplasm between adjacent hyphal compartments . In an effort to determine ultrastructural characters useful for systematic and phylogenetic analyses of the Agaricomycotina , Gail Celio and colleagues used electron microscopy to examine both the structure of the septal pore , and nuclear division in A. vulgare . They determined that septa found in hyphae of the hymenium have bell @-@ shaped pore " caps " with multiple perforations . Each cap extends along the length of the septum , along with a zone surrounding the pore that is free of organelles . Due to the scarcity of similar data from other Agaricomycotina species , it is unknown whether the extended septal pore cap margins of A. vulgare are phylogenetically informative . Regarding nuclear division , the process of metaphase I of meiosis is similar to the metaphase of mitosis . Spherical spindle pole bodies containing electron @-@ opaque inclusions are set within gaps on opposite ends of the nuclear membrane . This membrane has occasional gaps but is largely continuous . Fragments of endoplasmic reticulum occur near the spindle pole bodies , but do not form a cap . 
 = = Growth in culture = = 
 Auriscalpium vulgare can be grown in pure culture on agar @-@ containing plates supplemented with nutrients . The colonies that grow are white to pale cream , and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation . The mycelium is made of bent @-@ over hyphae , without any aerial hyphae ( hyphae that extend above the surface of the agar ) . Typically , two indistinct zones develop at about 6 mm and 15 mm from the initial inoculum spot , with each zone roughly 4 mm wide . The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar . 
 The mature mycelium consists of thin @-@ walled , densely packed hyphae that are 1 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 2 µm in diameter . They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral ( <unk> ) , and frequently branched at an angle of about 45 ° , with a clamp at the base of the branch . They contain amorphous granules that appear refractive when viewed under phase contrast microscopy , and their walls are often encrusted with tiny granules . <unk> ( thin @-@ walled cystidia with refractive , frequently granular contents ) are common ; they measure 50 – 85 by 6 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 5 µm , and are club @-@ shaped ( sometimes elongated ) , thin @-@ walled , and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips . Containing foamy and pale yellow contents , they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast . Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface . Crystalline deposits are abundant as small , randomly scattered plate @-@ like or star @-@ like crystals . 
 Fruiting begins about six weeks after the initial inoculation on the agar plate , but only when portions of fruit bodies ( spines or stem sections ) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth ; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting . Mature fruit bodies grow very close to the initial site of inoculation — within 3 mm — and take about 60 days to mature after they first start to form . 
 = = Fruit body development = = 
 Fruit body primordia first appear between the scales of the cones , and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height . They consist of an inner core of thin @-@ walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae . Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate , but gradually become brown as they mature . Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends , cap development interrupts stem growth , and this shift to centrifugal growth ( that is , growth outward from the stem ) results in the typical kidney @-@ shaped or semicircular cap . Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature , spores production begins within 48 – 72 hours of the start of cap growth . Spines start out as minute protuberances on the part of the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap . As the cap enlarges , these spines are spread horizontally , and more protuberances are formed , which elongate vertically downwards . 
 When grown in favorable conditions of high water availability and humidity , the fruit body can proliferate by growing additional ( secondary ) fruit bodies on all parts of its upper and lower surfaces . These secondary growths typically number between four and seven ; some may be aborted as the nutrients from the pine cone substrate are depleted , resulting in stems lacking caps . In one instance , a complete secondary proliferation was noted ( i.e. , growing from a primary proliferation ) that developed completely so as to produce viable spores . Humidity is a limiting factor for optimum fruit body development . Removal of incompletely mature laboratory @-@ grown specimens from a relative humidity ( R.H. ) of over 98 % to one of 65 – 75 % causes the fruit bodies to brown and stop growing . When transferred to an even lower R.H. of about 50 % , the stems quickly begin to collapse . Light also affects fruit body development : both continuous illumination and complete darkness inhibit growth . 
 When a stem is developing , the fungus is negatively geotropic , so that if the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees , it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours . The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves <unk> — they will grow at right angles to the direction of gravity . Finally , the spines are positively geotropic , and will re @-@ orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes . Because the second ( cap formation ) and third ( spine formation ) geotropic responses overlap , there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously . These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Auriscalpium vulgare is a saprobic species . Its mushrooms grow solitary or clustered on fallen pine cones , especially those that are fully or partially buried . It typically favors Scots Pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) , but has also been reported on spruce cones , and in California grows primarily on Douglas @-@ fir cones . One author noted finding the mushroom on spruce needles on top of squirrel dens where cone bracts were present in the forest floor . In a study conducted in the Laojun Mountain region of Yunnan Province , China , A. vulgare was found to be one of the most dominant species collected from mixed forest at an altitude of 2 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 000 m ( 8 @,@ 500 – 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . A study on the effect of slash and burn practices in northeast India showed that the fungus prefers to fruit on burned cones of the Khasi Pine , and that the number of fruit bodies on unburned cones increases with cone girth . 
 The fungus is widely distributed in Europe , Central and North America , temperate Asia , and Turkey . In North America , its range extends from Canada to the Trans @-@ Mexican Volcanic Belt south of Mexico City . The mushroom is common , appearing in the summer and autumn , although it is easily overlooked because of its small size and nondescript coloration . A. vulgare is the only representative of its genus in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere . 
 = German cruiser Köln = 
 Köln was a light cruiser , the third member of the Königsberg class that was operated between 1929 and March 1945 , including service in World War II . She was operated by two German navies , the Reichsmarine and the Kriegsmarine . She had two sister ships , Königsberg and Karlsruhe . Köln was built by the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel ; she was laid down in August 1926 , launched in May 1928 , and commissioned into the Reichsmarine in January 1930 . She was armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm SK C / 25 guns in three triple turrets and had a top speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . 
 Like her sister ships , Köln served as a training ship for naval cadets in the 1930s , and joined the non @-@ intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during the latter part of the decade . After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , she conducted several operations in the North Sea , but did not encounter any British warships . She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weserübung in April 1940 , and she was the only member of her class to survive the operation . In 1942 , she was modified to carry a Flettner Fl 282 helicopter experimentally . Later in 1942 , she returned to Norway , but did not see significant action . She remained there until early 1945 , when she returned to Germany ; in March , she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven . She remained on an even keel , with her gun turrets above water ; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to defenders of the city until the end of the war in May 1945 . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Köln was 174 meters ( 571 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 15 @.@ 2 m ( 50 ft ) and a maximum draft of 6 @.@ 28 m ( 20 @.@ 6 ft ) . She displaced 7 @,@ 700 long tons ( 7 @,@ 800 t ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of four steam turbines and a pair of 10 @-@ cylinder four @-@ stroke diesel engines . Steam for the turbines was provided by six Marine @-@ type double @-@ ended oil @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) and a range of approximately 5 @,@ 700 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 600 km ; 6 @,@ 600 mi ) at 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . Köln had a crew of 21 officers and 493 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with nine 15 cm SK C / 25 guns mounted in three triple gun turrets . One was located forward , and two were placed in a superfiring pair aft . The rear gun turrets were offset to increase their arc of fire . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 080 rounds of ammunition , for 120 shells per gun . The ship was also equipped with two 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 45 anti @-@ aircraft guns in single mounts ; they had 400 rounds of ammunition each . Köln also carried four triple torpedo tube mounts located amidships ; they were supplied with twenty @-@ four 50 cm ( 20 in ) torpedoes . She was also capable of carrying 120 naval mines . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick amidships and an armored belt that was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides .

 Köln was ordered as " Cruiser D " under the contract name Ersatz Arcona , as a replacement for the old cruiser Arcona . The keel for Köln was laid on 7 August 1926 at the Kriegsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven . She was launched on 23 May 1928 , and commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 15 January 1930 , the last member of her class to be completed . She spent the year conducting sea trials and training in the Baltic Sea . In 1931 , she was modified with dual 8 @.@ 8 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns to replace the original single mounts , the rear superstructure was enlarged , and a fire control system was installed aft . Köln departed on a cruise into the Atlantic in early 1932 for more extensive sea trials . After returning to Germany , she took on her first crew of naval cadets for a world cruise , departing Germany in late 1932 . The tour lasted a full year ; she stopped in ports across the globe , including in the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian Oceans , and the Mediterranean Sea . 
 In 1935 , the ship had an aircraft catapult installed , along with cranes to handle float planes . A pole mast was also installed on the rear side of the aft funnel . Köln continued to serve as a training ship until early 1936 , when she was transferred to fishery protection duty . Later that year , she joined the non @-@ intervention patrols off Spain during the Spanish Civil War . After the German heavy cruiser Deutschland was attacked by Republican bombers in the so @-@ called " Deutschland incident " , Köln transported wounded crew members from Deutschland back to Germany . Köln conducted a further four patrols off Spain before returning to fishery protection in the North Sea in 1938 . Late in the year , she went into drydock for a refit in Kiel .

 In March 1939 , Köln participated in the annexation of Memel which Germany had demanded from Lithuania . Later in the year , she joined the battleship Gneisenau and the heavy cruisers Deutschland , Admiral Scheer , and Admiral Graf Spee for a major series of maneuvers in the Atlantic . In the final days of August , Köln was stationed in the western Baltic to prevent Polish vessels from fleeing after the German invasion of Poland on 1 September ; she was unsuccessful in this task . She thereafter joined her sister ships in laying a series of defensive minefields . 
 Köln joined Gneisenau and nine destroyers for a sortie into the North Sea on 7 – 9 October . The goal was to draw units of the Royal Navy over a U @-@ boat line and into range of the Luftwaffe , though it failed on both counts . The British launched an air attack consisting of 12 Wellington bombers , though it too failed to hit any of the German warships . On 20 – 22 November , Köln and the cruiser Leipzig escorted the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst on the first leg of their sortie into the North Atlantic . On the 22nd , Köln and Leipzig were detached to join an unsuccessful patrol for Allied merchant ships in the Skagerrak along with Deutschland and three torpedo boats . The patrol lasted until 25 November , and failed to locate any Allied freighters . On 13 December , Köln , Leipzig , and Nürnberg covered the return of several destroyers that had laid an offensive minefield off Newcastle . 
 Köln took part in Operation Weserübung , the invasion of Norway , in April 1940 . She was assigned Group 3 , tasked with the assault on Bergen , along with her sister Königsberg . She reached the harbor unscathed , but Königsberg was not so lucky ; she was badly damaged by Norwegian coastal guns . Köln nevertheless supported the German infantry ashore with her main guns . After the port was secured , she returned to Germany , along with a pair of destroyers . In late 1940 , she went into drydock for further modifications . A degaussing coil was installed , along with a helicopter landing platform on top of turret " Bruno " . She thereafter served as a testbed for the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter , a task she performed until 1942 . 
 While still conducting experiments with the FI 282 in September 1941 , Köln provided gunfire support to ground troops attacking Soviet positions on Dagö in the Gulf of Riga . She also bombarded Soviet positions on Ristna . She joined the battleship Tirpitz , Admiral Scheer , Nürnberg , and several destroyers and torpedo boats formed the Baltic Fleet , which was intended to block any Soviet warships from fleeing the eastern Baltic . No Soviet vessels attempted to do so , however . On 13 July , the Soviet submarine <unk> @-@ 322 tried to attack Köln , but the cruiser 's escorts forced the Soviet submarine to break off the attack . 
 Toward the end of 1941 , she was transferred to the North Sea , and went into drydock for her last major modification . This consisted of the installation of a FuMO 21 radar set on the forward command center roof . In July 1942 , Köln departed Germany to join the growing naval presence in Norway , though she saw no major action there . On 13 September , she and the heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer and Admiral Hipper and two destroyers attempted to attack Convoy PQ 18 . While en route from Narvik to Altenfjord , the flotilla was attacked by the British submarine HMS Tigris , but the torpedoes passed behind the German ships . The convoy was instead attacked by U @-@ boats and long @-@ range bombers , which sank thirteen freighters . She returned to Germany in January 1943 , where she was decommissioned in Kiel on 17 February . She was sent to drydock in early 1944 for an overhaul to prepare her to return to combat duty ; this was completed by 1 July . The cruiser served briefly as a training ship before escorting German merchant vessels in Norway . While en route from Kristiansand on 7 July , the ship laid a defensive minefield in the Skagerrak . She and three destroyers laid another minefield on 14 – 15 July , before steaming to Trondheim . 
 On the night of 13 – 14 December , Köln was attacked by British bombers in Oslofjord ; several near misses caused damage to her propulsion system that required repair in Germany . She departed Norway on 23 January 1945 in company with Admiral Hipper and a destroyer , and arrived in Kiel on 8 February . She then proceeded to Wilhelmshaven , where she was again attacked by Allied bombers repeatedly . On 30 March , B @-@ 24 Liberators from the Eighth Air Force attacked the harbor ; Köln was hit and sank on an even keel . Since her guns remained above water , the ship was used as an artillery battery to defend the city from advancing Allied forces . She served in this capacity until the end of the war in May . She was partially dismantled in situ after the end of the war , and finally raised in 1956 for scrapping . 
 = Rosendale Theatre = 
 The Rosendale Theatre is a three @-@ story , 260 @-@ seat movie theater and performance venue in Rosendale Village , a hamlet and former village in the town of Rosendale in Ulster County , New York . The building was opened as a casino in 1905 , and began showing films in the 1920s . By the 1930s , a stage had been installed for live vaudeville and burlesque acts . The casino was eventually taken over by the local government , and used to house the town 's fire department . 
 A tile setter , Anthony Cacchio Sr. , rented the building in 1949 and converted it into a movie theater ; it opened on February 18 , 1949 with a screening of the film Blood on the Moon . Cacchio owned the building outright by the mid @-@ 1950s . During this time , a severe flood damaged the Theatre 's interior , and all the equipment had to be replaced . In its early years , the Theatre showed about 300 different movies each year , making it unpopular with film distributors . Denied easy access to first run films , the Theatre turned to independent movies and art films , and eventually began exhibiting live performances . Cacchio 's entire family helped run the Theatre ; his wife Fannie sold tickets and determined the Theatre 's movie selection , while their sons Anthony Jr. and Rocco , and grandson Michael , ran the projector and eventually managed the day @-@ to @-@ day operation of the business . 
 After more than 60 years of continuous operation , the Cacchio family decided to sell the Theatre . Rather than sell to real estate developers , the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective , a nonprofit formed in late 2009 for the sole purpose of buying and preserving the Theatre . The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building , with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations . About 60 fundraisers were held , and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project . The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August 19 , 2010 . Since its purchase , the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades , including a move to digital cinema . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Construction and early use = = = 
 The first building constructed on the site now occupied by the Theatre was reputedly a blacksmith shop , erected during the 19th century to service the town 's cement mills and the Delaware and Hudson Canal . The current three @-@ story structure was opened in 1905 as the Rosendale Casino . As a casino , the building doubled as a theater , screening movies in the 1920s on 16 mm film . 
 The following decade , the casino began exhibiting burlesque and vaudeville acts to draw crowds , and a raised stage was installed for the live performances . The building eventually became village property , and housed the town 's fire house . Known as Firemen 's Hall , the building was also used by the town 's fire department as a basketball court . Basketball was extremely popular in Rosendale in the 1940s . On Friday nights the Firemen 's Hall became a dance hall , and people would sometimes square dance in formal attire . 
 = = = Ownership by the Cacchios = = = 
 Anthony Cacchio Sr. , a tile setter from Poughkeepsie who bore a strong resemblance to filmmaker Otto Preminger , received permission to rent the building from the village 's mayor , who strongly desired a movie theater in Rosendale . Cacchio opened the former casino as a one @-@ room , 300 @-@ seat movie theater on February 18 , 1949 . Critics of the venture , wary of out @-@ of @-@ towners , claimed it would not be profitable , and that the Theatre ( which the Cacchios pronounced " thee @-@ ate @-@ er " , with a long " a " sound ) would be closed within six months . 
 Tickets were sold for 50 cents apiece for adults and 25 cents for children , and the first film shown on opening night was a western , Blood on the Moon . Cacchio 's sons , Anthony " Uncle Tony " Cacchio Jr. and Rocco " Rocky " Cacchio , worked with him at the Theatre , serving as ushers on opening night , and eventually running the Theatre . Cacchio 's wife , Fannie , sold tickets to moviegoers . She had never held such a job before the Theatre 's opening , but continued to sell tickets and work at the Theatre for over five decades without requesting a single paycheck . The Theatre continued to house the town 's fire department for some time ; one Rosendale resident , Bill Brooks , later recalled walking around a fire truck to reach the bathroom . 
 The Cacchio family owned the building outright by 1954 , and in 1955 the Rondout Creek flooded , filling the Theatre with 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) of water and destroying its contents . The Cacchios took out loans and received relief funds from the government to rebuild . A new 35 mm projector and sound equipment were installed , along with " pull @-@ handle vending machines " . A popcorn machine was added , but broke down in 1965 and was not replaced . While most movie theaters at the time generated profit by selling concessions , Anthony Cacchio Jr. made the " daring move " of banning popcorn in the Theatre in 1964 because it was " too smelly , messy on the seats , and crackling paper bags disrupted quiet scenes " . 
 Anthony Cacchio Jr. was trained to operate the Theatre 's equipment by one of his employees , a union projectionist who left in 1966 to work at a different theater in Kingston . By 1980 , the cost of tickets was half that of competing , larger theaters , and annual attendance was between 40 @,@ 000 and 50 @,@ 000 people . 
 For several years following its 1949 opening , the Theatre would only screen a movie for two days , with double features twice a week ; about 300 different movies were shown each year . By rapidly introducing and removing movies from circulation , the Theatre became unpopular with film distributors , and was often forced to wait until after a film had been shown in nearby Kingston . This proved beneficial at times ; the Theatre screened Chariots of Fire the same week it won the 1981 Academy Award for Best Picture . To compensate for its lack of first run films , the Theatre began showing independent films , films by local artists , and foreign art films . Longstanding patrons , dissatisfied with mainstream , sensationalist cinema , were generally receptive to the " more eclectic stuff " . Avoiding first @-@ run films for several weeks also allowed the Theatre to pay distributors a lower percentage of its gross profits on each film . 
 Anthony Cacchio Sr. had had a stroke by the late 1990s , but continued to work at the Theatre . He wore a suit to work each day , including the day before his death in 1998 . That same year his grandson , Michael Cacchio , began to help run the Theatre . Michael Cacchio supported the introduction of live performances , and was the primary reason the Theatre began exhibiting art films , though his grandmother Fannie Cacchio remained the " power broker " who determined which movies were shown . She reputedly warned moviegoers if a film was of poor quality or obscene , and continued to work at the Theatre until her death in 2004 . 
 The history of the Theatre was documented in an 8 @-@ minute , 26 @-@ second film by four local teenagers . The four were attending a screening of Fahrenheit 9 / 11 at the Theatre , during which a member of the audience announced that it was Fannie Cacchio 's 93rd birthday . The teens , enrolled in a summer film camp , were seeking to create a documentary and decided to make the Theatre their subject . Filming took six weeks , wrapping around August 2004 . In what a Daily Freeman reporter described as " [ p ] erhaps the most precious moment " of the film , Fannie Cacchio got out of her son 's car and walked through the Theatre 's doors , two weeks before her death . The documentary was shown in 2005 , and again during the Theatre 's 60th anniversary celebration in 2009 . 
 By this time , the price of tickets had risen to $ 6 each , and popcorn was available for $ 1 per bag . Drinks , as well as brownies baked by Anthony Cacchio Jr . , were also $ 1 each . The Theatre served as one of three screening locations for the Woodstock Film Festival , along with theaters in Rhinebeck and Woodstock . After years of resisting live entertainment , the Theatre allowed its stage to be used as a platform for a John Kerry rally on October 26 , 2004 . It was the first time there had been such an event in the building in over 55 years . By 2005 , live performances were commonplace at the Theatre . The acoustics of the building also made it suitable for musical performances , beginning in autumn 2006 with a jazz performance by Kevin Mahogany . 
 = = = Preservation campaign = = = 
 The unexpected November 2008 death of Rocco Cacchio prompted the family to sell the business . In November 2009 , a real estate developer offered to purchase the Theatre from the Cacchios , who sought between $ 400 @,@ 000 and $ 500 @,@ 000 for the property . A private local group , the Rosendale Theatre Collective ( RTC ) , had formed in October 2009 to purchase and preserve the Theatre . The RTC was advised by a committee of 17 people , which included actors Aidan Quinn , David Strathairn , Melissa Leo , Denny Dillon , Mandy Patinkin , radio personality Bruce Morrow , screenwriter Ron <unk> , and author Kim <unk> . 
 The group planned to raise a total of $ 100 @,@ 000 for a down payment on the Theatre before a March 15 , 2010 deadline , raising $ 13 @,@ 000 by December 9 , and reaching $ 25 @,@ 000 by December 18 . New York State Assemblyman Kevin Cahill indicated support for the group in his January 2010 newsletter . Cahill had enjoyed the Theatre as a child , and urged the RTC to " hang onto the vintage candy machine at all costs " . 
 The Cacchios expressed a desire to sell the Theatre to the RTC rather than to developers , because the RTC consisted of friends of the family and other residents whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre . To make the transfer of ownership easier , the Cacchios agreed to continue operating the Theatre until such a deal could be reached , and to assist in the operation of the Theatre after its sale to the RTC . By late February 2010 the RTC had raised $ 45 @,@ 000 , and needed to reach a total of $ 600 @,@ 000 . After a down payment of $ 160 @,@ 000 , and paying the full cost of the property , the remaining funds would cover renovations to the building . Over $ 8 @,@ 000 was raised in a silent auction on February 28 . More than 100 people attended the auction , including Congressman Maurice Hinchey . 
 By March 2010 the RTC had been approved as a 501 ( c ) nonprofit organization . The group managed to raise between $ 55 @,@ 000 and $ 80 @,@ 000 , less than half the amount required for the down payment , and the deadline was extended to May 15 . A benefit on March 28 was expected to raise $ 5 @,@ 000 . One local newspaper , the Blue Stone Press , speculated that the RTC 's 501 ( c ) status would benefit the group financially . New York Times reporter Peter <unk> , feeling that " [ o ] ne of the best barometers of whether a small town has a pulse is the [ condition of its ] old downtown movie house " , speculated that the effort to preserve the Theatre bode well for Rosendale . 
 The RTC entered the Pepsi Refresh Project on March 1 , hoping to receive between $ 5 @,@ 000 and $ 25 @,@ 000 during the April competition . Created by PepsiCo in 2010 as a way to distribute $ 33 million that would otherwise fund its Super Bowl ads , the contest sought to provide funding for community projects . The ten projects receiving the most votes would each receive $ 50 @,@ 000 grants . By April , the RTC was courting large institutions , such as IBM , for funding . Other planned activities designed to raise funds in April and May were a series of potlucks , a writing workshop , a music benefit , an online auction , and a screening of rare 1970s films at activist Jay <unk> 's house . Most of the RTC 's funding came from individual donations between $ 25 and $ 100 , and roughly 60 fundraisers were held in total . 
 The Theatre outpaced 362 other Pepsi Refresh entrants , and was in first place by the middle of April . The RTC attributed its success in the contest to its use of social networking services , notably Facebook . The group considered moving to a digital projector with the forthcoming grant to replace the existing projector , an expected cost of $ 100 @,@ 000 . By late May , the group had won the April competition and was waiting for the Pepsi funds , before tendering a down payment on the Theatre , initially planned for June 10 . The closing date of the sale was pushed back to allow time to finalize the deal . In mid @-@ June , the Playback Theatre planned a benefit for the RTC in which improv actors would perform skits based on audience members ' stories of experiences they had at the Theatre . 
 = = = Ownership by the Theatre Collective = = = 
 That July , the RTC took out a $ 385 @,@ 000 mortgage on the Theatre from two banks , the Rondout Savings Bank and the Ulster Savings Bank . After being run by the Cacchios for 61 years , the RTC assumed ownership of the Theatre on August 19 , 2010 . Announcing its intent to show the same kind of movies that the Theatre screened during the Cacchio 's tenure , the group also agreed to continue exhibiting live acts , continue participating in the Woodstock Film Festival , renovate the building , and add digital equipment . The second and third floors may be renovated and used for offices , and as space for rehearsals and performances . 
 The RTC secured a new retractable screen by October 2010 , from a New Windsor – based entertainment supplier , to replace the fixed screen that had obscured access to the Theatre 's 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) stage . The new screen opened the stage by 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) , allowing live acts . Under the Cacchios , the screen had been replaced once a decade , with an engineer performing maintenance once every six months . Eight Behringer stereo surround sound speakers and two subwoofers were installed in the building in December 2010 . By February 2011 , the RTC also added a digital projector , a stage thrust , a server for digital programming , and a new phone system . The group announced plans to add a concession stand , an additional server , and an uninterruptible power supply . The group also intended to move the ticket booth outside during warm months . 
 In late February 2011 , Assemblyman Cahill helped the RTC secure a $ 175 @,@ 000 state grant to pay for part of the $ 250 @,@ 000 worth of renovations to the building . The renovations included improvements to the ticket and concession stands , and repairs to the Theatre 's lighting system , roof , ceiling , and bathroom . It would also allow the RTC to buy new curtains and wall coverings , and to restore the building 's exterior . That March , the town began applying for $ 300 @,@ 000 to $ 500 @,@ 000 in state grants to restore buildings on Main Street . The agency responsible for distributing the grants reported that the Theatre may be eligible for up to $ 250 @,@ 000 in state funding to " help establish or expand [ it ] as a cultural or business anchor that is key to local revitalization efforts " . 
 = Who 's That Girl ( soundtrack ) = 
 Who 's That Girl : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is a soundtrack album by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna , from the film of the same name , and was released on July 21 , 1987 by Sire Records . It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti , Duncan Faure , Club Nouveau , Coati Mundi and Michael Davidson . The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album , despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album . After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan ( 1985 ) , Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer , about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide . However , due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise ( 1986 ) , Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project , but later agreed , after Madonna convinced them and also because they wanted to cash in on Madonna 's success with soundtracks . 
 Madonna began working on the soundtrack in December 1986 , and contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray , who had worked as producers on her third studio album True Blue ( 1986 ) . She felt that an uptempo song and a downtempo song were needed for the album . Leonard composed the music for the uptempo song , with Madonna providing the melody and lyrics . The singer named the track " Who 's That Girl " and , believing this to be a better title than Slammer , changed the name of the film to the same . Together , Madonna and Leonard also developed the downtempo ballad " The Look of Love " . Two more songs were composed for the film with Bray , the first being the dance @-@ y tune " Causing a Commotion " , and the other being " Can 't Stop " , a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas . 
 After its release , the Who 's That Girl soundtrack received a mostly negative response from critics . Some reviews described the album as plain and incomplete , although the title track and " The Look of Love " were praised as its highlights . The soundtrack was a commercial success , reaching the top ten of the album charts of the United States , Austria , Canada , France , Italy , New Zealand , Sweden and the United Kingdom , while topping the charts of Germany , and European Album chart . The album went on to sell six million copies worldwide . 
 Three of the Madonna tracks were released as singles . The title track became her sixth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 , making her the first artist to accumulate six number @-@ one singles in the 1980s , and the first female performer to get that many number @-@ ones as a solo act . " Causing a Commotion " was released as the second single , and reached number two on the Hot 100 . " The Look of Love " was a European market @-@ only release , reaching the top ten in United Kingdom . Another track , " Turn It Up " was a promotional release in United States , reaching number 15 on the dance charts . Who 's That Girl received further promotion from the successful Who 's That Girl World Tour .

 Madonna 's 1985 comedy film Desperately Seeking Susan was a commercial success , prompting her to take further interest in acting . For her next screen project , she picked another comedy , initially titled Slammer , but later named Who 's That Girl . Madonna played the character of Nikki Finn , a young woman accused of homicide who insisted that she was innocent . Released on parole , she was determined to clear her name . Along with a character named Loudon Trott ( played by Griffin Dunne ) , she gets caught up in 36 hours of high adventure , culminating in a scene where Nikki interrupts a wedding to reveal the identity of the real murderer . Regarding the character Nikki , Madonna commented , 
 " I had a lot in common with Nikki . She 's courageous and sweet and funny and misjudged . But she clears her name in the end , and that 's always good to do . I 'm continuously doing that with the public . I liked Nikki 's tough side and her sweet side . The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside . " 
 However , in the light of the bad publicity surrounding Madonna and her then husband Sean Penn , coupled with the fact that their drama film Shanghai Surprise had failed commercially , she had to fight hard to persuade Warner Bros. to green light the project . She also wanted her close friend James Foley to direct the film , proclaiming him to be a " genius " . Foley had previously directed the music videos of her songs " Live to Tell " , " Papa Don 't Preach " and " True Blue " . Warner Bros. were looking for another way to cash in upon Madonna 's success with soundtracks , and felt that her name alone might be enough to guarantee the success of the film as well as its soundtrack . So they felt that they had no choice , but to green light the project . Filming began in October 1986 , in New York , but it was not until January that Madonna started working on the soundtrack . 
 = = Development = = 
 Having some specific ideas in her mind about the music of the film , Madonna contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray , who had helped to write and produce her third studio album True Blue in 1986 . Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song . As per her demands , Leonard developed the uptempo song . Madonna came to the recording studio one Thursday , and Leonard handed her a cassette of a recording of the chorus , which he had just finished working on . Madonna went to the backroom and completed the melody and the lyrics of the song , while Leonard worked on the other parts of it . After finishing the lyrics , Madonna decided to name the song " Who 's That Girl " , and changed the title of Slammer to the same , considering it to be a better name . In Fred Bronson 's book The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits , Leonard explained that the song was recorded in one day with Madonna recording her vocals only once . Additional guitar and percussion tracks were added later by Leonard and Bray . 
 The downtempo song was developed on the following day , with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody . Named " The Look of Love " , the song contains the line " No where to run , no place to hide . From the look of love , from the eyes of pride " . After " The Look of Love " , Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer . The first was called " Causing a Commotion " , and was inspired by Penn and the couple 's often tumultuous relationship . Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn was on the verge of breaking @-@ up , due to Penn 's abusive and violent nature . In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10 , 1987 , Madonna spoke about Penn 's impact on her life and the song : " I don 't like violence . I never condone hitting anyone , and I never thought that any violence should have taken place . But on the other hand , I understood Sean 's anger and believe me , I have wanted to hit him many times . I never would you know , because I realize that it would just make things worse . [ ... ] I felt like he was ' Causing a Commotion ' to purposefully distract me . I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it . " The last song developed was " Can 't Stop " , a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas . In addition to this , the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records , namely Club Nouveau , Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson . Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US , these groups needed a platform to project their songs , and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner . Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends . Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album , Who 's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album , with only her face and name appearing on the cover art . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The title track is composed in Madonna 's typical style — mixing a drum machine , bubbling bass synth line , and the sound of stringed instruments . According to Rikky Rooksby , author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , the three parts of the song , namely the bridge , where Madonna sings " what can help me now " , the chorus and the verse flow together in a coherent manner , with the chorus incorporating a haunting effect . The song epitomized Madonna 's interest with Hispanic culture that continued after the release of her 1987 single " La Isla Bonita " . Leonard and Madonna had added Spanish phrases in the chorus , over the trumpets of the second verse , and also in the added instrumental break in the middle . " Who 's That Girl " also makes use of the sonic effect brought about by the combination of multiple vocal lines , which had been previously used by groups like The Beach Boys in their singles " God Only Knows " ( 1966 ) and " I Get Around " ( 1964 ) as well as R.E.M. ' s singles " Fall on Me " ( 1986 ) and " Near Wild Heaven " ( 1991 ) . " Who 's That Girl " employs this effect on the last chorus where three or four different vocal hooks are intertwined . 
 The second track " Causing a Commotion " has a danceable , up @-@ tempo groove . The musical arrangement consists of a number of hooks interpolating with each other . It begins with the chorus , where Madonna sings the line " I 've got the moves baby , You 've got the motions , If we got together we be causing a commotion . " The verses are accompanied by a four @-@ note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords . The lyrics make reference to Madonna 's 1985 single " Into the Groove " and have three parts to the vocal harmony . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Walt Disney Music Company , the song is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 192 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of B ♭ major with Madonna 's voice spanning from the high @-@ note of C3 to B5 . The song has a basic sequence of B ♭ – Fm7 – B ♭ – F9 – B ♭ 6 as its chord progression . 
 " The Look of Love " starts off with a low bass synth line and a slow backing track . It is followed by the sound of percussion and a high register note , contrasting with the bassline . The song continues in this way until the last verse , which is backed by the sound of an acoustic guitar . A two @-@ part vocal is found in the line " No where to run , no place to hide " . Rooksby felt that Madonna 's voice sounded " expressive " when she sings the line " From the look of love " and utters the word " look " over the D minor chord present underneath . The word is sung in a higher note of the musical scale , thus giving an impression of the suspension like quality of the minor ninth chord , dissociating it from the harmony of the other notes . The song is set in the time signature of common time , with a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of D minor , with Madonna 's voice spanning the notes C5 to B ♭ 3 . " The Look of Love " has a basic sequence of C – Dm – Fm – B as its chord progression . 
 " Can 't Stop " has a high pitched keyboard sound embedded in between the sound of a drum machine and clarinet . The lyrics essentially refer to the idea that " I want my man and I am going to get him whatever " . Rooksby noticed that the instrumental break in the song repeats the chorus , with a synth line added on the top . He felt that " Can 't Stop " , at 4 : 45 length , was a good example of the division of Madonna 's songs between dance music — where the length is important — and the requirement of classic pop songs , which can vary from two minutes to four minutes . J. Randy Taraborrelli , in his book Madonna : An Intimate Biography , described Faure 's song " 24 Hours " as a slow track which fails to build up momentum . Joe Brown from The Washington Post described Davidson 's " Turn it Up " as consisting of a slow background synth , that transforms into a rapidly progressing beat , with Davidson 's singing reminiscent of the Beastie Boys .

 Madonna performed " Who 's That Girl " , " Causing a Commotion , " and " The Look of Love " on her 1987 Who 's That Girl World Tour . It was her second concert tour and supported her third studio album , True Blue ( 1986 ) , as well as the soundtrack . It was Madonna 's first world tour , reaching Asia , North America and Europe . Musically and technically superior to her previous Virgin Tour , the Who 's That Girl tour incorporated multimedia components to make the show more appealing . Madonna trained herself physically with aerobics , jogging and weight @-@ lifting , to cope with the choreography and the dance routines . For the costumes , she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart , expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage , reworking scenes from " True Blue " , " Open Your Heart " , " Papa Don 't Preach " and " La Isla Bonita " . The stage was huge , with four video screens , multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle . Leonard became the music director and encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of rearranging her older songs and presenting them in a new format . Madonna named the tour ' Who 's That Girl ' , after looking up at a gigantic image of herself projected on a screen on the stage during rehearsals . 
 The show consisted of seven costume changes , with song @-@ and @-@ dance routines and theatrics with an encore consisting of the title song " Who 's That Girl " and " Holiday " . The tour also addressed social causes like AIDS , during " Papa Don 't Preach " . Who 's That Girl was critically appreciated , with reviewers commenting on the extravagant nature of the concert and complimenting Madonna for her dancing , costume changes and dynamic pacing . Who 's That Girl was a commercial success , grossing a total of US $ 25 million , with Madonna playing in front of 1 @.@ 5 million people over the course of the tour . According to Pollstar , it was the second top female concert tour of 1987 , behind Tina Turner 's Break Every Rule Tour . Two concerts from the Who 's That Girl tour were later released on the VHS , including Ciao Italia : Live from Italy . Taraborrelli commented that " Many female artists behave like a diva for a period when they reach superstar status , and the ' Who 's That Girl ? ' tour marked the beginning of Madonna 's . " The tour is also noted for giving rise to the term " new Madonna " , a stronger and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to the term Madonna wannabe . A statue of Madonna , wearing a conical bra was erected in her name , at the center of the town of Pacentro in Italy , where her ancestors used to live .

 " Who 's That Girl " was released as the lead single from the soundtrack , on June 30 , 1987 . A latin pop influenced song , it became Madonna 's sixth single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart , making her the first artist to accumulate six number @-@ one singles in the 1980s , and the first female performer to get that many number @-@ ones as a solo act . It also reached the top the charts in United Kingdom , Canada , Netherlands , Ireland and Belgium . In the music video Madonna did not portray her film character Nikki Finn , instead she continued with her Hispanic look from the " La Isla Bonita " music video . This time she appeared dressed boyishly in a wide @-@ brimmed Spanish hat and bolero jacket — a combination which would later become a fashion trend . " Who 's That Girl " was nominated for " Best Song From A Motion Picture " at the 1988 Grammy Awards and " Best Original Song " at the 1988 Golden Globe Awards . 
 The album 's second single , " Causing a Commotion " , was released on August 25 , 1987 . It was criticized by music reviewers for being a sub @-@ standard Madonna single , but enjoyed commercial success , reaching the top ten in New Zealand , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . In the United States , the single quickly climbed up the chart , ultimately peaking at number two in the week of October 24 , 1987 , the same week Michael Jackson 's " Bad " advanced to the pole position . It remained in second position for three weeks , before descending from the chart . " Causing a Commotion " reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Play chart . 
 The third song released from the album was the European single , " The Look of Love " . In the United Kingdom , " The Look of Love " was released on December 12 , 1987 , and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 15 . The next week , it reached a peak of nine on the chart , her first single to miss the top five since " Lucky Star " ( 1984 ) . The song was present for a total of seven weeks on the chart . In Germany , the song peaked on the Media Control Charts at number 34 , and was present for a total of seven weeks on the chart . In Ireland , the song reached the top ten and peaked at six . Across Europe , the song charted peaked at nine in Belgium , 23 in France , eight in Netherlands and 20 in Switzerland . On the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles of Billboard , the song reached 17 . " Turn It Up " was released as a promotional single from the album in early 1988 . Described by Joe Brown of The Washington Post as " <unk> banal " and its singer as " one of Madonna 's photogenic <unk> " , the song was a success on the Dance Club charts of Billboard , peaking at number 15 .

 The soundtrack album was not well received by music critics , some of whom went on comment that the title track is the record 's highlight . Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review , though Noah Robischon from the same magazine complimented the title track , saying that Madonna had " pushed synergy over the borderline . " Bill Lamb from About.com said that the songs were not among Madonna 's best music . Taraborrelli commented that " the soundtrack was once again the reminder of Madonna 's power and status as one of the most important singers of the 80s , because it was only her songs which gained prominence , albeit not being her best , though ' The Look of Love ' is an exotic ballad . " Author Mary Cross , in her biography Madonna : A Biography said that " the soundtrack slips up because of the film . " Allen Metz and Carol Benson , authors of The Madonna Companion : Two Decades of Commentary , said that " Who 's That Girl has done what it was released for , put money in Warner 's pockets , but [ adds ] nothing in Madonna 's catalogue " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted in his review for Allmusic that " In the strictest sense [ the record ] isn 't a Madonna album — it 's a soundtrack album " , adding that it features " competent but uninspiring dance @-@ pop by [ various artists ] " . David Denby from New York magazine commented that " there 's nothing absolutely wrong with the soundtrack . But it 's just that it has the misfortune of being associated with such an unfortunate movie , that the album actually does not hold up to you well . " He added that " The Look of Love " was a hidden gem in Madonna 's catalogue . Don Shewey from Rolling Stone commented that " although essentially a Madonna album , the soundtrack does not boast a truly memorable song , rather there is the inclusion of the failed Warner artist songs , like the Coati Mundi song ' El Coco Loco ' and Duncan Faure 's uncannily Beatles @-@ esque " 24 Hours " . For most buyers though this album is the new Madonna album . " 
 Robert Christgau gave the album a ( C – ) and said " From Scritti Politti and Coati Mundi you expect trickier spin , but they 're outsiders , and outsiders times soundtrack equals contract work . For her own movie , though , the decade 's purest pop icon should do better than sloppy seconds . Or neat seconds — worse still . " Ed Blank from Pittsburgh Press commented : " It feels like the sole purpose to create the soundtrack was to show it in the film . " Jay Boyar from Orlando Sentinel praised the songs on the soundtrack , claiming that " Madonna brings forth a heart @-@ breaking warmth in ' The Look of Love ' and a club stomping feel with ' Causing a Commotion ' . With the movie 's fate being sealed , luckily for her Madonna can sing . " Gyan Singh from The Miami Herald , while reviewing the film , said that the " Only solace of the movie is the soundtrack , the songs — especially those by Madonna — are actually good . " Don McLeese from Chicago Sun @-@ Times , while reviewing Madonna 's Who 's That Girl World Tour , said that " the soundtrack 's songs sound good live " . Larry Geller from The Advocate gave a positive review , saying that " Who 's That Girl will be the soundtrack album of the summer . " Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave an equally positive review , saying that the " soundtrack album is full of engaging pop fluff . One of the hottest singles of the year , Madonna 's bilingual title song has the buoyant bounce of an acrobat doing somersaults on a trampoline . ' The Look of Love ' is as memorable a ballad as [ Madonna 's 1986 single ] ' Live to Tell ' , and ' 24 Hours ' , sung by Duncan Faure , skillfully fuses Beatles @-@ styled vocals with 80 's synthesizer @-@ pop underpinnings . " Daniel Brogan from Chicago Tribune said that " since this soundtrack isn 't really a Madonna album , this is no surprise that it appears as incomplete . "

 The music video for " Blow " was directed by Chris Marrs Piliero . The video was released on February 25 , 2011 . Kesha wanted the video to be " different , a video that was cool and random " . The director , Piliero , came up with the idea for the video 's mythological aspect saying , " I had this idea running in my head with just the idea of unicorns , If I massacred unicorns , they could bleed rainbows . I 'm a fan of violence and I 'm always trying to find a way to make it OK . " While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha , explaining her point of view on the video , " Before we started filming , we had quite a few talks . She was adamant you can 't back away from the crazy ; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it , On set , she was having fun . She was like , ' I want to lick a unicorn . ' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn 't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached ; no ego . It felt like we had worked together before . " 
 Opening with the disclaimer " No mythological creatures were harmed in the making of this video " , Kesha appears sitting next to two unicorns pouring champagne while having a conversation on how she was elected to the parliament of Uzbekistan , " So I grabbed the bear by the throat and I looked him right in the eyes , and I said , ' Bear , you have till the count of zero to put some pants on and apologize to the president . ' " The music begins and Kesha makes eyes at James Van Der Beek . After the eye contact Kesha grabs one of the unicorns and kisses him then removes her bra and throws it across the room , Van Der Beek then does the same with his bra , puzzling Kesha as to why he was wearing a bra . The music fades in the background as the two then make their way to the center of the dance floor and exchange words ( " Well , well , well . If it isn ’ t James Van Der Douche . " , " I don 't appreciate you slander @-@ <unk> my name , Ke dollar sign ha . " ) before engaging in a gun fight . They begin shooting lasers at one another , killing multiple unicorns . Van Der Beek gets hit in the shoulder and falls . Kesha steps on his arm to stop him from reaching for his gun , as he begs for mercy , which Kesha denies . At the end of the video , it is revealed that Kesha killed Van Der Beek and that she has mounted his head on her wall with the plaque reading , " James Van Der Dead " , as she sits with two unicorns laughing . She then frowns at the camera and it switches to Van Der Beek one more time before the screen goes black . 
 Willa Paskin from New York Magazine opened her review of the video writing , " Maybe it ’ s exhaustion , maybe it ’ s acquiescence , maybe it 's just time , but Ke $ ha and her whole glam @-@ wasted shtick are starting to charm us . " Paskin felt that Kesha had a great " functioning sense of humor " writing that she " enjoyed her new video " . Peter Gaston from Spin , referring to Kesha , wrote that he was able to " continually find something massively entertaining about this <unk> " and wrote that the video was " provocative " . Rolling Stone 's Matthew Perpetua wrote " You know you 're in for a great video when the very first thing you see is a disclaimer reading " No mythological creatures were harmed in the making of this video .

 = Jim Kilburn = 
 James Maurice " Jim " Kilburn ( 8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993 ) was a British sports journalist who wrote for the Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976 . Well @-@ regarded for the style of his writing and his refusal to write about off @-@ field events , Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club . After a brief career in teaching , and having spent time in Finland , Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing . A serious man , he had an unusual way of writing his reports , but his editors refused to change his copy , so highly did they value his impact . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Kilburn was born in Sheffield in 1909 , and attended Holgate Grammar School in Barnsley , before completing a degree in economics at the university there . From an early age , he showed interest in cricket ; as a boy he received coaching from former Yorkshire cricketer George Hirst at Scarborough , and played for Barnsley in Yorkshire Council matches and for Bradford in the Bradford League . Bowling fast @-@ paced off spin , Kilburn was successful enough with bat and ball to win medals for Bradford and have his achievements reported in the press . He worked briefly as a teacher in a Harrogate preparatory school . While in Bradford , he met the vice @-@ consul for Finland ; as a result , he went to live in Finland for a year . 
 = = Cricket correspondent = = 
 During his time in Finland , Kilburn sent travel articles to the Barnsley Chronicle and the Yorkshire Post . The editor of the latter , Arthur Mann , was impressed by Kilburn 's work , and arranged to meet him in 1934 . Learning of his interest in cricket , and recognising his name from his success in the Bradford League , Mann gave Kilburn a trial as the newspaper 's cricket correspondent ; the position had been vacant since Alfred Pullin had retired in 1931 . An initial three @-@ month period , with a salary of £ 3 per week , resulted in a written commendation from Neville Cardus , and he was appointed permanently with responsibility for cricket and rugby . 
 Now paid £ 6 per week plus expenses , and initially writing under the by @-@ line " Our Cricket Correspondent " , Kilburn quickly established his reputation . Soon after he took the position , he was given the byline " J. M. Kilburn " ; his reports were often among the few not <unk> . He continued in the position until 1976 , when he retired . 
 = = Style and personality = = 
 As cricket correspondent for the Yorkshire Post , Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club . His obituary in Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack described his writing style : he wrote " with a fountain pen on press telegram forms at 60 or 80 words a shilling . At the close of play he immediately concluded his essay ; he hardly ever crossed anything out . His cricketing judgments were assured and rigorous , his style exact but sometimes elegant : Leyland 's bowling is a joke but it is an extremely practical joke . " The Times stated that his reports were " always precise , frequently elegant , sometimes stern and invariably fair and accurate . He never wrote an unpolished piece or an unidentifiable one , although he was only occasionally analytical . " The speed and ease with which he produced his reports , and his refusal to use a typewriter — which he described as " the devil 's own invention " — were envied by other journalists . Kilburn 's writing was printed exactly as he wrote it ; sub @-@ editors did not touch anything , even if he had made a mistake , as his employers valued his style so greatly . He refused to write about off @-@ field events which caused consternation for his editors as Yorkshire cricket was turbulent behind the scenes at the time he wrote . Nor would he write about the wider aspects of cricket , confident that his reputation made it impossible to sack him . This attitude made him popular with the players , and he became particularly close to Len Hutton and Donald Bradman . His position at the Yorkshire Post gave him freedom to write about whatever he chose , and he refused several offers to move to national newspapers . But his obituary in The Times suggested that , had he worked for a London publication , he would have been as well @-@ known and respected as Cardus , E. W. Swanton and R. C. Robertson @-@ Glasgow . 
 The press @-@ boxes of Kilburn 's time , particularly in Yorkshire , were unfriendly and serious places . According to Wisden , " [ Kilburn ] was a tall , austere man who had little truck with press @-@ box banter . " According to writer Derek Hodgson , Kilburn was shy . However , his views and methods were regarded as old @-@ fashioned in the later stages of his career . Kilburn was often compared to his contemporary from Lancashire , Neville Cardus , but his style was dissimilar . Cardus wrote in a romantic style whereas Kilburn preferred factual accuracy ; according to Wisden , Kilburn was " harder , less flashy , more punctilious " . Journalist Frank Keating writes : " Neville Cardus was acclaimed the Wordsworth of cricket writing , while across the Pennines they hailed Kilburn as the Coleridge . With good reason . " Kilburn 's writings on the Yorkshire players of the 1930s and 1940s made them well @-@ known to the public as personalities , and he wrote several pieces for the Yorkshire Post which became famous . Kilburn had a deep love of cricket , and worried it was losing its way in embracing one @-@ day matches and sponsorship , although he did not believe that progress was necessarily bad . He believed that cricketers should be chivalrous , and greatly admired stylish play . He severely criticised anything on the field which he believed fell short of acceptable standards , including the occasion in 1967 when Yorkshire won the County Championship after engaging in time @-@ wasting tactics to avoid losing a game . He retired in 1976 , but continued to follow the sport very closely .

 Kilburn twice accompanied the England team on overseas tours to Australia : in 1946 – 47 and 1954 – 55 . During the former tour , he became a founder member of the Cricket Writers ' Club . He served as its secretary , chairman and later became an Honorary Life Member . He also became the only journalist elected as a life member at Yorkshire , and opened the newly built press box at Headingley Cricket Ground in 1988 . In his final years , he became blind — his sight began to fail shortly after his retirement — but according to Wisden , " Jim Kilburn remained an upright , dignified man until he died " . Outside of his work , Kilburn played golf to a reasonable standard , and was married with three children . Derek Hodgson writes : " All his work will be valued as an accurate insight into social attitudes in the first half of this century . Jim Kilburn intended always to write about cricket but in fact he told us all so much more . " He wrote ten books on cricket , and contributed regularly to The Cricketer magazine and to Wisden . 
 = Una @-@ class submarine = 
 The Una @-@ class submarine ( also known as Type 911 ) was a class of six midget submarines built for the Yugoslav Navy at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata ( English : Special objects shipyard ) during the 1980s . They were designed with the purpose of laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces , with or without their submersibles , in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines . Due to their mission profile that called for a small design as well as the need to stay undetected , they lacked torpedo armament and a generator for battery recharging . 
 During the Croatian War of Independence and the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia , five of the six boats were relocated to Boka Kotorska where they served with the SR Yugoslav Navy . One , Soča ( P @-@ 914 ) , was captured in drydock by Croatian forces . It was later modified and entered service with the Croatian Navy as Velebit ( P @-@ 01 ) . All of the boats have since been decommissioned .

 During the 1970s the Brodarski Institute ( BI ) from Zagreb started working on a new class of submarines for the Yugoslav Navy ( JRM ) . The project , designated B @-@ 91 and led by Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk> , was tasked with developing a class of midget submarines capable of operating in the shallow waters of the northern Adriatic . Using their small dimensions , the submarines were to be able to maneuver in depths as shallow as 10 metres ( 33 ft ) ; such abilities were needed to conduct offensive minelaying near the enemy coastline , reconnaissance , and transporting naval special forces in hostile waters . 
 All six boats were completed from 1985 to 1989 at the Brodogradilište <unk> <unk> ( BSO ) in Split , SR Croatia and named after rivers in SFR Yugoslavia : Tisa ( P @-@ 911 ) , Una ( P @-@ 912 ) , Zeta ( P @-@ 913 ) , Soča ( P @-@ 914 ) , Kupa ( P @-@ 915 ) and Vardar ( P @-@ 916 ) . Further planned improvements included the addition of a Stirling engine , either by refitting the existing boats or building a new , seventh one , but the imminent breakup of Yugoslavia happened before anything was realized .

 The Una @-@ class featured a single @-@ hulled design , measuring 18 @.@ 82 m ( 61 ft 9 in ) in length with an average draught of 2 @.@ 4 m ( 7 ft 10 in ) . The boats displaced 76 @.@ 1 tonnes ( 74 @.@ 9 long tons ) when surfaced and 87 @.@ 6 tonnes ( 86 @.@ 2 long tons ) when submerged . Because deploying naval commandos was one of their main tasks , they were equipped with an underwater exit / re @-@ entry chamber . 
 Propulsion consisted of two 18 @-@ kilowatt ( 24 hp ) electric motors , mounted on a single shaft and powered by two battery groups with 128 cells each . The class lacked the ability to recharge during surface drive making them dependent on external power sources such as harbours and depot ships . Maximum achievable speed was 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 mph ) underwater and 7 knots ( 13 km / h ; 8 mph ) surfaced . Traveling at a speed of 3 knots ( 6 km / h ; 3 mph ) they had a range of 250 – 270 nautical miles ( 460 – 500 km ; 290 – 310 mi ) . Maximum diving depth was 120 m ( 390 ft ) . The sensor suite included an active / passive Krupp Atlas sonar . 
 In accordance with their expected mission , the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 6 – 12 M @-@ 66 or M @-@ 71 limpet mines . Also at their disposal were four large AIM @-@ 70 / 71 bottom mines mounted on the outside of the submarines . Four R @-@ 1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried in place of the AIM @-@ 70 / 71 mines . With a full crew of six members the boats had an underwater endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if the complement numbered ten personnel ( four crew members and six naval commandos ) .

 All six boats were in service with the 88th submarine flotilla of the JRM with Lora Naval Base being their homeport . At the start of the Croatian War of Independence all boats except Soča were relocated to Montenegro without participating in combat operations . Croatian forces captured Soča in drydock at the BSO where it was undergoing an overhaul . Soča underwent a modification program that improved its autonomy by installing a diesel generator . It was recommissioned , now with the Croatian Navy , in 1996 as Velebit ( P @-@ 01 ) and remained in service until the early 2000s when it was declared redundant . The remaining boats entered service with the new SR Yugoslav Navy . The first ones to be decommissioned sometime between 1997 and 2001 were Tisa and Una . In 2003 a decision was made that the ongoing major overhaul of Kupa would stop ; the boat was decommissioned and broken up in 2008 . It appears that the last Una @-@ class boats in service with the SR Yugoslav Navy were Zeta and Vardar , both of them being decommissioned in 2005 .

 Ownership of the decommissioned boats passed on to Montenegro after the country declared independence in 2006 , ending the state of Serbia and Montenegro and its joint armed forces . In 2009 the Ministry of Defence announced that it is willing to donate three Una @-@ class submarines to former SFR Yugoslav republics of Slovenia , Croatia and Serbia . Although the " Submariner " society from Pula was interested in accepting the donation and exhibiting it in a museum , the Croatian MoD responded with a statement that accepting the donation is against national interests ; since most of the fleet of the former Yugoslav Navy was relocated to Montenegro at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence , Croatia claims the military equipment of the former joint armed forces was stolen , and should be a subject of succession . The MoD further explains that the state interest is in compensation for that equipment , not returning " obsolete , damaged and corroded equipment which nowadays Serbia and Montenegro are unsuccessfully trying to sell " .
