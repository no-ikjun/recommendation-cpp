 The Buccaneers scored 10 points and recovered two fumbles , all in the last four minutes , to pass the Lions and maintain their two @-@ game division lead over the Chicago Bears . This was the Buccaneers ' sixth come @-@ from @-@ behind win of the season and they finished with a 4 @-@ 0 road record against division opponents . After Neil O 'Donoghue 's fourth @-@ quarter field goal , Dewey Selmon forced a Detroit fumble that was recovered by Dana Nafziger at the Lions ' 23 @-@ yard line . Doug Williams followed this with a 23 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Larry Mucker . Mucker , who earlier had been fined for missing the team bus to the stadium , beat close coverage from Walt Williams to make the catch .

 The Buccaneers routed a Giants team that came in having won 5 of their past 6 games . Giants quarterback Phil Simms was sacked 5 times for 75 yards , intercepted twice , and gave up two fumbles . One Cecil Johnson @-@ caused fumble was picked up by Dave Lewis and returned 39 yards for a touchdown . Both sides denied running up the score during either of the season 's matchups , though the Tampa players were said to have approached this game as a grudge match . The game was mostly devoid of the trash @-@ talking that had characterized the previous meeting , the Giants having little room for words . The Giants ' 3 points was the lowest score allowed by the Buccaneers , and the Buccaneers had their second @-@ highest point total with 31 . The Buccaneers used a two @-@ tight end set , providing additional blocking that helped spring Ricky Bell for 152 yards in three quarters of play . Bell spent the fourth quarter holding an ice pack " ... to keep Ricky from getting a swollen head " , joked coach McKay . The win left the Buccaneers with an NFC @-@ best 9 – 3 record .

 In a game that would have clinched the Buccaneers ' first playoff berth , coach McKay instead wound up being booed after a one @-@ point loss in which three kick attempts were blocked . A touchdown drive by Doug Williams in which he ran the ball into the end zone with 19 seconds remaining turned out to be futile , as Wally Hilgenberg 's blocked extra point left the Buccaneers one point short of tying the game . Various special teams miscues erased a good offensive day , in which Williams went 19 of 38 for 252 yards ( including 5 of 7 for 52 yards and 25 yards rushing on the final drive ) , and Ricky Bell 's 101 yards rushing put him over 1 @,@ 000 for the season . The Buccaneers ' 182 yards team rushing moved them into first place overall in the NFC . McKay had to issue a public apology after shouting an obscenity at the end zone stands , saying later that he was angry over racist statements being made from that direction . This was the first game that Pat Summerall and John Madden announced together .

 Doug Williams completed only 5 of 19 passes for 60 yards with four interceptions before being pulled in favor of Mike Rae . Bears quarterback Mike Phipps completed six passes , all to Dave Williams . The Bears scored on one of those receptions , and on a Walter Payton run . The Buccaneers ' Williams was nearly ejected from the game after throwing Bears lineman Mike <unk> to the ground by his face mask after a Gary <unk> interception . The Bears ' five interceptions were their most against the Buccaneers . The Buccaneers ' play was later described as " flat " by Bears players . Wally Chambers dismissed talk of the team 's inexperience , noting the intensity with which the team had played against the Giants two weeks prior . The last time the Buccaneers had been shut out previous to this game was the last game of their 0 – 26 losing streak in 1977 , also against the Bears .

 Still needing only one victory to clinch the division , the Buccaneers lost to the San Francisco 49ers in O.J. Simpson 's final home game . It was the second year in a row that the Buccaneers lost to a 49ers team that entered the game with a 1 – 13 record . The 49ers scored first , as Jeris White slipped while covering receiver Mike <unk> , leaving <unk> open for a 19 @-@ yard touchdown reception . The offense 's single touchdown , a 19 @-@ yard pass from Doug Williams to Jimmie Giles , was a season low , while injuries to Mike Washington and Cedric Brown left the Buccaneers ' secondary vulnerable . Mike Rae again saw duty at quarterback in the fourth quarter , with the game out of hand . Williams , who tearfully accepted blame for the loss , threw five interceptions that left McKay considering either benching him or avoiding pass plays . McKay also criticized the offensive line 's blocking , saying that he " saw ( Ricky ) Bell make some long runs , maybe two or three inches " . Under pressure of needing to win one game , the Buccaneers ' tension ( " state of shock " , according to McKay ) was noticeable to 49ers players . The loss dropped the Buccaneers into a 1st @-@ place tie with the surging Chicago Bears in the NFC Central .

 The Rain Bowl 
 Playing in a torrential downpour , the Buccaneers scored the first shutout in franchise history to clinch their first playoff berth and the NFC Central title . The Chiefs were held to a franchise @-@ low 80 yards of total offense . Despite the rain , Ricky Bell claimed that the field had better traction than the dry field they had played on the week previously in San Francisco . Bell carried the ball 39 times for 137 yards in such bad weather that the game had to be played under lights . The Buccaneers lost four previous scoring opportunities to a fumble , two interceptions , and a fumbled snap on a field goal attempt . Shut out of the end zone on three tries with first @-@ and @-@ goal from the 9 @-@ yard line , the Buccaneers brought Neil O 'Donoghue in to kick what would be the winning field goal with 8 : 50 remaining . Tampa Bay would hold the ball for all but four plays for the rest of the game . The Chiefs players gave the Buccaneers little credit after the victory , saying that the AFC was superior to the NFC and that the Buccaneers would never have won the AFC West .

 The Buccaneers won their first playoff game in team history by holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards , while running back Ricky Bell recorded 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns . Bell 's 38 rushing attempts set a playoff record , tied later by John Riggins in Super Bowl XVII , while the Eagles ' Wilbert Montgomery was held to 35 yards on 12 attempts . The Buccaneers ' opening drive resulted in a Bell touchdown , and a Neil O 'Donoghue field goal gave the Buccaneers an early 10 – 0 lead . Wally Chambers forced a Montgomery fumble that was recovered by Randy Crowder on the 4 @-@ yard line and led to Bell 's second touchdown run , giving the Buccaneers a 17 – 0 second @-@ quarter lead . Trying to extend that lead before halftime , Doug Williams hurried a pass that wound up in the hands of Eagles linebacker Jerry Robinson at the Tampa Bay 11 @-@ yard line . This set up Ron Jaworski 's touchdown pass to Charles Smith . After the Eagles narrowed the gap to 17 – 10 on a Tony Franklin field goal , a series of Lee Roy Selmon sacks of Jaworski killed the Eagles ' rally . A 9 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles completed the Buccaneers ' scoring . It was only in the final minutes of the game that the Eagles were able to put together a long drive , ending in a touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael . The Buccaneers held the ball for over 36 minutes of the game . The Buccaneers ' defensive strategy revolved around stopping Carmichael and Montgomery . At one point , when Leroy Harris was gang @-@ tackled following a short reception , the entire Buccaneer defense was penalized for unnecessary roughing . The Buccaneers ' hard @-@ hitting play intimidated the Eagles ' receivers into dropping 10 passes . Going into the matchup , the Eagles were expected to have edges in playoff and quarterback experience . Jaworski was the third @-@ rated quarterback in the NFC , while Williams had the lowest rating of all NFC starting quarterbacks . The game represented a rematch of old coaching rivals , McKay of USC and Dick Vermeil of UCLA . The game was the Buccaneers ' first on national television .

 Referee : Pat Haggerty 
 The Los Angeles Rams , who had been hobbled by injuries much of the season , entered the playoffs with the worst record ( 9 – 7 ) of the six division winners . Rams defensive end Jack Youngblood played the game with a hairline fracture of his left leg , and Vince Ferragamo continued to start in place of the injured Pat Haden . On the other side of the ball , the Buccaneers lost Lee Roy Selmon and Cecil Johnson with ankle injuries , Doug Williams with a torn bicep , and Wally Chambers with a knee injury . Mike Washington and Dave Lewis also missed part of the game with injuries . The game was the Rams ' second consecutive playoff win against a team that had beaten them decisively during the regular season . Each team had a touchdown called back due to a penalty . The Rams also had a touchdown called back when it was ruled that receiver Preston <unk> did not maintain possession of the ball . The Rams offensive line was intact , unlike in the regular @-@ season matchup . This provided for 216 yards rushing and gave Ferragamo much time to complete passes . Another change from the earlier game was that Wendell Tyler had become the starting halfback for the Rams . With Tyler 's speed enabling the Rams to run outside , the Buccaneers were no longer able to clog the inside lanes with defenders and put the linebackers into coverage on passing downs . The Buc defense 's focus on Tyler freed Cullen Bryant to run for 106 yards on 18 carries . Meanwhile , Buc quarterbacks Williams and Mike Rae were 4 – 26 on pass attempts . It took until the third quarter for the Buccaneers to even pass midfield , on a halfback option pass from Jerry Eckwood to Larry Mucker .

 " Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink " is the seventh episode of the fifth season of the American comedy @-@ drama detective television series Monk , and the show 's 68th episode overall . The series follows Adrian Monk ( Tony Shalhoub ) , a private detective with obsessive – compulsive disorder and multiple phobias , and his assistant Natalie Teeger ( Traylor Howard ) . In this episode , Dr. Charles Kroger ( Stanley Kamel ) , Monk 's psychiatrist , retires after blaming himself for the murder of his cleaning lady and Monk has to prove the culprit was not one of Kroger 's patients . 
 Written by Hy Conrad and directed by Andrei <unk> , " Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink " was created following a long @-@ time desire of the staff to center an episode on Kamel and make a vacuum bag pivotal in a mystery . When the episode first aired in the United States on USA Network on August 18 , 2006 , it was watched by 5 @.@ 2 million viewers . The episode was generally well received by critics , with most of the praise regarding Kamel 's major role . It also led Shalhoub to be nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Dr. Charles Kroger ( Stanley Kamel ) arrives at his office and finds Adrian Monk ( Tony Shalhoub ) and Harold Krenshaw ( Tim Bagley ) arguing over who should get the following session . They enter the office and find Teresa Mueller ( Lisa Dempsey ) , the building 's cleaning lady , dead , and some of the patient files scattered . Captain Stottlemeyer ( Ted Levine ) and Lieutenant Disher ( Jason Gray @-@ Stanford ) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger 's patients was responsible . Dr. Kroger says it can be Joseph Wheeler ( Kevin Fry ) , who threatened him in the past . Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder , and decides to retire . Wheeler , however , is dismissed as a suspect as he has a confirmed alibi . 
 When Monk returns with Natalie ( Traylor Howard ) to Dr. Kroger 's office , they meet Francis Merrigan ( Gordon Clapp ) , who owns an importing and exporting business based in the same building . Merrigan is carrying a milk carton , which he says he is utilizing for a <unk> . That night , someone throws a rock through the window of Dr. Kroger 's house . Stottlemeyer and Disher keep the suspicion on one of Dr. Kroger 's patients . As they interview the Kroger family , they learn Kroger suspects his rebellious son Troy ( Cody <unk> ) did it . Monk , however , believes that whoever killed Teresa might have thrown the rock to make everyone believe that one of Dr. Kroger 's patients is involved . Monk recognizes the rock , though he does not know where he saw it . 
 Dr. Kroger tells Monk he has found a therapist , Dr. Jonah Sorenson ( Rick Curry ) ; in session , he remembers where the rock came from . Monk goes to Dr. Kroger 's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard , to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to . In Merrigan 's office , they find powdered milk but not a <unk> and , as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin , Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs , and he probably also killed Teresa . Suddenly , Merrigan appears , ties them to chairs , and loads them into the back of his truck . 
 Inside the truck Monk sees a broken Turkish figurines and remembers the vacuum bag was empty . He deduces that Teresa , while cleaning Merrigan 's office , broke a figurine , which contained heroin . When Merrigan saw the broken figurine he realized that the vacuum bag was filled with heroin . When he found the drug on the vacuum bag , he killed Teresa . He spread the patient files and later he threw a rock at Dr. Kroger 's house to make it look like the killer was one of Dr. Kroger 's patients . 
 Unbeknownst to them , Harold is following Merrigan 's truck and calls the police . At a warehouse , Harold grabs a gun from a shelf and Dr. Kroger gestures for Harold to shoot Merrigan and his accomplice , who are emptying the vacuum bag to destroy the evidence . However , Harold makes some noise . As Merrigan prepares to shoot Harold , the police arrive to arrest Merrigan , but just then , he shoots at Dr. Kroger . Harold intercepts the bullet in his chest and Merrigan is taken away .

 " Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink " was written by Hy Conrad and directed by Andrei <unk> . The idea of hiding the crucial piece of evidence in a vacuum bag had been on the writing table for years at the time that this episode was written . The writers ' problem was that they could not get a realistic idea on how to use it . One idea had actually been to have a killer hack up his victim , place the dismembered limbs into a self @-@ cleaning oven , then vacuum out the remains and have the bag filled with the victim . The writers saw this possibility as too gruesome for the show . Other ideas had included hiding something valuable in the bag and having the killer stalk Monk while trying to recover it . 
 After some time , they decided that the best method of featuring a vacuum bag was to have a cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence . Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes , here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot . However , the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement . Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady , and if he did , she would never be good enough for him because of his <unk> and meticulousness . It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger 's employee . The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful , because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus . 
 This led to further complications in the writing process . For a few days , it was thought that Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case , but upon realizing that Monk would not be able to go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger , they eliminated this idea . So instead , Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does , but he stays out of the investigation scenes . As a result , Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan 's office to snoop around , though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there . Rather , they simply peer through the sliding glass door that opens from Merrigan 's office into the courtyard . 
 Another major challenge that came up in production was who Monk 's new psychiatrist would be . Several ideas included a woman , someone too strict or too nice , someone driven crazy by Monk 's compulsions , and even someone who would give Monk scream therapy . The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier , who suggested a one @-@ armed psychiatrist . Shalhoub liked the idea , but required that they recruit an actual one @-@ armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson . The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition , and the part was given to Rick Curry .

 " Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink " was first broadcast in the United States on the USA Network at 9 pm EST on August 18 , 2006 . According to Nielsen Media Research , the episode was viewed by an estimated number of 5 @.@ 21 million viewers . It was the sixth most watched program on cable television that week with a 3 @.@ 4 percent household rating and a household audience of 3 @.@ 7 million . 
 The episode was well @-@ received ; Kamel elected it one of his three favorite episodes of the series , Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk dubbed it a " strong episode " , while Adam Finley from AOL TV said it was " great " . IGN 's Colin Moriarty said one can " have a hardy laugh at the high level of dysfunctionality " with the episode while highlighted the one @-@ armed therapist and mainly the interactions between Monk and Harold as the responsible for its humor . On his blog Cultural <unk> , critic Myles McNutt affirmed Shalhoub did a " tour de force comic performance " and that " It features most of Monk 's best qualities : his feud with fellow patient Harold , his insecurity about his mental health , his reaction to a new therapist with only one arm , and his broad comedy . " Although disliked the scene in which Harold <unk> a shoot as it was made in a cliched way , Finley enjoyed seem Dr. Kroger getting more attention . Similarly , Raven Snook , a TV Guide contributor , appreciated the fact that the doctor 's home life was explored in the episode . Jon Weisman , writing for Variety , selected the scene in which Monk manifests the five stages of grief the best scene of the episode . The scene was also highlighted by Robert <unk> of the Los Angeles Times , who nevertheless said the episode felt " a bit ' same old same old . ' " Chris <unk> , writing for the same newspaper , stated it was " the weakest episode " of the series to ever being submitted for the Primetime Emmy Awards , and , unlike other reviewers , considered the grief scene " just too forced and ' showy . ' " 
 Shalhoub was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for this episode . However , he lost at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards to Ricky Gervais for the Extras episode " Sir Ian McKellen " . 
 = Ipswich Road , Colchester = 
 Ipswich Road , formally the <unk> , is a road in Colchester , Essex , England . It was the historic coaching route and main road to Ipswich from the Middle Ages onwards , and was part of the A12 , a main road in East Anglia , until the A12 was rerouted in 1974 . 
 Rovers Tye Farm , a pub since 1983 , was established by 1353 , and a causeway at this location had been built by 1429 , by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route . The road once contained the County Gaol and County Police Station . The Grade II listed St. John 's Church was built in 1864 by Arthur Blomfield in the High Victorian Early Gothic style . The toothpaste tube manufacturer Betts opened a factory at No. 505 Ipswich Road in 1953 . More recently there have been the development of housing and industrial estates along the road , particularly automobile dealers , at the northern end where it meets the A12 . 
 = = Route = = 
 The road runs northeast from East Street , crossing the Great Eastern Main Line , to Ardleigh Wick where it meets the A12 , a major road from London to Ipswich and the Port of Felixstowe and the <unk> to Harwich ( and hence by ferry to Hook of Holland ) . 
 The majority of the road is within the Borough of Colchester aside from a small portion at the northern end , which is in the Borough of <unk> . The main bus routes from Colchester to Ipswich , 93 and 94 , run along the road . It also serves a portion of the Colchester half marathon route . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre 20th century = = = 
 Colchester has been inhabited since pre @-@ Roman Britain , but the ancient route to Ipswich followed a different path , leaving Duncan 's Gate and heading east of Castle Park and crossing the River Colne , thereby heading northeast to meet the current road . An excavation in 1930 found evidence of road ditches on this alignment . In 991 Byrhtnoth , Ealdorman of the East @-@ Saxons , decided to check the Danes . They had plundered Ipswich and were sailing south to plunder Maldon . <unk> entered the well @-@ defended town of Colchester by the Ipswich road on his way south , later dying at the Battle of Maldon . The London – Ipswich road passing through Colchester provided a vital economic connection to the capital , 51 miles ( 82 km ) away , during the Tudor period . The royalist defenders of Colchester during the English Civil War ( 1642 – 51 ) built Fort Suffolk to the north of Ipswich Road , one of eleven earthern <unk> with timber palisades . 
 At the edge of the <unk> Parish boundary is Rovers Tye Farm , which has been documented as being established by 1353 . A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429 , by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route . This road was turnpiked in 1725 , when the road was predominantly rural in nature . In 1841 , a prison , known as the House of Correction or County Gaol , was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle , but it only held about 25 or 30 prisoners , both male and female , at any one time . When the War Office re @-@ authorized the militia in 1845 the 14th East Essex Regiment of Militia , which later became the Essex Rifles Militia , was given the old County Gaol as its headquarters . In 1875 the County Police Station was located on the Ipswich Road . 
 = = = 20th – 21st century = = = 
 The road was bisected by the first Colchester Bypass in 1933 , an unemployment relief project . The railway bridge was also built in the Great Depression of the 1930s , using government funding . 7 @-@ ton locomotives were used to bring sand via a light railway from a pit on the Harwich Road to form the embankment for the railway bridge . The sand was topped with clay . The bridge crossing the Great Eastern Main Line underwent major reconstruction in 1957 . 
 On 12 November 1940 Colchester was bombed by German air raids , causing damage in the vicinity of Ipswich Road . In the early hours of 30 April 1944 , a crew of seven on board a Lancaster UM @-@ K2 were returning from a bombing raid on Karlsruhe , Germany , when the engines caught fire , causing a fatal crash landing at what is now Space Makers <unk> on Ipswich Road . In 2015 , a memorial service was held at the site of the crash . In December 2014 , 24 World War II bombs weighing approximately 600 lbs in total were discovered at a recycling centre on the road . After the war , there were small private developments off Mersea Road , " west of <unk> Park , north of Colchester North railway station , between Ipswich Road and the railway , and north of East Hill " . St. John 's housing estate was built in the 1960s , and in 1979 , the Kier Group began developing the 730 acre High Woods site to the west of the road . Around 4000 houses and a shopping centre were subsequently built in the vicinity . 
 The toothpaste tube manufacturer Betts opened a factory at No. 505 Ipswich road in 1953 . In 2008 , the firm decided to close the factory and moved to smaller premises elsewhere in town . In 2014 , <unk> Homes announced they would convert the former Ipswich Road factory into a housing estate named <unk> Place . Locals protested against the name , which is Spanish for hazelnut , saying a more appropriate name would be after the 1944 Lancaster Bomber crash . 
 The road was part of the A12 when road numbers were first classified in 1922 , and remained the main route to Ipswich for motor traffic until the Northern Colchester Bypass opened in 1974 , which was extended towards Harwich in 1982 .

 The Rose And Crown is at the southern end of Ipswich Road . It was established as a coaching inn in the 14th century and used as a stopping point for prisoners being transported from Europe and Suffolk to London . The building still contains two cells , retaining their original doors . The venue 's fireplace dates from the Tudor period . To the north is Colchester 's Magic Roundabout . 
 Beyond the railway bridge is the St Johns Post Office and Milton Lodge at No. 290 Ipswich Road , almost opposite it . Milton Lodge is a residential care home for elderly dementia sufferers and was converted into a care home in 2001 . Further north , at the roundabout with <unk> Approach and St. John 's Road , is The Rovers Tye – Flaming Grill restaurant . The Rovers Tye is set in a Grade II listed farmhouse dated to the 17th century , with additional extensions in the mid @-@ 18th , although an earlier building dated to 1353 . In 1983 , the building became a pub . Timber framed , it is a two storey building with five windows and a panelled door . Just to the north is St. John 's Primary School , and St. John 's Church beyond this . The church was built in 1864 by Arthur Blomfield in the High Victorian Early Gothic style . It is built from " red and gault brick with stone dressings and peg tile gabled roofs " and features a " circular bell turret with conical roof " . It became a Grade II listed building in 1986 . 
 The northern part of the road is characterised by industrial estates . There is retail centre selling cars , including Porsche Centre Colchester and Underwoods Mazda and <unk> Colchester . Colchester Business Park is at the northern end of the road , next to the A12 and <unk> . It contains 250 @,@ 000 square feet ( 23 @,@ 000 m2 ) of office space .

 The breakthrough role in Dunst 's career came in 1994 in the romantic horror film Interview with the Vampire with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt , based on Anne Rice 's novel , in which she played Claudia , the child vampire who is a surrogate daughter to Cruise and Pitt 's characters . The film received ambivalent reviews , but many film critics complimented Dunst 's performance . Roger Ebert commented that Dunst 's creation of the child vampire Claudia was one of the " creepier " aspects of the film , and mentioned her ability to convey the impression of great age inside apparent youth . Todd McCarthy in Variety noted that Dunst was " just right " for the family . The film featured a scene in which Dunst shared her first on @-@ screen kiss with Pitt , who was nineteen years older than her .

Critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was the greatest adaptation of the novel and remarked on Dunst 's performance , " The perfect contrast to take @-@ charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst 's scene @-@ stealing Amy , whose vanity and twinkling mischief make so much more sense coming from an 11 @-@ year @-@ old vixen than they did from grown @-@ up Joan Bennett in 1933 . Ms. Dunst , also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of Interview With the Vampire , is a little vamp with a big future . " 
 In 1995 , Dunst co @-@ starred in the fantasy adventure film Jumanji , loosely based on Chris Van <unk> 's 1981 book of the same name .

The film generated mostly positive reviews , with many critics reserving praise for her performance . In his review , A. O. Scott called her " a terrific comic actress , largely because of her great expressive range , and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt . " Charles Taylor of Salon noted that " among contemporary teenage actresses , Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist " , even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in Dick or in The Virgin Suicides . Jessica Winter from The Village Voice complimented Dunst , stating that her performance was " as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in Dick " and commenting that " [ Dunst ] provides the only major element of Bring It On that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick , strident , body @-@ slam <unk> .

"

Derek Elley of Variety described the film as " playful and sporty , " saying that this was Dunst 's best performance to date : " <unk> as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men , Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy .

 = Iron Maiden = 
 Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton , East London , in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris . The band 's discography has grown to thirty @-@ eight albums , including sixteen studio albums , eleven live albums , four EPs , and seven compilations . 
 Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal , Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s . After several line @-@ up changes , the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums , including 1982 's The Number of the Beast , 1983 's Piece of Mind , 1984 's Powerslave , 1985 's live release Live After Death , 1986 's Somewhere in Time and 1988 's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son . Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999 , the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity , with their 2010 studio offering , The Final Frontier , peaking at No. 1 in 28 countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim . Their sixteenth studio album , The Book of Souls , was released on 4 September 2015 . 
 Despite little radio or television support , Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history , with The Observer reporting in 2015 that the band have sold over 90 million copies of their albums worldwide . The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002 . As of October 2013 , the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career . For the past 35 years , the band have been supported by their famous mascot , " Eddie " , who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers , as well as in their live shows . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years ( 1975 – 78 ) = = = 
 Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day 1975 by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group , Smiler . Harris attributes the band 's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas , the title of which reminded him of the iron maiden torture device . After months of rehearsal , Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976 , before taking up a semi @-@ residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland Point , Stratford . 
 The original line @-@ up did not last very long , however , with vocalist Paul Day being the first casualty as , according to Harris , he lacked " energy or charisma on stage " . He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock , a Kiss fan who used make @-@ up and fake blood during live performances . Wilcock 's friend Dave Murray was invited to join , to the dismay of the band 's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance . Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976 , though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist . Steve Harris and Dave Murray remain the band 's longest @-@ standing members and have performed on all of their releases . 
 Iron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977 , Bob Sawyer , who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth . Tension ensued again , causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock , who convinced Harris to fire Murray , as well as original drummer Ron Matthews . A new line @-@ up was put together , including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards , Terry <unk> on guitar , and drummer Barry Purkis . A bad performance at the Bridgehouse , a pub located in Canning Town , in November 1977 was the line @-@ up 's first and only concert and led to Purkis being replaced by Doug Sampson . At the same time , Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band 's sound . A few months later , Dennis Wilcock decided that he had had enough with the group and left to form his own band , V1 , and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated . As he preferred to be the band 's sole guitarist , <unk> disapproved of Murray 's return and was also dismissed . 
 Steve Harris , Dave Murray and Doug Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band 's new line @-@ up . A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di 'Anno . Steve Harris has stated , " There 's sort of a quality in Paul 's voice , a raspiness in his voice , or whatever you want to call it , that just gave it this great edge . " At this time , Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist , with Harris commenting , " Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own . The plan was always to get a second guitarist in , but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult . " 
 = = = Record contract and early releases ( 1978 – 81 ) = = = 
 On New Year 's Eve 1978 , Iron Maiden recorded a demo , consisting of four songs , at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge . Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs , the band presented a copy to Neal Kay , then managing a heavy metal club called " Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse " , located in Kingsbury Circle , northwest London . Upon hearing the tape , Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon , and one of the songs , " Prowler " , eventually went to No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts , which were published weekly in Sounds magazine . A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood , who soon became the band 's manager , and , as Iron Maiden 's popularity increased , they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes , named after the club . Featuring only three tracks ( one song , " Strange World " , was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production ) all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks . 
 In December 1979 , the band secured a major record deal with EMI and asked Dave Murray 's childhood friend Adrian Smith to join the group as their second guitarist . Smith declined as he was busy with his own band , Urchin , so Iron Maiden hired guitarist Dennis Stratton instead . Shortly afterwards , Doug Sampson left due to health issues and was replaced by ex @-@ Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton 's suggestion on 26 December . Iron Maiden 's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation ( released on 15 February 1980 ) with two early versions of " Sanctuary " and " Wrathchild " . The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal . 
 Iron Maiden 's eponymous 1980 release , Iron Maiden , debuted at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart . In addition to the title track ( a live version of which would be one of the first music videos aired on MTV ) , the album includes other early favourites such as " Running Free " , " Transylvania " , " Phantom of the Opera " , and " Sanctuary " – which was not on the original UK release but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters . The band set out on a headline tour of the UK , before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour 's European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates . After the Kiss tour , Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences , and was replaced by Adrian Smith in October 1980 . 
 In 1981 , Iron Maiden released their second album , entitled Killers . Containing many tracks that had been written prior to their debut release , only two new songs were written for the record : " Prodigal Son " and " Murders in the Rue Morgue " ( the latter 's title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe ) . Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album , the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch , who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992 . The record was followed by the band 's first world tour , which included their debut performance in the United States , opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino , Las Vegas . 
 = = = Success ( 1981 – 85 ) = = = 
 By 1981 , Paul Di 'Anno was demonstrating increasingly self @-@ destructive behaviour , particularly through his drug usage , about which Di 'Anno comments , " it wasn 't just that I was snorting a bit of coke , though ; I was just going for it non @-@ stop , 24 hours a day , every day ... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months , years , and I just couldn 't see my way to the end of it . I knew I 'd never last the whole tour . It was too much . " With his performances suffering , Di 'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour , at which point the band had already selected his replacement . 
 After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival , Bruce Dickinson , previously of Samson , auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired . The following month , Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy , as well as a one @-@ off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK . For the last show , and in anticipation of their forthcoming album , the band played " Children of the Damned " and " 22 Acacia Avenue " , introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing . 
 In 1982 , Iron Maiden released The Number of the Beast , an album which gave the band their first ever UK Albums Chart No. 1 record and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries . At the time , Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson 's management and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits , although he still made what he described as a " moral contribution " to " Children of the Damned " , " The Prisoner " and " Run to the Hills " . For the second time the band embarked on a world tour , dubbed The Beast on the Road , during which they visited North America , Japan , Australia and Europe , including a headline appearance at the Reading Festival . A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden 's future was cemented ; in 2010 The New York Times reported that the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide . 
 The Beast on the Road 's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed Iron Maiden were Satanic because of the new album 's title track , to the point where a group of Christian activists destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band . In recent years , Dickinson has stated that the band treated this as " silliness " , and that the demonstrations in fact gave them " loads of publicity " . 
 In December 1982 , drummer Clive Burr was fired from the band and replaced by Nicko McBrain , previously of French band Trust . Although Harris states that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities , Burr objected to this and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band . Soon afterwards , the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at Compass Point Studios . In 1983 , they released Piece of Mind , which reached the No. 3 spot in the UK , and was the band 's debut in the North American charts , reaching No. 70 on the Billboard 200 . Piece of Mind includes the successful singles " The Trooper " and " Flight of Icarus " , the latter of which being particularly notable as one of the band 's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US . 
 Soon after the success of Piece of Mind and its supporting tour , the band released Powerslave on 9 September 1984 . The album featured fan favourites " 2 Minutes to Midnight " , " Aces High " , and " Rime of The Ancient Mariner " , the latter based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's poem of the same name and running over 13 minutes long . 
 The tour following the album , dubbed the World Slavery Tour , was the band 's largest to date and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months , playing to an estimated 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 people . Many shows were played back @-@ to @-@ back in the same city , such as in Long Beach , California , where the band played four consecutive concerts . It was here where the majority of their subsequent live release , Live After Death , was recorded , which became a critical and commercial success , peaking at No. 4 in the UK . Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America , where they co @-@ headlined ( with Queen ) the Rock in Rio festival to an estimated crowd of 300 @,@ 000 . The tour was physically gruelling for the band , who demanded six months off when it ended ( although this was later reduced to four months ) . This was the first substantial break in the group 's history , including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album , with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended . 
 = = = Experimentation ( 1986 – 89 ) = = = 
 Returning from their time off , the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album , entitled Somewhere in Time , featuring , for the first time in the band 's history , synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound . The release charted well across the world , particularly with the single " Wasted Years " , but notably included no writing credits from lead singer Bruce Dickinson , whose material was rejected by the rest of the band . While Dickinson was focused on his own music , guitarist Adrian Smith , who typically collaborated with the vocalist , was " left to [ his ] own devices " and began writing songs on his own , coming up with " Wasted Years " , " Sea of Madness " , and " Stranger in a Strange Land " , the last of which would be the album 's second single . 
 The experimentation evident on Somewhere in Time continued on their next album , entitled Seventh Son of a Seventh Son , which was released in 1988 . A concept album , based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card , this would be the band 's first record to include keyboards , performed by Harris and Smith , as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release . After his contributions were not used for Somewhere in Time , Dickinson 's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album . Another popular release , it became Iron Maiden 's second album to hit No. 1 in the UK charts , although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US , in contrast to its four predecessors . 
 During the following tour , the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park for the first time on 20 August 1988 , playing to the largest crowd in the festival 's history ( 107 @,@ 000 ) . Also included on the bill were Kiss , David Lee Roth , Megadeth , Guns N ' Roses and Helloween . The festival was marred , however , by the deaths of two fans in a crowd @-@ surge during the aforementioned Guns N ' Roses performance ; the following year 's festival was cancelled as a result . The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988 , with the concerts at the NEC Arena , Birmingham recorded for a live video , entitled Maiden England . Throughout the tour , Harris ' bass technician , Michael Kenney , provided live keyboards . Kenney has acted as the band 's live keyboard player ever since , also performing on the band 's four following albums before Harris took over as the group 's sole studio keyboardist from 2000 's Brave New World .

 During another break in 1989 , guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP , entitled Silver and Gold , and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers , releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990 , followed by a tour . At the same time , to mark the band 's ten @-@ year recording anniversary , Iron Maiden released The First Ten Years , a series of ten CDs and double 12 @-@ inch singles . Between 24 February and 28 April 1990 , the individual parts were released one @-@ by @-@ one , each containing two of Iron Maiden 's singles , including the original B @-@ sides . 
 Soon afterwards , Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record . During the pre @-@ production stages , Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris regarding the direction the band should be taking , disagreeing with the " stripped down " style that they were leaning towards . Janick Gers , having worked on Dickinson 's solo project , was chosen to replace Smith and became the band 's first new member in seven years . The album , No Prayer for the Dying , was released in October 1990 and contained " Bring Your Daughter ... to the Slaughter " , the band 's first ( and to date , only ) UK Singles Chart No. 1 , originally recorded by Dickinson 's solo outfit for the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 : The Dream Child . 
 After another tour and some more time off , the band recorded their next studio release , Fear of the Dark , which was released in 1992 and included the stand @-@ out title track , which is now a regular fixture in the band 's concert setlists . Achieving their third No. 1 in the UK albums chart , the disc also featured the No. 2 single " Be Quick or Be Dead " and the No. 21 single " From Here to Eternity " . The album featured the first songwriting by Gers , and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs . The extensive worldwide tour that followed included their first ever Latin American leg ( after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour ) , and headlining the Monsters of Rock festivals in seven European countries . Iron Maiden 's second performance at Donington Park , to an audience of 68 @,@ 500 ( the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988 ) , was filmed for the audio and video release , Live at Donington , and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith , who joined the band to perform " Running Free " . 
 In 1993 , Bruce Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career , but agreed to remain for a farewell tour and two live albums ( later re @-@ released in one package ) . The first , A Real Live One , featured songs from 1986 to 1992 , and was released in March 1993 . The second , A Real Dead One , featured songs from 1980 to 1984 , and was released after Dickinson had left the band . The tour did not go well , however , with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high @-@ profile shows and that at several concerts he would only mumble into the microphone . Dickinson denies the charge that he was under @-@ performing , stating that it was impossible to " make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn 't right " , saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour . He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993 , which was filmed , broadcast by the BBC and released on video under the name Raising Hell . 
 = = = Blaze Bayley era , The X Factor and Virtual XI ( 1994 – 99 ) = = = 
 In 1994 , the band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley , formerly of the band Wolfsbane who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990 , to audition for them . Harris ' preferred choice from the outset , Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor , which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans . 
 After a two @-@ year hiatus ( as well as a three @-@ year hiatus from studio releases – a record for the band at the time ) Iron Maiden returned in 1995 . Releasing The X Factor , the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK ( debuting at No. 8 ) , although it would go on to win Album of the Year awards in France and Germany . The record included the 11 @-@ minute epic " Sign of the Cross " , the band 's longest song since " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , as well as the singles , " Man on the Edge " , based on the film Falling Down , and " Lord of the Flies " , based on the novel of the same name . The release is notable for its " dark " tone , inspired by Steve Harris ' divorce . The band toured for the rest of 1995 and 1996 , playing for the first time in Israel and South Africa , before stopping to release Best of the Beast . The band 's first compilation , it included a new single , " Virus " , whose lyrics attack the critics who had recently written off the band . 
 Iron Maiden returned to the studio to record Virtual XI , released in 1998 . The album 's chart scores were the band 's lowest to date , including the UK where it peaked at No. 16 failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in Iron Maiden 's history . At the same time , Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band 's entire discography , up to and including Live at Donington ( which was given a mainstream release for the first time ) . 
 Bayley 's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting . The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour , although Janick Gers has since stated that this was partly the band 's fault for forcing him to perform songs which were beyond his natural register . 
 = = = Return of Dickinson and Smith , Brave New World ( 1999 – 2002 ) = = = 
 While the group were considering a replacement for Bayley , Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band . Although Harris admits that he " wasn 't really into it " at first , he then thought , " ' Well , if the change happens , who should we get ? ' The thing is , we know Bruce and we know what he 's capable of , and you think , ' Well , better the devil you know . ' I mean , we got on well professionally for , like , eleven years , and so ... after I thought about it , I didn 't really have a problem with it . " 
 The band entered into talks with Dickinson , who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999 , along with guitarist Adrian Smith , who was telephoned a few hours later . With Gers , Smith 's replacement , remaining , Iron Maiden now had a three @-@ guitar line @-@ up and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour . Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour , it tied in with the band 's newly released greatest hits collection , Ed Hunter , whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group 's website , and also contained a computer game of the same name starring the band 's mascot . 
 One of Dickinson 's primary concerns on rejoining the group " was whether we would in fact be making a real state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art record and not just a comeback album , " which eventually took the form of 2000 's Brave New World . Having disliked the results from Harris ' personal studio , Barnyard Studios located on his property in Essex , which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums , the band recorded the new release at Guillaume Tell Studios , Paris in November 1999 with producer Kevin Shirley . Thematic influences continued with " The Wicker Man " – based on the 1973 British cult film of the same name – and " Brave New World " – title taken from the Aldous Huxley novel of the same name . The album furthered the more progressive and melodic sound present in some earlier recordings , with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration . 
 The world tour that followed consisted of well over 100 dates and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil , where Iron Maiden played to an audience of around 250 @,@ 000 . While the performance was being produced for a CD and DVD release in March 2002 , under the name Rock in Rio , the band took a year out from touring , during which they played three consecutive shows at Brixton Academy in aid of former drummer Clive Burr , who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis . The band performed two further concerts for Burr 's MS Trust Fund charity in 2005 , and 2007 , before his death in 2013 . 
 = = = Dance of Death and A Matter of Life and Death ( 2003 – 07 ) = = = 
 Following their Give Me Ed ... ' Til I 'm Dead Tour in the summer of 2003 , Iron Maiden released Dance of Death , their thirteenth studio album , which was met by worldwide critical and commercial success . Produced by Kevin Shirley , now the band 's regular producer , many critics also felt that this release matched up to their earlier efforts , such as Killers , Piece of Mind and The Number of the Beast . As usual , historical and literary references were present , with " Montségur " in particular being about the Cathar stronghold conquered in 1244 , and " <unk> " relating to the significant battle which took place during The First World War . During the following tour , the band 's performance at <unk> , in Dortmund , Germany , was recorded and released in August 2005 as a live album and DVD , entitled Death on the Road . 
 In 2005 , the band announced the Eddie Rips Up the World Tour which , tying in with their 2004 DVD entitled The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1 : The Early Days , only featured material from their first four albums . As part of this celebration of their earlier years , " The Number of the Beast " single was re @-@ released and went straight to No. 3 in the UK Chart . The tour included many headlining stadium and festival dates , including a performance at Ullevi Stadium in Sweden to an audience of almost 60 @,@ 000 . This concert was also broadcast live on satellite television all over Europe to approximately 60 million viewers . Following this run of European shows , the band co @-@ headlined the US festival tour , Ozzfest , with Black Sabbath , their final performance at which earned international press coverage after their show was sabotaged by singer Ozzy Osbourne 's family , who took offence to Dickinson 's remarks against reality @-@ TV . The band completed the tour by headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals on the 26 – 28 August , and the RDS Stadium in Ireland on 31 August . For the second time , the band played a charity show for The Clive Burr MS Trust Fund , this time taking place at the Hammersmith Apollo . The same year , the band were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk in Sunset Boulevard , Los Angeles . 
 At the end of 2005 , Iron Maiden began work on A Matter of Life and Death , their fourteenth studio effort , released in autumn 2006 . While not a concept album , war and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics , as well as in the cover artwork . The release was a critical and commercial success , earning the band their first top ten in the Billboard 200 and receiving the Album of the Year award at the 2006 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards . A supporting tour followed , during which they played the album in its entirety ; response to this was mixed . 
 The second part of the " A Matter of Life and Death " tour , which took place in 2007 , was dubbed " A Matter of the Beast " to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Number of the Beast album , and included appearances at several major festivals worldwide . The tour opened in the Middle East with the band 's first performance in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival , after which they played to over 30 @,@ 000 people at the Bangalore Palace Grounds , marking the first concert by any major heavy metal band in the Indian sub @-@ continent . The band went on to play a string of European dates , including an appearance at Download Festival , their fourth headline performance at Donington Park , to approximately 80 @,@ 000 people . On 24 June they ended the tour with a performance at London 's Brixton Academy in aid of The Clive Burr MS Trust fund . 
 = = = Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and Flight 666 ( 2007 – 09 ) = = = 
 On 5 September 2007 , the band announced their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour , which tied in with the DVD release of their Live After Death album . The setlist for the tour consisted of successes from the 1980s , with a specific emphasis on the Powerslave era for set design . The first part of the tour , commencing in Mumbai , India on 1 February 2008 , consisted of 24 concerts in 21 cities , travelling nearly 50 @,@ 000 miles in the band 's own chartered aeroplane , named " Ed Force One " . They played their first ever concerts in Costa Rica and Colombia and their first shows in Australia and Puerto Rico since 1992 . 
 The tour led to the release of a new compilation album , entitled Somewhere Back in Time , which included a selection of tracks from their 1980 eponymous debut to 1988 's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son , as well as several live versions from Live After Death . 
 The Somewhere Back in Time World Tour continued with two further legs in the US and Europe in the summer of 2008 , during which the band used a more expansive stage @-@ set , including further elements of the original Live After Death show . With the sole UK concert taking place at Twickenham Stadium , this would be the first time the band would headline a stadium in their own country . The three 2008 legs of the tour were remarkably successful ; it was the second highest grossing tour of the year for a British artist . 
 The last part of the tour took place in February and March 2009 , with the band , once again , using " Ed Force One " . The final leg included the band 's first ever appearances in Peru and Ecuador , as well as their return to Venezuela and New Zealand after 17 years . The band also played another show in India ( their third in the country within a span of 2 years ) at the Rock in India festival to a crowd of 20 @,@ 000 . At their concert in São Paulo on 15 March , Dickinson announced on stage that it was the largest non @-@ festival show of their career , with an overall attendance of 63 @,@ 000 people . The final leg ended in Florida on 2 April after which the band took a break . Overall , the tour reportedly had an attendance of over two million people worldwide over both years . 
 At the 2009 BRIT Awards , Iron Maiden won the award for best British live act . Voted for by the public , the band reportedly won by a landslide . 
 On 20 January 2009 , the band announced that they were to release a full @-@ length documentary film in select cinemas on 21 April 2009 . Entitled Iron Maiden : Flight 666 , it was filmed during the first part of the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour between February and March 2008 . Flight 666 was co @-@ produced by Banger Productions and was distributed in cinemas by Arts Alliance Media and EMI , with D & E Entertainment sub @-@ distributing in the US . The film went on to have a Blu @-@ ray , DVD and CD release in May and June , topping the music DVD charts in 22 countries .

 Following announcements that the band had begun composition of new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing , The Final Frontier was announced on 4 March . The album , the band 's fifteenth , was released on 16 August , garnering critical acclaim and the band 's greatest commercial success in their history , reaching No. 1 in twenty @-@ eight countries worldwide . Although Steve Harris had been quoted in the past as claiming that the band would only produce fifteen studio releases , band members have since confirmed that there will be at least one further record . 
 The album 's supporting tour saw the band perform 98 shows across the globe to an estimated audience of over 2 million , including their first visits to Singapore , Indonesia and South Korea , before concluding in London on 6 August 2011 . As the tour 's 2010 leg preceded The Final Frontier 's release , the band made " El Dorado " available as a free download on 8 June , which would go on to win the award for Best Metal Performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards on 13 February 2011 . It is the band 's first win following two previous Grammy nominations ( " Fear of the Dark " in 1994 and " The Wicker Man " in 2001 ) . 
 On 15 March , a new compilation to accompany 2009 's Somewhere Back in Time was announced . Entitled From Fear to Eternity , the original release date was set at 23 May but was later pushed back to 6 June . The double disc set covers the period 1990 – 2010 ( the band 's most recent eight studio albums ) , and , as on Somewhere Back in Time , live versions with Bruce Dickinson were included in place of original recordings which featured other vocalists , in this case Blaze Bayley . 
 In a press release regarding From Fear to Eternity , band manager Rod Smallwood revealed that Iron Maiden will release a new concert video to DVD in 2011 , filmed in Santiago , Chile and Buenos Aires , Argentina during The Final Frontier World Tour . On 17 January 2012 , the band announced that the new release , entitled En Vivo ! , based on footage from the Chile concert , will be made available worldwide on CD , LP , DVD and Blu @-@ ray on 26 March , except the United States and Canada ( where it was released on 27 March ) . In addition to the concert footage , the video release includes an 88 @-@ minute tour documentary , entitled Behind The Beast , containing interviews with the band and their crew . In December 2012 , one song from the release ( " Blood Brothers " ) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock / Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards . 
 On 15 February 2012 , the band announced the Maiden England World Tour 2012 – 14 , which was based around the video of the same name . The tour commenced in North America in the summer of 2012 and was followed by further dates in 2013 and 2014 , which included the band 's record @-@ breaking fifth headline performance at Donington Park , their first show at the newly built national stadium in Stockholm , a return to the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil , and their debut appearance in Paraguay . In August 2012 , Steve Harris stated that the Maiden England video would be re @-@ issued in 2013 , with a release date later set for 25 March 2013 in DVD , CD and LP formats under the title Maiden England ' 88 .

 Following confirmation from the group that 2010 's The Final Frontier would not be their last album , Bruce Dickinson revealed plans for a sixteenth studio record in July 2013 , with a potential release date in 2015 . In February 2015 , drummer Nicko McBrain revealed that a new album had been completed , although the release has been put on hold while Dickinson recovers from treatment for a cancerous tumour found on his tongue . On 15 May , after Dickinson had been given the all @-@ clear , manager Rod Smallwood confirmed that the album would be released in 2015 , although the band will not tour until 2016 to allow Dickinson to recuperate . On 18 June 2015 , the band 's website announced its title , The Book of Souls , and confirmed a release date of 4 September 2015 . A critical and commercial success , it received positive reviews and became the band 's fifth UK No. 1 album . 
 The new record was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios , Paris , which they had previously used for 2000 's Brave New World , with regular producer Kevin Shirley in late summer 2014 . With a total time of 92 minutes , it is the group 's first double studio album . In addition , the release 's closing song , " Empire of the Clouds " , penned by Dickinson , replaces " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " ( from 1984 's Powerslave ) as Iron Maiden 's longest song , at 18 minutes in length . A music video for the song " Speed of Light " was issued on 14 August . 
 In February 2016 , the band embarked on The Book of Souls World Tour , which will see them play concerts in 35 countries in North and South America , Asia , Australasia , Africa and Europe , including their first ever performances in China , El Salvador and Lithuania . As with 2008 @-@ 09 's Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and 2010 @-@ 11 's The Final Frontier World Tour , the group will be travelling in a customised aeroplane , flown by Dickinson and nicknamed " Ed Force One " , although this time they will be using a Boeing 747 @-@ 400 jumbo jet .

 Iron Maiden were ranked No. 24 in VH1 's " 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock " , No. 4 in MTV 's " Top 10 Greatest Heavy Metal Bands of All Time " and No. 3 in VH1 Classic 's " Top 20 Metal Bands " . The band also won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002 and were inducted into the Hollywood RockWalk whilst touring in the US in 2005 . 
 Iron Maiden frequently use the slogan " Up the Irons " in their disc liner notes , and the phrase can also be seen on several T @-@ shirts officially licensed by the band . It is a paraphrase of " Up the Hammers " , the phrase which refers to the London football club , West Ham United , of which founder Steve Harris is a fan . 
 Iron Maiden 's mascot , Eddie , is a perennial fixture in the band 's science fiction and horror @-@ influenced album cover art , as well as in live shows . Originally a papier @-@ mâché mask incorporated in their backdrop which would squirt fake blood during their live shows , the name would be transferred to the character featured in the band 's debut album cover , created by Derek Riggs . Eddie was painted exclusively by Riggs until 1992 , at which point the band began using artwork from numerous other artists as well , including Melvyn Grant . Eddie is also featured in the band 's first @-@ person shooter video game , Ed Hunter , as well as their mobile role @-@ playing game , Iron Maiden : Legacy of the Beast , in addition to numerous T @-@ shirts , posters and other band @-@ related merchandise . In 2008 , he was awarded the " Icon Award " at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods , while <unk> describes him as " the most recognisable metal icon in the world and one of the most versatile too " . 
 Iron Maiden 's distinct logo has adorned all of the band 's releases since their debut , 1979 's The Soundhouse Tapes EP . The typeface originates with Vic Fair 's poster design for the 1976 science fiction film , The Man Who Fell to Earth , also used by Gordon <unk> , although Steve Harris claims that he designed it himself , utilising his abilities as an architectural draughtsman . 
 = = = Influence on other artists = = = 
 According to Guitar World , Iron Maiden 's music has " influenced generations of newer metal acts , from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold , " with Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich commenting that he has " always had an incredible amount of respect and admiration for them . " Kerry King of Slayer has stated that " they meant so much to me in their early days " and Scott Ian of Anthrax said , " they had a major impact on my life . " 
 M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold states that Iron Maiden " are by far the best live band in the world and their music is timeless " , while Trivium singer Matt Heafy comments that " without Iron Maiden , Trivium surely wouldn 't exist " . Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor says that " Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I 've ever seen anybody do . And Bruce Dickinson ? Dude ! To me , he was the quintessential old @-@ school heavy metal singer . He could hit notes that were just sick , and he was a great showman . Everything made me a fan . And there wasn 't a dude that I hung out with that wasn 't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks " , while their music also helped Jesper <unk> of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre , stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden 's melodic guitar sounds . 
 Other heavy metal artists who cite the band as an influence include Chris Jericho , lead singer of Fozzy , Cam Pipes , lead vocalist of 3 Inches of Blood , Vitaly <unk> , bassist of Aria , and Mikael Åkerfeldt , guitarist and lead vocalist of Opeth . Both current and former Dream Theater members John Petrucci , John Myung and Mike Portnoy have stated that Iron Maiden were one of their biggest influences when their band first formed .

 The band 's name has been mentioned prominently in several songs , such as the singles " Teenage Dirtbag " by Wheatus , " Back to the 80 's " by Danish dance @-@ pop band <unk> and " Fat Lip " by Sum 41 . Iron Maiden have also been referenced in Weezer 's " Heart Songs " ( from their 2008 self @-@ titled " Red " album ) , Blues Traveler 's " Psycho Joe " ( from 1997 's Straight on till Morning ) , and NOFX 's " Eddie , Bruce and Paul " ( from their 2009 album Coaster ) , which Sputnikmusic describes as " a humorous retelling of Paul <unk> 's departure " . Also , Swedish power metal band Sabaton have made references to the band in their songs " Metal Machine " , " Metal Crue " , and " Metal Ripper " , with the former mentioning various Iron Maiden songs ( namely " Fear of the Dark " and " Afraid to Shoot Strangers " ) , and the latter including lyrics from " The Number of the Beast " . 
 In 2008 , Kerrang ! released an album , entitled Maiden Heaven : A Tribute to Iron Maiden , composed of Iron Maiden cover songs played by artists such as Metallica , Machine Head , Dream Theater , Trivium , Coheed and Cambria , Avenged Sevenfold , and others who were influenced by Iron Maiden throughout their careers . In 2010 , Maiden <unk> , an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of Ayreon , Threshold and Within Temptation , released Mind the Acoustic Pieces , a re @-@ interpretation of the entire Piece of Mind album . Many other Iron Maiden cover albums exist ( each featuring various artists ) , including piano , electro , string quartet and hip @-@ hop tributes . 
 Iron Maiden songs have been featured in the soundtracks of several video games , including <unk> 2 , Grand Theft Auto : Vice City , Grand Theft Auto : Episodes From Liberty City , Grand Theft Auto IV : The Lost and Damned , Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 4 , SSX on Tour and Madden NFL 10 .

 Transformers author Bill Forster is an avowed Iron Maiden fan and made several Iron Maiden references , including song lyrics and the phrase " Up the Irons " in his books , including The Ark series and The AllSpark Almanac series . 
 = = = Claims of Satanic references = = = 
 In 1982 , the band released one of their most popular , controversial and acclaimed albums , The Number of the Beast . The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists , encouraging people to destroy copies of the release . The band 's manager , Rod Smallwood , later commented that Christians initially burnt the records , but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl 's fumes . The claims were not restricted to the US , however , with Christian organisations managing to prevent Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992 . 
 Contrary to the accusations , the band have always denied the notion that they are Satanists , with lead vocalist , Bruce Dickinson , doing so on @-@ stage in the Live After Death concert video . Steve Harris has since commented that , " It was mad . They completely got the wrong end of the stick . They obviously hadn 't read the lyrics . They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists . " Harris has also stated that " The Number of the Beast " song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching Damien : Omen II , and also influenced by Robert Burns ' Tam o ' Shanter . Furthermore , the band 's drummer , Nicko McBrain , has been a born again Christian since 1999 . 
 = = = Ed Force One = = = 
 For their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009 , Iron Maiden commissioned an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport . The aeroplane was converted into a combi configuration , which enabled it to carry the band , their crew and stage production , thereby allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically . It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery , which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers . 
 The aircraft , named " Ed Force One " after a competition on the band 's website , was flown by Dickinson , as he was also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus , and plays a major role in the award @-@ winning documentary , Iron Maiden : Flight 666 , which was released in cinemas in 42 countries in April 2009 . A different aeroplane ( registered G @-@ <unk> ) was used for The Final Frontier World Tour in 2011 with altered livery , adopting the artwork of The Final Frontier album , and features heavily in the 2012 documentary " Behind the Beast " . For the The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016 , the band upgraded to an ex @-@ Air France Boeing 747 @-@ 400 jumbo jet , supplied by Air Atlanta Icelandic ( registered TF @-@ <unk> ) and customised by Volga @-@ Dnepr Gulf , which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Steve Harris , Iron Maiden 's bassist and primary songwriter , has stated that his influences include Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , Led Zeppelin , Uriah Heep , Pink Floyd , Genesis , Yes , Jethro Tull , Thin Lizzy , UFO and Wishbone Ash . In 2010 Harris stated , " I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden 's early thing , in particular the harmony guitars , all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash 's Argus album . Thin Lizzy too , but not as much . And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well , because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull . So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed , and you 've got it . " In 2004 , Harris explained that the band 's " heaviness " was inspired by " Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in . " On top of this , Harris developed his own playing style , which guitarist Janick Gers describes as " more like a rhythm guitar , " cited as responsible for the band 's galloping style , heard in such songs as " The Trooper " and " Run to the Hills . " 
 The band 's guitarists , Dave Murray , Adrian Smith and Janick Gers , each have their own individual influences and playing style . Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which , he claims , " evolved naturally . I 'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up , and I liked that style of playing . " Stating that he " was inspired by blues rock rather than metal , " Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers , leading to him becoming a " melodic player . " Janick Gers , on the other hand , prefers a more improvised style , largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore , which he claims is in contrast to Smith 's " rhythmic " sound . 
 Singer Bruce Dickinson , who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith , has an operatic vocal style , inspired by Arthur Brown , Peter Hammill , Ian Anderson and Ian Gillan , and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time . Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit , on the Dance of Death album , Harris often relies on him while developing songs . Adrian Smith commented , " Steve loves playing with him . [ They ] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns . " 
 Throughout their career , the band 's style has remained largely unchanged , in spite of the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986 's Somewhere in Time , keyboards on 1988 's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son , and an attempt to return to the " stripped down " production of their earlier material on 1990 's No Prayer for the Dying . In recent years , however , the band have begun using more progressive elements in their songs , which Steve Harris describes as not progressive " in the modern sense , but like Dream Theater , more in a 70s way " . According to Harris , Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the band 's first album which was " more progressive " , while they would only return to this style from 1995 's The X Factor , which he states is " like an extension of Seventh Son ... , in the sense of the progressive element to it " . The development contrasts with the band 's raw sounding earlier material , which AllMusic states was " clearly drawing from elements of punk rock " , although Harris firmly denies this .

 = Battle of Gloucester ( 1775 ) = 
 The Battle of Gloucester was a skirmish fought early in the American Revolutionary War at Gloucester , Massachusetts on August 8 or 9 , 1775 . Royal Navy Captain John Linzee , commanding the sloop @-@ of @-@ war HMS Falcon , spotted two schooners that were returning from the West Indies . After capturing one schooner , Linzee chased the second one into Gloucester Harbor , where it was grounded . The townspeople called out their militia , captured British seamen sent to seize the grounded schooner , and recovered the captured ship as well . 
 The skirmish was one of a series of actions that prompted a retaliatory expedition by Royal Navy Captain Henry Mowat in October 1775 . The major event of his cruise , the Burning of Falmouth , was cited by the Second Continental Congress when it established the Continental Navy . 
 = = Background = = 
 In April 1775 , tensions between British colonists in the Province of Massachusetts Bay and the royal governor , General Thomas Gage , boiled over into war . When General Gage dispatched troops to Concord to search for military supplies the colonists had stored there , alarms were raised , and colonists and soldiers clashed in Lexington and Concord on April 19 . Militia companies continued to arrive in the days following , and the British troops were besieged in Boston . 
 The siege , which only blockaded land access to the city , made the army dependent on the ability of the navy to supply it with fresh provisions . In many communities near the city , livestock and hay were removed from islands in Boston Harbor and the immediate coastal areas , while General Gage and Vice Admiral Samuel Graves sent out expeditions to raid coastal communities for livestock and hay , and to interdict colonial shipping . When these expeditions landed troops or sailors to round up livestock , they were sometimes met with resistance . Not long after the siege began , colonists and army troops clashed on May 27 near Boston over supplies on a nearby island . 
 On August 5 , the HMS Falcon , commanded by John Linzee , appeared off Ipswich Bay . Captain Linzee sent a barge of men to the shore in search of livestock , hove to , and sent a barge containing about 50 men ashore to secure a supply of mutton from , the flock of sheep grazing on the Coffin farm at West Gloucester . Major Coffin observed their movements and anticipated their design . He hastily gathered some half dozen men , armed them with rifles and , concealed behind sand mounds , kept up such a brisk firing that the sailors in the barge , supposing that a large company were ready to receive them , thought it prudent to desist from their sheep foraging intentions and returned to the " Falcon " . When the barge returned to the Falcon , Linzee sent it to investigate a schooner in the harbor ; this ship turned out to only contain ballast . Linzee continued to cruise off Cape Ann for the next few days , and impressed some men from local ports and ships . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On August 8 or 9 ( sources disagree on the exact date ) , Captain Linzee spotted two American schooners making sail for Salem around 8 in the morning . Quickly capturing one of the schooners without incident , he put a crew aboard the prize before giving chase to the other . The captain of the second schooner , apparently familiar with the area , brought his ship deep into Gloucester Harbor and grounded it near Five Pound Island shortly after noon . Linzee forced a local fisherman to pilot the Falcon and the prize schooner to an anchorage in the harbor . He then sent 36 men on three small boats under the command of his lieutenant to take the ship . Among the crews sent were 10 impressed Americans , including four from Gloucester . The arrival of the British ship had caused the townspeople to raise the alarm , and militia companies began to muster , led by their captains , Joseph Foster and Bradbury Sanders . Armed with muskets and two aging swivel guns , they opened fire from the shore at the small boats as they neared the schooner . The British rowed faster , and boarded the grounded schooner , where they were effectively trapped by constant fire from the shore . Linzee , attempting to distract the townspeople , fired the Falcon 's guns on the town , and eventually sent a landing party to try to burn the town . However , this attempt was unsuccessful , and the party on the grounded schooner continued to be harassed by from the shore . The lieutenant was wounded in the action , and he and a few men managed to escape the action in a skiff around 4 pm , leaving the Falcon 's master in charge . The remaining men left on the grounded ship were eventually taken prisoner , including the impressed Americans . By 7 pm , the small boats had all been taken . Linzee then decided to send the prize schooner in to recover his men . Linzee reported his suspicion that the crew of the captured ship took the opportunity to overpower the prize crew , and recovered the vessel . According to Linzee , " After the master was landed I found I could not do him any good , or distress the rebels by firing , therefore I left off . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Linzee 's attempt to burn the town as a punishment for resisting his actions was echoed in later naval actions . In October 1775 , Admiral Graves ordered Captain Henry Mowat on an expedition of reprisal against New England 's coastal communities , specifically including Gloucester as a target , and citing among other justifications Captain Linzee 's defeat at Gloucester . Mowat chose not to attack Gloucester , since he felt its buildings were too widely spaced for cannonades to have any significant effect . Reports of Mowat 's only major action , the Burning of Falmouth ( present @-@ day Portland , Maine ) , were instrumental in motivating the Second Continental Congress to establish the Continental Navy .

 = Matthew , Mark , Luke and John = 
 " Matthew , Mark , Luke and John " , also known as the " Black Paternoster " , is an English language prayer and nursery rhyme traditionally said by children as they go to bed . It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 1704 . It may have origins in ancient Babylonian prayers and was being used in a Christian version in late Medieval Germany . The earliest extant version in English can be traced to the mid @-@ sixteenth century . It was mentioned by English Protestant writers as a " popish " or magical charm . It is related to other prayers , including a " Green " and " White Paternoster " , which can be traced to late Medieval England and with which it is often confused . It has been the inspiration for a number of literary works by figures including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and musical works by figures such as Gustav Holst . It has been the subject of alternative versions and satires . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 The most common modern version of the verse is as follows : 
 Matthew , Mark , Luke and John , 
 Bless the bed that I lie on . 
 Four corners to my bed , 
 Four angels round my head ; 
 One to watch and one to pray 
 And two to bear my soul away . 
 The Roud Folk Song Index , which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number , classifies the song as 1704 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The verse may be one of few English nursery rhymes to have ancient origins . The Babylonian prayer " Shamash before me , behind me Sin , Nergal at my right , <unk> at my left " , is echoed by the medieval Jewish prayer : " In the name of the Lord , the God of Israel , may Michael be at my right hand ; Gabriel at my left ; Uriel before me ; Raphael behind me and the <unk> of God be above my head " which is used as a prayer before sleep . A Christian version has been found for Germany at the end of the Medieval period . However , the first known record of the lyrics in English is from Thomas Ady 's witchcraft treatise A Candle in the Dark , or , a treatise concerning the nature of witches and witchcraft ( 1656 ) , which tells of a woman in Essex who claimed to have lived in the reign of Mary I ( r . 1553 @-@ 8 ) and who was alive in his time and blessed herself every night with the " popish charm " : 
 Matthew , Mark , Luke and John , 
 The Bed be blest that I lye on . 
 George Sinclair , writing of Scotland in his Satan 's Invisible World Discovered in 1685 , repeated Ady 's story and told of a witch who used a " Black Paternoster " , at night , which seems very similar to Ady 's rhyme : 
 Four <unk> in this house , for <unk> Angels , 
 A post in the midst , that 's Christ Jesus , 
 Lucas , Marcus , Matthew , Joannes , 
 God be into this house , and all that <unk> us . 
 A year later it was quoted again by John Aubrey , but in the form : 
 Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , 
 Bless the bed that I lye on . 
 And blessed Guardian @-@ Angel keep 
 Me safe from danger whilst I sleep . 
 A version similar to that quoted at the beginning of this article was first recorded by Sabine Baring @-@ Gould in 1891 , and it survived as a popular children 's prayer in England into the twentieth century . 
 = = " White Paternoster " = = 
 Robert Grosseteste ( c . 1175 – 1253 ) , Bishop of Lincoln , condemned the use of a " Green Paternoster " by old women in a treatise on blasphemy , which contained reference to " Green Pater Noster , Peter 's dear sister " . In Chaucer 's " Miller 's Tale " ( c . 1387 ) he refers to a prayer known as the " White Paternoster " , elements of which , particularly the blessing of four parts of a house , can be seen in the later " Black Paternoster " : 
 <unk> the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> he anon @-@ <unk> 
 On four halves of the <unk> <unk> 
 And on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> : 
 <unk> Crist and <unk> <unk> , 
 Bless this <unk> from every <unk> wight , 
 For the <unk> <unk> the white pater @-@ noster ! 
 Where <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? ' 
 The reference to St. Peter 's sister may be a substitution for St. Peter 's daughter , St. Petronilla , known in England as St. Parnell . It has been suggested that the differing colours associated with these verses may have been determined by the colour of prayer beads , with different coloured beads used to prompt the recitation of <unk> and <unk> . 
 After the Reformation this " White Paternoster " was among a number of prayers and devotions that were converted into magical rhymes , becoming widely known charms . Lancashire minister John White ( 1570 – 1615 ) in his The Way to the True Church ( 1608 ) recorded among many " superstitions " of the inhabitants of Lancashire , a " White Paternoster " : 
 White Pater @-@ noster , St Peter ’ s brother , 
 What hast i ’ th ' t ’ one hand ? White booke leaves . 
 What hast i ’ th ' t ’ other hand ? heaven <unk> keys . 
 Open heaven Yates , and <unk> shut hells Yates : 
 And let every <unk> child creep to its own mother . 
 White Pater @-@ noster , Amen . 
 Sinclair in 1685 contrasted the " Black Paternoster " to be used at night with a " White Paternoster " to be used in the day . 
 White paternoster , 
 God was my Foster . 
 He fostered me Under the Book of Palm @-@ Tree , 
 St Michael was my Dame , 
 He was born at <unk> . 
 He was made of flesh and blood . 
 God send me my right food ; 
 My right food , and dyne two , 
 That I may to yon Kirk go 
 To read upon yon sweet Book , 
 Which the mighty God of heaven <unk> . 
 Open , open Heaven 's <unk> , 
 <unk> , <unk> , Hell 's <unk> . 
 All the saints be better , 
 That hear the white prayer Pater Noster . 
 Anthropologist Margaret Murray suggested in her controversial 1933 book The God of the Witches that the names of the two companion verses could be interpreted as " a confused version of a Christian prayer or hymn " : 
 = = Literary and musical references = = 
 The " White Paternoster " was used by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ( 1807 – 82 ) as a mockery of the mass by Lucifer , described as the " Black Paternoster " in his narrative poem The Golden Legend ( 1851 ) . It was also the title of a short story by Theodore Francis Powys ( 1875 – 1953 ) published in 1930 . A four @-@ part choir setting of the Black Paternoster text was produced by Gustav Holst ( 1874 – 1934 ) in early 20th @-@ Century Britain , while contemporary countryman Henry Walford Davies ( 1869 – 1941 ) composed an equivalent setting of the White Paternoster .

 The rhyme has often been the source of satire . One of the most common was recorded in Scotland in the 1840s as a hobby horse game among boys , with the lyrics : 
 Matthew , Mark , Luke and John , 
 Hold the horse till I get on ; 
 When I got on I could not ride , 
 I fell off and broke my side . 
 A version from the United States recorded in 1900 began :

 = Pennatomys = 
 Pennatomys nivalis is an extinct oryzomyine rodent from the islands of Sint Eustatius , Saint Kitts , and Nevis in the Lesser Antilles . The only species in the genus Pennatomys , it is known from skeletal remains found in Amerindian archeological sites on all three islands , with dates ranging from 790 – 520 BCE to 900 – 1200 CE . No live specimens are known , but there are several historical records of rodents from Saint Kitts and Nevis that could conceivably refer to Pennatomys . The animal apparently belongs to a group within the tribe Oryzomyini that includes many other island @-@ dwelling species . 
 Pennatomys nivalis was a medium @-@ sized species without many distinctive adaptations . The nasal bones were short and blunt @-@ ended . The zygomatic plate , a bony plate at the side of the skull , was broad . The bony palate was long and flat . The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance , the capsular process . The molars were low @-@ crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs . The upper molars all had three roots . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Oryzomyini , also known as rice rats , is a diverse grouping of North , Central , and South American rodents within the family Cricetidae . Remains of extinct rice rats are known throughout the Lesser Antilles , but the systematic relationships among those animals are poorly understood , and many species remain unnamed . Rice rat fossils were first recorded from Saint Kitts in 1907 by archeologist C.W. Branch and were later found in abundance in Amerindian archeological sites on nearby Nevis and Sint Eustatius . The rice rat of these islands was formally described and named as Pennatomys nivalis in a 2010 article by zoologist Samuel Turvey and coworkers . The generic name , Pennatomys , combines the Latin <unk> " winged " with <unk> " mouse " , a standard element in the names of rodent genera , and honors archeologist Elizabeth Wing . The specific name , nivalis , is Latin for " snowy " and refers to Nevis . This island 's name derives from the Spanish Nuestra Señora de las Nieves " Our Lady of the Snows " , a reference to the clouds ( mistaken for snow ) that surround the island 's central peak . 
 Cladistic analysis of morphological characters suggest that Pennatomys is most closely related to a clade , the Nectomys subclade , that includes members of Aegialomys , <unk> , Nectomys , Sigmodontomys , Melanomys , Megalomys ( another Antillean rice rat ) , and possibly Nesoryzomys . However , the exact position of Pennatomys was poorly resolved because of missing data . Turvey and colleagues placed P. nivalis as the only member of its own genus because of its distinctive characters and the absence of evidence for close relationships with any other oryzomyine genus . Pennatomys probably belongs to a subgroup of Oryzomyini known as " clade D " . This clade contains a number of species only occurring on islands — including members of Aegialomys , Megalomys , Nesoryzomys , Noronhomys , Oryzomys , and Pennatomys . Turvey and colleagues suggested that this is related to the high proportion of semiaquatic species in clade D — most other oryzomyines are forest dwellers . As a whole , Oryzomyini includes over a hundred species in about thirty genera . It is one of several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae , which encompasses hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents , distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas . However DNA analysis demonstrated a sister @-@ taxa relationship with Megalomys as an endemic Lesser Antillean radiation within clade D , and also showed that the different island populations showed a high degree of genetic differentiation from each other . 
 = = Description = = 
 A medium @-@ sized oryzomyine , Pennatomys is known from a number of skeletal remains , many of which are fragmentary . Both skull and postcranial bones are represented . Although there are no unusual adaptations in the known material , the animal possesses a combination of characteristics that distinguish it from all other known oryzomyines . The skull is known only from fragments . The nasal bones extend back to a point before or slightly behind the point where the maxillary , frontal , and lacrimal bones meet , and have a blunt back margin . The nasals extend slightly further back than the premaxillaries . The lacrimals articulate with both the frontals and the maxillaries , a trait that distinguishes Pennatomys from its closest relatives ( which have lacrimals articulating mainly with the frontals ) . The interorbital region of the skull bears weak crests at its sides . The zygomatic plate , a bony plate at the side of the skull , is broad and its back margin is located in front of the first upper molar ( M1 ) . The incisive foramina , openings in the bony palate , extend back to a point next to the front root of M1 . The palate itself is long and flat , extending beyond the third upper molars ( M3 ) . In the mandible ( lower jaw ) , there is a capsular process — a protuberance at the back of the jawbone that houses the root of the lower incisor . Below the molars , the upper and lower masseteric ridges ( crests which support some of the chewing muscles ) are sometimes conjoined towards the front , and they extend forward to a point below the first lower molar ( m1 ) . The conjoined crests are one of the synapomorphic ( shared @-@ derived ) characters of the Nectomys subclade . 
 The maxillary toothrows are parallel to each other . The molars are bunodont ( with the cusps higher than the connecting crests ) and brachyodont ( low @-@ crowned ) and have the inter @-@ cusp valleys on the labial ( outer ) sides closed by a cingulum ( shelf ) . The valleys on the labial and lingual ( inner ) sides of the molars meet at the midlines . Each of the upper molars has three roots — unlike in most of the closest relatives of Pennatomys , there is no additional labial root on M1 . The m1 has four roots — two large roots at the front and back and two smaller ones in the middle . There are three roots under m2 , two at the front and one at the back , and two under m3 , at the front and back . Upper toothrow length ranges from 5 @.@ 6 to 6 @.@ 7 mm and lower toothrow length is 5 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 4 mm . 
 On M1 , the anterocone ( the cusp at the front of the tooth ) is not divided into smaller cuspules . The connection between the protocone and the paracone , the major cusps immediately after the anterocone , is located relatively far toward the front . Behind the paracone , the mesoloph accessory crest is present . On M2 , there is no <unk> ( an indentation in front of the protocone , which on this tooth is the frontmost cusp ) and the valley between the paracone and the mesoloph , the mesoflexus , is not divided into two pieces by a paracone – mesoloph connection . These traits are both characteristic of the Nectomys subclade . The mesoloph is present on M3 , but the posteroloph , a crest at the back of the tooth , is absent or vestigial , as is the <unk> ( the valley between the protocone and the cusp behind it , the hypocone ) . The absence or near @-@ absence of the posteroloph is a distinctive trait that differentiates Pennatomys from related oryzomyines . 
 The anteroconid on m1 ( the frontmost cusp , corresponding to the anterocone ) contains an internal hollow , an anteromedian fossettid . There is an ectolophid , an accessory crest in the valley between the protoconid ( the cusp on the labial side , behind the anteroconid ) and the hypoconid ( the cusp behind the protoconid , at the back labial corner of the tooth ) . On the other side of the tooth , the mesolophid ( another accessory crest ) is also present . On each of the lower molars , an anterolabial cingulum ( a shelf on the front labial corner ) is present . On m2 and m3 , an anterolophid is present — a crest in front of the metaconid ( the cusp on the front lingual corner of the tooth ) .

 Remains of Pennatomys nivalis come from several Amerindian archeological sites on each of the three islands where it has been found ; it was eaten by the native Amerindian population . The oldest site is <unk> ' Shell Heap on Nevis , which is from the Archaic age and is dated to 790 to 520 BCE . The youngest , Sulphur Ghaut ( 900 – 1200 CE ) , is also on Nevis , and is from the post @-@ Saladoid period . Other sites on Nevis include <unk> ( Saladoid , 100 BCE – 600 CE ) , Indian Castle ( post @-@ Saladoid , 650 – 880 CE ) , and Coconut Walk ( post @-@ Saladoid , no absolute dates known ) . The only site on Sint Eustatius is the Saladoid and post @-@ Saladoid site Golden Rock ( 80 BCE – 980 CE ) . Each of the three sites yielding Pennatomys on Saint Kitts is from the post @-@ Saladoid period : Sugar Factory ( 700 – 1000 CE ) , Bloody Point ( 660 – 1115 CE ) , and <unk> ( undated ) . 
 Unambiguous historical records of Pennatomys are lacking , but there are some references to Saint Kitts and Nevis rodents that may relate to it . George Percy reported on the presence of " great store of <unk> " on Nevis around 1606 , probably a reference to the agoutis ( <unk> ) that have been introduced throughout the Lesser Antilles . There are references from 1631 and 1720 to people eating rats on Saint Kitts and Nevis , respectively , but these may well have been introduced black rats ( Rattus rattus ) , not Pennatomys . There are anecdotal records of unusual rats on Nevis up to recent times ; these were reportedly eaten by the islanders until the 1930s . Surveys on Nevis in 2009 found no evidence for the survival of Pennatomys . The extinction of the Antillean rice rats , including Pennatomys , may have resulted from the introduction of exotic animals such as the black rat and the small Asian mongoose ( Herpestes <unk> ) to the Lesser Antilles . 
 There are no known morphological differences between the three island populations , but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands . Such a difference in size might be related to the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis , in accordance with the trend that animals become larger on larger islands . However , Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis ; thus , the size difference may result from differences in the mode of exploitation by Amerindians .

 The Hitachi Magic Wand ( renamed as Magic Wand Original and Original Magic Wand and referred to simply as Magic Wand ) is an electrical , mains @-@ powered vibrating massager , manufactured for relieving tension and relaxing sore muscles . Japanese company Hitachi listed the device for business in the United States in 1968 . Sex educator Betty Dodson popularized its use as a vibrator and masturbation aid for women during the sex @-@ positive movement in the late 1960s . It functions effectively as a clitoral vibrator and is able to bring women to orgasm . The wand is 12 inches ( 30 cm ) long and weighs 1 @.@ 2 pounds ( 540 g ) with stimulation provided by its rubberized 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) head . 
 Hitachi executives assisted financing the production of chocolates in the shape of the massager in 1992 , in honor of the 15 @-@ year anniversary of the sex shop Good Vibrations . Subsequently the company asserted in 1999 its sole intended use was for health care purposes . Hitachi had a conflict with its U.S. distributor in 2000 and briefly stopped selling the device until it reached a new deal with distributor Vibratex . The Magic Wand sold out after being featured in a 2002 episode of Sex and the City . Hitachi decided to cease production of the device in 2013 because of concerns about having the company name attached to a sex toy . Vibratex persuaded the company to continue manufacturing it under the name " Original Magic Wand " , omitting the Hitachi name . In 2014 , the company used the name " Magic Wand Original " . 
 Academics have researched its use for treatment of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmia — a sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasm . The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self @-@ administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm . In 2008 , The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93 % of a group of 500 chronic <unk> women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method . The device was used in studies in many applications , including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal , Journal of Applied Physiology , Experimental Brain Research , Neuroscience Letters , and Journal of <unk> & Neonatal Nursing . 
 The Magic Wand has alternatively been referred to as the Cadillac of vibrators , the Rolls @-@ Royce of vibrators , and the mother of all vibrators . Counselors Bettina Arndt , Laura Berman , Gloria <unk> , and Ruth Westheimer recommended the device to women , and Cosmopolitan magazine reported the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists . Mobile Magazine readers in 2005 voted the Magic Wand " the No. 1 greatest gadget of all time " . Tanya Wexler 's film Hysteria featured the device while showing the evolution of the vibrator . Engadget called the Magic Wand " the most recognizable sex toy on Earth " .

 The device is 30 cm ( 12 in ) long and it weighs 540 g ( 1 @.@ 19 lb ) . Muscle and nerve stimulation is provided by the device 's <unk> , 6 @.@ 4 cm ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) head , which is attached to the main body of the massager via a flexible neck . A 1 @.@ 8 m ( 6 ft ) cord is attached to the device to provide power from mains electricity with alternating current , and requires 110 Volts . It does not take batteries . The massager provides two vibration rates — 5 @,@ 000 and 6 @,@ 000 rpm , which are equivalent to 83 Hz and 100 Hz — that are controlled by a switch on its body . Specifically , research published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy determined that the Magic Wand operated on its low setting at a frequency of 89 Hz and at 101 Hz on its high setting . Its displacement was measured as 452 @.@ 9 µm ( 0 @.@ <unk> in ) , with an acceleration of 185 @.@ 7 µg ( 0 @.@ <unk> gr ) . Because the device was not originally designed as a vibrator , it exhibits some deficiencies when used for this purpose . Apart from its size , bulk , and its reliance on a mains power supply that limits its portability , it is not waterproof or water @-@ resistant , and it overheats when used for more than 25 minutes . It does not work well in electrical outlets in all countries internationally . 
 Because of the Magic Wand 's popularity , various aftermarket attachments with differences in colour , pattern of studs , and material , became available to purchase . Such attachments have been produced by many companies without ties to Hitachi . Without attachments , the device functions effectively as a clitoral vibrator , able to bring women to orgasm . Add @-@ ons that are fitted over the top of the device and are used to excite the clitoris are available . An attachment called the " Wonder Wand " allows women to feel vibrations deep into the vagina . According to an article in the Dermatology Online Journal , " The Wonder Wand " is created from a plastic material which is even in consistency and may be simply cleansed after use . Attachments made of silicone designed to aid with penetrative sensations or to modify texture of the device are available . An add @-@ on called the " G @-@ Spotter " fits over the device in the same fashion and turns the device into a G @-@ spot vibrator . The " Gee @-@ Whiz " ( also referred to as " G @-@ Whiz " ) is a similar type of attachment used to stimulate the G @-@ spot . The " <unk> Tip Wand Attachment " may be placed over the device and can be used to mimic the sensation of cunnilingus . " Liberator Axis " is a booster pillow that stabilizes the Magic Wand so the user does not have to hold it with her hands during use . Attachments have been sold by Betty Dodson on her website , which provides pictorial instructions on their use with the Magic Wand . The massager may be used without attachments for men or with the " G @-@ Whiz " attachment ; when held on the penis it can stimulate pleasurable sensations to the prostate . An attachment made by an unaffiliated company provides a cap that fits over the top of the device so it can function as a male masturbation sleeve .

 The Magic Wand has found great commercial success as a vibrator , a masturbation aid for women . Its popularity for this purpose is associated with the American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson , who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct females regarding self @-@ pleasure techniques . Dodson became active in the sex @-@ positive movement in the late 1960s . She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience . Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method . Her sessions were known as <unk> workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position , each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation . She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these two @-@ hour masturbation sessions . Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique . 
 Dell Williams , founder of the first feminist sex toy business in the United States , Eve 's Garden , was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson 's course in the early 1970s . Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris . In 1974 , Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation . In 1975 in her demonstrations , she replaced the Panasonic <unk> with the Magic Wand . In 1977 , Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson , former editor of men 's magazines Leg Show and <unk> . Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson . Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit @-@ forming dependency . She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries , the Magic Wand was significantly more effective . 
 The Magic Wand has been a bestseller at the sex shop Good Vibrations since it opened in 1977 . The shop marketed the magic wand to women as an effective means of stimulating the clitoris . The device became an enduring bestseller in adult sex toy shops in the United States . It has become known colloquially among women as " Big <unk> " , and is also simply referred to as " The Hitachi " . During the 1980s , the device was advertised in the back pages of Mother Jones magazine . It became popular with women and was featured on the cover of the book Good Vibrations : The New Complete Guide to Vibrators ( 1976 ) by <unk> Blank . The Magic Wand features on the covers of the 1989 and 1998 editions of the book . In 1992 for the 15th anniversary of the opening of Good Vibrations , the sex store managers arranged to have chocolates manufactured in the shape of the Magic Wand . Sales staff from the corporate headquarters of Hitachi company contributed finances towards the creation of the chocolates in the shape of their massager . The Hitachi executives additionally purchased 500 of the massager @-@ shaped chocolates which were given out at the company 's sales conference that year . 
 Good Vibes Gazette surveyed sex toy store customers in 1995 and asked them to rank their opinions of sex toys . The Magic Wand was identified as outstanding . The 1995 book about censorship Forbidden Passages : Writings Banned in Canada , which included works confiscated by Canadian authorities for being " obscene " , featured a contribution involving a woman who used a Magic Wand for pain relief . In 1997 , the Magic Wand was the most popular holiday gift item sold at the Good Vibrations store in Berkeley , California . According to Out magazine , the Magic Wand was the best @-@ selling sex toy of 1998 . Chatelaine received criticism from the Alberta Report in 1999 for reporting on the increasing popularity of the Magic Wand and other sex toys among women . In 1999 the Magic Wand was promoted to consumers as a " personal massager " device . The Village Voice reported in 1999 that the device was marketed by the company as the " Hitachi Magic Wand Household Electric <unk> " . According to the The Village Voice article , the device had outlived competition from subsequent inventions by other companies and remained a bestseller . When contacted in 1999 by The Village Voice the public relations director of Hitachi , Gerry Corbett , emphasized the original intent of their product : " Clearly , [ the Magic Wand ] is a straightforward product . There are no implications of anything beyond standard health @-@ care use . "

 In 2000 , the Hitachi company had a conflict with Appliance Corporation of America , the American distributor of its products including the Magic Wand . The device ceased being sold briefly in the United States . In June 2000 , Hitachi reached a deal with the sex toy distributor company Vibratex located in California to sell the device in the U.S. Vibratex has continued to sell the device in the U.S. through 2014 . <unk> and specialist in sexual dysfunction Jed <unk> told The New York Observer in 2000 that the Magic Wand had a renowned reputation . He stated he recommended the device to female patients with difficulty achieving orgasm to use in masturbation . <unk> observed that the Magic Wand was an extremely successful manner in which to masturbate and was among the preeminent vibrators available . 
 The concept of using a neck massager for other than its stated purpose was popularized in 2002 in the fifth @-@ season episode of the television series Sex and the City , " Critical Condition " . The character Samantha Jones goes to Sharper Image to buy a vibrator , but the staff at the store tell her it is a neck massager . Shortly after being featured on Sex and the City , the Magic Wand sold out of stores . Journalist Naomi Wolf wrote in The Sunday Times that while researching for an article on the female @-@ oriented sex toys catalogue Good Vibrations , she was informed that the Magic Wand had sold out from their stock because of its appearance on Sex and the City . The Rabbit vibrator had previously seen an increase in sales , after it was similarly popularized on the program in 1998 . According to a contribution to Best Sex Writing 2013 by Andy Isaacson , these appearances of sex toys on Sex and the City revolutionized the way they were perceived culturally in the United States . The Times noted the Magic Wand was relatively new to the market in the United Kingdom , where it became available in 2004 . The Magic Wand was number seven of the top ten hand @-@ held <unk> sold on Amazon.com. Faye Flam writing for Knight Ridder Newspapers reported in 2006 that the Magic Wand was exempt from anti @-@ vibrator laws in Alabama , Georgia , and Texas because it did not appear to be a phallic object . In 2006 the device was among the top @-@ selling masturbation aids in the market . 
 The closing credits of director Tanya Wexler 's 2011 film Hysteria featured the Magic Wand in a montage showing the evolution of the vibrator . In August 2012 , American filmmaker Clayton Cubitt used the Magic Wand in a video @-@ art exhibit titled Hysterical Literature . The film project featured women sitting on a chair narrating a piece of literature while being stimulated by the Magic Wand . Each video ends with the woman 's orgasm . Writing for The McClatchy Company , Chuck Shepherd called it " Great Art ! " .

 Because of its concerns about having its name attached to a popular sex toy , Hitachi decided to cease production of the Magic Wand in 2013 . Vibratex director of operations Eddie Romero told Engadget that Hitachi is an extremely staid company and was uncomfortable being associated with the best @-@ selling masturbation aid . Vibratex persuaded Hitachi to continue manufacturing the device , to rename it the " Original Magic Wand " , to use lighter , more durable materials , and to omit any reference to Hitachi . The newly named device returned to the market on 25 June 2013 , with improved engineering and modified graphic design on its accompanying box .

 Many academics have discussed use of the Magic Wand to treat chronic anorgasmia — a type of sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasm — and other sexual problems including female sexual arousal disorder . A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self @-@ masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm . The researchers gave women the Magic Wand to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an orgasm . They found self @-@ administered treatment using the Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm . 
 In 2008 The Scientific World Journal published research in which women with long @-@ term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson . They said the Magic Wand 's large head effectively created a vibrating sensation in the area of the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort . Their research showed that more than 93 % of a group of 500 chronically <unk> women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method . The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine . Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects ' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations . 
 In their work Pleasure Able : Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities , authors Kate Naphtali and Edith <unk> of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the supervision of doctors Andrei <unk> and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the Magic Wand in sexual activity for people with disabilities . The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process . They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands . They also said it was well @-@ suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities . 
 In a 2011 paper for the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems , authors Anna <unk> and <unk> <unk> discussed the Magic Wand within the context of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose . A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation . They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation . The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients .

 In their 2002 book <unk> Pain and <unk> : Trigger Point Management authors orthopedic surgeon Edward S. Rachlin and physical therapist Isabel Rachlin recommended use of the Magic Wand for self @-@ treatment by patients with myalgia . They wrote that continued use of the Magic Wand on <unk> trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients . Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that such treatment could be done in one 's residence outside of a clinical setting . 
 In a 2004 article published in Dermatology Online Journal , authors reported on use of the Magic Wand to help alleviate pain before cosmetic and dermatologic techniques performed by clinicians . The authors described use of the device to decrease discomfort before procedures including supplementing anesthesia with the injection of triamcinolone <unk> into the proximal nail fold for psoriasis , decreasing discomfort during a <unk> injection of the <unk> fold , making an Intense Pulsed Light ( IPL ) facial treatment easier by reducing pain during the procedure , and throughout axillary <unk> treatment with botulinum toxin . They recommended use of the device with the " Wonder Wand " attachment to provide vibration to a decreased surface area on the patient . Lead researcher Kevin C. Smith explained to Skin & Allergy News that the vibrations when delivered to the area of the patient 's mandible can give relief from discomfort by negating feelings of pain from being sent through the sensory system . Smith and Francisco Perez @-@ <unk> further elaborated on use of the Magic Wand in Chapter 7 " Other Dermatologic Uses of Botulinum Toxin " of the 2006 compilation book Botulinum Toxin in Clinical Dermatology . They emphasized the beneficial uses of the Magic Wand with the " Wonder Wand " attachment and showed how its vibrations can reduce pain if given just before an injection of <unk> within 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 to 0 @.@ 79 in ) from the injection site . 
 Authors Lisa R. Baba , Jacqueline M. McGrath , and <unk> Liu examined use of vibration delivery to infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 article for the Journal of <unk> & Neonatal Nursing . Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more , and they tracked their subjects ' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure . Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand , which they bought through Vibratex . They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting and placed it on the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure . Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief . They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns .

 Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon reported in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on their use of the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces . Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research . They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient 's upper extremity in a localized area . Rabin and Gordon later co @-@ wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia . They measured people suffering Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects ' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator . In 2007 , researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway . While testing their subjects ' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration , the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg . 
 In a 2011 article for the International Journal of Otolaryngology , Jeremy Hornibrook discussed the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ( BPPV ) . BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo , a problem attributed to a detached <unk> in one of the semicircular canals . Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location . He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the <unk> maneuver , and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix – <unk> test to assess the status of BPPV . If such a test was positive , Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process .

Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth . Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms . Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the <unk> Museum . Sociologist , sexologist and sex @-@ positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan , and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries , and durability compared to other vibrators . 
 Sex therapist Ruth Westheimer said the device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety . Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , both for women who had never experienced an orgasm and those who had difficulty becoming aroused . <unk> Gloria <unk> wrote in her book The Truth about Sex , a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed , and stated it was popular due to its non @-@ penetrative nature . Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse . Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure , and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device . Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists . 
 Paula Kamen , author of Her Way : Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution , placed the increasing popularity of the Magic Wand as an influential factor in the sexual revolution which took place towards the end of the 20th century . Cathy Winks and Anne Semans , coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex , recommended the Magic Wand for use both during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples could feel pleasure through the device together at the same time . Wendy Caster wrote in the 2003 edition of The Lesbian Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the Magic Wand due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris . 
 Mobile Magazine announced in its July 2005 issue that readers had voted the Magic Wand " the No. 1 greatest gadget of all time " . The Magic Wand won despite being included in the category that included the iPod , the telephone , and the toothbrush . In 2006 , Melinda Gallagher and Emily Kramer , founders of women 's entertainment company CAKE , awarded the device the Best Vibrator Award in their book A Piece of Cake . Many publications have called the Magic Wand the mother of all vibrators including : The Hot Woman 's Handbook , Clean Sheets , the Valley Advocate , and Cosmopolitan Magazine . Gallagher and Kramer wrote that the device was effective at giving the clitoris and vulva intense oscillation sensations . 
 Writing for the Star Tribune , Alexis <unk> recommended the device for a woman having difficulty achieving orgasm . She wrote that for thirty @-@ years a multitude of females had found it to be an assured way to reach orgasm . <unk> recommended the Magic Wand again in a subsequent column as a Valentine 's Day gift , and wrote that it faced little competition due to its basic construction , efficiency , intensity , and reliability . Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was among the highest @-@ demanded vibrators in the United States . Rubel stated that approximately ninety @-@ percent of females are able to achieve orgasm with the Magic Wand . A panel of users arranged by Good Housekeeping tried the Magic Wand for relief of lumbar discomfort and were unimpressed with the results . Self Magazine observed in 2010 that the device 's appreciation had become a cultural phenomenon . 
 Rachel Kramer <unk> praised the device in a 2011 article for <unk> Magazine titled : " 10 Reasons The Hitachi Magic Wand is My Favorite Vibrator " . She composed her article in the form of an ode to her favorite toy . Her rationale for selecting the device as her favorite included its power , speed it takes her to a state of increased arousal , its lack of need for batteries , its delivery of intense clitoral sensations , and its affordability . Yana Tallon @-@ Hicks described the device in a 2011 piece for the Valley Advocate , and wrote that it was quite effective at bringing women to orgasm . She compared its intensity to a Mack Truck . Valley Advocate recommended the Magic Wand in a 2012 article for overweight partners to use during sex because of its longer handle . Ashleigh Corbeil wrote in her book about achieving a simultaneous orgasm for two partners that due to its length the Magic Wand could be used during doggy style intercourse ; and Hilda Hutcherson similarly advised use of the massager in this sexual position . 
 Comic book artist Erika Moen devoted the first piece of her new comic strip series Oh Joy , Sex Toy to " The Hitachi Magic Wand " in April 2013 .

 USS Jacob Jones ( Destroyer No. 61 / DD @-@ 61 ) was a Tucker @-@ class destroyer built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of Jacob Jones . 
 Jacob Jones was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding of Camden , New Jersey , in August 1914 and launched in May of the following year . The ship was a little more than 315 feet ( 96 m ) in length , just over 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) abeam , and had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 090 long tons ( 1 @,@ 110 t ) . She was armed with four 4 @-@ inch ( 10 cm ) guns and had eight 21 @-@ inch ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes . Jacob Jones was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) . 
 After her February 1916 commissioning , Jacob Jones conducted patrols off the New England coast . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Jacob Jones was sent overseas . Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown , Ireland , Jacob Jones rescued the survivors of several ships , notably picking up over 300 from the sunken Armed merchant cruiser Orama . 
 On 6 December , Jacob Jones was steaming independently from Brest , France , for Queenstown , when she was torpedoed and damaged by German submarine U @-@ 53 and was scuttled with the loss of 66 officers and men , becoming the first ever United States destroyer sunk by enemy action . Jacob Jones sank in eight minutes without issuing a distress call ; the German submarine commander , Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose , after taking two badly injured Jacob Jones crewmen aboard his submarine , radioed the American base at Queenstown with the coordinates for the survivors . The Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Dedham , Massachusetts is named for the ship .

 Jacob Jones was authorized in 1913 as the fifth ship of the Tucker class which , like the related O 'Brien class , was an improved version of the Cassin @-@ class destroyers authorized in 1911 . Construction of the vessel was awarded to New York Shipbuilding of Camden , New Jersey , which laid down her keel on 3 August 1914 . Ten months later , on 29 May 1915 , Jacob Jones was launched by sponsor Mrs. Jerome Parker Crittenden ( née Paulina Cazenove Jones ) , a great @-@ granddaughter of the ship 's namesake , Commodore Jacob Jones ( 1768 – 1850 ) , a U.S. Navy officer during the War of 1812 . As built , Jacob Jones was 315 feet 3 inches ( 96 @.@ 09 m ) in length and 30 feet 6 inches ( 9 @.@ 30 m ) abeam and drew 9 feet 8 inches ( 2 @.@ 95 m ) . The ship had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 060 long tons ( 1 @,@ 080 t ) and displaced 1 @,@ 205 long tons ( 1 @,@ 224 t ) when fully loaded . 
 Jacob Jones had two Curtis steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers , and an additional steam turbine geared to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes . The power plant could generate 17 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) and move the ship at speeds up to 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) . 
 Jacob Jones ' main battery consisted of four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) / 50 Mark 9 guns , with each gun weighing in excess of 6 @,@ 100 pounds ( 2 @,@ 800 kg ) . The guns fired 33 @-@ pound ( 15 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles at 2 @,@ 900 feet per second ( 880 m / s ) . At an elevation of 20 ° , the guns had a range of 15 @,@ 920 yards ( 14 @,@ 560 m ) . 
 Jacob Jones was also equipped with eight 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti @-@ aircraft guns for the Tucker @-@ class ships , as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines . From sources , it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Jacob Jones or any of the other ships of the class . 
 = = United States Navy career = = 
 USS Jacob Jones was commissioned into the United States Navy on 10 February 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Commander William S. Pye . Following her commissioning , Jacob Jones conducted training exercises off the New England coast , and then entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs . Upon the United States ' entry into World War I on 6 April 1917 , Jacob Jones patrolled off the coast of Virginia . She sailed from Boston for Europe on 7 May with a group of destroyers that included Cassin , and arrived at Queenstown , Ireland , on 17 May . 
 Jacob Jones ' duties at Queenstown involved patrolling and escorting convoys in the Irish Sea and making occasional rescues of survivors of sunken ships . On 8 July , Valetta was torpedoed by German submarine U @-@ 87 some 120 nautical miles ( 220 km ) west of Fastnet Rock ; Jacob Jones arrived on the scene and picked up 44 survivors of the British steamship . While escorting British steamship Dafila two weeks later , lookouts on Jacob Jones sighted a periscope , but before the destroyer could make an attack on the submarine , U @-@ 45 torpedoed and sank the steamship . Jacob Jones was able to take on 26 of Dafila 's 28 @-@ member crew after the ship went down . 
 On 19 October , the British Armed merchant cruiser Orama and ten destroyers , including Jacob Jones , were escorting an eastbound convoy of twenty steamers , when German submarine U @-@ 62 surfaced in the midst of the group . The submarine launched its only remaining torpedo at Orama , sinking that vessel . While sister ship Conyngham saw and depth charged U @-@ 62 ( to no avail ) , Jacob Jones turned her attentions to rescuing Orama 's survivors , gathering 309 . 
 = = Sinking = = 
 In early December , Jacob Jones helped escort a convoy to Brest , France , with five other Queenstown @-@ based destroyers . The last to depart from Brest on the return to Ireland , Jacob Jones was steaming alone in a zig @-@ zag pattern when she was spotted by Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose on the German submarine U @-@ 53 . At 16 : 20 on 6 December 1917 , near position 49 ° 23 ′ N 6 ° 13 ′ W , lookouts on Jacob Jones spotted a torpedo 800 yards ( 730 m ) distant headed for the ship 's starboard side . Despite having her rudder put hard left and emergency speed rung up , Jacob Jones was unable to move out of the way , and the torpedo struck her rudder . Even though the depth charges did not explode , Jacob Jones was adrift . The jolt had knocked out power , so the destroyer was unable to send a distress signal ; since she was steaming alone , no other ship was present to know of Jacob Jones ' predicament . 
 Commander David W. Bagley , the destroyer 's commander , ordered all life rafts and boats launched . He then ordered Jacob Jones to be scuttled , knowing that the ship 's cargo of depth charges , set on " ready " , the ship began to sink by the stern after the scuttling charges were activated , the ship would probably detonate at any moment . As the ship continued to sink , her bow raised in the air almost vertically before she began to slip beneath the waves . At this point the depth charges began exploding , killing a number of men who had been unable to escape the destroyer , and stunning many others in the water . The destroyer , the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action , sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder , taking with her two officers and 64 men . 
 In the water , several of the crew — most notably Lieutenant , junior grade , Stanton F. Kalk , the officer @-@ of @-@ the @-@ deck when the torpedo struck — began to get men out of the water and into the life rafts . Kalk worked in the cold Atlantic water to equalize the load among the various rafts , but died of exhaustion and exposure . 
 Bagley noted in his official account that about 30 minutes after Jacob Jones sank , the German submarine surfaced about two to three miles from the collection of rafts and took one of the American sailors on board . According to Uboat.net , what Rose of U @-@ 53 had done was surface and take aboard two badly injured American sailors . Rose had also radioed the American base at Queenstown with the approximate coordinates of the sinking before departing the area . 
 Bagley , unaware of Rose 's humanitarian gesture , left most of the food , water , and medical supplies with Lieutenant Commander John K. Richards , whom he left in charge of the assembled rafts . Bagley , Lieutenant Commander Norman Scott ( Jacob Jones ' executive officer ) and four crewmen ( brought along to row ) , set out for aid in the nearby Isles of Scilly . At 13 : 00 on 7 December , Bagley 's group was sighted by a British patrol vessel just six nautical miles ( 11 km ) from their destination . The group was relieved to find that the British sloop HMS Camellia had found and taken aboard most of the survivors earlier that morning ; a small group had been rescued on the night of the sinking by the American steamer Catalina . 
 Several men were recognized for their actions in the aftermath of the torpedo attack . Kalk ( posthumously ) and Bagley received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal . Others honored included Chief Boatswain 's Mate Harry Gibson ( posthumously ) and Chief Electrician 's Mate L. J. Kelly , who both received the Navy Cross ; and Richards , Scott , and Chief Boatswain 's Mate Charles Charlesworth all received letters of commendation . 
 = Supermarine Spitfire = 
 The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single @-@ seat fighter aircraft that was used by the Royal Air Force and many other Allied countries before , during and after the Second World War . The Spitfire was built in many variants , using several wing configurations , and was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft . It was also the only British fighter to be in continuous production throughout the war . The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts , with approximately 54 Spitfires being airworthy , while many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world . 
 The Spitfire was designed as a short @-@ range , high @-@ performance interceptor aircraft by R. J. Mitchell , chief designer at Supermarine Aviation Works , which operated as a subsidiary of Vickers @-@ Armstrong from 1928 . In accordance with its role as an interceptor , Mitchell supported the development of the Spitfire 's distinctive elliptical wing ( designed by B. Shenstone ) to have the thinnest possible cross @-@ section ; this enabled the Spitfire to have a higher top speed than several contemporary fighters , including the Hawker Hurricane . Mitchell continued to refine the design until his death in 1937 , whereupon his colleague Joseph Smith took over as chief designer , overseeing the development of the Spitfire through its multitude of variants . 
 During the Battle of Britain , from July to October 1940 , the Spitfire was perceived by the public to be the RAF fighter , though the more numerous Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against the Nazi German air force , the Luftwaffe . Spitfire units , however , had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory @-@ to @-@ loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance . Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging the Luftwaffe fighters ( mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for the Spitfire ) during the Battle . 
 After the Battle of Britain , the Spitfire superseded the Hurricane to become the backbone of RAF Fighter Command , and saw action in the European , Mediterranean , Pacific and the South @-@ East Asian theatres . Much loved by its pilots , the Spitfire served in several roles , including interceptor , photo @-@ reconnaissance , fighter @-@ bomber and trainer , and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s . The Seafire was a carrier @-@ based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid @-@ 1950s . Although the original airframe was designed to be powered by a Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin engine producing 1 @,@ 030 hp ( 768 kW ) , it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and , in later marks , Rolls @-@ Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2 @,@ 340 hp ( 1 @,@ 745 kW ) ; as a consequence of this the Spitfire 's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its life .

 R. J. Mitchell 's 1931 design to meet Air Ministry specification F7 / 30 for a new and modern fighter capable of 250 mph ( 400 km / h ) , the Supermarine Type 224 , was an open @-@ cockpit monoplane with bulky gull @-@ wings and a large fixed , spatted undercarriage powered by the 600 horsepower ( 450 kW ) evaporatively cooled Rolls @-@ Royce Goshawk engine . This made its first flight in February 1934 . Of the seven designs tendered to F7 / 30 , the Gloster Gladiator biplane was accepted for service . 
 The Type 224 was a big disappointment to Mitchell and his design team , who immediately embarked on a series of " cleaned @-@ up " designs , using their experience with the Schneider Trophy seaplanes as a starting point . This led to the Type 300 , with retractable undercarriage and the wingspan reduced by 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . This was submitted to the Air Ministry in July 1934 , but was not accepted . The design then went through a series of changes , including the incorporation of a faired , enclosed cockpit , oxygen @-@ breathing apparatus , smaller and thinner wings , and the newly developed , more powerful Rolls @-@ Royce PV @-@ XII V @-@ 12 engine , later named the " Merlin " . In November 1934 Mitchell , with the backing of Supermarine 's owner , Vickers @-@ Armstrong , started detailed design work on this refined version of the Type 300 
 On 1 December 1934 , the Air Ministry issued contract AM <unk> / 34 , providing £ 10 @,@ 000 for the construction of Mitchell 's improved F7 / 30 design . On 3 January 1935 , they formalised the contract with a new specification , F10 / 35 , written around the aircraft . In April 1935 , the armament was changed from two .303 in ( 7 @.@ 7 mm ) Vickers machine guns in each wing to four .303 in ( 7 @.@ 7 mm ) Brownings , following a recommendation by Squadron Leader Ralph Sorley of the Operational Requirements section at the Air Ministry . 
 On 5 March 1936 , the prototype ( K5054 ) took off on its first flight from Eastleigh Aerodrome ( later Southampton Airport ) . At the controls was Captain Joseph " Mutt " Summers , chief test pilot for Vickers , who is quoted as saying " Don 't touch anything " on landing . This eight @-@ minute flight came four months after the maiden flight of the contemporary Hurricane . 
 K5054 was fitted with a new propeller , and Summers flew the aircraft on 10 March 1936 ; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time . After the fourth flight , a new engine was fitted , and Summers left the test @-@ flying to his assistants , Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering . They soon discovered that the Spitfire was a very good aircraft , but not perfect . The rudder was over @-@ sensitive and the top speed was just 330 mph ( 528 km / h ) , little faster than Sydney Camm 's new Merlin @-@ powered Hurricane . A new and better @-@ shaped wooden propeller allowed the Spitfire to reach 348 mph ( 557 km / h ) in level flight in mid @-@ May , when Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment ( A & AEE ) . Here , Flight Lieutenant Humphrey Edwardes @-@ Jones took over the prototype for the RAF . He had been given orders to fly the aircraft and then to make his report to the Air Ministry on landing . Edwardes @-@ Jones 's report was positive ; his only request was that the Spitfire be equipped with an undercarriage position indicator . A week later , on 3 June 1936 , the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires , before any formal report had been issued by the A & AEE ; interim reports were later issued on a piecemeal basis . 
 = = = Initial production = = = 
 The British public first saw the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air @-@ display on Saturday 27 June 1936 . Although full @-@ scale production was supposed to begin immediately , there were numerous problems that could not be overcome for some time and the first production Spitfire , <unk> , did not roll off the Woolston , Southampton assembly line until mid @-@ 1938 . The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats . Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components , especially the wings , Vickers @-@ Armstrong ( the parent company ) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents . As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production , the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310 , after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters . The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938 , the two orders covering the K , L and N prefix serial numbers . 
 In February 1936 the director of Vickers @-@ Armstrongs , Sir Robert MacLean , guaranteed production of five aircraft a week , beginning 15 months after an order was placed . On 3 June 1936 , the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 aircraft , for a price of £ 1 @,@ 395 @,@ 000 . Full @-@ scale production of the Spitfire began at Supermarine 's facility in Woolston , Southampton , but it quickly became clear that the order could not be completed in the 15 months promised . Supermarine was a small company , already busy building Walrus and Stranraer flying boats , and Vickers was busy building the Wellingtons . The initial solution was to subcontract the work . The first production Spitfire rolled off the assembly line in mid @-@ 1938 , and was flown by Jeffrey Quill on 15 May 1938 , almost 24 months after the initial order . 
 The final cost of the first 310 aircraft , after delays and increased programme costs , came to £ 1 @,@ 870 @,@ 242 or £ 1 @,@ 533 more per aircraft than originally estimated . Production aircraft cost about £ 9 @,@ 500 . The most expensive components were the hand @-@ fabricated and finished fuselage at approximately £ 2 @,@ 500 , then the Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin engine at £ 2 @,@ 000 , followed by the wings at £ 1 @,@ 800 a pair , guns and undercarriage , both at £ 800 each , and the propeller at £ 350 . 
 = = = Manufacturing at Castle Bromwich , Birmingham = = = 
 In 1935 , the Air Ministry approached Morris Motors Limited to ask how quickly their Cowley plant could be turned to aircraft production . In 1936 this informal request for major manufacturing facilities was turned into a formal scheme to boost British aircraft production capacity under the leadership of Herbert Austin , known as the Shadow factory plan . Austin was given the task of building nine new factories , and to supplement the existing British car manufacturing industry by either adding to overall capacity or increasing the potential for reorganisation to produce aircraft and their engines . 
 Under the plan , on 12 July 1938 , the Air Ministry bought a site consisting of farm fields and a sewage works next to Castle Bromwich Aerodrome in Birmingham . This shadow factory would supplement Supermarine 's original factories in Southampton in building the Spitfire . The Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory ordered the most modern machine tools then available , which were being installed two months after work started on the site . Although Morris Motors under Lord Nuffield ( an expert in mass motor @-@ vehicle construction ) at first managed and equipped the factory , it was funded by government money . When the project was first mooted it was estimated that the factory would be built for £ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , however , by the beginning of 1939 this cost had doubled to over £ 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . The Spitfire 's stressed @-@ skin construction required precision engineering skills and techniques outside the experience of the local labour force , which took some time to train . However , even as the first Spitfires were being built in June 1940 the factory was still incomplete , and there were numerous problems with the factory management , which ignored tooling and drawings provided by Supermarine in favour of tools and drawings of its own designs , and with the workforce which , while not completely stopping production , continually threatened strikes or " slow downs " until their demands for higher than average pay rates were met . 
 By May 1940 , Castle Bromwich had not yet built its first Spitfire , in spite of promises that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April . On 17 May Lord Beaverbrook , Minister of Aircraft Production , telephoned Lord Nuffield and manoeuvred him into handing over control of the Castle Bromwich plant to <unk> 's Ministry . Beaverbrook immediately sent in experienced management staff and experienced workers from Supermarine and gave over control of the factory to Vickers @-@ Armstrong . Although it would take some time to resolve the problems , in June 1940 , 10 Mk IIs were built ; 23 rolled out in July , 37 in August , and 56 in September . By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945 , a total of 12 @,@ 129 Spitfires ( 921 Mk IIs , 4 @,@ 489 Mk Vs , 5 @,@ 665 Mk IXs , and 1 @,@ 054 Mk <unk> ) had been built . <unk> went on to become the largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939 – 45 conflict . As the largest Spitfire factory in the UK , by producing a maximum of 320 aircraft per month , it built over half of the approximately 20 @,@ 000 aircraft of this type . 
 = = = Production dispersal = = = 
 During the Battle of Britain , concerted efforts were made by the Luftwaffe to destroy the main manufacturing plants at Woolston and Itchen , near Southampton . The first bombing raid , which missed the factories , came on 23 August 1940 . Over the next month , other raids were mounted until , on 26 September 1940 , both factories were completely wrecked , with 92 people being killed and a large number injured ; most of the casualties were experienced aircraft production workers . 
 Fortunately for the future of the Spitfire , many of the production jigs and machine tools had already been relocated by 20 September , and steps were being taken to disperse production to small facilities throughout the Southampton area . To this end , the British government requisitioned the likes of Vincent 's Garage in Station Square Reading , which later specialised in manufacturing Spitfire fuselages , and Anna Valley Motors , Salisbury , which was to become the sole producer of the wing leading @-@ edge fuel tanks for photo @-@ reconnaissance Spitfires , as well as producing other components . A purpose @-@ built works , specialising in manufacturing fuselages and installing engines , was built at Star Road , Caversham in Reading . The drawing office in which all Spitfire designs were drafted was relocated to Hursley Park , near Southampton . This site also had an aircraft assembly hangar where many prototype and experimental Spitfires were assembled , but since it had no associated aerodrome no Spitfires ever flew from Hursley . 
 Four towns and their satellite airfields were chosen to be the focal points for these workshops : 
 Southampton and Eastleigh Airport 
 Salisbury with High Post and <unk> Hill aerodromes 
 Trowbridge with Keevil aerodrome 
 Reading with Henley and Aldermaston aerodromes . 
 An experimental factory at Newbury was the subject of a Luftwaffe daylight raid but all missed their target and bombed a nearby school . 
 Completed Spitfires were delivered to the airfields on large Commer " Queen Mary " low @-@ loader articulated trucks , there to be fully assembled , tested , then passed on to the RAF . 
 = = = Flight testing = = = 
 All production Spitfires were flight tested before delivery . During the Second World War , Jeffrey Quill was Vickers Supermarine 's chief test pilot , in charge of flight @-@ testing all aircraft types built by Vickers Supermarine ; he also oversaw a group of 10 to 12 pilots responsible for testing all developmental and production Spitfires built by the company in the Southampton area . Quill had also devised the standard testing procedures which , with variations for specific aircraft designs , operated from 1938 . Alex Henshaw , chief test pilot at Castle Bromwich from 1940 , was placed in charge of testing all Spitfires built at that factory , co @-@ ordinating a team of 25 pilots ; he also assessed all Spitfire developments . Between 1940 and 1946 , Henshaw flew a total of 2 @,@ 360 Spitfires and Seafires , more than 10 % of total production . 
 Henshaw wrote about flight testing Spitfires : 
 After a thorough pre @-@ flight check I would take off and , once at circuit height , I would trim the aircraft and try to get her to fly straight and level with hands off the stick ... Once the trim was satisfactory I would take the Spitfire up in a full @-@ throttle climb at 2 @,@ 850 rpm to the rated altitude of one or both supercharger blowers . Then I would make a careful check of the power output from the engine , calibrated for height and temperature ... If all appeared satisfactory I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3 @,@ 000 rpm , and trim her to fly hands and feet off at 460 mph ( 740 km / h ) IAS ( Indicated Air Speed ) . Personally , I never cleared a Spitfire unless I had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was . 
 The production test was usually quite a brisk affair : the initial circuit lasted less than ten minutes and the main flight took between twenty and thirty minutes . Then the aircraft received a final once @-@ over by our ground mechanics , any faults were rectified and the Spitfire was ready for collection . 
 I loved the Spitfire in all of her many versions . But I have to admit that the later marks , although they were faster than the earlier ones , were also much heavier and so did not handle so well . You did not have such positive control over them . One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick @-@ roll and see how many times she rolled . With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half flick @-@ rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half . With the later and still heavier versions , one got even less . The essence of aircraft design is compromise , and an improvement at one end of the performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else . 
 When the last Spitfire rolled out in February 1948 , a total of 20 @,@ 351 examples of all variants had been built , including two @-@ seat trainers , with some Spitfires remaining in service well into the 1950s . The Spitfire was the only British fighter aircraft to be in continuous production before , during and after the Second World War . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Airframe = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1930s , aviation design teams worldwide started developing a new generation of all @-@ metal , low @-@ wing fighter aircraft . The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany 's Messerschmitt Bf 109 , for example , were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high @-@ powered , liquid @-@ cooled , in @-@ line aero engines . They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages , fully enclosed cockpits and low drag , all @-@ metal wings ( all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military , who favoured the biplane 's simplicity and manoeuvrability ) . 
 Mitchell 's design aims were to create a well @-@ balanced , high @-@ performance bomber interceptor and fighter aircraft capable of fully exploiting the power of the Merlin engine , while being relatively easy to fly . At the time , with France as an ally , and Germany thought to be the most likely future opponent , no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain , enemy bombers would be required to fly to the UK over the North Sea and no single engined fighter at the time had the range to accompany the bombers and successfully return to its own friendly airfields ; to carry out the mission of home defence , the design was intended to climb quickly to meet enemy bombers . 
 The Spitfire 's airframe was complex : the streamlined , semi @-@ monocoque duralumin fuselage featured a large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers , also known as frames , starting from frame number one , immediately behind the propeller unit , to the tail unit attachment frame . The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings . Frame 5 , to which the engine bearers were secured , supported the weight of the engine and accessories , and the loads imposed by the engine : this was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and , in later versions of the Spitfire , the oil tank . This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons to the rest of the airframe . Behind the bulkhead were five ' U ' shaped half @-@ frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit . The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame , to which the pilot 's seat and ( later ) armour plating was attached , and ended at the nineteenth , which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin . Each of these nine frames were oval , reducing in size towards the tail , and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them . The U @-@ shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached . Frames 21 , 22 and 23 formed the fin ; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post . Before being attached to the main fuselage , the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them . 
 A combination of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons attached to the frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of <unk> stressed skinning were attached . The fuselage plating was 24 , 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail , while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23 , before being covered in 22 gauge plating . 
 The skins of the fuselage , wings and tailplane were secured by rivets and in critical areas such as the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required , with flush rivets ; the fuselage used standard dome @-@ headed riveting . From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage , affecting all Spitfire variants . In some areas , such as at the rear of the wing , and the lower tailplane skins the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs . The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin skinned spruce formers . At first the ailerons , elevators and rudder were fabric @-@ covered . When combat experience showed that fabric @-@ covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds , a light alloy replaced the fabric , enhancing control throughout the speed range . 
 = = = Elliptical wing design = = = 
 In 1934 , Mitchell and the design staff decided to use a semi @-@ elliptical wing shape to solve two conflicting requirements ; the wing needed to be thin , to avoid creating too much drag , while still able to house a retractable undercarriage , plus armament and ammunition . An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an <unk> wing , leading to the lowest amount of induced drag . The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure , which occurs at the quarter @-@ chord position , aligned with the main spar , thus preventing the wings from twisting . Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70 , which first flew in 1932 ; but as Beverley Shenstone , the aerodynamicist on Mitchell 's team , explained " Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section to that of the Heinkel . In any case it would have been simply asking for trouble to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose . " 
 The wing section used was from the NACA 2200 series , which had been adapted to create a thickness @-@ to @-@ chord ratio of 13 % at the root , reducing to 9 @.@ 4 % at the tip . A dihedral of six degrees was adopted to give increased lateral stability . 
 A feature of the wing which contributed greatly to its success was an innovative spar boom design , made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other . As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away in a similar fashion to a leaf spring ; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web , creating a lightweight and very strong main spar . The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner , rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non @-@ load @-@ carrying wing structure . The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main @-@ spar during landing . 
 Ahead of the spar , the thick @-@ skinned leading edge of the wing formed a strong and rigid D @-@ shaped box , which took most of the wing loads . At the time the wing was designed , this D @-@ shaped leading edge was intended to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV @-@ XII . Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100 % glycol . The radiators were housed in a new radiator @-@ duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough ; this used the cooling air to generate thrust , greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators . In turn , the leading @-@ edge structure lost its function as a condenser , but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes , a feature patented by Vickers @-@ Supermarine in 1938 . 
 Another feature of the wing was its washout . The trailing edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span , the angle of incidence decreasing from + 2 ° at its root to - ½ ° at its tip . This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips , reducing tip @-@ stall that could otherwise have resulted in a wing drop , often leading to a spin . As the wing roots started to stall , the separating air stream started to buffet ( vibrate ) the aircraft , warning the pilot , and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance . This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire . The complexity of the wing design , especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading @-@ edge structures , at first caused some major hold @-@ ups in the production of the Spitfire . The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors , most of whom had never dealt with metal @-@ structured , high @-@ speed aircraft . By June 1939 , most of these problems had been resolved , and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings . 
 All of the main flight controls were originally metal structures with fabric <unk> and pilots felt that having ailerons which were too heavy to move ( in terms of effort , not mass ) at high speed would avoid possible aileron reversal , stopping pilots throwing the aircraft around and pulling the wings off . It was also felt that air combat would take place at relatively low speed and that high @-@ speed manoeuvring would be physically impossible . During the Battle of Britain , pilots found the ailerons of the Spitfire were far too heavy at high speeds , severely restricting lateral manoeuvres such as rolls and high @-@ speed turns , which were still a feature of air @-@ to @-@ air combat . Flight tests showed the fabric covering of the ailerons " ballooned " at high speeds , adversely affecting the aerodynamics . Replacing the fabric covering with light alloy dramatically improved the ailerons at high speed . 
 The Spitfire had detachable wing tips which were secured by two mounting points at the end of each main wing assembly : when the Spitfire took on a role as a high @-@ altitude fighter ( Marks VI and VII and some early Mk VIIIs ) the standard wing tips were replaced by extended , " pointed " tips which increased the wingspan from 36 ft 10 in ( 11 @.@ 23 m ) to 40 ft 2 in ( 12 @.@ 3 m ) . The other wing tip variation , used by several Spitfire variants , was the " clipped " wing ; the standard wing tips were replaced by wooden fairings which reduced the span to 32 ft 6 in ( 9 @.@ 9 m ) The wing tips used spruce formers for most of the internal structure with a light alloy skin attached using brass screws . 
 The airflow through the main radiator was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps . In early marks of Spitfire ( Mk I to Mk VI ) the single flap was operated manually using a lever to the left of the pilot 's seat . When the two @-@ stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator ; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside . Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half @-@ radiator unit . The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat . 
 The light alloy split flaps at the trailing edge of the wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel . Only two positions were available ; fully up or fully down ( 85 ° ) . The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing , and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing . 
 The ellipse also served as the design basis for the Spitfire 's fin and tailplane assembly , once again exploiting the shape 's favourable aerodynamic characteristics . Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward , thus reducing control @-@ surface flutter . The longer noses and greater propeller @-@ wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and , later , horizontal tail surfaces to compensate for the altered aerodynamics , culminating in those of the Mk 22 / 24 series which were 25 % larger in area than those of the Mk I. 
 = = = Improved late wing designs = = = 
 As the Spitfire gained more power and was able to manoeuvre at higher speeds , the possibility that pilots would encounter aileron reversal increased , and the Supermarine design team set about redesigning the wings to counter this . The original wing design had a theoretical aileron reversal speed of 580 mph ( 930 km / h ) , which was somewhat lower than that of some contemporary fighters . The Royal Aircraft Establishment noted that , at 400 mph ( 640 km / h ) IAS , roughly 65 % of aileron effectiveness was lost , due to wing twist . 
 The new wing of the Spitfire F Mk 21 and its successors was designed to help alleviate this problem ; the wing 's stiffness was increased by 47 % , and a new design of aileron using piano hinges and geared trim tabs meant that the theoretical aileron reversal speed was increased to 825 mph ( 1 @,@ 328 km / h ) . Alongside the redesigned wing Supermarine also experimented with the original wing , raising the leading edge by one inch ( 2 @.@ 54 cm ) , with the hope of improving pilot view and reducing drag . This wing was tested on a modified F Mk 21 , also called the F Mk 23 , ( sometimes referred to as " Valiant " rather than " Spitfire " ) . The increase in performance was minimal and this experiment was abandoned . 
 Supermarine developed a new laminar flow wing based on new aerofoil profiles developed by NACA in the United States , with the objective of reducing drag and improving performance . These laminar flow airfoils were the Supermarine 371 @-@ I used at the root and the 371 @-@ II used at the tip . Supermarine estimated that the new wing could give an increase in speed of 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) over the Spitfire Mk 21 . The new wing was initially fitted to a Spitfire Mk XIV ; later a new fuselage was designed , with the new fighter becoming the Supermarine Spiteful . Somewhat surprisingly , the new trapezoid wing had lower critical Mach number than the old elliptic one , bringing one of the test pilots who flew the " jet Spiteful " ( the Supermarine Attacker ) to remark that the original wing should have been retained on the jet . 
 = = = <unk> versus fuel injection = = = 
 Early in its development , the Merlin engine 's lack of fuel injection meant that Spitfires and Hurricanes , unlike the Bf 109E , were unable to simply nose down into a steep dive . This meant a Luftwaffe fighter could simply " bunt " into a high @-@ power dive to escape an attack , leaving the Spitfire behind , as its fuel was forced out of the carburettor by negative " g " . RAF fighter pilots soon learned to " half @-@ roll " their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents . <unk> were adopted because , as Sir Stanley Hooker explained , the carburettor " increased the performance of the supercharger and thereby increased the power of the engine . " 
 In March 1941 , a metal disc with a hole was fitted in the fuel line , restricting fuel flow to the maximum the engine could consume . While it did not cure the problem of the initial fuel starvation in a dive , it did reduce the more serious problem of the carburettor being flooded with fuel by the fuel pumps under negative " g " . It became known as " Miss Shilling 's orifice " as it was invented by Beatrice " Tilly " Shilling . Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin series , with Bendix @-@ manufactured pressure carburettors , which were designed to allow fuel to flow during all flight attitudes , introduced in 1942 . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Due to a shortage of Brownings , which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934 , early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns , with the other four fitted later . Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly on the ground and at low altitudes , they tended to freeze at high altitude , especially the outer wing guns . This was because the RAF 's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt ; while this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition , it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered . Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938 , when they added hot air ducts from the rear of the wing mounted radiators to the guns , and bulkheads around the <unk> to trap the hot air in the wing . Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold , dirt and moisture until they were fired . Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly , pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft . Combat reports showed that an average of 4 @,@ 500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft . In November 1938 , tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon of at least 20 mm calibre was urgently needed . A variant on the Spitfire design with four 20 mm Oerlikon cannon had been tendered to specification F37 / 35 but the order for prototypes had gone to the Westland Whirlwind in January 1939 . 
 In June 1939 , a Spitfire was fitted with a drum @-@ fed Hispano in each wing , an installation that required large blisters on the wing to cover the 60 @-@ round drum . The cannon suffered frequent stoppages , mostly because the guns were mounted on their sides to fit as much of the magazine as possible within the wing . In January 1940 , P / O George Proudman flew this prototype in combat , but the starboard gun stopped after firing a single round , while the port gun fired 30 rounds before seizing . If one cannon seized , the recoil of the other threw the aircraft off aim . Nevertheless , 30 more cannon @-@ armed Spitfires were ordered for operational trials , and they were soon known as the Mk IB , to distinguish them from the Browning @-@ armed Mk IA , and were delivered to No. 19 Squadron beginning in June 1940 . The <unk> were found to be so unreliable that the squadron requested an exchange of its aircraft with the older Browning @-@ armed aircraft of an operational training unit . By August , Supermarine had perfected a more reliable installation with an improved feed mechanism and four <unk> in the outer wing panels . The modified fighters were then delivered to 19 Squadron . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 = = = Service operations = = = 
 The operational history of the Spitfire with the RAF started with the first Mk Is <unk> , which entered service with 19 Squadron at RAF Duxford on 4 August 1938 . The Spitfire achieved legendary status during the Battle of Britain , a reputation aided by the famous " Spitfire Fund " organised and run by Lord Beaverbrook , the Minister of Aircraft Production . In fact the Hurricane outnumbered the Spitfire throughout the battle , and shouldered the burden of the defence against the Luftwaffe ; however , because of its higher performance the overall attrition rate of the Spitfire squadrons was lower than that of the Hurricane units , and the Spitfire units had a higher victory @-@ to @-@ loss ratio . The key aim of Fighter Command was to stop the Luftwaffe 's bombers ; in practice the tactic , whenever possible , was to use Spitfires to counter German escort fighters , by then based in northern France , particularly the Bf 109s , while the Hurricane squadrons attacked the bombers . 
 Well @-@ known Spitfire pilots included " Johnnie " Johnson ( 34 enemy aircraft shot down ) , who flew the Spitfire right through his operational career from late 1940 to 1945 . Douglas Bader ( 20 e / a ) and " Bob " Tuck ( 27 e / a ) flew Spitfires and Hurricanes during the major air battles of 1940 , and both were shot down and became prisoners of war while flying Spitfires over France in 1941 and 1942 . Paddy Finucane ( 28 – 32 e / a ) scored all his successes in the fighter before disappearing over the English Channel in July 1942 . Some notable Commonwealth pilots were George <unk> ( 311 ⁄ 3 e / a ) from Canada , " Sailor " Malan ( 27 e / a ) from South Africa , New Zealanders Alan Deere ( 17 e / a ) and C F Gray ( 27 e / a ) and the Australian Hugo Armstrong ( 12 e / a ) . 
 The Spitfire continued to play increasingly diverse roles throughout the Second World War and beyond , often in air forces other than the RAF . The Spitfire , for example , became the first high @-@ speed photo @-@ reconnaissance aircraft to be operated by the RAF . Sometimes unarmed , they flew at high , medium and low altitudes , often ranging far into enemy territory to closely observe the Axis powers and provide an almost continual flow of valuable intelligence information throughout the war . In 1941 and 1942 , PRU Spitfires provided the first photographs of the Freya and Würzburg radar systems and , in 1943 , helped confirm that the Germans were building the V1 and V2 <unk> ( " vengeance weapons " ) by photographing Peenemünde , on the Baltic Sea coast of Germany . 
 In the Mediterranean the Spitfire blunted the heavy attacks on Malta by the Regia Aeronautica and Luftwaffe and , from early 1943 , helped pave the way for the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy . On 7 March 1942 , 15 Mk Vs carrying 90 @-@ gallon fuel tanks under their bellies took off from HMS Eagle off the coast of Algeria on a 600 @-@ mile flight to Malta . Those Spitfires V were the first to see service outside Britain . 
 The Spitfire also served on the Eastern Front : approximately a thousand were supplied to the Soviet Air Force . Though some were used at the frontline in 1943 , most of them saw service with the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ( English : " Anti @-@ air Defence Branch " ) . 
 The Spitfire also served in the Pacific Theater . During the Malaya campaign in defense of Singapore , the Spitfire met its match in the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero . " The RAF pilots were trained in methods that were excellent against German and Italian equipment but suicide against the acrobatic Japs . " as <unk> Claire Lee Chennault had to notice . Although not as fast as the Spitfire , the Zero could out @-@ turn the Spitfire with ease , could sustain a climb at a very steep angle , and could stay in the air for three times as long . To counter the Zero , Spitfire pilots had to adopt a " slash and run " policy and use their superior speed and diving superiority to fight while avoiding classic dogfights . It also did not help that Southeast Asia was a lower @-@ priority area which was allocated few Spitfires and other modern fighters compared to Europe , which allowed the Japanese to easily achieve air superiority by 1942 . Over the Northern Territory of Australia , RAAF and RAF Spitfires helped defend the port town of Darwin against air attack by the Japanese Naval Air Force . Spitfire <unk> 's took part in the last battle of WWII involving the Western allies , in Burma as a ground attack role , helping to defeat a Japanese break @-@ out attempt . 
 During the Second World War , Spitfires were used by the USAAF in the 4th Fighter Group until replaced by Republic P @-@ 47 Thunderbolts in March 1943 . 
 The Spitfire is listed in the appendix to the novel KG 200 as " known to have been regularly flown by " the German secret operations unit KG 200 , which tested , evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the Second World War . 
 = = = Speed and altitude records = = = 
 Beginning in late 1943 , high @-@ speed diving trials were undertaken at Farnborough to investigate the handling characteristics of aircraft travelling at speeds near the sound barrier ( i.e. , the onset of compressibility effects ) . Because it had the highest limiting Mach number of any aircraft at that time , a Spitfire XI was chosen to take part in these trials . Due to the high altitudes necessary for these dives , a fully feathering Rotol propeller was fitted to prevent <unk> . It was during these trials that <unk> , flown by Squadron Leader J. R. Tobin , reached 606 mph ( 975 km / h , Mach 0 @.@ 891 ) in a 45 ° dive . In April 1944 , the same aircraft suffered engine failure in another dive while being flown by Squadron Leader Anthony F. Martindale , RAFVR , when the propeller and reduction gear broke off . The dive put the aircraft to Mach 0 @.@ 92 , the fastest ever recorded in a piston @-@ engined aircraft , but when the propeller came off the Spitfire , now tail @-@ heavy , zoom @-@ climbed back to altitude . Martindale blacked out under the 11g loading , but when he resumed consciousness he found the aircraft at about 40 @,@ 000 feet with its ( originally straight ) wings now slightly swept back . Martindale successfully glided the Spitfire 20 mi ( 32 km ) back to the airfield and landed safely . Martindale was awarded the Air Force Cross for his exploits . 
 A Spitfire was modified by the RAE for high @-@ speed testing of the stabilator ( then known as the " flying tail " ) of the Miles <unk> supersonic research aircraft . RAE test pilot Eric Brown stated that he tested this successfully during October and November 1944 , attaining Mach 0 @.@ 86 in a dive . 
 On 5 February 1952 , a Spitfire 19 of 81 Squadron based at Kai Tak in Hong Kong reached probably the highest altitude ever achieved by a Spitfire . The pilot , Flight Lieutenant Ted Powles , was on a routine flight to survey outside @-@ air temperature and report on other meteorological conditions at various altitudes in preparation for a proposed new air service through the area . He climbed to 50 @,@ 000 ft ( 15 @,@ 240 m ) indicated altitude , with a true altitude of 51 @,@ 550 ft ( 15 @,@ 712 m ) . The cabin pressure fell below a safe level and , in trying to reduce altitude , he entered an uncontrollable dive which shook the aircraft violently . He eventually regained control somewhere below 3 @,@ 000 ft ( 900 m ) and landed safely with no discernible damage to his aircraft . Evaluation of the recorded flight data suggested that , in the dive , he achieved a speed of 690 mph ( 1 @,@ 110 km / h , Mach 0 @.@ 96 ) , which would have been the highest speed ever reached by a propeller @-@ driven aircraft , but it has been speculated this figure resulted from inherent instrument errors . 
 The critical Mach number of the Spitfire 's original elliptical wing was higher than the subsequently used laminar @-@ flow @-@ section , straight @-@ tapering @-@ planform wing of the follow @-@ on Supermarine Spiteful , <unk> and Attacker , illustrating that Reginald Mitchell 's practical engineering approach to the problems of high @-@ speed flight had paid off . 
 = = Variants = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 Although R. J. Mitchell is justifiably known as the engineer who designed the Spitfire , his premature death in 1937 meant that all development after that date was undertaken by a team led by his chief draughtsman , Joe Smith , who became Supermarine 's chief designer on Mitchell 's death . As Jeffrey Quill noted : " If Mitchell was born to design the Spitfire , Joe Smith was born to defend and develop it . " 
 There were 24 marks of Spitfire and many sub @-@ variants . These covered the Spitfire in development from the Merlin to Griffon engines , the high @-@ speed photo @-@ reconnaissance variants and the different wing configurations . More Spitfire Mk Vs were built than any other type , with 6 @,@ 487 built , followed by the 5 @,@ 656 Mk IXs . Different wings , featuring a variety of weapons , were fitted to most marks ; the A wing used eight .303 in ( 7 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns , the B wing had four .303 in ( 7 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns and two 20 mm ( .79 in ) Hispano cannon , and the C , or universal , wing could mount either four 20 mm ( .79 in ) cannon or two 20 mm ( .79 in ) and four .303 in ( 7 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns . As the war progressed , the C wing became more common . Another armament variation was the E wing which housed two 20 mm ( .79 in ) cannon and two .50 in ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) Browning machine guns . Although the Spitfire continued to improve in speed and armament , because of its limited fuel capacity its range and endurance were also limited : it remained " short @-@ legged " throughout its life except in the dedicated photo @-@ reconnaissance role , when its guns were replaced by extra fuel tanks . 
 Supermarine developed a two @-@ seat variant known as the T Mk VIII to be used for training , but none were ordered , and only one example was ever constructed ( identified as <unk> / G @-@ <unk> by Supermarine ) . In the absence of an official two @-@ seater variant , a number of airframes were crudely converted in the field . These included a 4 Squadron SAAF Mk VB in North Africa , where a second seat was fitted instead of the upper fuel tank in front of the cockpit , although it was not a dual @-@ control aircraft and is thought to have been used as the squadron " run @-@ about " . The only unofficial two @-@ seat conversions that were fitted with dual @-@ controls were a small number of Russian lend / lease Mk IX aircraft . These were referred to as Mk IX UTI and differed from the Supermarine proposals by using an inline " greenhouse " style double canopy rather than the raised " bubble " type of the T Mk VIII . 
 In the postwar era , the idea was revived by Supermarine and a number of two @-@ seat Spitfires were built by converting old Mk IX airframes with a second " raised " cockpit featuring a bubble canopy . Ten of these <unk> variants were then sold to the Indian Air Force along with six to the Irish Air Corps , three to the Royal Netherlands Air Force and one for the Royal Egyptian Air Force . Currently several of the trainers are known to exist , including both the T Mk VIII , a T Mk IX based in the US , and the " Grace Spitfire " <unk> , a veteran flown operationally by 485 ( NZ ) Squadron in 1944 . 
 = = = Seafire = = = 
 The Seafire , a name derived from sea , and Spitfire , was a naval version of the Spitfire specially adapted for operation from aircraft carriers . Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough @-@ and @-@ tumble of carrier @-@ deck operations , it was considered to be the best available fighter at the time . The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations on the use of the aircraft as a carrier @-@ based fighter ; poor visibility over the nose , for example , meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking alongside the port cowling of their Seafire ; also , like the Spitfire , the Seafire had a relatively narrow undercarriage track , which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations . Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe ; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes , folding wings , arrestor hooks and other modifications , culminating in the purpose @-@ built Seafire F / FR Mk 47 . 
 The Seafire II was able to outperform the A6M5 Zero at low altitudes when the two types were tested against each other during wartime mock combat exercises . However , contemporary Allied carrier fighters such as the F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair were considerably more robust and so more practical for carrier operations . Performance was greatly increased when later versions of the Seafire were fitted with the Griffon engines . These were too late to see service in the Second World War . 
 = = = Griffon @-@ engined variants = = = 
 The first Rolls Royce Griffon @-@ engined Mk XII flew on August 1942 , and first flew operationally with 41 Squadron in April 1943 . This mark could nudge 400 mph ( 640 km / h ) in level flight and climb to an altitude of 33 @,@ 000 ft ( 10 @,@ 000 m ) in under nine minutes . 
 As American fighters took over the long @-@ range escorting of USAAF daylight bombing raids , the Griffon @-@ engined Spitfires progressively took up the tactical air superiority role , and played a major role in intercepting V @-@ 1 flying bombs , while the Merlin @-@ engined variants ( mainly the Mk IX and the Packard @-@ engined Mk XVI ) were adapted to the fighter @-@ bomber role . Although the later Griffon @-@ engined marks lost some of the favourable handling characteristics of their Merlin @-@ powered predecessors , they could still outmanoeuvre their main German foes and other , later American and British @-@ designed fighters . 
 The final version of the Spitfire , the Mk 24 , first flew at South Marston on 13 April 1946 . On 20 February 1948 , almost twelve years from the prototype 's first flight , the last production Spitfire , <unk> , left the production line . Spitfire Mk 24s were used by only one regular RAF unit , with 80 Squadron replacing their Hawker Tempests with F Mk 24s in 1947 . With these planes , 80 Squadron continued its patrol and reconnaissance duties from Wunstorf in Germany as part of the occupation forces , until it relocated to Kai Tak Airport , Hong Kong in July 1949 . During the Chinese Civil War , 80 Squadron 's main duty was to defend Hong Kong from perceived Communist threats . 
 Operation <unk> during the Malayan Emergency saw the Spitfire fly over 1 @,@ 800 operational sorties against the Malaysian Communists . The last operational sortie of an RAF Spitfire was flown on 1 April 1954 , by PR Mk 19 Spitfire <unk> flying from RAF Seletar , in Singapore . 
 The last non @-@ operational flight of a Spitfire in RAF service , which took place on 9 June 1957 , was by a PR Mk 19 , <unk> , from RAF Woodvale of the Temperature and Humidity Flight . This was also the last known flight of a piston @-@ engined fighter in the RAF . The last nation in the Middle East to operate Spitfires was Syria , which kept its F 22s until 1953 . 
 In late 1962 , Air Marshal Sir John Nicholls instigated a trial when he flew Spitfire <unk> , a PR Mk 19 in the custody of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight , against an English Electric Lightning F 3 ( a supersonic jet @-@ engined interceptor ) in mock combat at RAF Binbrook . At the time British Commonwealth forces were involved in possible action against Indonesia over Malaya and Nicholls decided to develop tactics to fight the Indonesian Air Force P @-@ 51 Mustang , a fighter that had a similar performance to the PR Mk 19 . The first airframe ( <unk> ) developed mechanical issues which removed it from the trial . Another PR Mk 19 , <unk> which is now owned by Rolls @-@ Royce , was on gate @-@ guard duties at Binbrook , having been retired from the <unk> one year before . It had been maintained in running condition by ground crews at Binbrook , and after a short time was participating in the trials . At the end of the trials , RAF pilots found that <unk> infra @-@ red guided missiles had trouble acquiring the Spitfire due to a low exhaust temperature , and decided that the twin ADEN 30 mm ( 1 in ) cannons were the only weapons suited to the task , which was complicated by the tight turning circle of the Spitfire and the Lightning 's proclivity for over @-@ running the Spitfire . It was concluded that the most effective and safest way for a modern jet @-@ engined fighter to attack a piston @-@ engined fighter was to engage full afterburner at an altitude lower than the Spitfire , and behind it to perform a hit @-@ and @-@ run attack , contrary to all established fighter @-@ on @-@ fighter doctrine at that time .

 There are approximately 55 Spitfires and a few Seafires in airworthy condition worldwide , although many air museums have examples on static display , for example , Chicago 's Museum of Science and Industry has paired a static Spitfire with a static Ju 87 R @-@ 2 / Trop . Stuka dive bomber . 
 The oldest surviving Spitfire is a Mark 1 , serial number <unk> ; it is preserved at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Shropshire . This aircraft was the 155th built and first flew in April 1939 . It flew operationally with No. 72 Squadron RAF until June 1940 , when it was damaged in a wheels @-@ up landing . After repair , it was used for training until August 1944 , when it became one of several Battle of Britain aircraft veterans that were allocated to the Air Historical Branch for future museum preservation . 
 What may be the most originally restored Spitfire in the world is maintained in airworthy condition at Fantasy of Flight in Polk City , Florida . Over a six @-@ year period in the 1990s , this aircraft was slowly restored by Personal Plane Services in England using almost 90 % of its original aircraft skins . Owner Kermit Weeks insisted that the aircraft be restored to original condition as closely as possible . Machine guns , cannon , gun sight and original working radios are all installed . 
 Two MK 1 Supermarine Spitfires originally restored remain in a flying condition at the Imperial War Museum Duxford , in Cambridgeshire , England . Both restored by American billionaire Thomas Kaplan , one has been donated to the Imperial War Museum and the second was auctioned in July 2015 at Christie 's , London . Being only one of four flying MK 1 Spitfires in the world , the aircraft fetched a record £ 3 @.@ 1 million at auction on 9 July , beating the previous record for a Spitfire of £ 1 @.@ 7 million set in 2009 .
