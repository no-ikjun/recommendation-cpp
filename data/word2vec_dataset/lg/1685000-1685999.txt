 Windows Mobile is a family of mobile operating systems developed by Microsoft for smartphones and Pocket PCs . 
 Its origins dated back to Windows CE in 1996 , though Windows Mobile itself first appeared in 2000 as <unk> 2000 . It was renamed " Windows Mobile " in 2003 , at which point it came in several versions ( similar to the desktop versions of Windows ) and was aimed at business and enterprise consumers . By 2007 , it was the most popular smartphone software in the U.S. , but this popularity faded in the following years . In February 2010 , facing competition from rival OSs including iOS and Android , Microsoft announced Windows Phone to supersede Windows Mobile . As a result , Windows Mobile has been deprecated . Windows Phone is incompatible with Windows Mobile devices and software . The last version of Windows Mobile , released after the announcement of Windows Phone , was 6 @.@ 5 @.@ 5 . After this , Microsoft ceased development on Windows Mobile , in order to concentrate on Windows Phone .

 Most versions of Windows Mobile have a standard set of features , such as multitasking and the ability to navigate a file system similar to that of Windows 9x and Windows NT , including support for many of the same file types . Similarly to its desktop counterpart , it comes bundled with a set of applications that perform basic tasks . Internet Explorer Mobile is the default web browser , and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media . The mobile version of Microsoft Office , is the default office suite . 
 Internet Connection Sharing , supported on compatible devices , allows the phone to share its Internet connection with computers via USB and Bluetooth . Windows Mobile supports virtual private networking over <unk> protocol . Most devices with mobile connectivity also have a Radio Interface Layer . The Radio Interface Layer provides the system interface between the Cell Core layer within the Windows Mobile OS and the radio protocol stack used by the wireless modem hardware . This allows OEMs to integrate a variety of modems into their equipment . 
 The user interface changed dramatically between versions , only retaining similar functionality . The Today Screen , later called the Home Screen , shows the current date , owner information , upcoming appointments , e @-@ mails , and tasks . The taskbar display the current time as well as the volume level . Devices with a cellular radio also show the signal strength on said taskbar . 
 = = History = = 
 Windows Mobile is based on the Windows CE kernel and first appeared as the Pocket PC 2000 operating system . It includes a suite of basic applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API , and is designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows . It allowed third party developers to develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft . Software applications were purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service 's lifespan . 
 Most early Windows Mobile devices came with a stylus , which can be used to enter commands by tapping it on the screen . The primary touch input technology behind most devices were resistive touchscreens which often required a stylus for input . Later devices used capacitive sensing which does not require a stylus . Along with touchscreens , a large variety of form factors existed for the platform . Some devices featured <unk> keyboards , while others featured minimal face buttons . 
 = = = Windows CE = = = 
 Microsoft 's work on handheld portable devices began with research projects in 1990 , with the work on Windows CE beginning in 1992 . Initially , the OS and the user interface were developed separately . With Windows CE being based on Windows 95 code and a separate team handing the user interface which was codenamed WinPad ( later Microsoft At Work for Handhelds ) . Windows 95 had strong pen support making porting easy ; with some saying " At this time , Windows 95 offers outstanding pen support . It is treating pens right for the first time . " WinPad was delayed due to price and performance issues , before being scrapped in early 1995 due to touchscreen driver problems relating to <unk> technology , made by NCR <unk> Products . Although WinPad was never released as a consumer product , Alpha builds were released showcasing many interface elements . During development of WinPad a separate team worked on a project called Pulsar ; designed to be a mobile communications version of WinPad , described as a " pager on Steroids " . This project was also canceled around the same time as WinPad . The two disbanded groups would form the Pegasus project in 1995 . Pegasus would work on the hardware side of the Windows CE OS , attempting to create a form factor similar to a PC @-@ esque PDA like WinPad , with communications functionality like Pulsar . A hardware reference guide was created and devices began shipping in 1996 , although most of these device bore little resemblance to the goal of a pen @-@ based touchscreen handheld device . 
 = = = Pocket PC 2000 = = = 
 Pocket PC 2000 , originally codenamed " Rapier " , was released on April 19 , 2000 , and was based on Windows CE 3 @.@ 0 . It was the debut of what was later dubbed the Windows Mobile operating system , and meant to be a successor to the operating system aboard Palm @-@ size PCs . It retained backwards compatibility with such Palm @-@ Size PC applications . Pocket PC 2000 was intended mainly for Pocket PC devices ; however , several Palm @-@ Size PC devices had the ability to be updated also . While , several Pocket PC 2000 phones were released , Microsoft 's smartphone hardware platform was not yet created . The only resolution supported by this release was 240 x 320 ( QVGA ) . Removable storage card formats that were supported were <unk> and <unk> . At this time Pocket PC devices had not been standardized with a specific CPU architecture . As a result , Pocket PC 2000 was released on multiple CPU architectures ; SH @-@ 3 , MIPS , and ARM . Infrared ( IR ) File beaming capability was among the original hardware features . 
 The original Pocket PC operating system had similar appearance to Windows 98 , Windows Me , and Windows 2000 operating systems . Pocket PC 2000 is unsupported as of September 10 , 2007 . 
 This initial release had multiple built @-@ in applications , many of them similarly branded to match their desktop counterparts ; such as Microsoft Reader , Microsoft Money , Pocket Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player . A version of Microsoft Office called Pocket Office was also bundled and included Pocket Word , Pocket Excel and Pocket Outlook . Notes , a note @-@ taking app saw its first release and would be supported by most later versions of Windows Mobile . Intelligent character recognition support allowed Notes to distinguish styles of handwriting to be learned by the OS during processing to improve accuracy and recognition levels . 
 = = = Pocket PC 2002 = = = 
 Pocket PC 2002 , originally codenamed " Merlin " , was released in October 2001 . Like Pocket PC 2000 , it was powered by Windows CE 3 @.@ 0 . Although targeted mainly for 240 × 320 ( QVGA ) Pocket PC devices , Pocket PC 2002 was also used for Pocket PC phones , and for the first time , Smartphones . These Pocket PC 2002 Smartphones were mainly GSM devices . With future releases , the Pocket PC and Smartphone lines would increasingly collide as the licensing terms were relaxed allowing OEMs to take advantage of more innovative , individual design ideas . Aesthetically , Pocket PC 2002 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows XP . Newly added or updated programs include Windows Media Player 8 with streaming capability ; MSN Messenger , and Microsoft Reader 2 , with Digital rights management support . Upgrades to the bundled version of Office Mobile include a spell checker and word count tool in Pocket Word and improved Pocket Outlook . Connectivity was improved with file beaming on non @-@ Microsoft devices such as Palm OS , the inclusion of Terminal Services and Virtual private networking support , and the ability to synchronize folders . Other upgrades include an enhanced UI with theme support and <unk> downloads and WAP in Pocket Internet Explorer . 
 = = = Windows Mobile 2003 = = = 
 Windows Mobile 2003 , originally codenamed " Ozone " , was released on June 23 , 2003 , and was the first release under the Windows Mobile banner . It came in four editions : " Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Premium Edition " , " Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Professional Edition " , " Windows Mobile 2003 for Smartphone " and " Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition " . The last was designed especially for Pocket PCs which include phone functionalities . The Professional Edition was used in Pocket PC budget models . It lacked a number of features that were in the Premium Edition , such as a client for <unk> / <unk> <unk> . Windows Mobile 2003 was powered by Windows CE 4 @.@ 20 . 
 Communications interface were enhanced with Bluetooth device management . Which allowed for Bluetooth file beaming support , Bluetooth headset support and support for Bluetooth add @-@ on keyboards . A pictures application with viewing , cropping , e @-@ mail , and beaming support was added . Multimedia improvements included MIDI file support as ringtones in Phone Edition and Windows Media Player 9 @.@ 0 with streaming optimization . A puzzle game titled Jawbreaker is among the preinstalled programs . <unk> was included with this release to facilitate the development of games for the platform . 
 Other features / built @-@ in applications included the following : enhanced Pocket Outlook with <unk> and <unk> support , improved Pocket Internet Explorer and SMS reply options for Phone Edition .

 Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition , also known as " Windows Mobile 2003 SE " , was released on March 24 , 2004 and first offered on the Dell Axim <unk> . This was the last version which allowed users to back up and restore an entire device through ActiveSync . 
 This upgrade allows users to switch between portrait and landscape modes and introduces a single @-@ column layout in Pocket Internet Explorer . It includes support for Wi @-@ Fi Protected Access ( WPA ) and new screen resolutions : 640 × 480 ( VGA ) , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = = Windows Mobile 5 = = = 
 Windows Mobile 5 @.@ 0 , originally codenamed " Magneto " , was released at Microsoft 's Mobile and Embedded Developers Conference 2005 in Las Vegas , May 9 – 12 , 2005 . Microsoft offered mainstream support for Windows Mobile 5 through October 12 , 2010 , and extended support through October 13 , 2015 . It was first offered on the Dell Axim <unk> . It used the .NET Compact Framework 1 @.@ 0 SP3 , an environment for programs based on <unk> Windows Mobile 5 @.@ 0 included Microsoft Exchange Server " push " functionality improvements that worked with Exchange 2003 <unk> . The " push " functionality also required vendor / device support With <unk> software upgrades all WM 5 @.@ 0 devices supported <unk> . 
 Other features included an enhanced battery @-@ saving capability called persistent storage capability . Previously up to 50 % ( enough for 72 hours of storage ) of battery power was reserved just to maintain data in volatile RAM . This continued the trend of Windows @-@ based devices moving from using RAM as their primary storage medium to the use of a combination of RAM and flash memory ( in use , no distinction between the two is obvious to users ) . Programs and frequently accessed data run in RAM , while most storage is in the flash memory . The OS seamlessly moves data between the two as needed . Everything is backed up in the flash memory , so unlike prior devices , <unk> devices lose no data if power is lost . New to 5 @.@ 0 , OS updates were released as Adaptation kit upgrades , with <unk> 3 @.@ 5 being the final released . 
 Windows Mobile 5 comes with Microsoft Office Mobile which includes PowerPoint Mobile , Excel Mobile with graphing capability and Word Mobile with the ability to insert tables and graphics . Media management and playback was enhanced with Picture and Video package , which converged the management of videos and pictures and Windows Media Player 10 Mobile . Among new hardware features were enhanced Bluetooth support , default QWERTY keyboard @-@ support and a management interface for Global Positioning System ( GPS ) . Improvements were made to ActiveSync 4 @.@ 2 with 15 % increased synchronization speed . Business customers benefited from a new error reporting facility similar to that present in desktop and server Windows systems . Caller ID now supports photos so a user can apply an image to each contact to show when a call is received . <unk> was also natively added . This release was the first to include <unk> with hardware acceleration , replacing the deprecated graphics component of <unk> . 
 Windows Mobile 5 @.@ 0 requires at least 64 <unk> of ROM ( it 's advisable to have 64 <unk> of RAM ) , and the device must run an ARM compatible processor such as the Intel <unk> or the Samsung and Texas Instruments ARM <unk> . 
 = = = Windows Mobile 6 = = = 
 Windows Mobile 6 , formerly codenamed " Crossbow " , was released on February 12 , 2007 at the <unk> World Congress 2007 . It comes in three different versions : " Windows Mobile 6 Standard " for Smartphones ( phones without touchscreens ) , " Windows Mobile 6 Professional " for Pocket PCs with phone functionality , and " Windows Mobile 6 Classic " for Pocket PCs without cellular radios . 
 Windows Mobile 6 is powered by Windows CE 5 @.@ 0 ( version 5 @.@ 2 ) and is strongly linked to the then newly introduced Windows Live and Exchange 2007 products . Windows Mobile 6 Standard was first offered on the Orange 's SPV <unk> , while Windows Mobile 6 Professional was first offered on the O2 's <unk> Terra . Aesthetically , Windows Mobile 6 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows Vista . Functionally , it works much like Windows Mobile 5 , but with much better stability . 
 Along with the announcement of Office Mobile 6 @.@ 1 with support for Office 2007 document formats ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) ; OneNote Mobile , a companion to Microsoft Office OneNote was added to the already installed version . In addition to the newly included programs with Office Mobile improvements were made to existing applications . Such as HTML email support in Outlook Mobile . A large number of Windows Mobile users are enterprise users business environments were targeted . With Server Search on Microsoft Exchange 2007 , Out of Office Replies with Microsoft Exchange 2007 , and search ability for contacts in an Exchange Server Address Book being implemented . To aid development for programmers , .NET Compact Framework v2 <unk> is now preinstalled with the OS . Developers and users also have access to Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Compact Edition for storage and retrieval of information . <unk> , JavaScript , and <unk> support were added to Internet Explorer Mobile along with improved <unk> Internet Sharing . Communication abilities were further enhanced with a new Microsoft Bluetooth Stack and VoIP ( Internet calling ) support with AEC ( Acoustic Echo Cancelling ) and <unk> Audio Codec . 
 To improve security Microsoft added Storage Card Encryption so that encryption keys are lost if device is cold @-@ booted . Further updates both , security and feature , can now also be provided using Operating System Live Update 
 Among other improvements : <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) screen resolution support ( The <unk> or " Em One " by Sharp was the first and only device to have an <unk> screen on <unk> ) , Improved Remote Desktop access ( Available for only certain Pocket PCs ) , Customer Feedback option , <unk> for searching within programs and <unk> Mobile Access ( UMA ) support for select operators

 Windows Mobile 6 @.@ 1 was announced April 1 , 2008 . It is a minor upgrade to the Windows Mobile 6 platform with various performance enhancements and a redesigned Home screen featuring horizontal tiles that expand on clicking to display more information , although this new home screen is featured only on Windows Mobile Standard edition . This was not supported in the Professional edition . Several other changes such as threaded SMS , full page zooming in Internet Explorer and ' Domain <unk> ' were also added , along with a " mobile " version of the Microsoft OneNote program and an interactive " Getting Started " wizard . Domain <unk> is functionality to connect the device to System Center Mobile Device Manager 2008 , a product to manage mobile devices . Windows Mobile 6 @.@ 1 also had improved bandwidth efficiency in its push @-@ email protocol ActiveSync up to 40 % ; this considerably improved battery life in many devices . 
 Aside from the visual and feature distinctions , the underlying CE versions can be used to differentiate <unk> from WM 6 @.@ 1 .

 Windows Mobile 6 @.@ 5 was a stopgap update to Windows Mobile 6 @.@ 1 intended to bridge the gap between version 6 @.@ 1 and the then yet @-@ to @-@ be released Windows Mobile 7 ( Later canceled in favor of Windows Phone 7 ) , that arrived in 2010 . It was never part of Microsoft 's mobile phone roadmap , and has been described by its chief executive , Steve Ballmer , as " not the full release [ Microsoft ] wanted " until the multi @-@ touch @-@ enabled Windows Mobile 7 ( now replaced by Windows Phone ) arrived in 2010 . Ballmer also indicated that the company " screwed up with Windows Mobile " , he lamented that Windows Mobile 7 was not yet available and that the Windows Mobile team needed to try to recoup losses . Microsoft unveiled this version at the 2009 Mobile World Congress in February , and several devices were supplied with it . It was released to manufacturers on May 11 , 2009 ; the first devices running the operating system appeared in late October 2009 . Several phones that officially shipped with Windows Mobile 6 @.@ 1 can be officially updated to Windows Mobile 6 @.@ 5 . This update includes some significant new added features , such as a revamped GUI , a new Today screen resembling that of Microsoft 's Zune player with vertically <unk> labels ( called ' Titanium ' ) . <unk> also includes the new Internet Explorer Mobile 6 browser , with improved interface . 
 Along with Windows Mobile 6 @.@ 5 , Microsoft announced several Cloud computing services codenamed " SkyBox " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " . " SkyBox " has been confirmed as My Phone , while " <unk> " has been confirmed as Windows Marketplace for Mobile . This version was designed mainly for easier finger usage . Some reviewers have noted interface inconsistencies , with some applications having small buttons making them harder to operate using only a finger . Whilst this version of Windows Mobile does not natively support capacitive screens , mobile manufacturers have been able to use them on their devices 
 In the months following this release , development shifted from Windows Mobile to its successor Windows Phone . As such no major upgrades were planned or released , although three minor updates ; 6 @.@ 5 @.@ 1 , 6 @.@ 5 @.@ 3 and 6 @.@ 5 @.@ 5 ; were made to satisfy consumers during the transition period . 6 @.@ 5 @.@ 1 brings larger user interface elements , including icon based soft buttons ( rather than text based ) , an updated contacts app , native support for A @-@ GPS , improved threaded text messaging , and performance improvements . It was unofficially ported to several Windows Mobile phones . 
 The second minor update was announced on February 2 , 2010 , along with the Sony Ericsson Aspen which was the first phone to use this version . 6 @.@ 5 @.@ 3 continues the trend of attempting to provide a more finger @-@ friendly user interface with several new usability features such as native support for multitouch ; although device maker HTC Corporation created proprietary work @-@ arounds to allow multi @-@ touch to work on some applications it installed on its HD2 handset ( However , Microsoft applications on this handset , such as the Internet Explorer web browser , did not support multi @-@ touch . ) and drag @-@ and @-@ drop start menu icons . <unk> tiles replaced soft keys . " Internet Explorer Mobile 6 has also received some major updates including decreased page load time , improved memory management and gesture smoothing . As with other updates it was unofficially ported to some other devices . Additional features include threaded email and Office Mobile 2010 . 
 The last minor update and the last released version is 6 @.@ 5 @.@ 5 . It first leaked in January 2010 , and was unofficially ported to some Windows Mobile phones . The name Windows Mobile 6 @.@ 5 @.@ 5 has been applied to these newer builds , although this name remained unconfirmed by Microsoft .

 There are three main versions of Windows Mobile for various hardware devices : 
 Windows Mobile Professional runs on smartphones with touchscreens 
 Windows Mobile Standard runs on mobile phones without touchscreens 
 Windows Mobile Classic which runs on personal digital assistant or Pocket PCs . 
 Windows Mobile for Automotive and Windows Mobile software for Portable Media Centers are among some specialty versions of the platform . 
 Microsoft had over 50 handset partners , when Windows Mobile was still being shipped on new devices . 80 % of the 50 million Windows Mobile devices that were made from launch to February 2009 were built by one contract manufacturing group , HTC , which makes handsets for several major companies under their brands , and under its own brand .

 Pocket PCs and personal digital assistants were originally the intended platform for Windows Mobile . These were grouped into two main categories : devices that lacked mobile phone capabilities , and those that included it . Beginning with version 6 devices with this functionality ran " Windows Mobile 6 Professional " and those that lacked it ran " Windows Mobile 6 Classic " . Microsoft had described these devices as " a handheld device that enables you to store and retrieve e @-@ mail , contacts , appointments , play multimedia files , games , exchange text messages with MSN Messenger , browse the Web , and more " . From a technical standpoint Microsoft also specified various hardware and software requirements such as the inclusion of a touchscreen and a directional pad or touchpad . 
 = = = Smartphones = = = 
 Smartphones were the second hardware platform after Pocket PC to run Windows Mobile , and debuted with the release of Pocket PC 2002 . Although in the broad sense of the term " Smartphone " , both Pocket PC phones and Microsoft branded Smartphones each fit into this category , it should be noted that Microsoft 's use of the term " Smartphone " includes only more specific hardware devices that differ from Pocket PC phones . Such Smartphones were originally designed without touchscreens , intended to be operated more efficiently with only one hand , and typically had lower display resolution than Pocket PCs . Microsoft 's focus for the Smartphone platform was to create a device that functioned well as a phone and data device in a more integrated manner . 
 = = Market share = = 
 Windows Mobile 's share of the smartphone market grew from its inception while new devices were being released . After peaking in 2007 , it saw decline year @-@ on @-@ year . 
 In Q1 2004 , Windows Mobile accounted for 23 % of worldwide smartphone sales . Windows Mobile was projected to overtake Symbian to become the leading mobile OS by 2010 . 
 In Q4 2005 Microsoft shipped 2 @.@ 2 million PDAs , which increased to 3 @.@ 5 million in the same quarter the following year . Windows Mobile saw year over year growth between 2005 – 2006 of 38 @.@ 8 % which according to Gartner " helped Windows Mobile to solidify its stronghold on the market " . 
 But by 2008 , its share had dropped to 14 % . Microsoft licensed Windows Mobile to four out of the world 's five largest mobile phone manufacturers , with Nokia being the exception . 
 Gartner research data showed that while the total smartphone industry grew 27 % between 2008 and 2009 , Windows Mobile 's share of the smartphone market fell 2 @.@ 7 % in that same period . It also decreased by 20 % in Q3 2009 . At one time Windows Mobile was the most popular handset for business use , but by 2009 this was no longer the case ; 24 % of planned business deployments of mobile application were for Windows Mobile , putting it in 3rd place , behind Blackberry ( 61 % ) and iPhone ( 27 % ) ; 
 In February 2009 , Microsoft signed a deal with the third largest mobile phone maker , LG Electronics , to license Windows Mobile OS on 50 upcoming LG smartphone models . But in September 2009 , Palm , Inc. announced it would drop Windows Mobile from its smartphone line @-@ up . Gartner estimated that by the third quarter of 2009 Windows Mobile 's share of worldwide smartphone sales was 7 @.@ 9 % . By August 2010 , it was the least popular smartphone operating system , with a 5 % share of the worldwide smartphone market ( after Symbian , BlackBerry OS , Android and iOS ) . An October 2009 report in <unk> said that Acer will shift its focus from Windows Mobile to Google Android . The New York Times reported in 2009 that Windows Mobile " is foundering " , as cellphone makers desert it in favor of Google 's Android phone platform . It cited the difficulties in Microsoft 's business model , which involves charging handset manufacturers up to $ 25 for each copy of Windows Mobile , while rival Google gives away Android for free . From late 2009 analysts and media reports began to express concerns about the future viability of the Windows Mobile platform , and whether Microsoft would keep supporting it into the future . Samsung announced in November 2009 that it would phase out the Windows Mobile platform , to concentrate on its own Bada operating system , Google 's Android , and Microsoft 's Windows Phone . 
 = = Software development = = 
 Software may be developed by third parties for the Windows Mobile operating system . Developers have several options for deploying mobile applications . These include writing native code with Visual C + + , managed code that works with the .NET Compact Framework , writing code in Tcl @-@ Tk with <unk> , GCC using <unk> , Python using <unk> or server @-@ side code that can be deployed using Internet Explorer Mobile or a mobile client on a user 's device . The .NET Compact Framework is a subset of the .NET Framework and hence shares many components with software development on desktop clients , application servers , and web servers which have the .NET Framework installed , thus integrating networked computing space . 
 To aid developers Microsoft released software development kits ( SDKs ) that work in conjunction with their Visual Studio development environment . These SDKs include emulator images for developers to test and debug their applications while writing them . Software can be tested on a client machine directly or be downloaded to a device . Microsoft also distributes Visual Studio 2008 / 2005 Professional Editions , and server / database counterparts to students as downloads free of charge via its <unk> program . Third party integrated development environments can also be used to write software such as Lazarus , <unk> <unk> Toolkit , <unk> , NS Basic and <unk> . Some third party development environments allow coding to be done on the device itself without the need for a computer . 
 Developer communities have used the SDK to port later versions of Windows Mobile OS to older devices and making the OS images available for free , thus providing the devices with the current feature set . Microsoft has tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in February 2007 to ask developers to take their OS images off the net , which in turn raised discussions . At the same time Microsoft offered upgrades to Windows Mobile 6 versions to manufacturers for free . 
 On July 5 , 2009 , Microsoft opened a third @-@ party application distribution service called Windows Marketplace for Mobile . In 2011 , Windows Marketplace for Mobile stopped accepting new <unk> and then fully closed on May 9 , 2012 . 
 = = Connectivity = = 
 In the early years of Windows Mobile devices were able to be managed and synced from a remote computer using ActiveSync ; a data synchronization technology and protocol developed by Microsoft , originally released in 1996 . This allowed servers running Microsoft Exchange Server , or other third party variants , to act as a personal information manager and share information such as email , calendar appointments , contacts or internet favorites . 
 With the release of Windows Vista , ActiveSync was replaced with Windows Mobile Device Center . Device Center is included with Vista and Windows 7 and provides many front end enhancements , allowing a home user to sync PIM information with Microsoft Outlook 2003 and later , photos from Windows Photo Gallery , videos or music from Windows Media Player and favorites with Internet Explorer ; without the need for a server back end . Devices at this time also included a base driver compatible with Mobile Device Center so a user can connect to a computer without a need for any configuration . 
 = Georges Bizet = 
 Georges Bizet ( French : [ ʒɔʁʒ <unk> ] ; 25 October 1838 – 3 June 1875 ) , registered at birth as Alexandre César Léopold Bizet , was a French composer of the romantic era . Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death , Bizet achieved few successes before his final work , Carmen , which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire . 
 During a brilliant student career at the Conservatoire de Paris , Bizet won many prizes , including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857 . He was recognised as an outstanding pianist , though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public . Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy , he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers . His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored ; as a result , his career stalled , and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others . Restless for success , he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s , most of which were abandoned . Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time — Les pêcheurs de perles and La jolie fille de Perth — were immediately successful . 
 After the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 , during which Bizet served in the National Guard , he had little success with his one @-@ act opera Djamileh , though an orchestral suite derived from his incidental music to Alphonse Daudet 's play L 'Arlésienne was instantly popular . The production of Bizet 's final opera , Carmen , was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences . After its premiere on 3 March 1875 , Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure ; he died of a heart attack three months later , unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success . 
 Bizet 's marriage to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son . After his death , his work , apart from Carmen , was generally neglected . Manuscripts were given away or lost , and published versions of his works were frequently revised and adapted by other hands . He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors . After years of neglect , his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century . Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre .

 Georges Bizet was born in Paris on 25 October 1838 . He was registered as Alexandre César Léopold , but baptised as " Georges " on 16 March 1840 , and was known by this name for the rest of his life . His father , Adolphe Bizet , had been a hairdresser and wigmaker before becoming a singing teacher despite his lack of formal training . He also composed a few works , including at least one published song . In 1837 Adolphe married Aimée Delsarte , against the wishes of her family who considered him a poor prospect ; the <unk> , though impoverished , were a cultured and highly musical family . Aimée was an accomplished pianist , while her brother François Delsarte was a distinguished singer and teacher who performed at the courts of both Louis Philippe and Napoleon III . François Delsarte 's wife Rosine , a musical prodigy , had been an assistant professor of solfège at the Conservatoire de Paris at the age of 13 . 
 Georges , an only child , showed early aptitude for music and quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother , who probably gave him his first piano lessons . By listening at the door of the room where Adolphe conducted his classes , Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory , and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures . This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old ( the minimum entry age was 10 ) . Georges was interviewed by Joseph <unk> , the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire 's Committee of Studies . <unk> was so struck by the boy 's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available . 
 = = = = Conservatoire = = = = 
 Bizet was admitted to the Conservatoire on 9 October 1848 , two weeks before his 10th birthday . He made an early impression ; within six months he had won first prize in solfège , a feat that impressed Pierre @-@ Joseph @-@ Guillaume Zimmermann , the Conservatoire 's former professor of piano . Zimmermann gave Bizet private lessons in counterpoint and fugue , which continued until the old man 's death in 1853 . Through these classes Bizet met Zimmermann 's son @-@ in @-@ law , the composer Charles Gounod , who became a lasting influence on the young pupil 's musical style — although their relationship was often strained in later years . He also met another of Gounod 's young students , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old Camille Saint @-@ Saëns , who remained a firm friend of Bizet 's . Under the tuition of Antoine François Marmontel , the Conservatoire 's professor of piano , Bizet 's pianism developed rapidly ; he won the Conservatoire 's second prize for piano in 1851 , and first prize the following year . Bizet would later write to Marmontel : " In your class one learns something besides the piano ; one becomes a musician " . 
 Bizet 's first preserved compositions , two wordless songs for soprano , date from around 1850 . In 1853 he joined Fromental Halévy 's composition class , and began to produce works of increasing sophistication and quality . Two of his songs , " Petite Marguerite " and " La Rose et l <unk> " , were published in 1854 . In 1855 he wrote an ambitious overture for a large orchestra , and prepared four @-@ hand piano versions of two of Gounod 's works : the opera La <unk> sanglante and the Symphony in C. Bizet 's work on the Gounod symphony inspired him , shortly after his seventeenth birthday , to write his own symphony , which bore a close resemblance to Gounod 's — note for note in some passages . Bizet 's symphony was subsequently lost , rediscovered in 1933 and finally performed in 1935 . 
 In 1856 Bizet competed for the prestigious Prix de Rome . His entry was not successful , but nor were any of the others ; the musician 's prize was not awarded that year . After this rebuff Bizet entered an opera competition which Jacques Offenbach had organised for young composers , with a prize of 1 @,@ 200 francs . The challenge was to set the one @-@ act libretto of Le docteur Miracle by Léon Battu and Ludovic Halévy . The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and Charles Lecocq , a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised on the grounds of the jury 's manipulation by Fromental Halévy in favour of Bizet . As a result of his success Bizet became a regular guest at Offenbach 's Friday evening parties , where among other musicians he met the aged Gioachino Rossini , who presented the young man with a signed photograph . Bizet was a great admirer of Rossini 's music , and wrote not long after their first meeting that " Rossini is the greatest of them all , because like Mozart , he has all the virtues " . 
 For his 1857 Prix de Rome entry Bizet , with Gounod 's enthusiastic approval , chose to set the cantata Clovis et Clotilde by Amédée <unk> . Bizet was awarded the prize after a ballot of the members of the Académie des Beaux @-@ Arts overturned the judges ' initial decision , which was in favour of the oboist Charles Colin . Under the terms of the award , Bizet received a financial grant for five years , the first two to be spent in Rome , the third in Germany and the final two in Paris . The only other requirement was the submission each year of an " envoi " , a piece of original work to the satisfaction of the Académie . Before his departure for Rome in December 1857 , Bizet 's prize cantata was performed at the Académie to an enthusiastic reception . 
 = = = Rome , 1858 – 60 = = = 
 On 27 January 1858 Bizet arrived at the Villa Medici , a 16th @-@ century palace that since 1803 had housed the French Académie in Rome and which he described in a letter home as " paradise " . Under its director , the painter Jean @-@ Victor <unk> , the villa provided an ideal environment in which Bizet and his fellow @-@ laureates could pursue their artistic endeavours . Bizet relished the convivial atmosphere , and quickly involved himself in the distractions of its social life ; in his first six months in Rome his only composition was a Te Deum written for the Rodrigues Prize , a competition for a new religious work open to Prix de Rome winners . This piece failed to impress the judges , who awarded the prize to Adrien Barthe , the only other entrant . Bizet was discouraged to the extent that he vowed to write no more religious music . His Te Deum remained forgotten and unpublished until 1971 . 
 Through the winter of 1858 – 59 Bizet worked on his first envoi , an opera buffa setting of Carlo <unk> 's libretto Don Procopio . Under the terms of his prize , Bizet 's first envoi was supposed to be a mass , but after his Te Deum experience , he was averse to writing religious music . He was apprehensive about how this breach of the rules would be received at the Académie , but their response to Don Procopio was initially positive , with praise for the composer 's " easy and brilliant touch " and " youthful and bold style " . 
 For his second envoi , not wishing to test the Académie 's tolerance too far , Bizet proposed to submit a quasi @-@ religious work in the form of a secular mass on a text by Horace . This work , entitled Carmen Saeculare , was intended as a song to Apollo and Diana . No trace exists , and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it . A tendency to conceive ambitious projects , only to quickly abandon them , became a feature of Bizet 's Rome years ; in addition to Carmen Saeculare he considered and discarded at least five opera projects , two attempts at a symphony , and a symphonic ode on the theme of Ulysses and Circe . After Don Procopio Bizet completed only one further work in Rome , the symphonic poem Vasco da Gama . This replaced Carmen Saeculare as his second envoi , and was well received by the Académie , though swiftly forgotten thereafter . 
 In the summer of 1859 Bizet and several companions travelled in the mountains and forests around Anagni and Frosinone . They also visited a convict settlement at Anzio ; Bizet sent an enthusiastic letter to Marmontel , recounting his experiences . In August he made an extended journey south to Naples and Pompeii , where he was unimpressed with the former but delighted with the latter : " Here you live with the ancients ; you see their temples , their theatres , their houses in which you find their furniture , their kitchen utensils ... " Bizet began sketching a symphony based on his Italian experiences , but made little immediate headway ; the project , which became his Roma symphony , was not finished until 1868 . On his return to Rome Bizet successfully requested permission to extend his stay in Italy into a third year , rather than going to Germany , so that he could complete " an important work " ( which has not been identified ) . In September 1860 , while visiting Venice with his friend and fellow @-@ laureate Ernest Guiraud , Bizet received news that his mother was gravely ill in Paris , and made his way home .

 Back in Paris with two years of his grant remaining , Bizet was temporarily secure financially , and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city . The two state @-@ subsidised opera houses , the Opéra and the Opéra @-@ Comique , each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent ; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra . Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra @-@ Comique , the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s . A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta , a field in which Offenbach was then paramount , while the Théâtre Italien specialised in second @-@ rate Italian opera . The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Théâtre Lyrique company which , despite repeated financial crises , operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager Léon Carvalho . This company had staged the first performances of Gounod 's Faust and his Roméo et Juliette , and of a shortened version of Berlioz 's Les Troyens . 
 On 13 March 1861 Bizet attended the Paris premiere of Wagner 's opera Tannhäuser , a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage @-@ managed by the influential Jockey @-@ Club de Paris . Despite this distraction , Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner 's music , which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric . He now declared Wagner " above and beyond all living composers " . Thereafter , accusations of " Wagnerism " were often laid against Bizet , throughout his compositional career . 
 As a pianist , Bizet had showed considerable skill from his earliest years . A contemporary asserted that he could have assured a future on the concert platform , but chose to conceal his talent " as though it were a vice " . In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when , at a dinner party at which Liszt was present , he astonished everyone by playing on sight , flawlessly , one of the maestro 's most difficult pieces . Liszt commented : " I thought there were only two men able to surmount the difficulties ... there are three , and ... the youngest is perhaps the boldest and most brilliant . " 
 Bizet 's third envoi was delayed for nearly a year by the prolonged illness and death , in September 1861 , of his mother . He eventually submitted a trio of orchestral works : an overture entitled La Chasse d <unk> , a scherzo and a funeral march . The overture has been lost ; the scherzo was later absorbed into the Roma symphony , and the funeral march music was adapted and used in a later opera . Bizet 's fourth and final envoi , which occupied him for much of 1862 , was a one @-@ act opera , La guzla de l <unk> . As a state @-@ subsidised theatre , the Opéra @-@ Comique was obliged from time to time to stage the works of Prix de Rome laureates , and La guzla duly went into rehearsal in 1863 . However , in April Bizet received an offer , which originated from Count Walewski , to compose the music for a three @-@ act opera . This was Les pêcheurs de perles , based on a libretto by Michel Carré and Eugène Cormon . Because a condition of this offer was that the opera should be the composer 's first publicly staged work , Bizet hurriedly withdrew La guzla from production and incorporated parts of its music into the new opera . The first performance of Les pêcheurs de perles , by the Théâtre Lyrique company , was on 30 September 1863 . Critical opinion was generally hostile , though Berlioz praised the work , writing that it " does M. Bizet the greatest honour " . Public reaction was lukewarm , and the opera 's run ended after 18 performances . It was not performed again until 1886 . 
 In 1862 Bizet had fathered a child with the family 's housekeeper , Marie Reiter . The boy was brought up to believe that he was Adolphe Bizet 's child ; only on her deathbed in 1913 did Reiter reveal her son 's true paternity .

 When his Prix de Rome grant expired , Bizet found he could not make a living from writing music . He accepted piano pupils and some composition students , two of whom , Edmond Galabert and Paul Lacombe , became his close friends . He also worked as an accompanist at rehearsals and auditions for various staged works , including Berlioz 's oratorio L <unk> du Christ and Gounod 's opera Mireille . However , his main work in this period was as an arranger of others ' works . He made piano transcriptions for hundreds of operas and other pieces , and prepared vocal scores and orchestral arrangements for all kinds of music . He was also , briefly , a music critic for La Revue Nationale et Étrangère , under the assumed name of " Gaston de <unk> " . Bizet 's single contribution in this capacity appeared on 3 August 1867 , after which he quarrelled with the magazine 's new editor and resigned . 
 Since 1862 Bizet had been working intermittently on Ivan IV , an opera based on the life of Ivan the Terrible . Carvalho failed to deliver on his promise to produce it , so in December 1865 Bizet offered it to the Opéra , which rejected it ; the work remained unperformed until 1946 . In July 1866 Bizet signed another contract with Carvalho , for La jolie fille de Perth , the libretto for which , by J.H. Vernoy de Saint @-@ Georges after Sir Walter Scott , is described by Bizet 's biographer Winton Dean as " the worst Bizet was ever called upon to set " . Problems over the casting and other issues delayed its premiere for a year before it was finally performed by the Théâtre Lyrique on 26 December 1867 . Its press reception was more favourable than that for any of Bizet 's other operas ; Le <unk> 's critic hailed the second act as " a masterpiece from beginning to end " . Despite the opera 's success , Carvalho 's financial difficulties meant a run of only 18 performances . 
 While La jolie fille was in rehearsal , Bizet worked with three other composers , each of whom contributed a single act to a four @-@ act operetta Marlborough s 'en va @-@ t @-@ en guerre . When the work was performed at the Théâtre de l <unk> on 13 December 1867 it was a great success , and the Revue et Gazette Musicale 's critic lavished particular praise on Bizet 's act : " Nothing could be more stylish , smarter and , at the same time , more distinguished " . Bizet also found time to finish his long @-@ gestating Roma symphony , and wrote numerous keyboard works and songs . Nevertheless , this period of Bizet 's life was marked by significant disappointments . At least two projected operas were abandoned with little or no work done . Several competition entries , including a cantata and a hymn composed for the Paris Exhibition of 1867 were unsuccessful . La Coupe du Roi de Thulé , his entry for an opera competition , was not placed in the first five ; from the fragments of this score that survive , analysts have discerned pre @-@ echoes of Carmen . On 28 February 1869 the Roma symphony was performed at the Cirque Napoléon , under Jules Pasdeloup . Afterwards Bizet informed Galabert that on the basis of proportionate applause , hisses and catcalls , the work was a success . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 Not long after Fromental Halévy 's death in 1862 , Bizet had been approached on behalf of Mme. Halévy about completing his old tutor 's unfinished opera Noé . Although no action was taken at that time , Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family . Fromental had left two daughters ; the elder , Esther , died in 1864 , an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève , who from the age of 15 lived with other family members . It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached , but in October 1867 he informed Galabert : " I have met an adorable girl whom I love ! In two years she will be my wife ! " . The pair became engaged , although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match . According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch : " penniless , left @-@ wing , anti @-@ religious and Bohemian " , which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from " a family bristling with artists and eccentrics " . By summer 1869 their objections had been overcome , and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869 . Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal : " Bizet has spirit and talent . He should succeed " . 
 As a belated homage to his late father @-@ in @-@ law , Bizet took up the Noé manuscript and completed it . Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score , but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho 's company finally went bankrupt , and Noé remained unperformed until 1885 . Bizet 's marriage was initially happy , but was affected by Geneviève 's nervous instability ( inherited from both her parents ) , her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy 's interference in the couple 's affairs . Despite this , Bizet kept on good terms with his mother @-@ in @-@ law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her . In the year following the marriage he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas , and began to sketch the music for two of them : Clarissa Harlowe based on Samuel Richardson 's novel Clarissa , and Grisélidis with a libretto from Victorien Sardou . However , his progress on these projects was brought to a halt in July 1870 , with the outbreak of the Franco @-@ Prussian War . 
 = = = War and upheaval = = = 
 After a series of perceived provocations from Prussia , culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern , the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870 . Initially this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory . Bizet , along with other composers and artists , joined the National Guard and began training . He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which he was supposed to fight ; his unit 's guns , he said , were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy . The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses ; at Sedan on 2 September the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat ; Napoleon was captured and deposed , and the Second Empire came to a sudden end . 
 Bizet greeted with enthusiasm the proclamation in Paris of the Third Republic . The new government did not sue for peace , and by 17 September the Prussian armies had surrounded Paris . Unlike Gounod , who fled to England , Bizet rejected opportunities to leave the besieged city : " I can 't leave Paris ! It 's impossible ! It would be quite simply an act of cowardice " , he wrote to Mme Halévy . Life in the city became frugal and harsh , although by October there were efforts to re @-@ establish normality . Pasdeloup resumed his regular Sunday concerts , and on 5 November the Opéra reopened with excerpts from works by Gluck , Rossini and Meyerbeer . 
 An armistice was signed on 26 January 1871 , but the departure of the Prussian troops from Paris in March presaged a period of confusion and civil disturbance . Following an uprising , the city 's municipal authority was taken over by dissidents who established the Paris Commune . Bizet decided that he was no longer safe in the city , and he and Geneviève escaped to Compiègne . Later they moved to Le <unk> where they sat out the two months of the Commune , within hearing distance of the gunfire that resounded as government troops gradually crushed the uprising : " The cannons are rumbling with unbelievable violence " , Bizet wrote to his mother @-@ in @-@ law on 12 May .

 As life in Paris returned to normal , in June 1871 Bizet 's appointment as chorus @-@ master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director , Émile Perrin . Bizet was due to begin his duties in October , but on 1 November the post was assumed by Hector Salomon . In her biography of Bizet , Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director 's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer 's opera <unk> after only two performances . Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis , but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra @-@ Comique fell through , and neither work was finished ; only fragments of their music survive . Bizet 's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d 'enfants , and a one @-@ act opera , Djamileh , which opened at the Opéra @-@ Comique in May 1872 . It was poorly staged and incompetently sung ; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music . It closed after 11 performances , not to be heard again until 1938 . On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple 's only child , a son , Jacques . 
 Bizet 's next major assignment came from Carvalho , who was now managing Paris ' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet 's play L 'Arlésienne . When the play opened on 1 October the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste . However , encouraged by Reyer and Massenet , Bizet fashioned a four @-@ movement suite from the music , which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception . In the winter of 1872 – 73 , Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still @-@ absent Gounod 's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra @-@ Comique . Relations between the two had been cool for some years , but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor 's request for help , writing : " You were the beginning of my life as an artist . I spring from you " . 
 In June 1872 Bizet informed Galabert : " I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra @-@ Comique . [ Henri ] Meilhac and [ Ludovic ] Halévy are doing my piece " . The subject chosen for this project was Prosper Mérimée 's short novel Carmen . Bizet began the music in the summer of 1873 , but the Opéra @-@ Comique 's management was concerned about the suitability of this risqué story for a theatre that generally provided wholesome entertainment , and work was suspended . Bizet then began composing Don Rodrigue , an adaptation of the El Cid story by Louis Gallet and Édouard Blau . He played a piano version to a select audience that included the Opéra 's principal baritone Jean @-@ Baptiste Faure , hoping that the singer 's approval might influence the directors of the Opéra to stage the work . However , on the night of 28 – 29 October , the Opéra burned to the ground ; the directors , amid other pressing concerns , set Don Rodrigue aside . It was never completed ; Bizet later adapted a theme from its final act as the basis of his 1875 overture , Patrie . 
 = = = = Carmen = = = = 
 Adolphe de Leuven , the co @-@ director of the Opéra @-@ Comique most bitterly opposed to the Carmen project , resigned early in 1874 , removing the main barrier to the work 's production . Bizet finished the score during the summer and was pleased with the outcome : " I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity , full of colour and melody " . The renowned mezzo @-@ soprano <unk> Galli @-@ Marié ( known professionally as " Galli @-@ Marié " ) was engaged to sing the title role . According to Dean she was as delighted by the part as Bizet was by her suitability for it . There were rumours that he and the singer pursued a brief affair ; his relations with Geneviève were strained at this time , and they lived apart for several months . 
 When rehearsals began in October 1874 the orchestra had difficulties with the score , finding some parts unplayable . The chorus likewise declared some of their music impossible to sing , and were dismayed that they had to act as individuals , smoking and fighting onstage rather than merely standing in line . Bizet also had to counter further attempts at the Opéra @-@ Comique to modify parts of the action which they deemed improper . Only when the leading singers threatened to withdraw from the production did the management give way . Resolving these issues delayed the first night until 3 March 1875 on which morning , by chance , Bizet 's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was announced . 
 Among leading musical figures at the premiere were Jules Massenet , Camille Saint @-@ Saëns and Charles Gounod . Geneviève , suffering from an abscess in her right eye , was unable to be present . The opera 's first performance extended to four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours ; the final act did not begin until after midnight . Afterwards , Massenet and Saint @-@ Saëns were congratulatory , Gounod less so . According to one account he accused Bizet of plagiarism : " Georges has robbed me ! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet 's credit but the sauce that masks the fish " . Much of the press comment was negative , expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue . Galli @-@ Marié 's performance was described by one critic as " the very incarnation of vice " . Others complained of a lack of melody , and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Opéra @-@ Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu . Léon Escudier in L 'Art Musical called the music " dull and obscure ... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes " . There was , however , praise from the poet Théodore de Banville , who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra @-@ Comique " puppets " . The public 's reaction was lukewarm , and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure : " I foresee a definite and hopeless flop " . 
 = = = Illness and death = = = 
 For most of his life Bizet had suffered from a recurrent throat complaint . A heavy smoker , he may have further undermined his health by overwork during the mid @-@ 1860s , when he toiled over publishers ' transcriptions for up to 16 hours a day . In 1868 he informed Galabert that he had been very ill with abscesses in the windpipe : " I suffered like a dog " . In 1871 , and again in 1874 while completing Carmen , he had been disabled by severe bouts of what he described as " throat angina " , and suffered a further attack in late March 1875 . At that time , depressed by the evident failure of Carmen , Bizet was slow to recover and fell ill again in May . At the end of the month he went to his holiday home at Bougival and , feeling a little better , went for a swim in the Seine . On the next day , 1 June , he was afflicted by high fever and pain , which was followed by an apparent heart attack . He seemed temporarily to recover , but in the early hours of 3 June , his wedding anniversary , he suffered a fatal second attack . 
 The suddenness of Bizet 's death , and awareness of his depressed mental state , fuelled rumours of suicide . Although the exact cause of death was never settled with certainty , physicians discounted such theories and eventually determined the cause as " a cardiac complication of acute articular rheumatism " . News of the death stunned Paris 's musical world ; as Galli @-@ Marié was too upset to appear , that evening 's performance of Carmen was cancelled and replaced with Boieldieu 's La dame blanche . 
 At the funeral on 5 June at the Église de la Sainte @-@ Trinité in Montmartre , more than 4 @,@ 000 people were present . Adolphe Bizet led the mourners , who included Gounod , Thomas , Ludovic Halévy , Léon Halévy and Massenet . An orchestra under Pasdeloup played Patrie , and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from Carmen . At the burial which followed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery , Gounod gave the eulogy . He said that Bizet had been struck down just as he was becoming recognised as a true artist . Towards the end of his address Gounod broke down , and was unable to deliver his final peroration . After a special performance of Carmen at the Opéra @-@ Comique that night , the press which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier now declared Bizet a master . 
 = = Music = = 
 = = = Early works = = = 
 Bizet 's earliest compositions , chiefly songs and keyboard pieces written as exercises , give early indications of his emergent power and his gifts as a melodist . Dean sees evidence in the piano work Romance sans parole , written before 1854 , of " the conjunction of melody , rhythm and accompaniment " that is characteristic of Bizet 's mature works . Bizet 's first orchestral piece was an overture written in 1855 in the manner of Rossini 's Guillaume Tell . Critics have found it unremarkable , but the Symphony in C of the same year has been warmly praised by later commentators who have made favourable comparisons with Mozart and Schubert . In Dean 's view the symphony has " few rivals and perhaps no superior in the work of any composer of such youth " . The critic Ernest Newman suggests that Bizet may at this time have thought that his future lay in the field of instrumental music , before an " inner voice " ( and the realities of the French musical world ) turned him towards the stage . 
 = = = Orchestral , piano and vocal works = = = 
 After his early Symphony in C , Bizet 's purely orchestral output is sparse . The Roma symphony over which he laboured for more than eight years compares poorly , in Dean 's view , with its juvenile predecessor . The work , says Dean , owes something to Gounod , and contains passages that recall Weber and Mendelssohn . However , Dean contends that the work suffers from poor organisation and an excess of pretentious music ; he calls it a " misfire " . Bizet 's other mature orchestral work , the overture Patrie , is similarly dismissed : " an awful warning of the danger of confusing art with patriotism " . The musicologist Hugh Macdonald argues that Bizet 's best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived respectively from the piano work Jeux d 'enfants and the incidental music for L 'Arlésienne . In these he demonstrates a maturity of style that , had he lived longer , might have been the basis for future great orchestral works . 
 Bizet 's piano works have not entered the concert pianist 's repertoire , and are generally too difficult for amateurs to attempt . An exception is the set of 12 pieces evoking the world of children 's games , Jeux d 'enfants , written for four hands . Here , Bizet avoided the virtuoso passages which tend to dominate his solo works . The earlier solo pieces bear the influence of Chopin ; later works , such as the Variations <unk> and the Chasse Fantastique , owe more to Liszt . Most of Bizet 's songs were written in the period 1866 – 68 . Dean defines the main weaknesses in these songs as an unimaginative repetition of the same music for each verse , and a tendency to write for the orchestra rather than the voice . Much of Bizet 's larger @-@ scale vocal music is lost ; the early Te Deum , which survives in full , is rejected by Dean as " a wretched work [ that ] merely illustrates Bizet 's unfitness to write religious music . " 
 = = = Dramatic works = = = 
 Bizet 's early one @-@ act opera Le docteur Miracle provides the first clear signs of his promise in this genre , its sparkling music including , according to Dean , " many happy touches of parody , scoring and comic characterisation " . Newman perceives evidence of Bizet 's later achievements in many of his earliest works : " [ A ] gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved . " Until Carmen , however , Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre . He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as Donizetti , Rossini , Berlioz , Gounod and Thomas . Macdonald suggests that , technically , he surpassed all of these , with a feeling for the human voice that compares with that of Mozart . 
 In Don Procopio Bizet followed the stock devices of Italian opera as typified by Donizetti in Don Pasquale , a work which it closely resembles . However , the familiar idiom is interspersed with original touches in which Bizet 's fingerprints emerge unmistakably . In his first significant opera , Les pêcheurs de perles , Bizet was hampered by a dull libretto and a laborious plot ; nevertheless , the music in Dean 's view rises at times " far above the level of contemporary French opera " . Its many original flourishes include the introduction to the cavatina Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre played by two French horns over a cello background , an effect which in the words of analyst Hervé Lacombe , " resonates in the memory like a fanfare lost in a distant forest " . While the music of Les pêcheurs is atmospheric and deeply evocative of the opera 's Eastern setting , in La jolie fille de Perth Bizet made no attempt to introduce Scottish colour or mood , though the scoring includes highly imaginative touches such as a separate band of woodwind and strings during the opera 's Act III seduction scene . 
 From Bizet 's unfinished works , Macdonald highlights La coupe du roi de Thulé as giving clear signs of the power that would reach a pinnacle in Carmen , and suggests that had Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis been completed , Bizet 's legacy would have been " infinitely richer " . As Bizet moved away from the accepted musical conventions of French opera he encountered critical hostility . In the case of Djamileh , the accusation of " Wagnerism " was raised again , as audiences struggled to understand the score 's originality ; many found the music pretentious and monotonous , lacking in both rhythm and melody . By contrast , modern critical opinion as expressed by Macdonald is that Djamileh is " a truly enchanting piece , full of inventive touches , especially of chromatic colour . " 
 Ralph P. Locke , in his study of Carmen 's origins , draws attention to Bizet 's successful evocation of Andalusian Spain . Grout , in his History of Western Music , praises the music 's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality , and Bizet 's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion . Among the opera 's early champions were Tchaikovsky , Brahms , and particularly Wagner , who commented : " Here , thank God , at last for a change is somebody with ideas in his head . " Another champion of the work was Friedrich Nietzsche , who claimed to know it by heart ; " It is music that makes no pretensions to depth , but it is delightful in its simplicity , so unaffected and sincere " . By broad consent , Carmen represents the fulfilment of Bizet 's development as a master of music drama , and the culmination of the genre of opéra comique . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 After Bizet 's death many of his manuscripts were lost ; works were revised by other hands , and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet . Even Carmen was altered into grand opera format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud , and by other amendments to the score . The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and , apart from Carmen and the L 'Arlésienne suite , few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death . However , the 20th century saw an increase of interest . Don Procopio was revived in Monte Carlo in 1906 ; an Italian version of Les pêcheurs de perles was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 13 November 1916 , with Caruso in the leading tenor role , and it has since become a staple at many opera houses . After its first performance in Switzerland in 1935 , the Symphony in C entered the concert repertory , and has been recorded by , among many others , Sir Thomas Beecham . Excerpts from La coupe du roi de Thulé , edited by Winton Dean , were broadcast by the BBC on 12 July 1955 , and Le docteur Miracle was revived in London on 8 December 1957 by the Park Lane Group . Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV have been recorded , as have numerous songs and the complete piano music . Carmen , after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances , became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna ( 1875 ) and London ( 1878 ) . It has been hailed as the first opera of the verismo school , in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised , with art reflecting life — " not idealised life but life as actually lived " . 
 The music critic Harold Schonberg surmises that had Bizet lived , he might have revolutionised French opera ; as it is , verismo was taken up mainly by Italians , notably Puccini who , according to Dean , developed the idea " till it became threadbare " . Bizet founded no specific school , though Dean names Chabrier and Ravel as composers influenced by him . Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet 's tragic heroes — <unk> in L 'Arlésienne , José in Carmen — is reflected in Tchaikovsky 's late symphonies , particularly the B minor " Pathetique " . Macdonald writes that Bizet 's legacy is limited by the shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of focus that persisted until his final five years . " The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions , or because no one asked him to write them , or because of his premature death , is infinitely dispiriting , yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable . It has greatly enriched a period of French music already rich in composers of talent and distinction . " 
 In Bizet 's family circle , his father Adolphe died in 1886 . Bizet 's son Jacques committed suicide in 1922 after an unhappy love affair . Jean Reiter , Bizet 's elder son , had a successful career as press director of Le Temps , became an Officer of the Legion of Honour , and died in 1939 at the age of 77 . In 1886 Geneviève married Émile Straus , a rich lawyer ; she became a famous Parisian society hostess and a close friend of , among others , Marcel Proust . She showed little interest in her first husband 's musical legacy , made no effort to catalogue Bizet 's manuscripts and gave many away as souvenirs . She died in 1926 ; in her will she established a fund for a Georges Bizet prize , to be awarded annually to a composer under 40 who had " produced a remarkable work within the previous five years " . Winners of the prize include Tony Aubin , Jean @-@ Michel <unk> , Henri <unk> and Jean <unk> . 
 = Pearl Jam ( album ) = 
 Pearl Jam ( sometimes referred to as The Avocado Album ) is the eponymous eighth studio album by American alternative rock band Pearl Jam , released on May 2 , 2006 on J Records . It was the first and only release for J Records , their last album issued by Sony Music . It was the band 's first full @-@ length studio release in almost four years , since Riot Act ( 2002 ) . Following their performances at the Vote For Change tour in 2004 , the band commenced work on Pearl Jam in November 2004 at Studio X in Seattle , Washington and finished in February 2006 . 
 The music on the record was proclaimed as a return to the band 's roots , with an emphasis on up @-@ tempo songs with an aggressive sound . The song lyrics are mostly told from the point of view of characters and deal with the socio @-@ political issues in the United States at the period , such as the War on Terror . 
 Pearl Jam was critically well received and was a commercial success , debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and eventually outselling the band 's previous release , Riot Act . The album also produced three singles — " World Wide Suicide " , " Life Wasted " and " Gone " — which were moderately successful . The band supported the album with a full @-@ scale world tour in 2006 . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Pearl Jam was recorded at Studio X in Seattle , Washington . The band began work on the album following the 2004 Vote for Change tour in November 2004 , and again employed producer Adam Kasper , who worked with them in predecessor Riot Act . The recording sessions started in February 2005 , and worked on it off and on throughout the year , with the sessions being interrupted toward the end of the year when the band toured North America and South America . The album was completed in early 2006 . Bassist Jeff Ament attributed the length of time recording to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder having a child and the band touring in the middle of recording . The album was mixed by Kasper at Studio X. 
 For the first time since 1993 's Vs . , the band members did not go into the recording sessions with any completed songs , only guitar riffs . Vedder admitted that the band " really went in with nothing . " The band sat around playing music together and discussed the song arrangements , and in just one week had completed ten songs . Ament described it as a " real collaborative effort , " and Vedder described it as " absolute democracy . " Guitarist Mike McCready stated that the band members were feeling " fresh and energetic " and " were communicating better than ever . " Toward the end of the sessions it came down to Vedder to finish up the material , with Ament observing that " the way the record started and the way that it finished is probably two different things . " Regarding his lyric writing process , Vedder said that he wrote at least four different sets of lyrics for each song , with many going as high as eight . Vedder described as a process that demands " the patience of like a National Geographic photographer sitting underneath the bush in a tent " , adding he would at times " figure out after eight , nine or eleven drafts that the first one was actually the one " . A total of 25 songs were written before coming down to the 13 on the final track listing . Outtakes include " The Forest " , later featured on Ament 's 2008 solo album Tone , and " Of the Earth " , which started being played live in 2010 . 
 Pearl Jam 's contract with Epic Records had ended in 2003 , but the band was not ready to release an album without label backing . Independent label Epitaph Records was considered , but the band wanted a company that would guarantee a wide release . Manager Kelly Curtis signed a one record deal with J Records - which ironically during production became , like Epic , a subsidiary of Sony Music after said company merged with J 's parent company BMG . J had approached Pearl Jam as early as 2001 , and had its first experiments with the band issuing the live album Live at Benaroya Hall in 2004 . Vedder said J was picked as they searched for " somebody who 'll allow us to be who we are and respects how we do things " and contributed with the " facilitation of getting the music out there " . Gossard added the label did not input any time or creative constraints upon the band - " We didn 't play them much music until it was basically done , and they were pleased . They weren 't expecting us to do something that was unnatural for us . "

 A number of critics cited the album as a return to the band 's roots . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said , " Nearly 15 years after Ten , Pearl Jam finally returned to the strengths of their debut with 2006 's Pearl Jam , a sharply focused set of impassioned hard rock . " Vedder said , " It 's easily the best stuff we 've done but also some of the hardest stuff . It 's very aggressive , because again , it 's kind of a product of what it 's like to be an American these days . It 's pretty aggressive , especially when you turn it loud . " Gossard added that after many experimental albums , Pearl Jam was " like a coming together again in terms of accepting our natural strengths and also incorporating the best of our experiments " . 
 The album begins with a number of up @-@ tempo songs before expanding to a variety of tempos for its second half . Vedder attributed the faster and more aggressive songs to the band writing a lot of material that kept getting pared down , with the band leaving behind mid @-@ tempo songs , while Ament suggested that it was because of the band balancing recording and touring which resulted in " physicality ... from being out on the road . " The band attempted to create an environment in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play much as they do live . Ament said that there was " a lot of honing of the guitars and vocals in the middle and toward the end , " which resulted in the album sounding " more polished . " On the overall feeling of the album , Ament said , " The band playing in a room — that came across . There 's a kind of immediacy to the record , and that 's what we were going for . " 
 Current socio @-@ political issues in the United States are addressed on the album , with Vedder claiming the record " deals with real content and the moral issues of our time " , and crediting as inspiration both the frustration with George W. Bush being reelected , and the birth of Vedder 's daughter - " Now that I see it as my daughter 's planet , I 'm even more ( angry ) . " McCready said , " We all feel that we 're living in tumultuous , frightening times , and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism . And just bad political decisions being made . We feel that as Americans , and we 're frustrated . So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs . " Vedder also added that among all the dark themes " the hope was going to be in the guitar solos . It was the guitars and drums going at it that was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted . " The Iraq War is addressed in the songs " World Wide Suicide " , " Marker in the Sand " , and " Army Reserve " . The lyrics of " World Wide Suicide " depict anger against the war . Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ( " Severed Hand " ) , religion ( " Marker in the Sand " ) , poverty ( " Unemployable " ) , leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ( " Gone " ) , and loneliness ( " Come Back " ) . 
 Many of the songs are written from the point of view of a protagonist , which emerged from an early idea of turning the record into a concept album - as guitarist Stone Gossard explained , " we did consider using narration to thematically unify the album , but ultimately a less conceptual structure just felt right . " Vedder added that using characters in the tracks helped with the themes , as the stories could " transmit an emotion or a feeling or an observation of modern reality rather than editorializing , which we 've seen plenty of these days " . 
 Vedder added that many songs were inspired by the death of fellow musician Johnny Ramone , whom he described as " the best friend I ever had on the planet " . The lyrics of " Life Wasted " in particular were written after attending Ramone 's funeral . Vedder said that " Gone " is about a man " needing to find a new life without his past , without his possessions , and not really looking for more possessions . " Damien Echols , one of the three members of the West Memphis 3 , co @-@ wrote the lyrics to " Army Reserve " . For the first time McCready contributed lyrics to a Pearl Jam album , writing the lyrics to the closing track " Inside Job " . McCready said that he wrote the lyrics while touring in São Paulo as he " want [ ed ] this song to happen " despite Vedder not having done the lyrics yet , and added that the lyrical inspiration was the realization that " I had to go inside myself first before I could be open to outside ideas . " 
 = = Packaging and versions = = 
 The album 's cover art , photographed by Brad Klausen , depicts an avocado cut in half with the seed still in place . McCready said , " That symbolizes just kind of ... Ed 's at the end of the process and said , for all I care right now , we 've done such a good job on this record , and we 're kind of tired from it . Let 's throw an avocado on the cover . I think that 's what happened , and our art director goes , hey , that 's not a bad idea . I think we were watching the Super Bowl , and we had some guacamole or something . " Because the album is self @-@ titled , many fans refer to it as " Avocado " or " The Avocado Album . " The cover was named in Pitchfork Media 's top 25 worst album covers of 2006 . The liner notes art features footage from the " Life Wasted " music video , directed by artist Fernando Apodaca . The photographs involve the band members with their skin decaying and animals crawling in and out of it , as Apodaca felt the songs , " Life Wasted " in particular , fit " my interpretation of the how fragile life is " . The album was also issued on a double vinyl . 
 On the choice of a self @-@ titled album , Vedder explained , " In the end , we thought there was enough there with the title of the songs , so to put another title on the album would have seemed pretentious . So , really , it 's actually Nothing by Pearl Jam . " During the making of the album Vedder considered the title <unk> @-@ owned , a play on Soundgarden 's 1994 album , Superunknown . He explained , " We 're un @-@ owned . We want to remain un @-@ owned . " 
 Copies of the album were made available for pre @-@ order through Pearl Jam 's official website with different CD art and packaging than the retail version , and also a bonus disk featuring the band 's show on December 31 , 1992 at The Academy Theater in New York City . Pre @-@ order campaigns were also set with iTunes , <unk> and Best Buy , each retailer receiving an exclusive behind @-@ the @-@ scenes or rehearsal clip shot by photographer Danny Clinch .

 The album was released on May 2 , 2006 . The Sony BMG merger lead to some problems in the international distribution , something the band took into consideration during the release of the self @-@ published Backspacer three years later . While Pearl Jam is normally averse to press , to promote the album they performed the album songs on Sessions @ AOL , and went to various television shows , including Saturday Night Live and Late Show with David Letterman . Vedder said the exposition happened because " it seem [ ed ] like a critical time to participate in our democracy . " The band also decided to shoot their first conceptual music videos in eight years , " World Wide Suicide " and " Life Wasted " . 
 Three singles were released from Pearl Jam . The lead single " World Wide Suicide " was made available through online music stores ( backed with " Unemployable " ) , and also issued for free download on the band 's website . " World Wide Suicide " entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 41 , reached number two on the Mainstream Rock charts , and spent a total of three weeks at number one on the Modern Rock charts . Neither of the album 's other commercially released singles , " Life Wasted " and " Gone " , charted on the Hot 100 , but the former placed on both the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts , while the latter placed on the Modern Rock chart " Big Wave " was featured on the soundtrack to the 2007 Columbia Pictures movie , Surf 's Up .

 Pearl Jam promoted the album with a tour across North America , Europe , and Australia in 2006 . The tour originally had 69 concerts , which were then expanded with three gigs in Hawaii , one of them opening for U2 's Vertigo Tour in Honolulu . The first leg of the North American tour focused on the Northeastern United States , and then the band moved to the Midwest and the West Coast for the tour 's second leg . 
 Pearl Jam went on to tour Europe for its first time in six years . The band played a small secret show at the Astoria in London , and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006 , despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde . In an interview in advance of the band 's return to the festival circuit , Gossard commented , " It seems like an era to trust that we 're aware enough to get through those bigger shows . We have a heightened awareness of what needs to happen every night so people are as safe as they can possibly be . " Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other . He commented during the Leeds set that the band 's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with " guts " but with trust in the audience . On September 19 , 2006 , at the Torino , Italy show at <unk> , Pearl Jam played Pearl Jam in its entirety in order mid @-@ way through its set . After Europe , the band headed to Australia and then finished the year with two shows in Hawaii . The official bootlegs on this tour were available only in digital form , in both MP3 and lossless FLAC formats . The band 's shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre were released as part of the Live at the Gorge 05 / 06 box set . A DVD documenting the band 's shows in Italy entitled Immagine in <unk> was released in 2007 .

 According to Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 74 , based on 28 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews . " The album was named in Rolling Stone 's top 50 albums of the year at number 13 . Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave Pearl Jam four out of five stars , calling it the band 's best album in ten years . He said it 's " the most overtly partisan — and hopeful — record of their lives , " adding that it 's " as big and brash in fuzz and backbone as Led Zeppelin 's Presence . " Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars , saying that " Pearl Jam has embraced everything they do well , whether it 's their classicist hard rock or heart @-@ on @-@ sleeve humanitarianism . " Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B + , saying that Vedder 's " passionate howl seems more valuable now , pitted against the navel @-@ gazing emo whine that 's commandeered the landscape , " and he went on to say that " in a world full of boys sent to do a man 's job of rocking , Pearl Jam can still pull off gravitas . " Jon Pareles of The New York Times said , " Now as ever , Pearl Jam takes itself seriously . But it delivers that seriousness not with the sodden self @-@ importance of rock superstardom , but with the craft and hunger of a band still proving itself on the spot . " PopMatters writer Michael Metivier gave the album a 9 / 10 rating and viewed it as a progression in " melody and songcraft " over the band 's previous work , writing that it " more consistently achieves the grandeur , rage , and beauty they 've always pursued , throughout its entirety " . 
 Brian D. Schiller of Slant Magazine gave the album three and a half out of five stars . He stated that " the album is at best another good step toward their once great state and not a full return to it . What 's true , though , is that it 's the group 's best full album since Vitalogy . " Noel Murray of The A.V.

In the review he stated that Vedder " musters absolute conviction in writing and singing lyrics of male teenage angst . " Snow observed , " And though few of these 13 numbers have the drama of tracks by the Who or Led Zeppelin , from whom the band draw much of their style , Pearl Jam play like men on a mission . " David <unk> of Pitchfork Media called it the " most consistent effort the group 's released since its second album , " but he added that it " gets pretty boring pretty ... quick . "

 = Frank Klepacki = 
 Frank Klepacki ( born May 25 , 1974 ) is an American musician , video game music composer and sound director best known for his work on the Command & Conquer series . Having learned to play drums as a child , he joined Westwood Studios as a composer when he was only 17 years old . He has scored several games there , including the Lands of Lore series , Westwood Studios ' Dune games , The Legend of Kyrandia series , Blade Runner , and the Command & Conquer series . His work in Command & Conquer : Red Alert won two awards . 
 He lives in Las Vegas , where he has shaped a solo career and played and produced for several local bands . His personal and band work touches upon several genres , including orchestral , rock music , hip hop music , soul music , and funk . He has dubbed the style of music he writes as " Rocktronic " . His work has appeared in various media , including the Spike TV program The Ultimate Fighter . 
 Klepacki is currently the audio director of Petroglyph games , where he scored Star Wars : Empire at War . Klepacki was contacted to score Command & Conquer 3 : Tiberium Wars , but was too busy with Petroglyph to take the project , and declined to mention the offer . Klepacki composed three songs , including " Hell March 3 " , for Command & Conquer : Red Alert 3 by Electronic Arts Los Angeles . His solo CD entitled <unk> is packaged with a comic he helped produce . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Klepacki was raised by a family of musicians of Polish and Italian descent who played on the Las Vegas strip . He drew art as a hobby , but music prevailed in his early interests . He received his first <unk> at age 8 and began performing professionally by age 11 . Among his early influences were electronica and heavy metal groups , including Depeche Mode , Afrika Bambaataa , AC / DC , and Iron Maiden . Seeking to master guitar , bass , and keyboards , he formed local bands and created a demo tape of original material by age 17 . His impetus for diversifying his instrumental abilities was " not being able to communicate with other band members on ideas ... for original songs . " His first piece of audio gear was a <unk> 4 @-@ track cassette recorder , which he used to record demos , band practices , and live shows . 
 After learning to program BASIC on a Tandy 1000 and becoming interested in computer and video games , he applied for a job as a game tester at Westwood studios . He submitted his demo tape — described as " an acoustic guitar song with electric guitar leads and keyboard strings , and raining sound effects " — to the company 's audio director . The growing company enlisted him as a composer for the NES port of <unk> and the computer game Eye of the Beholder II . He later composed with MIDI sequencing for several other Dungeons & Dragons games . In 1992 , he helmed the audio of Dune II , attempting to complement the music of the original Dune . He later noted that he pushed the sequencing program on his Amiga to the limit while scoring the game . While working on Disney 's The Lion King in 1994 , he and the Westwood team were shown sketches of the unfinished feature film . Film composer Hans Zimmer later praised Klepacki for reworking his scores . After finishing the third entry into The Legend of Kyrandia series ; Book Three : Malcolm 's Revenge , Frank Klepacki met with Westwood leaders to discuss the upcoming game Command & Conquer — the first in a series which would bring him wider fame and critical acclaim . 
 = = = Command and Conquer series = = = 
 In 1994 , Klepacki met with Westwood Studios developers to discuss the soundtrack of the company 's next project — Command & Conquer . To define the game 's style , Klepacki listened to a number of bands , including Nine Inch Nails and Ministry , which would supply the iconic industrial style found in the majority of the songs . He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound . With the company 's recent shift to 22 kHz audio , Klepacki composed with an ASR @-@ 10 sampler , a Roland <unk> sampler , a Roland JD 990 synth module , and an electric guitar . The first few songs he composed for Command & Conquer contained voice samples — including the notable pieces Act on Instinct and No Mercy ( which featured wild declarations from Bill & Ted 's Bogus Journey ) . The samples were later found to interfere with the game 's spoken audio , and were replaced with versions lacking the voices , although the original versions ( and several other unused pieces ) can still be found on the DOS C & C and Covert Operations discs . Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game 's commercial soundtrack . He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career , using a quote from The Brain from Planet <unk> in the Yuri song <unk> , for example . Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for Command & Conquer , drawing influences from orchestral , house , heavy metal , and hip hop music . For the credits , Klepacki wrote Airstrike , featuring a hook later used in Command & Conquer : Tiberian Sun for the Global Defense Initiative . Conversely , the Brotherhood of Nod ending used the song <unk> Times written by Klepacki 's local band , I AM . Developers requested the song because it " reflected the war aspect and bad @-@ ass vibe of Nod 's side . " The C & C expansion pack The Covert Operations featured seven new ambient pieces , all of which were also included on the disc in high quality CD Audio format . Though the soundtrack was not released through retail , Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues . 
 While working on Covert Operations , Klepacki composed Hell March from the idea of " a rock tune to marching boots , " finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff . Upon listening , director Brett Sperry insisted this song be used as the signature theme of Command & Conquer : Red Alert . Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod , it features militaristic samples — including marching , industrial sounds , and a commander shouting orders . Klepacki initially scored Red Alert with sci @-@ fi camp in mind , but early songs were shelved . He switched gears to write gritty pieces , prompting the Red Alert team to expand upon the style of Command & Conquer . In preparing to compose , Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds . Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time . He first wrote heavy songs like Workmen and Crush , then composed neutral , synthesizer @-@ laden music , such as Vector and Roll Out . Klepacki scored <unk> and Mud , one of his personal favorites , before finishing with Militant Force and Radio 2 . He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by Kane and an Allied commander in the cut scenes of Red Alert . He previously appeared as a Nod soldier and the voice of the commando in Command & Conquer and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games . 
 After completing Red Alert , he took a short break to review his work . He concluded that some songs could be enhanced , but Red Alert had already gone gold , precluding new versions . These remixes later appeared on the unsuccessful Command & Conquer : Sole Survivor . Red Alert 's soundtrack was voted best video game soundtrack of 1996 by PC Gamer and <unk> magazines , defeating Trent Reznor 's score for Quake . Reviewers called it " fun to listen to " and " second to none . " As of 2005 , Red Alert was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for selling several million units , bringing Klepacki his widest audience . He wrote additional music for the game 's expansion packs , Counterstrike and Aftermath . He attributed the success of Red Alert to an infusion of modern styles not found in other games . Klepacki initially wrote off the popularity of his music , assuming that his music " must only appeal to die @-@ hards . " He considered it " very surreal " to realize his soundtracks had gained notoriety , and has since embraced his fans and critics . 
 = = = Later Westwood games = = = 
 In 1997 , Klepacki scored a Blade Runner adaptation . Though Westwood acquired the rights to use the original film score by Vangelis , the company was not allowed access to the original master recordings , and Klepacki had to recreate the themes by ear . Developers were satisfied by his attention to detail , feeling that his digital recreations sounded clearer than the originals . In 1998 , Klepacki composed for Dune 2000 . He attempted to update the music from Dune II into " this non @-@ blip stuff , " and worked in homages to the original style of the films as composed by Toto . Dune 2000 was panned by critics , though Klepacki 's score was praised for adhering to the traditional Dune style . Klepacki considered 2000 to be a more definitive work than Dune 2 , which was constrained by software and hardware limitations . He composed for Command & Conquer : Tiberian Sun with <unk> Mendelson — with whom he would later collaborate on Emperor : Battle for Dune . He began by writing Stomp , an energetic rock piece intended to recreate the effect of Hell March for the new game . Coincidentally , one of the trailers for Command and Conquer 3 featured ' Stomp ' as the soundtrack . Westwood instead wanted Tiberian Sun to feature darker , more moody music , and Stomp was shelved in favor of the current sound . Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction , Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate ; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best . Tiberian Sun ultimately featured dark , ambient techno music and ambient space music suited to the game 's post @-@ apocalyptic and futuristic setting . Klepacki cited the piece " Mad Rap " as his favorite . An avid Star Wars fan , he enjoyed scoring cut scenes featuring James Earl Jones , the voice of Darth Vader . The scenes also allowed him to integrate the Airstrike and No Mercy themes into the game 's score despite the aforementioned shift . With the expansion pack Firestorm , he attempted to " set things right " by writing more upbeat songs and including Stomp , which would also appear in Command & Conquer : Renegade . 
 He next scored Lands of Lore III and Command & Conquer : Red Alert 2 . Klepacki defined Red Alert 2 's style with heavy metal guitar and fast @-@ paced beats . Klepacki scored the game with a Korg TR Rack , Novation Nova desktop , and Roland XV @-@ 5080 . Red Alert 2 included a remix of " Hell March " . The return to high @-@ energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of Tiberian Sun . Klepacki maintained the energetic style in Red Alert 2 's expansion pack Yuri 's Revenge . For Command & Conquer : Renegade — the next entry in the series — Klepacki tried to update the style of the original Command & Conquer by making it " hipper and more elaborate . " Several Command & Conquer mainstays appear as reworked versions , including Target ( Mechanical Man ) , Industrial , Act on Instinct , and No Mercy . The main theme 's melody comes from C & C 80 's Mix , a piece composed for Covert Operations but scrapped before release . Klepacki 's last contribution to Westwood Studios was the music of Earth & Beyond , comprising four albums of material . Acquired by Electronic Arts in 1998 , Westwood was liquidated in 2002 and the remaining employees were relocated to EA Los Angeles . Several Westwood founders left the company . Though Klepacki offered to score Command & Conquer : Generals and submitted a demo to EA , he was not contacted to compose . When asked in 2002 whether he 'd continue scoring music after ten years in the business , he exclaimed , " ten down , next ten to go ! " After Westwood 's closure , he reflected on his past work at a dinner held by Joseph Kucan and other former employees .

 Klepacki took a brief hiatus to work on solo albums , then joined Petroglyph Games as full @-@ time audio director in 2004 . He prepared by becoming versed in the job 's requirements and demands . His first task was scoring Star Wars : Empire at War , Petroglyph 's launch title ; he also helped select voice actors . A die @-@ hard fan of the Star Wars franchise , Klepacki enjoyed complementing John Williams 's style as he worked with sound effects used in the feature films . He worked closely with programmers to ensure perfect aural functionality . Though most the game 's score is John Williams 's work , Klepacki estimates that he contributed 20 % original material . Apart from the main theme , he aimed to minimize his editing in order to retain the classic Star Wars sound . He chiefly composed for new areas of the Star Wars universe only found in Empire at War . He calls his work on the game " the peak of my career , " and felt he had spent his entire life grooming his abilities for that soundtrack . As a perk of composing , he visited Skywalker Ranch and Industrial Light and Magic , and took pride in having his name associated with an official Star Wars product . 
 For the Forces of Corruption expansion pack , he took greater creative liberty with the Star Wars feel by writing an original theme for the new criminal faction . In attempting to compose this piece , he wrote several preliminary hooks that were later integrated into the game 's battle themes . He composed six pieces for the expansion total , including the finale theme . In line with the criminal theme of the game , Klepacki borrowed motifs and recreated the mood from scenes involving Jabba the Hutt in Return of the Jedi . His score for the expansion pack was accepted upon first submission to Lucasarts . As Petroglyph 's audio director , he also selected sound effects — a tricky process due to the issue of making the criminal faction 's sounds a " little different , without straying too much from the original signature sounds . " Klepacki worked with LucasArts to select voice actors , and contributed his own talents to the role of IG @-@ 88 and other minor characters . A blooper reel of his voice acting was released on Petroglyph 's forums after the one @-@ thousandth member registered . Klepacki was contacted to score Command & Conquer 3 , but was too busy with duties at Petroglyph and declined to mention the offer publicly . Electronic Arts hired Steve Jablonsky to score the game ; an EA community manager at C & C 3 's forums suggested that the audio team studied Klepacki 's music and tried to recreate his style . Klepacki feels that Command & Conquer is a significant part of his life and that he would like to return to the Tiberian era . He conceded that employment at Petroglyph games would probably prevent him from working with Electronic Arts . 
 Klepacki 's next project was a game collaboration by SEGA and Petroglyph named Universe at War : Earth Assault . As of December 2006 , he had composed several songs for various factions and enjoyed the " opportunity to create something new again , not based on ... existing intellectual property . Klepacki " began by taking into account what songs were identified as fan favorites in ... past related work " . He was interviewed about the creative process on March 27 , 2007 by Kevin Yu , a Petroglyph community manager , and provided a detailed tour of his studio at the company . His office included one of the fastest computers at Petroglyph and a vocal booth where unit responses and other vocalizations were tested and tweaked before voice actors performed finishing work . Klepacki was glad that Universe of War did not demand strict obedience to a particular style . He declared that surprises were in store for Command & Conquer fans waiting for him to return to his " roots " and " adrenaline @-@ pumping soundtrack style " , and suggested that they " imagine my mindset ... when Command & Conquer first came out , and add about fifteen years experience to that . " Klepacki summarized the game 's main styles shortly before release : 
 For the Hierarchy — our evil alien race — I went with a more heavy @-@ metal rock influence , to go along with how they stomp all over everything on the map with their massive walker units . Novus — our high @-@ tech , hit @-@ and @-@ run faction — featured more industrial electronica to go along with their futuristic robotic feel . For our third faction , the Masari — our ancient star @-@ faring side — I provided an epic orchestral feel , with worldly influences to reflect their godlike nature and questionable links to our past . One Masari track in particular , " Divine Intervention , " would become the central theme to the whole game . 
 As audio director , Klepacki also created many sound effects for Universe at War . For the alien Hierarchy , he cultivated an " unnatural " aesthetic through an " arsenal of mangled noises " . Klepacki used a " combination of heavy cranes recorded with overdriven impacts " to give the faction 's walkers a " menacing machinelike breathing sound " , and made up his own language to record " various grunts , growls , mannerisms , and strange vocalizations . Since Hierarchy heroes needed to communicate to the player in English , Klepacki engineered dialogue to seem as if the aliens were " telepathically speaking to you , with a back @-@ masking effect on their voices ... as if the words are being channeled straight to your brain " . The Novus effects were usually phased and involved " mechanical movement , electricity , and metal sounds " . He invented yet another language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel , who occasionally speak to one another . Lastly , he drew on weather and other natural sounds for the Masari , describing their ambience as having " more weight , thunder , heavy bass rumblings , vortex gusts ... " Klepacki directed the voice @-@ acting to have a " noble and strong " feel without appearing typically medieval or overly dramatic . He ultimately felt he did the work of " three people " with Universe at War , as the game 's audio requirements changed constantly , requiring vigilance and programmer support . Divine Intervention was later nominated for a Game Audio Network Guild award , and the soundtrack was released as a free download after Petroglyph 's efforts toward a traditional release were frustrated . 
 Klepacki next composed three songs for Command & Conquer : Red Alert 3 , including Hell March 3 . Hell March 3 was recorded with the aid of a 4 @-@ piece rock band alongside the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and Choir at the Skywalker Sound scoring stage ; the choir also sang in Russian for an updated version of Grinder from Red Alert 2 . He remarked in 2008 that he would never grow tired of Hell March , and was thankful it had resonated with so many fans . Around this time , he composed using Cubase , Kontakt , a <unk> <unk> audio interface , and several instruments . Collaborating with Video Games Live , Klepacki performed Hell March and its Red Alert 2 version in Las Vegas in 2008 , and later performed Hell March 3 in the Netherlands with a choir and orchestra through the Games in Concert series ; he wore a Soviet army conscript uniform for the song . Klepacki expressed a desire in 2009 to score an Unreal Tournament series game and a " generation one @-@ style " Transformers game , as well as a blockbuster movie . 
 = = = Solo and band work = = = 
 Klepacki has also played in and produced albums for several Las Vegas bands . I AM 's There 's a Home is his first full @-@ length CD appearance . The band featured Greg Greer on vocals , Rod Arnett on bass , Dan Ryan on guitar , and Klepacki on drums . Formed from the rhythm section of local band <unk> , I AM released one album in 1995 and broke up . Described as alternative progressive rock , the band 's music drew influences from Tool and Soundgarden . The song <unk> Times was used for the Brotherhood of Nod ending in the original Command & Conquer . After the break @-@ up , Klepacki joined Home Cookin ' , a ten @-@ member ensemble which played funk and soul in the tradition of Tower of Power . Founded in 1989 , Home Cookin ' commercially debuted with Mmm , Mmm , Mmm , in 1997 ( which featured a number one hit ) and released a second album ( Pink in the Middle ) in 2000 before disbanding following a tour in California . Towards the end of its run , the band played at Quark 's Bar in Star Trek : The Experience and at the Boston Grill and Bar . The group sometimes opened shows with a four @-@ member funk act named <unk> . Home Cookin ' was popular by readers of Las Vegas Weekly , winning several awards over its history — including " Best Horns " in a band . Klepacki boasted that turnout for the band at clubs was usually above four hundred people . In 2003 , he formed The Bitters , a trio composed of Klepacki , bassist Vinny Moncada , and guitarist Jeff Murphy . With a style described as metal and jazz fusion , the group has released one album as of August 2006 . Klepacki is also member to the group Mo Friction , supported by former Home Cookin ' members . Their debut album will mark Klepacki 's first outing as a band 's lead vocalist . 
 Klepacki 's solo work debuted in 2002 with Morphscape . Production began in 1996 with the song <unk> , though an album was not planned at this time . The rest of Morphscape 's songs were composed after Red Alert 2 . Klepacki composed the album 's title track while working on Command & Conquer : Renegade , and feels the game 's style is visibly present in Morphscape . Klepacki released the final product after Westwood 's dissolution . His biggest inspiration in creating solo works is the legion of fans interested in Command & Conquer . Klepacki took a hiatus from composing video game music to write two other solo albums , the first of which is entitled Rocktronic . Released in 2004 , the album was described as dark , edgy , and heavy in a way that will appeal to Command & Conquer fans . Klepacki sought out specific samples and instruments used in the Command & Conquer soundtrack for use in the release ; the title " Rocktronic " was an attempt to name his style of music . Featuring live drumming in certain songs , the album is Klepacki 's best @-@ seller . Following Rocktronic was Virtual Control , released in 2005 . Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album . Tracks from each release have been periodically used in The Ultimate Fighter , along with certain custom themes written for the show . 
 On August 1 , 2006 , he revealed his next solo project would be named Awakening of Aggression and confirmed the music would be " heavy " and " hard @-@ hitting . " When interviewed , Klepacki said that he channeled stress into the heavy music of the new album . Aggression was released in October of the same year , and was made available on iTunes on December 7 . He filled the liner notes of the album with the names of several supportive fans who had purchased his music . As of April 2007 , he speculates that a new solo release will be ready by the end of the year . After establishing recognition on Ultimate Fighter , Klepacki began scoring themes for HDNet 's Inside the MMA and HDNet Fights in autumn 2007 . Around this time , he made it to the district finals of the Guitar Center " drum @-@ off " competition after winning two store challenges in Las Vegas but was eliminated . His solo album Infiltrator was released in April 2009 . According to Klepacki , the album was inspired by his recent work on the Red Alert series . Klepacki enjoys Las Vegas thanks to its diversity of musical talent and prolific number of shows and attractions . He attributes his showmanship to being raised in the city , noting that one has to " stand out " to be noticed among the entertainment atmosphere of Vegas . The city 's Las Vegas Weekly honored him as a " badass composer " in its mid @-@ April 2009 issue , highlighting his prolific fan @-@ base and work as producer for various local bands . 
 = = Work and beliefs = = 
 When composing for video games , Klepacki spends a few days to compose and master one song on average . He feels writing music for games is somewhat difficult as only early software builds are available to play ; he sometimes must compose songs based on vague descriptions . Composing for cut scenes is easier by comparison , and Klepacki enjoys drawing inspiration and direction from game design art . Nonetheless , he prefers to compose for a game throughout its development rather than write songs for a finished product . He feels that game music has been harder to compose than film or solo music as he must compose for all situations a player may discover or engineer . Klepacki maintains templates with a base of common instruments prepared for sudden bursts of inspiration , as he resents " having technical issues ... as an obstacle . " When asked how the composing process begins , Klepacki related : 
 It starts with knowing what I 'm composing for . Is it a battle theme , or main title , or ambient theme , etc . Then I figure out what type of mood or style best fits ... the subject matter . From there it 's about picking the right instrumentation and then the writing process starts . It could start with anything ; a guitar riff , a French horn melody , a drum rhythm or bass line . Then I keep alternating instruments track by track recording one part at a time until I have something that sounds full and gets the point across I 'm trying for . 
 Klepacki has said that the most rewarding part of composing video game music is working with a team — which he compares to chemistry between band members — and knowing he is part of a greater cause . He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games . He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores , preferably next to video games in electronic departments . He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies . He also noted in 2008 that " composition and engineering skills are now required , " advising upstart composers to ensure their work is film @-@ quality . Klepacki is happy to see older games offered on the Wii , hoping that gamers are " recognizing once again that simple , short fun experiences are just as good as ... long , huge @-@ production experiences . " Klepacki listed several influences for his style of composition : " John Williams naturally for my love of Star Wars and his style in general , Michael Kamen for his composing diversity , Metallica for sparking my metal influence , Vince <unk> who in my opinion is way under @-@ rated for his great work , Sly & The Family Stone for inspiring funk , syncopation , and positive energy , Larry Graham for inspiring me to play funk bass , Nine Inch Nails for their unique uses of mangled sound , and Rob Zombie for combining music with a theme and persona . " 
 Klepacki runs a personal website featuring a biography , archived interviews , and a playlist of songs streamed in 128 kbit / s mp3 . His music is also available from iTunes . As a Star Wars fan , he has extensively written about the film premieres of the last two prequels on his website . He maintains an account at YouTube and has posted three videos of his work with other bands . He is an ardent supporter of digital cinema , believing the medium to be the pinnacle of quality . He has scored two short films , and won a <unk> award for his work with <unk> Invasion . Klepacki believes that the genre of video game music is more respected than it has ever been . He notes that complex and quality music comes at a higher cost , prompting certain producers to simply " get somebody who could cop the Hollywood sound " instead of nurturing original style . When asked about his career low @-@ point , he named Order of the Griffon for the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 , citing difficulties with the system 's limited musical capabilities . Concerning his solo career and Westwood , Klepacki regrets " not having attended more of the fun company functions and parties while I was instead playing club gigs with bands with the mentality of trying to get signed or discovered . " When asked to reflect on his career , he replied : 
 The ironic thing is that my original goal in life was to be in a famous band , tour the world and sell millions of albums . Although that didn 't quite happen , I got something else just as gratifying . Instead of being in a famous band , I gained some fame in the industry as a game composer . Instead of touring the world , I receive fan mail from around the world . Instead of selling millions of albums , my music is on millions of games ! And I sell enough of my own albums that allows me to keep releasing them . So in a different way , I kind of got what I wanted after all . And I 'm more than happy with that . The most fulfilling part of it is that I feel I contributed something that mattered to a significant number of people , and more importantly , I got to be a part of projects that mattered a lot to my life personally , like Star Wars ! 
 Klepacki is not seeking a record deal , citing a " horrible chain of steps to getting famous . " <unk> critical of the recording industry , he blames MTV — described as a " teenage reality show channel " — for putting a pretty face on music and destroying the independent valuation of actual sound . Klepacki has declared pop music as having become the " largest farce in music history — soul @-@ less , mechanical , and only made for the sole purpose of making the fastest dollar possible , with more emphasis on imagery than the music . " He 's also criticized lip @-@ synching and the repackaging of music genre through different labels — such as Nu metal for rock music and Neo soul for soul music . He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits , and would rather keep his day job as audio director . These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band Home Cookin ' in 2000 — Klepacki said the group wanted to " work with a label , not for them . " Stating that he would not compromise his work for popularity , he believes that " the only artists that have any longevity are the ones that pioneer a movement — not follow one . " He enjoys working independently , as he does not have to " change ... music for the sake of pop radio . " He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found . Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio airplay — where one hears " the exact same songs 3 months at a time . " When interviewed about file @-@ sharing , he expressed mixed emotions . Holding that compact discs are " just too damn expensive " , Klepacki believes that a few dollars ' reduction in price would " deter people from downloading for free . " Conversely , he notes that artists — who " don 't get as much money as you think " — need to be compensated for their work . His favorite artists by decade , starting with the 1960s , are Sly and the Family Stone , Graham Central Station , Metallica , Home Cookin ' , and Bob Schneider .

 = HMS Agamemnon ( 1781 ) = 
 HMS Agamemnon was a 64 @-@ gun third @-@ rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy . She saw service in the American Revolutionary , French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars , and fought in many of the major naval battles of those conflicts . She is remembered as being Nelson 's favourite ship , and was named after the mythical ancient Greek king Agamemnon , being the first ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name . 
 The future Lord Nelson served as Agamemnon 's captain from January 1793 for 3 years and 3 months , during which time she saw considerable service in the Mediterranean . After Nelson 's departure , she was involved in the infamous 1797 mutinies at Spithead and the Nore , and in 1801 was present at the first Battle of Copenhagen , but ran aground before being able to enter the action . 
 Despite Nelson 's fondness for the ship , she was frequently in need of repair and refitting , and would likely have been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had war with France not recommenced . She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 , as part of Nelson 's weather column , where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four @-@ decker Santísima Trinidad . Agamemnon 's later career was served in South American waters off Brazil . 
 Her oft worn @-@ out and poor condition contributed to her being wrecked when in June 1809 she grounded on an uncharted shoal in the mouth of the River Plate , whilst seeking shelter with the rest of her squadron from a storm . All hands and most of the ship 's stores were saved , but the condition of the ship 's timbers made it impossible to free the ship ; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship 's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects . Recently , the wreck of Agamemnon has been located , and several artefacts have been recovered , including one of her cannons . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Agamemnon was ordered from the commercial shipbuilder Henry Adams at his <unk> Hard shipyard on the Beaulieu River on 5 February 1777 , to be built to the lines of the Ardent class , as designed by Sir Thomas Slade . Her keel was laid down in May . She was constructed using timber sourced from the surrounding New Forest . The total cost of her construction was £ 38 @,@ 303 15s 4d . She was commissioned on 28 March 1781 under Captain Benjamin Caldwell — a full 13 days before her launch on 10 April . 
 A painting of the launch of Agamemnon by Harold Wyllie depicts blue skies and scores of spectators , despite the Hampshire Chronicle describing the day as being windy with heavy rain , and with few spectators in attendance . 
 She was named after King Agamemnon , a prominent figure in ancient Greek mythology who participated in the Siege of Troy , and was the first Royal Navy vessel to bear the name . Lord Nelson regarded her as his favourite ship , and to her crew she was known by the affectionate nickname ' Eggs – and – Bacon ' . According to an article in The Gentleman 's Magazine , her crew renamed her as they did not like the classical names that were in vogue at the Admiralty during this period ( the crews of Bellerophon and Polyphemus also ' renamed ' their ships , to ' Billy Ruffian ' and ' Polly Infamous ' respectively , for the same reason ) . 
 = = American Revolutionary War = = 
 In November 1781 , the Admiralty had received intelligence that a large convoy was preparing to sail from Brest under Admiral de Guichen . The convoy was composed of transports carrying naval supplies for the West Indies and the French fleet in the East Indies . Agamemnon was part of Admiral Richard Kempenfelt 's squadron of 18 ships ( 11 of which mounted 64 or more guns ) , which he commanded from HMS Victory . Kempenfelt was ordered to intercept the convoy , which he did in the afternoon of 12 December in the Bay of Biscay , approximately 150 miles ( 241 @.@ 4 km ) south @-@ west of Ushant . With the French naval escort to leeward of the convoy , Kempenfelt attacked immediately , capturing 15 of the transports before nightfall . The rest of the convoy scattered , most returning to Brest ; only five transports reached the West Indies . 
 Early in 1782 , she sailed to the West Indies as part of Admiral Sir George Rodney 's squadron , with Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Samuel Hood as his second in command . On 9 April , the Battle of the Saintes began with an indecisive skirmish , in which the ships of the vanguard division , under Hood 's command , were badly damaged and forced to withdraw to make repairs . On 12 April , Agamemnon took part in the second action , which proved much more decisive . Over the course of the battle , Agamemnon had 2 lieutenants and 14 crewmen killed , and 22 others were wounded . 
 After the signing of the Treaties of Versailles brought an end to the American Revolutionary War , Agamemnon returned from the West Indies to Chatham , where she was paid off and docked on 29 October 1783 for repairs and to have her copper sheathing replaced . She came out of dock on 4 June 1784 , and was subsequently laid up in ordinary . 
 = = French Revolutionary War = = 
 = = = Under Nelson = = = 
 In anticipation of the start of Britain 's involvement in the French Revolutionary War after the execution of King Louis XVI , Agamemnon was recommissioned on 31 January 1793 . She was placed under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson , and after provisioning joined the fleet lying at anchor at the Nore . She subsequently sailed to join the Mediterranean fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Hood , which was blockading the French port of Toulon . On 27 August the town of Toulon declared its allegiance to the Royalist Bourbon cause , and Hood 's fleet moved in to take control of the naval dockyard and the 30 French ships of the line that were in the harbour . After capturing 19 of the ships , Agamemnon was sent to Naples to ask King Ferdinand IV for reinforcements with which to secure the town ; he agreed to provide 4 @,@ 000 men . When the revolutionary army , commanded by Napoleon Buonaparte , launched its assault against Toulon , the troops proved insufficient to hold it , and they were forced to abandon the town . 
 In April and May 1794 , seamen from Agamemnon , led by Nelson , helped capture the Corsican town of Bastia . The French surrendered on 21 May , after a 40 @-@ day siege . After this action , Agamemnon was forced to sail to Gibraltar to undergo urgent repairs , the ship having become very worn out after just 16 months at sea , despite having undergone a fairly extensive refit just prior to being recommissioned . Upon completion of her repairs , Agamemnon returned to Corsica , anchoring south of Calvi on 18 June . After Hood arrived with additional ships , Agamemnon contributed guns and men to the 51 @-@ day siege of Calvi , during which time Nelson lost the sight in his right eye when a French shot kicked sand and grit into his face . The town surrendered on 10 August , Agamemnon having lost six men in the engagement . Shortly thereafter the inhabitants of Corsica declared themselves to be subjects of His Majesty King George III . 
 Agamemnon , still with the Mediterranean fleet — now under Vice @-@ Admiral William Hotham , who had superseded Hood in December 1794 — participated in the Battle of Genoa when a French fleet , comprising 15 ships of the line , was sighted on 10 March 1795 . Three days later , the French having shown no signs that they were willing to give battle , Admiral Hotham ordered a general chase . The French ship Ça Ira lost her fore and main topmasts when she ran into one of the other ships of the French fleet , Victoire , allowing HMS Inconstant to catch up with and engage her . Agamemnon and Captain came up to assist soon after , and continued firing into the 80 @-@ gun French ship until the arrival of more French ships led to Admiral Hotham signalling for the British ships to retreat . Ça Ira was captured the following day , along with Censeur , which was towing her , by Captain and Bedford . 
 On 7 July 1795 , whilst in company with a small squadron of frigates , Agamemnon was chased by a French fleet of 22 ships of the line and 6 frigates . Due to adverse winds , Admiral Hotham was unable to come to her aid until the following day , and the French fleet was sighted again on 13 July , off the Hyères Islands . Hotham signalled for his 23 ships of the line to give chase , and in the ensuing Battle of the Hyères Islands , Agamemnon was one of the few Royal Navy ships to engage the enemy fleet . The French ship Alcide struck her colours during the battle , only to catch fire and sink . Many of the other French ships were in a similar condition ; Agamemnon and Cumberland were manoeuvring to attack a French 80 @-@ gun ship when Admiral Hotham signalled his fleet to retreat , allowing the French to escape into the Gulf of Fréjus . Admiral Hotham was later greatly criticised for calling off the battle , and was relieved as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief in the Mediterranean by Admiral Sir John Jervis at the end of the year . 
 Nelson was promoted to Commodore on 11 March . Shortly thereafter , in the action of 31 May 1796 , boats from Agamemnon and Nelson 's squadron captured a small convoy of French vessels off the Franco @-@ Italian coast , while suffering minimal casualties . 
 On 10 June 1796 Nelson transferred his pennant to HMS Captain , Captain John Samuel Smith replacing him as Agamemnon 's commander . Having been deemed in great need of repair , Agamemnon then returned to England . 
 = = = Mutiny and the Baltic = = = 
 In May 1797 , whilst under the command of Captain Robert Fancourt , Agamemnon was involved in the Nore mutiny . On 29 May , the North Sea squadron lying in the Yarmouth Roads was ordered to sea . Only three ships , Adamant , Agamemnon and Glatton , obeyed the signal , but Agamemnon 's crew later mutinied , and sailed the ship back to Yarmouth Roads . The ship was then taken to join the main mutiny at the Nore anchorage , along with Ardent , Isis and Leopard , arriving on 7 June . After a blockade of London was formed by the mutineers , several ships began to desert the wider mutiny , in many cases being fired upon by the remaining ships . Order was eventually restored aboard Agamemnon when the loyal seamen and marines forcibly ejected the hard @-@ line mutineers from the ship . Captain Fancourt was able to secure a pardon for the remaining ship 's company . 
 On 18 March 1800 , Agamemnon was damaged when she ran onto the <unk> Rocks . She came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800 . On her way to port she had encountered Childers , which assisted her and accompanied her into port . With the assistance of the crews from two sloops , the guardship Chatham , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps , the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further . Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs . Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at the pumps once more , and when she was off Penlee Point , Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance . When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking . 
 In response to developments in the Baltic in 1801 that threatened to deprive Britain of much @-@ needed naval supplies , Agamemnon was sent as part of a fleet under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker and Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Nelson to attack the Danish at Copenhagen . On 2 April , Agamemnon was part of Nelson 's division that fought the Battle of Copenhagen . Agamemnon was positioned second in the line after HMS Edgar , and after passing down the Outer Channel , she grounded whilst attempting to round the southern tip of the Middle Ground shoal . While the battle raged around her Agamemnon , along with Bellona and Russell , both of which had also run aground , flew signals of distress . The three stranded ships were eventually pulled off the Middle Ground in the night of 3 April . 
 After the Treaty of Amiens concluded the Revolutionary War , Agamemnon was laid up at Chatham in 1802 . 
 = = Napoleonic Wars = = 
 Agamemnon 's general condition in 1802 was so poor that , had hostilities with France not recommenced , she would likely have been hulked or broken up . Instead , after Britain 's entry into the Napoleonic Wars , she was brought out of ordinary in 1804 , recommissioned under Captain John Harvey on 31 July , and went to join the Channel fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis . 
 Agamemnon was part of Vice @-@ Admiral Robert Calder 's fleet cruising off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805 , when the combined Franco @-@ Spanish fleet from the West Indies was sighted to windward . The British ships formed into line of battle , with Agamemnon fifth in the line , and engaged Admiral Villeneuve 's fleet in hazy conditions with light winds . Agamemnon had three men wounded in the Battle of Cape Finisterre , and lost her mizzen topmast and the foresail yard . By nightfall , Calder 's fleet had become scattered , and he signalled for the action to be discontinued .

 On 17 September 1805 , after completing a small refit of his ship in Portsmouth , Captain Harvey was superseded in command of Agamemnon by Captain Sir Edward Berry , who had previously commanded Nelson 's flagship , HMS Vanguard , at the Battle of the Nile . On 3 October she departed Spithead to join Vice @-@ Admiral Nelson 's fleet blockading Villeneuve 's combined fleet in Cádiz . En route , Agamemnon fell in with a French squadron , consisting of six ships of the line and several smaller vessels , which gave chase . Succeeding in evading the French , Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron on 13 October , and when Nelson laid eyes on the approaching ship he reportedly exclaimed : " Here comes that damned fool Berry ! Now we shall have a battle ! " In misty conditions on 20 October , Agamemnon captured a large American merchant brig , which she then took in tow . Not long after , HMS Euryalus signalled to Agamemnon that she was sailing straight towards an enemy fleet of 30 ships — Villeneuve 's fleet had left port . 
 On 21 October 1805 Agamemnon fought in the Battle of Trafalgar . Agamemnon was positioned eighth in Nelson 's weather column , with Orion ahead and Minotaur astern . Once engaged , she was firing both batteries , eventually pounding the great Spanish four @-@ decker Santísima Trinidad until that ship was dismasted and , with 216 of her complement dead , struck her colours . Before Berry could take possession of the prize , the enemy van division began bearing down on the British line , having previously been cut off from the battle by Nelson 's line @-@ breaking tactics . With Nelson already dying below decks on Victory , Captain of the Fleet Thomas Hardy ordered Agamemnon and several other ships to intercept them . Three of the enemy ships broke off and ran for Cádiz ; after briefly engaging Intrépide the British ships moved to try to cut off the fleeing ships . Over the course of the battle , Agamemnon suffered just two fatalities , and eight men were wounded . 
 Following the battle , Agamemnon , despite taking on three feet of water in her hold each hour , took Colossus under tow to Gibraltar . After carrying out repairs , the ship rejoined Vice @-@ Admiral Collingwood 's squadron , which had resumed the blockade of Cádiz .

 At the beginning of 1806 , Agamemnon was with Vice @-@ Admiral Duckworth 's squadron in the West Indies , pursuing a French fleet carrying troops to Santo Domingo . On 6 February 1806 , the two squadrons clashed in the Battle of San Domingo ; Agamemnon assisted Duckworth 's flagship Superb in driving the French Vice @-@ Admiral Leissègues ' flagship Impérial onto the shore where she was wrecked . In October , Agamemnon escorted a convoy on her return to Britain . 
 In 1807 Agamemnon was part of Admiral James Gambier 's fleet sent to take control of the Danish fleet before it could fall into French hands . She participated in the second Battle of Copenhagen , and as in the first in 1801 , ran aground . After she had come free , Agamemnon landed guns and shot in <unk> Bay to form part of a battery being established there to command the city . Firing commenced on 2 September , and lasted until the Danes surrendered on 7 September . In November , Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron off Lisbon .

 In February 1808 , Agamemnon sailed with Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Sidney Smith 's flagship Foudroyant to Brazil , where they joined another squadron . At Rio de Janeiro it was discovered that Agamemnon was again quite worn out , with seams in her planking opening and some of her framing bolts broken . In October , Agamemnon and Monarch anchored in Maldonado Bay , in the mouth of the River Plate . They had been escorting the merchant vessel Maria , which had carried the surgeon Dr. James Paroissien to Montevideo where he was tasked with exposing a plot against King John VI of Portugal , who was in exile in Brazil . Whilst there , Monarch ran aground , requiring Agamemnon 's assistance to get her off . After learning that Paroissien had been imprisoned , the two ships put to sea , but were forced to return to Maldonado Bay when they encountered bad weather . After the ships returned to Rio in January 1809 , the ship was fully surveyed by the carpenter , who drew up an extensive list of her defects . 
 On 16 June 1809 Agamemnon , along with the rest of the squadron ( which was now under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Michael de Courcy ) , put in to Maldonado Bay for the third and final time , to shelter from a storm . While working her way between Gorriti Island and the shore , Agamemnon struck an uncharted shoal . Captain Jonas Rose attempted to use the ship 's boats , together with the stream and kedge anchors , to pull the ship off , but to no avail . The ship had dropped anchor on the shoal just previously , and it was discovered that she had run onto it when she grounded , the anchor having pierced the hull . On 17 June , with the ship listing heavily to starboard , Agamemnon 's stores and all her crew were taken off by boats from other vessels in the squadron , and the following day Captain Rose and his officers left the ship . 
 The court @-@ martial for the loss of Agamemnon was held at Rio de Janeiro on 22 July 1809 , aboard HMS Bedford . It was found that the ship might have been saved if she had not been in such poor general condition , and Captain Rose was honourably acquitted .

 The historical novelist Patrick O 'Brian selected Agamemnon as one of the ships on which Jack Aubrey served as lieutenant , before the events of Master and Commander , the first novel in his Aubrey – Maturin series . Agamemnon has also been the subject of at least two paintings by the British artist Geoff Hunt , currently the president of the Royal Society of Marine Artists . 
 To mark the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar , in 2005 the Woodland Trust planted 33 woods named after Royal Navy ships that fought in the battle : one each for the 27 ships of the line , and six others for the frigates and smaller support craft . Agamemnon wood was planted in November 2005 on the Beaulieu Estate in Hampshire , near Agamemnon 's birthplace , Buckler 's Hard . 
 After the wreck of Agamemnon in 1809 , the name was reused by the Royal Navy for three other ships : the 91 @-@ gun second @-@ rate steam ship of the line Agamemnon of 1852 , the Ajax @-@ class ironclad Agamemnon in 1879 , and the Lord Nelson @-@ class battleship Agamemnon of 1906 . 
 The Royal Navy will again be adopting the name ' Agamemnon ' for one of their Astute Class Nuclear Submarines , currently under construction in the UK .

 = The Combat : Woman Pleading for the Vanquished = 
 The Combat : Woman Pleading for the Vanquished is a large oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty , first exhibited in 1825 and now in the National Gallery of Scotland . Inspired by the Elgin Marbles and intended by the artist to provide a moral lesson on " the beauty of mercy " , it shows a near @-@ nude warrior whose sword has broken , forced to his knees in front of another near @-@ nude soldier who prepares to inflict a killing blow . A woman , also near @-@ nude , clutches the victorious warrior to beg him for mercy . Very unusually for a history painting of the period , The Combat does not depict a scene from history , literature or religion and is not based on an existing artwork , but is instead a scene from the artist 's own imagination . 
 When it was shown at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1825 , it attracted near @-@ universal praise from critics for its technical excellence , its fusion of the styles of different schools of painting , and its subject matter . Nevertheless , it failed to find a buyer at the Summer Exhibition , and was instead bought by fellow artist John Martin . The painting proved too large for Martin 's house , and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy . It was transferred in 1910 to the National Gallery of Scotland , where it remains . 
 = = Background = = 
 William Etty was born in 1787 , the son of a York baker and miller . He began as an apprentice printer in Hull . On completing his seven @-@ year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London " with a few pieces of chalk crayons " , with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters . Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens , he submitted paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution , all of which were either rejected or received scant attention when exhibited . 
 In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty 's works , The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia ( also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra ) . The painting was extremely well received , and many of Etty 's fellow artists greatly admired him . Following the praise for Cleopatra , Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical , literary and mythological settings , most notably A Sketch from One of Gray 's Odes ( Youth on the Prow ) in 1822 , and the controversial Pandora Crowned by the Seasons in 1824 . Etty had travelled extensively in Italy in 1823 , and painted Pandora hastily on his return as a " testimonial of recent progress " he had made while studying paintings in Italian collections . Critical opinion of Pandora was highly divided , with some critics greatly praising it as a technical accomplishment , while others saw it as a rushed pastiche of Titian and Rubens . Pandora Crowned by the Seasons sold for 300 guineas ( about £ 25 @,@ 000 in 2016 terms ) , and secured Etty the position of Associate at the Royal Academy of Arts . 
 While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections , the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice . Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude , and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century . Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent , although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Etty was fascinated with classical artworks such as those he had seen during his recent travels in Italy , and in particular with the Elgin Marbles , a set of major Ancient Greek sculptures taken to London in controversial circumstances in the early 19th century . 
 The Combat : Woman Pleading for the Vanquished is a large painting , 399 cm ( 13 ft 1 in ) across . It depicts a defeated soldier , kneeling in front of another soldier . The defeated fighter strains to free himself from the grip of the victorious warrior , who stands , raising a sword . A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier , raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe . The defeated warrior has a stronger body , a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time , and a more sympathetic expression , while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness . The vanquished soldier 's sword has broken , and lies beside him on the ground . 
 Etty did not base The Combat on any single incident from history or literature , or on any existing artwork , but on his own imagination ; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings , which generally depicted themes from literature or religion . He had been considering the topic as early as 1821 , and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy . During this visit Etty had met Antonio Canova and been very impressed by him ; The Combat is clearly influenced by his work . As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture , he was also strongly influenced by the composition of Old Master works he had seen while in Italy . As with many of Etty 's works , the models posed for him separately in his studio , rather than as a group . 
 Etty , writing in 1849 , described the purpose of The Combat as " to paint a great moral on the heart [ of ] the beauty of mercy . " Etty 's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr points out similarities in the composition of The Combat and John Flaxman 's drawing Heracles Killing a Man to whom a Woman Clings , but while Etty and Flaxman were contemporaries at the Royal Academy , it is not known if Etty was aware of this drawing . 
 In the initial oil study for the defeated warrior ( York Art Gallery ) , Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version . In this preliminary sketch he is not on his knees , but thrusts his leg out to brace himself . He has an expression of defiance and determination , rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work . 
 The completed The Combat : Woman Pleading for the Vanquished was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1825 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 On its exhibition , The Combat was generally highly praised by critics for its technical excellence , its combination of the Venetian and English styles of painting , and as an indication that Etty was moving away from nudity and towards history painting . The European Magazine , and London Review commented that " in colour this picture strongly reminds us of the great heroes of the Venetian school , while in learned intelligence of form , and energy of action , it greatly surpasses them " , observing that " we should not have the least objection to seeing this picture placed in one of the very first galleries , by the side of Titian and Paul Veronese . " 
 In similar vein , The Lady 's Magazine felt that The Combat " strongly demonstrates the progress of [ Etty ] to excellence " , remarking that " never was a groupe more calculated to display the action in which the power of conquest is so eminently and fearfully delineated " and that " we have little doubt that the works of Titian were , on their first appearance ... what this piece is now . " The same correspondent did find some flaws in the overly pronounced muscles of the victor 's thigh and the lack of definition of muscle in the legs of the defeated man , but felt that despite this The Combat was " one of the finest and most masterly works that ever graced the walls of the Royal Academy . " 
 The London Magazine was similarly effusive about the painting , admiring Etty 's ability to fuse his own imagination with themes derived from the Elgin Marbles and from the Venetian Old Masters , and commenting that " it is always gratifying to those who feel for the honour and independence of painting when , as in the present instance , an artist successfully relies on nature and the resources of his own mind for his subject , and on the appreciation of collegial minds for his mode of treating it . " The Times , a newspaper which had previously condemned Etty as " offensive and indecent " , felt that " though defective in some respects " The Combat was " a masterly effort " that successfully fused " the florid beauties of the Venetian school " with the " sober dignity and power of the Roman school " and that compared with his previous paintings , which were " too uniformly feeble in character and meretricious in effect to entitle them to any very decided praise " , the painting proved Etty " capable of maintaining a much higher station in art than we had been led to expect . " 
 An anonymous reviewer in the first issue of the short @-@ lived The Parthenon magazine admired The Combat greatly , in particular the right foot of the female figure : 
 [ Etty is ] an artist who has hitherto appeared before the public only in a few small easel @-@ pictures , striking indeed from their arrangement , and their approach towards the Venetian system of colour , but destitute of any particular interest . He has now come forward in a new character — as a painter in the great style of epic composition ; and if his future efforts do but equal the expectations raised by his first essay , we shall have reasons to rejoice at the change . His ideal group of " The Combat " , in the present exhibition at the Royal Academy , is particularly striking , from its uncommon combination of beauties , without possessing any very extraordinary merit in any single quality , taken separately . Its style of colouring , perhaps , forms its most distinguishing feature ; and in this respect the artist has still adhered closely to the system pursued by the Venetian school . The arrangement of his colours is admirably successful , and we could instance individual passages of extraordinary beauty . Of these , none is more eminently deserving than the right foot of the female , which seems actually to glow with the rich juice of life . Generally speaking , the extremities are well understood , and carefully executed , and the composition of the figures is in the most masterly style . 
 The foot in question was not universally admired by critics ; the anonymous correspondent for The London Magazine , who was otherwise effusive in his praise for The Combat , felt that said foot " looks too much as if painted from a modern foot accustomed to compression in a shoe , for the heroic character and classical air of the rest of the work " and that her leg appeared too short . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition , The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas ( about £ 22 @,@ 000 in 2016 terms ) , following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete . The painting was too large for Martin 's house , and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy . It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains . One of Etty 's major works , it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857 , before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century . 
 Throughout his life , The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty 's most powerful paintings . In 1845 , Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm ( 35 by 46 in ) copy of The Combat , which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist , and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo . The engraving was published three years later , and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years , before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934 . A number of sketches attributed to Etty , under the name of A Study for Mercy <unk> for the Vanquished , are also in circulation . 
 After the success of The Combat , Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity ; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s ( including Cleopatra , Pandora and The Combat ) all but one contained a nude figure . He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828 , at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist . The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty , and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career ; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career . As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women . 
 The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow , and Pleasure at the Helm , a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures , met a hostile reception from critics . From then on , while Etty continued to paint nude figures for the rest of his career , he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work . This effort was not wholly successful , and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career . He died in late 1849 , and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain .

 Comverse Technology , Inc . , originally founded in Israel , was a technology company located in Woodbury , New York in the United States , that developed and marketed telecommunications software . The company focused on providing value @-@ added services to telecommunication service providers , in particular to mobile network operators . Comverse Technology had several wholly or partly owned subsidiaries . The name " Comverse " is a fusion of the words " communication " and " versatility " . 
 Founded in 1982 , the company went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1986 . Led by co @-@ founder and CEO Jacob " Kobi " Alexander , the company originally specialized in centralized hardware / software systems for voice and fax messaging and sold them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises . Much of its funding came from Israeli government subsidies and tax credits provided to research and development for hi @-@ tech firms . By the mid @-@ 1990s , one of its most successful products allowed legal authorities and intelligence agencies to record and store data collected from intercepted communications . Starting in the late 1990s , Comverse 's voice messaging software became its main product and the company grew rapidly with the surge in mobile phone use , passing the $ 1 billion mark in revenues . It established a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market and sold a popular short message service center ( SMSC ) product . While headquartered in the US , most of the company 's research and development was done in Israel ; Comverse became one of the more visible success stories in Israel 's hi @-@ tech industry . It was one of Israel 's largest employers of software engineers , was closely followed in the nation 's business press , and was the first Israeli @-@ associated company to join the S & P 500 index . 
 In 2006 , Comverse was involved in an options backdating scandal . Alexander and two other top executives were charged in the US with multiple counts of conspiracy , fraud , money laundering and making false filings . Alexander fled the country to Namibia where he engaged in a prolonged fight against extradition . The scandal proved difficult for Comverse Technology to recover from ; the company was delisted from Nasdaq , removed from the S & P 500 , and spent the next several years consumed by the costly need to restate its financial reports for several years . Additionally affected by the financial crisis of 2008 and on and changes in the mobile phone market , the company underwent several rounds of large @-@ scale layoffs and sold off parts of its business . By 2011 the company began a turnaround . 
 During 2012 and 2013 , Comverse Technology divested itself of all its holdings and ceased to exist ; the two independent companies that carry on its most well @-@ known product lines are <unk> and Verint Systems .

Comverse 's solutions support flexible deployment models , including in @-@ network , hosted and managed services , and can run on circuit @-@ switched , IP , IMS , and converged network environments . Comverse 's customer base spans more than 130 countries and covers over 500 communication service providers serving more than two billion subscribers . It typically provided some 70 percent of Comverse Technology 's overall revenue . Comverse has 100 local offices in 40 countries , with its corporate headquarters located in Wakefield , Massachusetts , in the US . 
 Verint Systems ( which , from 1999 to 2002 , was known as Comverse Infosys ) is a provider of solutions for analysis of intercepted communications , digital video @-@ focused security and surveillance , and analytics and business intelligence for the enterprise . Their products are aimed to enable government and enterprises to make sense of the vast information they collect to meet performance and security goals . Verint solutions are used by more than 10 @,@ 000 organizations in 150 countries . Verint is headquartered in Melville , New York , with offices worldwide and 2500 employees around the globe . By 2011 , Verint was 52 percent owned by Comverse Technology . 
 Ulticom provides signaling solutions for wireless , wireline , and Internet communications . Ulticom 's products are used by telecommunication equipment and service providers worldwide to deploy mobility , location , payment , switching , and messaging services . Ulticom is headquartered in Mount Laurel , New Jersey , with additional offices in the United States , Europe , and Asia . Comverse acquired Ulticom in 1996 and sold it in 2010 . 
 <unk> sells integrated voice , data and networking solutions for use in call centers worldwide . It was originally an independent company that was acquired by Comverse Technology in 1992 . 
 <unk> provides roaming services for mobile network operators . The <unk> portfolio includes international roaming services and core network solutions across various technologies , including intelligent networks and next @-@ generation networks . It was fully owned by Comverse Technology until being sold to Fortissimo Capital in 2012 for $ 54 million . 
 <unk> was a venture capital operation , created as a subsidiary in partnership with Soros Fund Management , that invested in start @-@ up companies directly and was active in the late 1990s and early 2000s . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The company 's origins date to 1982 ( or 1983 , sources differ ) , when three Israelis , aspiring investment banker Jacob " Kobi " Alexander of Shearson Loeb Rhoades , engineer Boaz <unk> , and Alexander brother @-@ in @-@ law and Columbia University computer science professor <unk> <unk> , got together and founded an Israeli start @-@ up company , Efrat Future Technologies Ltd . In a meeting in New York , <unk> had the idea of building a business around centralized hardware systems to support voice and fax messaging and selling them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises , who could then resell the voice and fax services to their customers . The three quickly returned to Israel and started the company , with the goal of securing Israeli government grants to fund the research and development work . 
 The early years of the company were difficult ; in 1984 , they founded Comverse in the United States , which became the parent company of Efrat . The name " Comverse " was chosen as a fusion of the words " communication " and " versatility " . 
 In 1986 Comverse went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market with a $ 20 million valuation ; the company used the money so gained as its final round of funding . The three founders had trouble working with each other , and <unk> divorced Alexander 's sister ; in 1987 , Alexander was left with sole control of the company after the other two pulled out . The company was a penny stock on the edge of collapse . 
 = = = Early successes = = = 
 Under his lead , Alexander was credited with turning around Comverse 's fortunes . In 1989 , the <unk> Group made a $ 6 million direct investment in the company . In 1990 , Comverse won a potentially $ 10 million contract , its largest yet , to deliver computers running voicemail and fax applications on West German cellular networks , beating out far larger corporations in the process . Deutsche Telekom became one of the company 's biggest early customers . By 1991 , the company had annual sales of $ 17 million and was selling a combined voice and fax mailbox system . Many of its early successes came from avoiding the huge telecommunications companies in the U.S. and instead focusing on selling to small- and medium @-@ sized companies in the wireless market in Europe . The company also sought a variety of other markets , including developing countries such as Mexico and China for its <unk> virtual telephone service . Gradually its product emphasis shifted more from hardware to software . 
 While headquartered in the U.S. , nearly all its manufacturing was done in Israel , where it was able to substantially benefit from government subsidies and tax credits provided to research and development for hi @-@ tech firms and industries by the Office of the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Trade and Industry and by the Israel @-@ U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation . Many other Israeli companies were built by the same model , including another top software company , Mercury Interactive . During the 1990s , Comverse received at least 69 research and development grants from the OCS program . 
 In 1993 , the company reported a 341 percent rise in profits on revenues in the $ 64 million range and was named a " Company to Watch " by Fortune magazine . However its stock plunged for a while in 1994 after a disappointing earnings report . 
 By 1995 , Comverse was best known for its <unk> product , which was sold to overseas clients and allowed legal authorities and intelligence agencies to record and store data collected from wiretaps . Half the company 's revenues at that point were from <unk> , and market analysts were recommending Comverse 's stock . 
 = = = Growth with wireless = = = 
 Comverse became a market leader in voice messaging software and boomed during the late 1990s with the surge in mobile phone use . Much of its market focus was on wireless operators and overseas companies , and it gained a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market . The growth coincided with SMS text messages becoming popular ; the first big application for SMS was as a notification mechanism to tell a wireless subscriber that voicemail were stored in a voicemail box . Comverse expanded this application into a full @-@ blown short message service center ( SMSC ) , which receives , buffers , processes , and dispatches all SMS messages throughout a mobile network . Comverse branded and <unk> this as the Intelligent Short Message Service Center , or ISMSC . Typical of <unk> software , it ran on Unix @-@ based platforms , such as <unk> and later Linux . Comverse 's ISMSC found success as a lower @-@ price solution for lower @-@ traffic networks , where it competed with Logica 's <unk> solution . Other companies in the SMSC space included CMG and <unk> . ISMSC found considerable market penetration , exemplified by all six of Hong Kong 's wireless carriers using it . 
 Comverse also became a participant in forming international wireless standards , such as in 2001 for the Speech Application Language Tags ( SALT ) markup language for XML to add voice capabilities to web @-@ based applications . Additional industry standards groups in which Comverse has been active include the Open Mobile Alliance and TM Forum . 
 In addition to growing organically , Comverse Technology began acquiring other companies in both Israel and the U.S. It acquired Dale , <unk> , McWilliams , & Sheridan , later known as DGM & S Telecom , in 1996 and renamed it Ulticom in 1999 . Comverse Technology acquired one of its key rivals , Boston Technology , for $ 843 million in stock in 1997 . The acquisition gave Comverse entree into the large U.S. telecommunications market and meant Comverse would be supplying voice messaging systems to 12 of the world 's top 20 carriers , and left it the third @-@ largest supplier after Lucent and Northern Telecom . In 1999 , as it saw record earnings , Comverse formed two wholly owned subsidiaries , Comverse Network Systems and Comverse Infosys , representing the telecommunications services platforms and products and the digital monitoring and recording products , respectively . By 2000 , its revenues were $ 1 @.@ 2 billion and it had global operations . It continued to aggressively acquire small companies to fill out its technologies , as exemplified by the purchase of <unk> , Gaya Software , and <unk> , all within a 30 @-@ day period in 2000 . The company 's stock price rose from around $ 10 in late 1998 to over $ 120 in early 2001 . The company was able to raise money several times on Nasdaq , including once for its Ulticom subsidiary and once ( at a valuation of $ 600 million ) shortly before the Dot @-@ com bubble burst . 
 Comverse was one of the most prominent and profitable success stories in Israel 's hi @-@ tech industry , with both Haaretz and The Jerusalem Post referring to it as a flagship of that industry . As CEO , Alexander was sought out for meetings in Tel Aviv by world leaders such as Chinese President Jiang Zemin . He became known , as Bloomberg News later stated , as " the wizard of Israel 's technology boom " ; his oft @-@ stated goal was for Comverse to do for Israel what Nokia had done for Finland . Comverse was one of the largest employers of software engineers in Israel and its stock was widely held among the Israeli investing public ; as a consequence , the successes and failures of Comverse were always followed closely in the country 's financial press . ( <unk> and Mercury Interactive were two other prominent Israeli companies in the enterprise software sector that were also closely followed . ) 
 The company was also quintessentially Israeli in how it was run , with Comverse CEO Ze 'ev Bregman in particular favoring a loose , relaxed system in which he knew all the employees and lines of management reporting were frequently bypassed . When Comverse Technology joined the S & P 500 index in 1999 , it was the first Israeli @-@ associated company ever to do so . It set the same mark when it joined the NASDAQ @-@ 100 index . 
 The early 2000s recession led to some struggles for Comverse Technology , with the global economic downturn leading to publicly announced profit warnings and a plunge in the stock price in July 2001 . Over 3 @,@ 000 jobs were cut during the period as part of several restructuring efforts . The company still made some acquisitions , such as buying the instant messaging specialist <unk> for $ 20 million in 2002 , after having previously purchased a 12 percent stake in it in 2001 . The image of Comverse Technology as Israel 's blue @-@ chip hi @-@ tech stock suffered , and led to a slide in several other large Israeli technology firms . Comverse 's management was criticized by analysts for having issued over @-@ optimistic forecasts , although many other Israeli firms in the industry did even worse or failed completely during this period . In addition , the European market for mobile voicemail management was already saturated by 2002 and the prepaid wireless market was in decline . In 2002 , Comverse Infosys changed its name to Verint , partly to separate its more thriving business from Comverse 's struggles , and staged a modestly successful IPO of a minority portion of its stock . By 2002 , Comverse Technology had more than 5 @,@ 000 employees across nearly 40 countries ; due to the partial spinoffs and economic difficulties , revenues were down to $ 735 million . 
 In December 2001 , a Fox News report raised the concern that wiretapping equipment provided by Comverse Infosys to the U.S. government for electronic eavesdropping may have been vulnerable , as these systems allegedly had a back door through which the wiretaps could be intercepted by unauthorized parties . Fox News reporter Carl Cameron said there was no reason to believe the Israeli government was implicated , but that " a classified top @-@ secret investigation is underway " . A March 2002 story by Le Monde recapped the Fox report and concluded : " Comverse is suspected of having introduced into its systems of the ' catch gates ' in order to ' intercept , record and store ' these wire @-@ taps . This hardware would render the ' listener ' himself ' listened to ' . " Fox News did not pursue the allegations , and in the years since , there have been no legal or commercial actions of any type taken against Comverse by the FBI or any other branch of the US Government related to data access and security issues . While no real evidence has been presented against Comverse or Verint , the allegations have become a favorite topic of conspiracy theorists . 
 By 2005 , the company had $ 959 million in sales and employed over 5 @,@ 000 people , of whom about half were located in Israel . That country held most of the research and development workers , many of whom occupied the company 's seven buildings on <unk> in the Ramat <unk> district of Tel Aviv , while business and marketing operations were stationed in the company 's Woodbury , New York headquarters . 
 = = = Options backdating and improper accounting = = = 
 In 2006 , Comverse Technology was involved in an options backdating scandal . In May of that year , company founder and CEO Jacob Alexander stepped down from his position . Alexander , finance chief David <unk> , and former senior general counsel William Sorin ( both of whom had also stepped down ) were charged in July 2006 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York with multiple counts of conspiracy , fraud , money laundering and making false filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , all related to alleged options backdating or other actions related to stock options between 1998 and 2006 . The accusations against the three included the backdating of options to when Comverse stock had been trading at low prices , the use of fake names of option holders , and the creation of secret funds in which to hold the illicit gains . The SEC also filed civil charges against the three , for filing false annual and quarterly financial reports and proxy statements from 1991 to 2005 . 
 By then , Alexander had already fled the country and was classified a wanted fugitive in August 2006 by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation . On 27 September 2006 , he was arrested in Namibia after hiding in Windhoek with his family , where he had bought a house at a country club . If extradited to the US and convicted , he faced 25 years in prison . 
 He was released on bail and subsequently engaged in a long , and so far successful , battle to avoid extradition to the US ( in Namibia neither money laundering nor options backdating is a crime ) . Upon leaving the US he had transferred some $ 64 million to Israel , with most of that ending up in Namibia ; another $ 50 million was blocked by the US government , which overall sought the forfeiture of $ 138 million of Alexander 's assets . In April 2010 , Alexander won a victory in the Supreme Court of Namibia that allowed him to continue to live and work in that country until the extradition request is finally ruled upon . In November 2010 , Alexander agreed to pay the U.S. government $ 53 @.@ 6 million to settle the SEC 's case against him , with those monies being targeted to settle assorted lawsuits against Comverse by shareholders . 
 Of the other two executives , William Sorin pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was sentenced to a year in prison in 2007 . David <unk> cooperated with prosecutors , repaid $ 2 @.@ 4 million to the SEC , and in 2011 was sentenced to the " time served " of the minimal period he had originally been in custody . While over a hundred companies were investigated or charged with options backdating , Comverse was one of the most known cases , and in the words of a pair of financial writers , " Comverse was the poster child for stock option fraud . " 
 = = = Continuing difficulties = = = 
 The scandal proved difficult for Comverse Technology to recover from . The three charged executives , who had stayed on as consultants , were fired without severance pay , and the company said it would pursue legal action against them . The board of directors was expanded from five to ten , with all of the new ones being Americans rather than Israelis . A new CEO , Andre Dahan , came on board in April 2007 but the ongoing management crisis prevented the company from engaging in new innovation or entering new business areas . Despite the 2006 @-@ 2007 economic climate being one of growth , layoffs occurred in mid @-@ 2007 . Research analysts began speculating that the company might break up . 
 Because of the accounting issues from the option backdating , Comverse Technology was unable to file full or timely financial reports with the SEC . Its stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market on 1 February 2007 , and removed from the S & P 500 and NASDAQ @-@ 100 at the same time . The stock then traded on the Pink Sheets . In 2009 , the SEC settled its case with Comverse Technology ; the company would not be subject to penalty fines over the backdating matter , but would accept a permanent injunction against itself regarding any future violations of law regarding publicly traded companies . A settlement in a similar case against Ulticom was also reached . The failure to file timely financial reports put the company at risk of having its stock registration revoked ; a process deciding this , involving the SEC and an Administrative Law Judge , is still active of 2011 . 
 The financial crisis of 2008 and on caused further difficulties for Comverse Technology , with new layoffs occurring in October 2008 , March 2009 , and August 2009 . The company reportedly lost considerable money in 2009 , and the moves were typical of other hi @-@ tech companies caught in the bad economic environment . Some of Comverse 's products were still viewed highly ; a Yankee Group survey ranked them first in the world in their type of billing services , and they were the worldwide market @-@ share leaders in providing multimedia message service centers to wireless carriers . However , the rise in popularity of smartphones and of sending e @-@ mail eroded the carrier market for some of Comverse 's products and services . By 2009 , the company 's upper management was now largely American rather than Israeli , Dahan was under internal criticism , and there were frequent clashes regarding company culture . 
 By early 2010 , Comverse Technology was planning to finally release an annual report with full financial statements and return to being fully listed on Nasdaq , but still was anticipating more layoffs . One piece of positive news in July 2010 was an $ 80 million investment by well @-@ known entrepreneur George Soros . However , the promised financial reports did not come , and an August 2010 public announcement that the company was short on cash and planning more layoffs and was subject to its stock being completely delisted caused a precipitous drop in the stock 's price , with the market valuation of the company falling below $ 1 billion . CEO Dahan said simply , " These are challenging times . " By August 2010 , analysts were stating that Comverse Technology might have to break up by selling off its subsidiaries and spin off Comverse 's own business units . Running low on cash , Comverse Technology engaged Goldman Sachs to explore such possibilities , with several large , well @-@ known technology companies potentially interested in Comverse and some private equity firms possibly interested in Verint . The company had some 4 @,@ 000 employees , and continued having about half of them employed in Israel and most of the rest in the US and France . The continuing financial reporting problems had cost the company some $ 500 million in accountants ' fees and related costs since 2006 and was the largest drain on its cash position . The fact that senior management awarded itself bonuses in a time of various rounds of layoffs left employees feeling outraged . Comverse 's restructuring also affected its 2006 @-@ acquired <unk> business unit in France , with layoffs or a shutdown possible . In October 2010 , Comverse Technology agreed to sell its two @-@ thirds ownership of its Ulticom subsidiary to a U.S. private equity firm for $ 90 million ; the deal closed in December 2010 . The company also sold part of its holdings in Verint , netting $ 80 million , and sold for $ 27 million land in the hi @-@ tech area of Ra <unk> , north of Tel Aviv , where it had been planning to build a new headquarters . 
 In October 2010 , Comverse Technology finally published its restated financial reports for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 . ( The company 's fiscal year N runs from February of year N to January of N + 1 . ) They revealed that the company lost about $ 1 billion during that period . In February 2011 , the company announced that due to this effort , its report for fiscal 2009 would be delayed , and also that it was restructuring into four independent business units and focusing much of its emphasis on billing systems for mobile carriers . <unk> also resumed , with more possibly in the offing . 
 In March 2011 , revenues for fiscal 2009 were announced at $ 1 @.@ 58 billion , down from $ 1 @.@ 72 billion two years previously , with an overall loss of $ 273 @.@ 3 million . Dahan stepped down as CEO . During his tenure , Comverse Technology stock fell 68 percent in price and 2 @,@ 000 – 2 @,@ 500 employees were laid off ; he made more than $ 20 million during that time and gained payments of some $ 5 million upon his departure . Overall , his stint as leader of the company was not regarded positively by some in the Israeli business press . 
 The new CEO was Charles Burdick , who had been non @-@ executive chairman of the company . Burdick became the first American to head the company . 
 In April 2011 , the company agreed to a $ 2 @.@ 8 million settlement with the U.S. government over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that had taken place between 2003 and 2005 . Payments of $ 536 @,@ 000 had been made to the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization in order to obtain purchase orders and had been inaccurately reported as sales commissions in Comverse 's accounting . 
 = = = Hopes for recovery = = = 
 During the first half of 2011 , analysts such as Oppenheimer & Co . , J.P. Morgan and Barclays said that with its accounting problems largely behind it , some restructuring done , and an improving cash balance and some revenue growth , Comverse Technology was well @-@ positioned for ongoing operations or a possible sale . <unk> Investment Research predicted the company would again show a profit for fiscal year 2011 . Comverse itself had gained tens of millions in new business , was hiring again in modest numbers , and was at about 4 @,@ 000 employees , including some on an outsourcing basis . 
 In June 2011 , results for fiscal 2010 were announced , finally bringing the company current with its annual audited reporting . Revenues rose to $ 1 @.@ 63 billion while the company 's net loss was halved to $ 132 @.@ 3 million , and the cash position was now stated as being sufficient to meet foreseeable needs . Another positive sign for its recovery came when it was re @-@ listed on NASDAQ in September 2011 . In April 2012 , results for fiscal 2011 were announced ; revenues remained flat at $ 1 @.@ 59 billion while the company 's net loss decreased again , to $ 58 @.@ 7 million . 
 Results for fiscal year 2012 demonstrated a return to profitability , with a net income of $ 5 @.@ 1 million . 
 = = = Restructuring = = = 
 In August 2012 , a series of transactions were announced that would end Comverse Technology as a functioning entity , by making Comverse Network Systems an independent company once again known simply as Comverse , allowing Verint Systems to buy back Comverse Technology 's majority stake , and selling off the other subsidiaries . Burdick said , " [ The Verint ] agreement , along with the planned spin @-@ off of [ Comverse Network Systems ] , will result in a tax efficient distribution to our shareholders and direct ownership in two independent , well @-@ capitalized publicly @-@ traded companies . " Philippe <unk> was named as the CEO of the newly independent Comverse . 
 These transactions were completed on 4 February 2013 and represented the effective liquidation of the Comverse Technology holding entity . In September 2015 this new Comverse entity changed its name to <unk> .

 = Italian cruiser Agordat = 
 Agordat was a torpedo cruiser of the Italian Regia Marina built in the late 1890s . She was the lead ship of the Agordat class , which had one other member , Coatit . The ship , which was armed with twelve 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns and two 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , was too slow and short @-@ ranged to be able to scout effectively for the fleet , so her career was limited . She saw action during the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1911 – 12 , where she provided gunfire support to Italian troops in North Africa . She assisted in the occupation of Constantinople in the aftermath of World War I , and in 1919 she was reclassified as a gunboat . In January 1923 , Agordat was sold for scrapping . 
 = = Design = = 
 Agordat was 91 @.@ 6 meters ( 301 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 9 @.@ 32 m ( 30 @.@ 6 ft ) and a draft of 3 @.@ 64 m ( 11 @.@ 9 ft ) . She displaced up to 1 @,@ 340 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 320 long tons ; 1 @,@ 480 short tons ) at full load . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal triple @-@ expansion steam engines each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by eight Blechynden water @-@ tube boilers . Her engines were rated at 8 @,@ 129 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 062 kW ) and produced a top speed of 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . The ship had a cruising radius of about 300 nautical miles ( 560 km ; 350 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of between 153 – 185 . 
 Agordat was armed with a main battery of twelve 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 40 guns mounted singly . She was also equipped with two 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship was only lightly armored , with a 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick deck . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Agordat was built at the Castellammare shipyard ; her keel was laid down on 18 February 1897 and her completed hull was launched on 11 October 1899 . After completing fitting @-@ out work , the new cruiser was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 26 September 1900 . Sea trials lasted from 11 February 1901 to 6 March , and during the final speed trial she exceeded her design speed by a knot . She nevertheless proved to be too slow and short @-@ legged to be useful as a fleet scout , which limited her active duty career . She served in the main fleet in 1903 – 1904 , during which time the fleet was kept in a state of readiness for seven months . For the remaining five months , the ships had reduced crews . During the 1908 fleet maneuvers , Agordat was assigned to the hostile force that was tasked with simulating an attempt to land troops on Sicily . 
 At the outbreak of the Italo @-@ Turkish War against the Ottoman Empire in September 1911 , Agordat was assigned in the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron , under the command of Rear Admiral Ernesto <unk> , the divisional commander . On 15 October , Agordat and her sister joined the battleship Napoli , the armored cruisers Pisa , Amalfi , and San Marco , three destroyers , and several troop transports for an attack on the port of Derna . Negotiators were sent ashore to attempt to secure the surrender of the garrison , which was refused . Napoli and the armored cruisers bombarded the Ottoman positions throughout the day , and on 18 October the Ottomans withdrew , allowing the Italian troops to come ashore and take possession of the port . The fleet remained offshore and helped to repel Ottoman counterattacks over the following two weeks . In December , Agordat joined San Marco and the battleships Roma and Regina Margherita at Benghazi . There , they provided gunfire support to the Italian garrison against repeated Turkish assaults . In early April 1912 , Agordat , the torpedo cruiser Iride , and several other vessels rendezvoused with a troop convoy carrying 10 @,@ 000 men to Zuwarah near the border with Tunisia . 
 In November 1918 , Agordat participated in the occupation of Constantinople following the surrender of the Ottoman Empire . She and the battleship Roma joined a fleet of British , French , and Greek warships that entered the Dardanelles and landed troops to occupy the city . In 1921 , Agordat was reclassified as a gunboat and her armament was modified ; four of the 76 mm guns were replaced by a pair of 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 40 guns and the torpedo tubes were removed . This service lasted less than two years , and on 4 January 1923 the ship was sold for scrapping . 
 = Mary Amdur = 
 Mary <unk> Amdur ( February 18 , 1921 – February 16 , 1998 ) was an American toxicologist and public health researcher who worked primarily on pollution . She was charged with studying the effects of the 1948 Donora smog , so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs . Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened , to her funding being pulled , and to her losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953 . Undeterred by the setback , she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard , and subsequently at MIT and New York University . Despite the early controversy related to her work , it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution , and towards the end of her life she received numerous awards and accolades . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mary Amdur was born in 1921 in Donora , Pennsylvania . She received a bachelor 's degree in chemistry in 1943 from the University of Pittsburgh , moving to Cornell University to study biochemistry at the postgraduate level . She received her PhD in biochemistry in 1946 , writing her thesis on the " Role of Manganese and <unk> in Bone Formation in the Rat " . After achieving her PhD , she worked at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary before joining Philip Drinker 's team at Harvard School of Public Health in 1949 . By 1953 she had married another scientist in the field , Benjamin Amdur , with whom she had a son , David . 
 = = Research = = 
 The American Smelting and Refining Company ( ASARCO ) funded Drinker to investigate the 1948 Donora smog , as the company had an interest in showing that its primary pollutants ( sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide ) had not significantly contributed to the damage it caused . In the middle of 1953 , Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination mist of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide into humid chambers containing guinea pigs to investigate the damage that it would cause to their lungs . Guinea pigs were used as they breathe more deeply through their mouths than smaller rodents which breathe through their noses . The <unk> bought their own guinea pigs for the mini project , and spent a holiday weekend doing the investigation . 
 Amdur presented the results of the experiment , that inhaling the combination mist led to dramatic effects on breathing , loss of weight and lung disease , to the American Association for the Advancement of Science at their annual meeting in December 1953 . She then wrote a damning paper on the effects of lower levels of sulfuric acid on humans , levels similar to those of the 1948 smog . The paper , and her attempt to present the associated findings to the American Industrial Hygiene Association , caused her many difficulties . Amdur was accosted and threatened by two thugs in an elevator at the association 's 1954 annual meeting . She presented the findings regardless . As Drinker received funding from ASARCO , the company 's management assumed that they would hold sway over what was published . When Amdur returned from the meeting , Drinker demanded that Amdur remove her name from the paper and to withdraw it from The Lancet , despite the fact it had already been accepted . Amdur refused Drinker 's demands , so her position on his staff was removed and she was left to find new work . The paper was never published . 
 She quickly found a new untenured research associate role under James <unk> , Chair of Physiology at Harvard School of Public Health , working with Dr. Jere Mead . She continued the research on air pollution , which she began under Drinker , until she left the school in 1977 . Partly because of the difficulty in obtaining tenure at Harvard , both for herself and for her colleague Sheldon Murphy , and partly because she needed to work with engineers to produce suitable combustion products , she moved her research to the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and accepted a promotion to lecturer , securing funding for 12 years . When she moved , her new focus was the role of metals in the inhalation of sulfuric acid . Dissatisfied with the attention the research received at MIT , she moved to the Institute of Environmental Medicine at New York University in 1989 as a senior research scientist , where she remained until her retirement in 1996 . 
 = = Awards = = 
 In 1953 , Amdur was inducted as a member of Delta Omega Honorary Society in Public Health . In 1974 , she received the Donald E. Cummings Memorial Award from the American Industrial Hygiene Association in recognition of her lifetime contributions and application of her knowledge in the field . The American Academy of Industrial Hygiene Council awarded her the Henry F. Smyth Jr . Award in 1984 for identifying and fulfilling research needs within the industrial hygiene profession . In 1986 she received the Inhalation Section of the Career Achievement Award from The Society of Toxicology . She received the Herbert E. <unk> Award from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists in 1989 In 1988 she gained , the Mid @-@ Atlantic Section , Society of Toxicology Ambassador Award . Then in 1997 , she was awarded the Merit Award from the same society , in celebration of her achievements throughout her life and her contributions to Toxicology .

 Amdur died on 16 February 1998 of a heart attack while returning from a holiday in Hawaii . At least three societies wrote obituaries and a toxicology book was dedicated to her memory . A Toxicology Society Award was set up in her name by students and colleagues . The award , the Mary Amdur Student Award is presented for the Inhalation and Respiratory Specialty Section . She is considered the " mother of smog research " and her work had " a major role in the development of air pollution standards . "

 = Hungarian prehistory = 
 Hungarian prehistory ( Hungarian : <unk> <unk> ) spans the period of history of the Hungarian people , or Magyars , which started with the separation of the Hungarian language from other Finno @-@ Ugric or Ugric languages around 800 BC , and ended with the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 895 AD . Based on the earliest records of the Magyars in Byzantine , Western European , and Hungarian chronicles , scholars considered them for centuries to have been the descendants of the ancient Scythians and Huns . This historiographical tradition disappeared from mainstream history after the realization of similarities between the Hungarian language and the Uralic languages in the late 18th century . Thereafter , linguistics became the principal source of the study of the Hungarians ' ethnogenesis . In addition , chronicles written between the 9th and 15th centuries , the results of archaeological research and folklore analogies provide information on the Magyars ' early history . 
 Study of pollen in fossils based on cognate words for certain trees – including larch and elm – in the daughter languages suggests the speakers of the Proto @-@ Uralic language lived in the wider region of the Ural Mountains , which were inhabited by scattered groups of Neolithic hunter @-@ gatherers in the 4th millennium BC . They spread over vast territories , which caused the development of a separate Proto @-@ Finno @-@ Ugric language by the end of the millennium . Linguistic studies and archaeological research evidence that those who spoke this language lived in pit @-@ houses and used decorated clay vessels . The expansion of marshlands after around 2600 BC caused new migrations . No scholarly consensus on the <unk> , or original homeland , of the Ugric peoples exists : they lived either in the region of the <unk> River or along the Kama River and the upper courses of the Volga River around 2000 BC . They lived in settled communities , cultivated millet , wheat , and other crops , and bred animals – especially horses , cattle , and pigs . Loan words connected to animal husbandry from Proto @-@ Iranian show that they had close contacts with their neighbors . The southernmost Ugric groups adopted a nomadic way of life by around 1000 BC , because of the northward expansion of the steppes . 
 The development of the Hungarian language started around 800 BC with the withdrawal of the grasslands and the parallel southward migration of the nomadic Ugric groups . The history of the ancient Magyars during the next thousand years is uncertain ; they lived in the steppes but the location of their <unk> is subject to scholarly debates . According to one theory , they initially lived east of the Urals and migrated west to " Magna Hungaria " by 600 AD at the latest . Other scholars say Magna Hungaria was the Magyars ' original homeland , from where they moved either to the region of the Don River or towards the Kuban River before the 830s AD . Hundreds of loan words adopted from Chuvash @-@ type Turkic languages prove the Magyars were closely connected to Turkic peoples . Byzantine and Muslim authors regarded them as a Turkic people in the 9th and 10th centuries . 
 An alliance between the Magyars and the Bulgarians in the late 830s was the first historical event that was recorded with certainty in connection with the Magyars . According to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus , the Magyars lived in Levedia in the vicinity of the Khazar Khaganate in the early 9th century and supported the Khazars in their wars " for three years " . The Magyars were organized into tribes , each headed by their own " voivodes " , or military leaders . After a Pecheneg invasion against Levedia , a group of Magyars crossed the Caucasus Mountains and settled in the lands south of the mountains , but the majority of the people fled to the steppes north of the Black Sea . From their new homeland , which was known as Etelköz , the Magyars controlled the lands between the Lower Danube and the Don River in the 870s . The confederation of their seven tribes was led by two supreme chiefs , the kende and the gyula . The Kabars – a group of rebellious subjects of the Khazars – joined the Magyars in Etelköz . The Magyars regularly invaded the neighboring Slavic tribes , forcing them to pay a tribute and seizing prisoners to be sold to the Byzantines . Taking advantage of the wars between Bulgaria , East Francia , and Moravia , they invaded Central Europe at least four times between 861 and 894 . A new Pecheneg invasion compelled the Magyars to leave Etelköz , cross the Carpathian Mountains , and settle in the Carpathian Basin around 895 . 
 = = = Archaeology = = = 
 Since the 1830s , archaeology has played an important role in the study of the Magyar prehistory . Archaeologists have applied two methods ; the so @-@ called " linear method " attempts to determine the route of the migrating Magyars from their original homeland to the Carpathian Basin , while the " retrospective method " tries to discover the antecedents of 10th @-@ century assemblages from the Carpathian Basin in the Eurasian steppes . However , only twelve cemeteries in the steppes have yielded finds that show similarities to assemblages unearthed in the Carpathian Basin . The dating of those cemeteries is also controversial . 
 Both the scarcity of published archaeological material and the <unk> of some sites may have contributed to the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes , according to archaeologist László Kovács . Kovács also says that the Hungarians ' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture , rendering the identification of pre @-@ conquest Hungarians difficult . Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland . 
 Buckles , belt mounts , and other objects of the so @-@ called " <unk> horizon " , which were unearthed at <unk> , <unk> , and other sites along the middle course of the Dniester show similarities with archaeological finds from the 10th @-@ century Carpathian Basin . These objects were carbon dated to the late 9th century . The same archaeological sites also yielded vessels similar to the pottery of the neighboring Slavic territories . 
 = = = Linguistics = = = 
 The study of the Hungarian language is one of the main sources of the research on the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms . According to a scholarly theory , the oldest layers of Hungarian vocabulary show features of the territory in which the language emerged . The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of the Hungarian language and other peoples . Loan words also reflect changes in the way of life of the Magyars . 
 = = = Written sources = = = 
 Written sources on the prehistoric Hungarians may begin with Herodotus , who wrote of the <unk> , a people of equestrian hunters who lived next to the <unk> . Based on the location of the homeland of the <unk> and their ethnonym , Gyula Moravcsik , János <unk> , and other scholars identify them as Hungarians ; their view has not been universally accepted . The 6th @-@ century Byzantine historian John Malalas referred to a Hunnic tribal leader called <unk> , who ruled around 527 AD . Moravcsik , Dezső Pais , and other historians connect <unk> 's name to the Hungarians ' <unk> ( Magyar ) ; they say Malalas 's report proves the presence of Magyar tribes in the region of the Sea of Azov in the early 6th century AD . This identification is rejected by most scholars . 
 The Continuation of the Chronicle by Friar George , which was written in the middle of the 10th century , recorded the first historical event – an alliance between the Magyars and the Bulgarians in the late 830s – that can without doubt be connected to the Magyars . The Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise 's Tactics , a book written around 904 , contained a detailed description of their military strategies and way of life . Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus 's De administrando imperio ( " On Governing the Empire " ) , which was completed between 948 and 952 , preserves most information on the Magyars ' early history . Al @-@ Jayhani , the minister of Nasr II , ruler of the Samanid Empire , collected the reports of merchants who had traveled in the western regions of the Eurasian steppes in the 870s and 880s . Although Al @-@ Jayhani 's work was lost , later Muslim scholars Ibn Rusta , Gardizi , Abu Tahir <unk> , and Al @-@ Bakri used his book , preserving important facts about the late 9th @-@ century Magyars . However , their works also contain interpolations from later periods . Among the sources written in Western Europe , the longer version of the Annals of Salzburg , Regino of Prüm 's Chronicon , the Annals of Fulda , and Liutprand of Cremona 's <unk> ( " Retribution " ) , provide contemporaneous or near @-@ contemporaneous information of the 9th @-@ century Magyars . There are also references to the Magyars dwelling in the Pontic steppes in the legends of Cyril , Methodius and other early Slavic saints . According to historian András Róna @-@ Tas , information preserved in the Russian Primary Chronicle , which was completed in the 1110s , has to be " treated with extreme caution " . 
 The first Hungarian chronicles were written in the late 11th or early 12th centuries but their texts were preserved in manuscripts compiled in the 13th to 15th centuries . Most extant chronicles show that the earliest works contained no information on the history of the Hungarians before their conversion to Christianity in the 11th century . The only exception is the Gesta Hungarorum , which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle , whose principal subject is the Magyars ' pagan past . However , the reliability of this work , which was written by a former royal notary now known as Anonymus , is suspect . In his monograph of medieval Hungarian historians , Carlile Aylmer Macartney describes it as " the most famous , the most obscure , the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts " .

 The Hungarians were mentioned under various ethnic names in Arabic , Byzantine , Slavic , and Western European sources in the 9th and 10th centuries . Arabic scholars referred to them as Magyars , <unk> , or Turks ; Byzantine authors mentioned them as Huns , <unk> , Turks , or <unk> ; Slavic sources used the ethnonyms <unk> or <unk> , and Western European authors wrote of <unk> , <unk> , Avars , Huns , Turks , and <unk> . According to the linguist Gyula Németh , the multiple ethnonyms – especially <unk> , Savard , and Turk – reflect that the Magyars had been integrated in various empires of the Eurasian steppes – the tribal confederations of the Onogurs and of the Sabirs , and the Turkic Khaganate – before gaining their independence . 
 Ibn Rusta was the first to record a variant of the Hungarians ' self @-@ designation ; ( al @-@ <unk> ) . According to a scholarly theory , the ethnonym " Magyar " is a composite word . The first part of the word ( <unk> ) is said to have been connected to several recorded or hypothetical words , including the Mansi 's self @-@ designation ( <unk> ) and a reconstructed Ugric word for man ( * <unk> ) . The second part ( -er or <unk> ) may have developed from a reconstructed Finno @-@ <unk> word for man or boy ( * <unk> ) or from a Turkic word with a similar meaning ( eri or <unk> ) . Alan W. Ertl writes that the ethnonym was initially the name of a smaller group , the <unk> tribe ; it developed into an ethnonym because <unk> was the most powerful tribe within the people . Most scholars agree that the Hungarian exonym and its variants were derived from the Onogurs ' name . This form started spreading in Europe with Slavic mediation . 
 = = Legend of the Wondrous Hind = = 
 Most historians agree that the legend of the wondrous hind preserved the Hungarians ' own myth of their origins . The late 13th @-@ century chronicler Simon of Kéza was the first to record it . The legend says two brothers , Hunor and Magor , were the forefathers of the Huns and Hungarians . They were the sons of Ménrót and his wife , Eneth . While chasing a hind , they reached as far as the marches of the Sea of Azov , where they abducted the wives of Belar 's sons and two daughters of Dula , the prince of the Alans . According to historian Gyula Kristó , Eneth 's name derived from the Hungarian word for hind ( <unk> ) , showing that the Magyars regarded this animal as their <unk> ancestor . Kristó also says the four personal names mentioned in the legend personify four peoples : the Hungarians ( Magor ) , the Onogurs ( Hunor ) , the Bulgars ( Belar ) and the Dula – kindred of the Alans or Bulgars ( <unk> ) . The hunt for a beast , ending with the arrival in a new homeland , was a popular legend among the peoples of the Eurasian steppes , including the Huns and the Mansi . The myth that a people were descended from two brothers was also widespread . Consequently , it is possible that Simon of Kéza did not record a genuine Hungarian legend , but borrowed it from foreign sources . 
 After the confusion of tongues the giant [ Ménrót ] entered the land of <unk> , which is now called Persia , and there he begot two sons , Hunor and Mogor , by his wife Eneth . It was from them that the Huns , or Hungarians , took their origins . ... [ A ] s Hunor and Mogor were Ménrót 's first born , they journeyed separately from their father in tents . Now it happened one day when they had gone out hunting in the Meotis marshes that they encountered a hind in the wilderness . As they went in pursuit of it , it fled before them . Then it disappeared from their sight altogether , and they could not find it no matter how long they searched . But as they were wandering through these marshes , they saw that the land was well suited for grazing cattle . They then returned to their father , and after obtaining his permission they took all their possessions and went to live in the Meotis marshes . ... So they entered the Meotis marshes and remained there for five years without leaving . Then in the sixth year they went out , and when by chance they discovered that the wives and children of the sons of Belar were camped in tents in a lonely place without their menfolk , they carried them off with all their belongings as fast as they could into the Meotis marshes . Two daughters of Dula , prince of the Alans , happened to be among the children who were seized . Hunor took one of them in marriage and Mogor the other , and to these women all the Huns owe their origin .

 According to the Annals of St. Bertin , the Magyars who invaded East Francia in 862 were enemies " hitherto unknown " to the local population . Likewise , Regino of Prüm wrote that the Magyars had been " unheard of in the previous centuries because they were not named " . in the sources . Both remarks evince that late 9th @-@ century authors had no knowledge of the Magyars ' origins . However , the Magyar raids reminded the Western European and Byzantine scholars of earlier historians ' descriptions of the Scythians or Huns , which gave rise to their identification with those peoples . For instance , Leo the Wise listed the Hungarians among the " Scythian nations " . The similarity between the Latin ethnonyms Huni and <unk> strengthened the identification of the two peoples , which became commonplace in Western Europe in the 11th century . The Chronicon <unk> was the first source that clearly stated that the Huns and the Hungarians were the same people . 
 The earliest Hungarian chronicles adopted the idea that the Huns and Hungarians were closely related . Anonymus did not mention the Huns , but he referred to Attila the Hun as a ruler " from whose line Prince Álmos " , the supreme head of the Magyar tribes , descended . However , Simon of Kéza explicitly identified the Huns and the Hungarians in the 1280 . He started his chronicle with a book of the history of the Huns , thus presenting the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin as the reoccupation of a land inherited from their ancestors . Thereafter the identification of the two peoples was the basic theory of the origins of the Hungarians for centuries . 
 = = = Modern scholarship = = = 
 Scholarly attempts in the early 18th century to prove a relationship between the Finns and the Huns led to the realization of the similarities between the Finnish and Hungarian languages . János Sajnovics 's <unk> , the first systematic comparative study of Hungarian and the Saami languages , was published in 1770 . Three decades later , Sámuel <unk> demonstrated similarities between a larger group of languages that are now known as Uralic languages . However , the majority of Hungarian scholars only gradually adopted Sajnovics 's and <unk> 's views . In the 1830s , Pál <unk> still wrote that Hungarian had an intermediate position between the Finnish and Turkic languages , but later accepted that Hungarian is closely related to the Mansi and Khanty languages . Hereafter linguistics played a pre @-@ eminent role in the research of the Magyars ' prehistory because it was always the dominant linguistic theory that determined the interpretation of historical and archaeological evidence . Consequently , as historian <unk> Berend writes , Hungarian prehistory is " a tenuous construct based on linguistics , folklore analogies , archaeology , and later written evidence " , because there are no certain records of the Magyars before the 9th century and the identification of archaeological cultures with peoples is highly debatable . Historian László Kontler identifies " the history of Hungarian origins " as " the history of a community whose genetic composition and cultural character has been changing , but which has assuredly spoken Hungarian or its predecessor language " . 
 According to mainstream scholarly consensus , the Hungarians are not the autochthonous population of the Carpathian Basin . Their ancestors arrived there through a series of westward migrations across the Eurasian steppes around 894 , centuries after their departure from their original homeland located somewhere in the East . Many details of the Magyars ' prehistory – the location of their original homeland , the ancient Magyars ' connections with the Turkic peoples and the Khazar Khaganate , their lifestyle and political organization , and the background of their conquest of the Carpathian Basin – are still subject to scholarly debates . With regard of the connections between the Magyars and the Turkic tribes , archaeologist Gyula László mooted an alternative theory in the 1960s . According to his theory of the " double conquest " , a large group of people who spoke a Finno @-@ <unk> language arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 670 , and a Turkic @-@ speaking people conquered the same territory in the late 9th century . László 's theory has never been widely accepted .

 Hungarian has traditionally been classified as an Ugric language within the family of Uralic languages , but alternative views exist . For instance , linguist Tapani <unk> rejects the existence of a Proto @-@ Ugric language , saying Hungarian was a member of an " areal genetic unit " that also included <unk> languages . <unk> research suggests the speakers of the Proto @-@ Uralic language lived in a territory where four trees – larch , silver fir , spruce , and elm – grew together . The study of pollen in fossils shows these trees could be found on both sides of the Ural Mountains along the rivers Ob , Pechora , and Kama in the 4th millennium BC . The land between the Urals and the Kama was sparsely inhabited during this period . From around 3600 BC , the Neolithic material culture of the wider region of the Urals spread over vast territories to the west and east . Regional variants emerged , showing the appearance of groups of people who had no close contact with each other . 
 About 1000 basic words of the Hungarian language – including the names of the seasons and natural phenomena , and the most frequently used verbs – had cognates in other Finno @-@ Ugric languages , suggesting the temporary existence of a Proto @-@ Finno @-@ Ugric language . Between around 2600 and 2100 BC , climatic changes caused the spread of swamps on both sides of the Urals , forcing groups of inhabitants to leave their homelands . The Finno @-@ Ugric linguistic unity disappeared and new languages emerged around 2000 BC . Whether the groups speaking the language from which Hungarian emerged lived to the east or to the west of the Urals in this period is debated by historians . 
 Further climate changes occurring between 1300 and 1000 BC caused the northward expansion of the steppes by about 200 – 300 kilometres ( 120 – 190 mi ) , compelling the southernmost Ugric groups to adopt a nomadic lifestyle . Around 800 BC , the climate again changed with the beginning of a wetter period , forcing the nomadic Ugric groups to start a southward migration , following the grasslands . Their movement separated them from the northern Ugric groups , which gave rise to the development of the language from which modern Hungarian emerged . According to historian László Kontler , the concept of the " sky @-@ high tree " and some other elements of Hungarian folklore seem to have been inherited from the period of the Finno @-@ Ugric unity . The melodies of the most common Hungarian funeral songs show similarities to tunes of Khanty epic songs .

 The stag and the eagle , which are popular motifs of 10th @-@ century Magyar art , have close analogies in Scythian art . The Scythians , Sarmatians , and other peoples who spoke Iranian languages dominated the Eurasian steppes between around 800 BC and 350 AD . During this period , all ethnic groups in the steppes were nomads with almost identical material cultures , for which the certain identification of the Magyars is impossible . Consequently , the location of their original homeland is subject to scholarly debates . Róna @-@ Tas says the development of Hungarian started in the region of the rivers Kama and Volga , west of the Urals . Archaeologist István Fodor writes that the original homeland lay to the east of the Urals . He says that some features of the tumuli erected at Chelyabinsk in the 4th century BC , including the northward orientation of the heads of the deceased and the geometric motifs on the clay vessels put in the graves , are similar to older burials that he attributes to Ugric peoples .

 In the 1230s , Friar Julian went to search for the Magyars ' legendary homeland Magna Hungaria after reading about it and a group of Magyars who had remained there in a Hungarian chronicle . He met a Hungarian @-@ speaking group " beside the great <unk> river " ( the Volga or the Kama ) in the land of the Volga Bulgars , in or in the wider region of present @-@ day Bashkortostan in Eastern Europe . Whether Magna Hungaria was the original homeland of the Magyars , or whether the Magyars ' ancestors settled in Magna Hungaria after their migration to Europe from their Western Siberian original homeland is still subject to scholarly debates . According to a third scholarly theory , Magna Hungaria was neither the Magyars ' original homeland nor their first homeland in Europe . Instead , the ancestors of the Eastern Magyars whom Friar Julian met had moved to Magna Hungaria from the south . 
 According to a scholarly theory , the name of at least one Magyar tribe , <unk> , is connected to the name of a Bashkir group , <unk> . Specific burial rites – the use of death masks and the placing of parts of horses into the graves – featuring a 9th- or 10th @-@ century cemetery at the confluence of the Volga and Kama near present @-@ day <unk> <unk> in Bashkortostan are also evidenced among the Magyars who lived in the Carpathian Basin in the 10th century . Most specialists say that the cemetery at <unk> <unk> was used by Magyars who either remained in Magna Hungaria when other Magyar groups left the territory , or who moved there from other regions which were inhabited by the Magyars during their migrations . 
 If the Magyars ' original homeland was situated in Western Siberia , instead of being identical with Magna Hungaria , their ancestors moved from Western Siberia to Eastern Europe . This must have happened between 500 BC and 700 AD , because there were several major movements of peoples across the steppes during this period . The " <unk> culture " spread towards modern @-@ day Bashkortostan around 400 BC . The westward migration of the Huns forced many groups of people of Western Siberia to depart for Europe between about 350 and 400 AD . The Avars ' attack against the Sabirs in Siberia set in motion a number of migrations in the 460s . Between around 550 and 600 , the migration of the Avars towards Europe compelled many nomadic groups to move . 
 The arrival of the Huns ended the dominance of Iranian peoples in the Eurasian steppes . Thereafter the Sabirs , Avars , <unk> , Khazars , and other Turkic peoples controlled the grasslands of Eastern Europe for centuries . Gardizi described the Magyars as " a branch of the Turks " ; Leo the Wise and Constantine Porphyrogenitus called them Turks . About 450 Hungarian words were borrowed from Turkic languages before around 900 . The oldest layer of Hungarian folk songs show similarities to Chuvash songs . These facts show the Magyars were closely connected to the Turks while they stayed in the Pontic steppes . 
 Gyula Németh , András Róna @-@ Tas and other scholars write that for centuries , the Magyars lived around the Kuban River , to the north of the Caucasus Mountains . They say it was there that the Magyars adopted the Turkic terminology of viticulture , including bor ( " wine " ) and <unk> ( " dregs " ) , and the Turkic names of cornel ( som ) , grapes ( <unk> ) and some other fruits . According to these scholars , the Hungarian words of Alanic origin – including <unk> ( " lady " , originally " noble or royal lady " ) – were also borrowed in the same region .

 The Khazar Khaganate was the dominant power in the steppes between the rivers Dnieper and Volga after around 650 . Archaeological finds show that the <unk> controlled a multi @-@ ethnic empire . The " Saltovo @-@ Mayaki culture " , which flourished in the same region around 750 and 900 , had at least seven variants . In the Hungarian chronicles , the legend of the wondrous hind seems to have preserved the memory of the Magyars ' " close symbiosis , intermarriages , and incipient fusion " with various ethnic groups – Alans , Bulgars , and Onogurs – of this large region . 
 Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote that the Magyars " had of old their dwelling next to <unk> , in the place called Levedia , " adding that " a river <unk> , also called <unk> " ran through this territory . The identification of the ( one or two ) rivers is uncertain . Porphyrogenitus associated Levedia with the whole territory dominated by the Magyars , but most modern historians agree that he only described a smaller region situated on the Don River . The period when the Magyars settled in Levedia is also uncertain ; this happened either before 750 ( István Fodor ) or around 830 ( Gyula Kristó ) . Porphyrogenitus said that the Magyars had been named " <unk> <unk> " , or " steadfast <unk> " , while staying in Levedia . Róna @-@ Tas says the ethnonym is an invented term with no historical credibility . Based on the same denomination , Károly <unk> , Dezső <unk> , Victor Spinei , and other historians associated the Magyars either with the late 6th @-@ century Sabirs or with the <unk> tribe of the Volga Bulgars . 
 <unk> wrote that the Magyars " lived together with the Chazars for three years , and fought in alliance with the Chazars in all their wars " , which suggests that the Magyars were subjugated to the Khazar Khagan , according to a scholarly view . On the other hand , historian György <unk> says , the emperor 's words prove the equal position of the Magyars and the Khazars , instead of the Magyars ' subjugation to the Khagan . Although the emperor said that the Magyars ' cohabitation with the Khazars lasted only for three years , modern historians tend to propose a longer period ( 20 , 30 , 100 , 150 , 200 or even 300 years ) . 
 According to a memorial stone erected in or before 831 , a Bulgarian military commander named <unk> drowned in the Dnieper during a military campaign . Florin Curta says this inscription may be the " ' first clue ' to the upheaval on the steppes created by the migration of the Magyars into the lands between the Dnieper and the Danube " . The earliest certainly identifiable events of the Magyars ' history occurred in the 830s . The Bulgarians hired them to fight against their Byzantine prisoners , who rebelled and tried to return to Macedonia in the late 830s , but the Byzantines routed them on the banks on the Lower Danube . According to the Annals of St. Bertin , Rus ' envoys who visited Constantinople in 839 could only return to their homeland through the Carolingian Empire because " the route by which they had reached Constantinople had taken them through primitive tribes that were very fierce and savage " ; Curta and Kristó identify those tribes with the Magyars . Ibn Rusta wrote that the Khazars " used to be protected from attack by the Magyars and other neighboring peoples " by a ditch . According to a scholarly theory , Ibn Rusta 's report shows that the Khazar fort at Sarkel , which was built in the 830s , was one of the forts protecting the Khazars against the Magyars . 
 According to Porphyrogenitus , In Levedia , the Magyars " were seven clans , but they had never had over them a prince either native or foreign , but there were among them ' voivodes ' " , or chiefs . Although the exact meaning of the term the emperor used ( <unk> ) cannot be exactly determined , scholars have traditionally considered the Magyar " clans " or " tribes " as ethnic and territorial units . In the Hungarian chronicles , references to " seven leading persons " or " seven captains " denote the existence of seven Magyar tribes . 
 Porphyrogenitus said the tribes did not " obey their own particular [ voivodes ] , but [ had ] a joint agreement to fight together with all earnestness and zeal ... wheresoever war breaks out " , suggesting the tribal chiefs were military rather than political leaders . According to Kristó , the emperor 's report also shows the tribal confederation was not a " solid political formation with strong cohesion " in the early 9th century . The Gesta Hungarorum referred to the seven Magyar chiefs as " Hetumoger " , or " Seven Magyars " . Similar ethnonyms – including <unk> Oghuz ( " Nine <unk> " ) and <unk> ( " Ten <unk> " ) – suggest the Gesta preserved the name of the confederation of the Magyar tribes . According to Porphyrogenitus , Levedia was named after Levedi , one of the Magyar voivodes . During Levedi 's life , the <unk> , a distinct group within the Pechenegs ' tribal confederation whom the Khazars had expelled from their homeland , invaded Levedia and forced the Magyars to cede the territory . A Magyar group fled across the Caucasus Mountains as far as Persia . However , the masses departed for the West and settled in a region called Etelköz . Most historians agree the Magyars ' forced exodus from Levedia occurred around 850 . 
 [ T ] he Pechenegs who were previously called " Kangar " ( for this " Kangar " was a name <unk> nobility and valour among them ) , these , then , stirred up war against the [ Khazars ] and , being defeated , were forced to quit their own land and to settle in that of the [ Magyars ] . And when battle was joined between the [ Magyars ] and the Pechenegs who were at that time called " Kangar " , the army of the [ Magyars ] was defeated and split into two parts . One part went eastwards and settled in the region of Persia , and they to this day are called by the ancient denomination of the [ Magyars ] " <unk> <unk> " ; but the other part , together with their voivode and chief [ Levedi ] , settled in the western regions , in places called [ Etelköz ] ... . 
 = = = Etelköz ( c . 850 – c . 895 ) = = = 
 Constantine Porphyrogenitus identified Etelköz with the lands where the rivers " Barouch " , " Koubou " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " <unk> " run . The identification of the last three rivers with the Dniester , the Prut , and the Siret is without debate , but the traditional identification of the Barouch with the Dnieper and the Koubou with the Southern Bug is refuted by Spinei . Al @-@ Jayhani wrote that the Magyars ' territory was located between two rivers named " tl " and " <unk> " in the 870s . According to modern scholars , tl may refer to the Volga , the Don , or the Dnieper ; <unk> is identified as the Danube . According to the Gesta Hungarorum , the Magyars lived in " Scythia " or " <unk> " ; the latter name , which refers to the Don River , suggests the Magyars inhabited the eastern regions of the Pontic steppes , according to Spinei . 
 The Khazar Khagan sent his envoys to the Magyars shortly after they fled from Levedia and settled in Etelköz , according to Porphyrogenitus . The Khagan invited Levedi to a meeting , proposing to make Levedi the supreme head of the confederation of the Magyar tribes in exchange for the acceptance of his suzerainty . Instead of accepting the offer , Levedi suggested the new rank should be offered to another voivode , Álmos , or the latter 's son , Árpád . The Khagan accepted Levedi 's proposal and upon his demand the Magyar chiefs proclaimed Árpád their head . According to Kristó and Spinei , Porphyrogenitus ' report preserved the memory of the creation of a central office within the federation of the Magyar tribes . Róna @-@ Tas says the story relates only a " change of dynasty " ; the fall of Levedi 's family and the emergence of the Árpád dynasty . In contrast with Porphyrogenitus 's story , the Gesta Hungarorum says it was not Árpád , but his father who was elected the first supreme prince of the Magyars . 
 According to Muslim scholars , the Magyars had two supreme leaders , the kende and the gyula , the latter being their ruler in the 870s . Their report implies the Khagan granted a Khazar title to the head of the federation of the Magyar tribes ; Ibn Fadlan recorded that the third Khazar dignitary was styled <unk> in the 920s . The Muslim scholar 's report also implies the Magyars adopted the Khazar system of " dual kingship " , whereby supreme power was divided between a sacred ruler ( the kende ) and a military leader ( the gyula ) . 
 Between the country of the [ Pechenegs ] and the country of the <unk> , which belongs to the [ Volga Bulgars ] , lies the first of the Magyar frontiers . ... Their chief rides at the head of 20 @,@ 000 horsemen . He is named <unk> , but the one who actually rules them is called <unk> . All the Magyars implicitly obey this ruler in wars of offence and defence . ... Their territory is vast , extending to the Black Sea , into which two rivers flow , one larger than the Oxus . Their campsites are located between these two rivers . 
 Porphyrogenitus wrote that the Kabars – a group of Khazars who rebelled against the Khagan – joined the Magyars in Etelköz at an unspecified time , suggesting that the Magyars had got rid of the Khagan 's suzerainty . The Kabars were organized into three tribes , but a single chieftain commanded them . Porphyrogenitus also wrote that the Kabars " were promoted to be first " tribe , because they showed themselves " the strongest and most valorous " of the tribes . Accordingly , the Kabars formed the Magyars ' vanguard , because nomadic peoples always placed the associated tribes in the most vulnerable position . 
 Ibn Rusta wrote that the Magyars subjected the neighboring Slavic peoples , imposing " a heavy tribute on them " and treating them as prisoners . The Magyars also " made piratical raids on the Slavs " and sold those captured during these raids to the Byzantines in Kerch on the Crimean peninsula . A band of Magyar warriors attacked the future Saint Cyril the Philosopher " howling like wolves and wishing to kill him " in the steppes near the Crimea , according to the saint 's legend . However , Cyril convinced them to " release him and his entire retinue in peace " . The inhabitants of the regions along the left bank of the Dniester – whom the Russian Primary Chronicle identified as <unk> – fortified their settlements in the second half of the 9th century , which seems to be connected to the Magyars ' presence . 
 A plundering raid in East Francia in 862 was the Magyars ' first recorded military expedition in Central Europe . This raid may have been initiated by Rastislav of Moravia , who was at war with Louis the German , according to Róna @-@ Tas and Spinei . The longer version of the Annals of Salzburg said the Magyars returned to East Francia and ransacked the region of Vienna in 881 . The same source separately mentioned the <unk> , or Kabars , plundering the region of <unk> or <unk> in the same year , showing that the Kabars formed a distinct group . In the early 880s , a " king " of the Magyars had an amicable meeting with Methodius , Archbishop of Moravia , who was returning from Constantinople to Moravia , according to Methodius ' legend . 
 When the King of Hungary came to the lands of the Danube , Methodius wished to see him . And though some were assuming and saying : " He will not escape torment , " Methodius went to [ the king ] . And as befits a sovereign , [ the king ] received [ Methodius ] with honor , solemnity , and joy . Having conversed with [ Methodius ] as befits such men to converse , [ the king ] dismissed [ Methodius ] with an embrace an many gifts . Kissing him , [ the king ] said : " O venerable Father , remember me always in your holy prayers . "

 The Magyars returned to Central Europe in July 892 , when they invaded Moravia in alliance with Arnulf , king of East Francia . Two years later , they stormed into the March of Pannonia . According to the Annals of Fulda , they " killed men and old women outright , and carried out the young women alone with them like cattle to satisfy their lusts " . Although this source does not refer to an alliance between the Magyars and Svatopluk I of Moravia , most historians agree the Moravian ruler persuaded them to invade East Francia . During their raids in the Carpathian Basin , the Magyars had several opportunities to collect information on their future homeland . 
 The Samanid emir , Isma 'il ibn Ahmad , launched an expedition against the Oghuz Turks in 893 , forcing them to invade the Pechenegs ' lands between the Volga and Ural rivers . After being expelled from their homeland , the Pechenegs departed for the west in search of new pastures . The Magyars had in the meantime invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise . Simeon I of Bulgaria sent envoys to the Pechenegs and persuaded them to storm into Etelköz . The unexpected invasion destroyed the unguarded dwelling places of the Magyars , forcing them to leave the Pontic steppes and seek refuge over the Carpathian Mountains . The Magyars occupied their new homeland in several phases , initially settling the lands east of the Danube and only invading the March of Pannonia after Arnulf of East Francia died in 899 . They destroyed Moravia before 906 and consolidated their control of the Carpathian Basin through their victory over a Bavarian army in the Battle of Brezalauspurc in 907 .

 Most Neolithic settlements were situated on the banks of rivers and lakes in the proposed original homeland of the Uralic peoples , but no houses have been excavated there . The local inhabitants primarily used tools made of stone – especially jasper from the southern Urals – , bone and wood , but baked clay vessels decorated with broken or wavy lines were also found . Their economy was based on fishing , hunting , and gathering . The basic Hungarian words connected to these activities – <unk> ( net ) , <unk> ( bow ) , <unk> ( arrow ) , <unk> ( bowstring ) , and mony ( egg ) – are inherited from the Proto @-@ Uralic period . Paleolithic drawings on rocks in the Urals depict scenes of hunting for reindeer and moose . The Hungarian words for house ( <unk> ) , dwelling ( lak ) , door ( <unk> ) , and bed ( <unk> ) are of Proto @-@ Finno @-@ Ugric origin . Houses built in the presumed Finno @-@ Ugric homeland in the wider region of the Urals in the 3rd millennium BC show regional differences ; in the valley of the <unk> River , square pit @-@ houses were dug deep into the ground ; along the Kama River , rectangular semi @-@ pit houses were built . The local people were hunter @-@ gatherers . They used egg @-@ shaped , baked clay vessels that were decorated with <unk> , triangles , and other geometrical forms . They buried their dead in shallow graves and showered the bodies with red ochre . They also placed objects including tools , jewels made of pierced boar tusks , and small pendants in the form of animal heads into the graves . Copper objects found in the graves , which were manufactured in the Caucasus Mountains , indicate that the inhabitants of the lands on both sides of the Ural Mountains had trading contacts with faraway territories around 2000 BC . Words from the Proto @-@ Ugric period – ló ( " horse " ) , <unk> ( " saddle " ) , <unk> ( " bridle " ) , and <unk> ( " wagon " ) – show that those who spoke this language rode horses . Animal husbandry spread on both sides of the Urals from around 1500 BC . The bones of domestic animals – cattle , goats , sheep , pigs , and horses – comprised 90 % of all animal bones excavated in many settlements . Loan words from Proto @-@ Iranian suggest the Ugric @-@ speaking populations adopted animal husbandry from neighboring peoples . For instance , the Hungarian words for cow ( <unk> ) and milk ( <unk> ) are of Proto @-@ Iranian origin . Archaeological finds – including seeds of millet , wheat , and barley , and tools including sickles , hoes , and spade handles – prove the local population also cultivated arable lands . 
 The Magyars ' ancestors gave up their settled way of life because of the northward expansion of the steppes during the last centuries of the 2nd millennium BC . Ethnographic studies of modern nomadic populations suggest cyclic migrations – a year @-@ by @-@ year movement between their winter and summer camps – featured in their way of life , but they also cultivated arable lands around their winter camps . Most historians agree the Magyars had a mixed nomadic or semi @-@ nomadic economy , characterized by both the raising of cattle and the cultivation of arable lands . Turkic loanwords in the Hungarian language show the Magyars adopted many practices of animal husbandry and agriculture from the Turkic peoples between the 5th and 9th centuries . For instance , the Hungarian words for pig ( <unk> ) , castrated hog ( <unk> ) , ox ( <unk> ) , barley ( <unk> ) , garden ( <unk> ) , plough ( eke ) , weed ( <unk> ) , refuse of grain ( <unk> ) , fallow land ( <unk> ) , and sickle ( <unk> ) are of Turkic origin . Most loanwords were borrowed from Bulgar or other Chuvash @-@ type Turkic language , but the place and the time of the borrowings are uncertain . The Magyars ' connections with the people of the Saltovo @-@ Mayaki culture may have contributed to the development of their agriculture , according to Spinei . 
 According to Ibn Rusta , the late 9th @-@ century Magyars " dwell in tents and move from place to place in search of pasturage " , but during the winters they settled along the nearest river , where they lived by fishing . He also said their " land is well watered and harvests abundant " , showing they had arable lands , although it is unclear whether those lands were cultivated by the Magyars themselves or by their prisoners . Taxes collected from the neighboring peoples , a slave trade , and plundering raids made the Magyars a wealthy people . <unk> wrote that they were " a handsome people and of good appearance and their clothes are of silk brocade and their weapons are of silver and are encrusted with pearls " , proving their growing wealth . However , 9th @-@ century Byzantine and Muslim coins have rarely been found in the Pontic steppes . 
 Archaeological finds from the Carpathian Basin provide evidence of the crafts practiced by the Magyars . 10th @-@ century warriors ' graves yielding sabres , arrow @-@ heads , spear @-@ heads , stirrups , and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre @-@ eminent role in the militarized Magyar society . Engraved or gilded sabres and <unk> plates – often decorated with precious stones – and golden or silver pectoral disks evidence the high levels of skills of Magyar <unk> and silversmiths . Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp . The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck . Ear @-@ rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors ; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows . In contrast , Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf @-@ like pendants , ear @-@ rings , decorated pectoral disks , and rings with gemstones . 
 A man seeking a bride was expected to pay a bride price to her father before the marriage took place , according to Gardizi 's description of the late 9th @-@ century Magyars . The Hungarian word for bridegroom – <unk> from <unk> <unk> ( " purchasing lad " ) – and the expression <unk> <unk> ( verbatim , " bride for sale " ) confirm the reliability of the Muslim author 's report . A decree of Stephen I of Hungary prohibiting the abduction of a girl without her parents ' consent implies that pretended abduction of the bride by her future husband was an integral part of ancient Magyar matrimonial ceremonies . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 The Magyars ' military tactics were similar to those of the Huns , Avars , Pechenegs , Mongols , and other nomadic peoples . According to Emperor Leo the Wise , the main components of Magyar warfare were long @-@ distance arrow @-@ fire , surprise attack , and feigned retreat . However , the contemporaneous Regino of Prüm said the Magyars knew " nothing about ... taking besieged cities " . Archaeological research confirms Leo the Wise 's report of the use of sabres , bows , and arrows . However , in contrast with the emperor 's report , spears have rarely been found in Magyar warriors ' tombs . Their most important weapons were bone @-@ reinforced reflex bows , with which they could shoot at a specific target within 60 – 70 metres ( 200 – 230 ft ) . 
 In battle [ the Magyars ] do not line up as do the [ Byzantines ] in three divisions , but in several units of irregular size , linking the divisions close to one another although separated by short distances , so that they give the impression of one battle line . Apart from their battle line , they maintain an additional force that they send out to ambush careless adversaries of theirs or hold in reserve to support a hard @-@ pressed section . ... Frequently they tie the extra horses together to the rear , that is , behind their battle line , as protection for it . They make the depth of the files , that is , the rows , of their battle line irregular because they consider it more important that the line should be thick than deep , and they make their front even and dense . They prefer battles fought at long range , ambushes , encircling their adversaries , simulated withdrawals and wheeling about , and scattered formations . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Modern scholarly theories of the Magyars ' pagan religious beliefs and practices are primarily based on reports by biased medieval authors and prohibitions enacted during the reigns of Christian kings . Both Christian and Muslim sources say the Magyars worshipped forces of nature . They gave offering to trees , fountains , and stones , and made sacrifices at wells ; these are evidenced by the prohibition of such practices during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary in the late 11th century . In accordance with the custom of the peoples of the Eurasian steppes , the pagan Magyars swore oaths on dogs , which were bisected to warn potential <unk> of their fate . Simon of Kéza also wrote about the sacrifice of horses . According to the Gesta Hungarorum , the seven Magyar chiefs confirmed their treaty " in pagan manner with their own blood spilled in a single vessel " . 
 Scholars studying the Magyars ' religion also take into account ethnographic analogies , folklore , linguistic evidence , and archaeological research . Artifacts depicting a bird of prey or a tree of life imply both symbols were important elements of the Magyar religion . Trepanation – the real or symbolic wounding of the cranium – was widely practiced by 10th @-@ century Magyars . Gyula László writes that real trepanations – the opening of the skull with a <unk> and the closing of the wound with a sheet of silver – were actually surgical operations similarly to those already practiced by Arab physicians , whereas symbolic trepanations – the marking of the skull with an incised circle – were aimed at the disposal of a protective talisman on the head . According to Róna @-@ Tas , a Hungarian word for cunning , ( <unk> ) – verbatim " with a drilled brain " – may reflect these ancient practices . 
 The Magyars buried their dead , laying the deceased on their backs with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their <unk> . A deceased warrior 's tomb always contained material connected with his horse . These are most frequently its skin , skull , and the lower legs ; these were put into its master 's grave , but occasionally only the harness was buried together with the warrior , or the horse 's skin was stuffed with hay . The Magyars rolled the corpses in textiles or mats and placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth . 
 Scholarly theories note the similarities between the táltos of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans , but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven . Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary , including <unk> ( " witch " ) , <unk> ( " to charm " ) , and the ancient Hungarian word for holy ( <unk> or <unk> ) , are of Turkic origin . Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary : <unk> ( indulgence ) , <unk> ( sin ) , <unk> ( confess ) , <unk> ( god ) , and <unk> ( devil ) . According to Gyula László , a Hungarian children 's verse that refers to a fife , a drum , and a reed violin preserves the memory of a pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise . The refrain of another children 's verse , which mentions three days of the week in reverse order , may have preserved an ancient belief in the existence of an afterlife world where everything is upside @-@ down . 
 Stork , oh stork , oh little stork , 
 What has made your leg bleed so ? 
 A Turkish child made the cut , 
 A Magyar child will cure it 
 With fife and drum and a reed violin . 
 = All That Glitters ( TV series ) = 
 All That Glitters is an American sitcom by producer Norman Lear . It consisted of 65 episodes and aired between April 18 and July 15 , 1977 in broadcast syndication . The show , a spoof of the soap opera format , depicted the trials and tribulations of a group of executives at the Globatron corporation . The twist of the series was that it was set within a world of complete role @-@ reversal : Women were the " stronger sex , " the executives and breadwinners , while the " weaker sex " – the men – were the secretaries or stay @-@ at @-@ home <unk> . Men were often treated as sex objects . 
 The series features Eileen Brennan , Greg Evigan , Lois Nettleton , Gary Sandy , Tim <unk> and Jessica Walter . Comic actor and cartoon voice artist Chuck McCann was also a regular . Linda Gray played transgender fashion model Linda Murkland , the first transgender series regular on American television . 
 Before and after its premiere , All That Glitters was negatively received and the series lasted just 13 weeks .

 All That Glitters was series creator Norman Lear 's attempt to duplicate his success with the syndicated soap opera spoof Mary Hartman , Mary Hartman . Lear described the premise simply : " God created Eve first , took out her rib and gave her a companion so she wouldn 't be lonely . " Lear came up with the idea on a trip to Washington , D.C. : 
 " I had visited the Institute of Policy Studies , and I just loved the whole thing . And I thought there was a series in it — a five @-@ times @-@ a @-@ week series : I went to bed thinking about that , and I woke up the next morning thinking what would happen if the male @-@ female equation were changed ? What would happen if the women had all the power and all the advantage , and the men had what the women normally would have ? ” 
 The world of All That Glitters had always been female @-@ dominated but Lear also used the series to comment on changing sex roles in the United States in the 1970s . 
 Former Major League Baseball player Wes Parker almost literally walked into his role . He was doing play @-@ by @-@ play reporting for a Los Angeles television station owned by Lear 's partner , Jerry <unk> . " Lear casually asked if I 'd be interested in the part . I said yes , but knew it was out of the question , because in real life things don 't happen that way . Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show . I read for the part , got it and didn 't sleep at all that night . " Linda Gray was somewhat non @-@ <unk> upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland . " I remember meeting Norman and him saying , ' You 'll be perfect for the role . ' I didn 't know whether to take that as a compliment or what . " To prepare for her role , Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman . Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production . Lois Nettleton reportedly based her characterization of Christina Stockwood on Clark Gable . Production started in early March 1977 with director Herbert <unk> . 
 In test screenings prior to its premiere , reaction to the show was sharply divided . According to executive producer Stephanie Sills , the strongest negative reaction came from male executives . " They didn 't mind being portrayed by women . It was simply that they detest the way we depicted them . " Feminists were uncertain how to react to the series , with some being concerned that audiences would not perceive the show as satire but as an attempt to represent how a female @-@ dominated society would actually operate . Lear marketed the program through his company , TAT Syndication . The series ran five nights a week .

 All That Glitters debuted the week of April 18 , 1977 on about 40 stations in late @-@ night syndication . It was poorly critically received , with one reviewer going so far as to call the show 's theme song " blasphemous " for suggesting that God was female and created Eve first . Time magazine sharply criticized the series , calling it " embarrassingly amateurish " , with " flaccid " and " wearying " jokes , flat writing , " mediocre " acting and " aimless " direction . The Wall Street Journal concurred , saying that while the series ' role @-@ reversal premise may have been adequate for a play or film , it was too limiting to serve as the basis for a continuing series . These limitations showed up most clearly , the Journal says , in the lead performances . Although praising the performers themselves as talented , they are cited for being " unable to infuse much life into their roles " . The Journal pegs the fundamental problem with All That Glitters as that " its characters are not people at all , merely composites of the least attractive characteristics of each sex . The satire focuses not on the way real , recognizable people behave , but on stereotypes and cliches about masculine and feminine attitudes . Even when stood on their heads , they still remain stereotypes and cliches . " 
 New Times Magazine was much more receptive to the series . Although labeling it " unquestionably the weirdest [ show ] that Lear has ever produced " , New Times found that the series was not " a satire of mannerisms but of attitudes " . All That Glitters required that viewers watch closely to pick up on the subtleties and nuances , " not so much for what the show says , but for the way that it 's said " . 
 All That Glitters , after initially capturing 20 % of viewers in major markets in its opening weeks , had lost about half of that audience mid @-@ way through its run . The series was cancelled after 13 weeks , last airing on July 15 , 1977 . Although the show was panned , it and Lear , along with Mary Hartman , Mary Hartman , are credited with expanding the subject matter that television producers were able to explore with lessened fear of antagonizing sponsors or viewers . 
 In the years since the series , it has garnered something of a positive reputation , with one critic listing it and other Lear efforts as " imaginative shows that contained some of the most striking satires of television and American society ever broadcast " . 
 While the show itself was unsuccessful , it did spawn a hit song . " You Don 't Bring Me Flowers " , which had been written with the intention of its being the theme song , was recorded by Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand and made it to # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 . By the time the show made it to air , another song had been chosen as the theme . The replacement , " Genesis Revisited " , was later described by the New York Times as " <unk> [ ing ] with witty rhymes and a punchy good humor " . The song was performed by Kenny Rankin . The lyrics for both songs were written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman ( the music for " Genesis Revisited " is credited solely to Alan Bergman ) . 
 = Hurricane Vince = 
 Hurricane Vince was an unusual hurricane that developed in the northeastern Atlantic basin . Forming in October during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , it strengthened over waters thought to be too cold for tropical development . Vince was the twentieth named tropical cyclone and twelfth hurricane of the extremely active season . 
 Vince developed from an extratropical system on October 8 , becoming a subtropical storm southeast of the Azores . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) did not officially name the storm until the next day , shortly before Vince became a hurricane . The storm weakened at sea and made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula as a tropical depression on October 11 . Vince was the first tropical system to do so since the 1842 Spain hurricane . It dissipated over Spain , bringing much needed rain to the region , and its remnants passed into the Mediterranean Sea . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On October 5 , an operationally unnamed subtropical storm which had gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low , which was moving to the southeast over the Azores . The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm . The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on October 8 , 580 miles ( 930 km ) southeast of Lajes in the Azores . However , the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time , because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone . The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day . Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) , much colder than the 26 @.@ 5 ° C ( 80 ° F ) usually required for tropical development . 
 Soon after it became a tropical storm on October 9 near Madeira , with a ragged eye already present , the NHC officially named it Tropical Storm Vince and began to issue advisories . At the time there was some uncertainty as to whether Vince was tropical or subtropical but , in his post @-@ season analysis , forecaster James L. Franklin of the NHC conceded that Vince had formed as a subtropical storm and had evolved into a tropical storm before it was named . The storm 's ragged eye quickly solidified and contracted into a " bona fide " eye with a diameter of 15 mi ( 25 km ) . This increase in organization was accompanied by strengthening , and Vince reached its peak strength as a hurricane with 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds later that day . The NHC forecaster decided that " if it looks like a hurricane , it probably is , despite its environment and unusual location " . 
 Hurricane Vince 's impressive organization was very short lived as westerly wind shear began to erode the eye within hours . In response , the storm weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter . A broad low @-@ level trough approached the storm from the northwest , pulling the convection northward as the storm 's low @-@ level center accelerated eastward . On October 10 , two brief bursts of convection surprised forecasters , but with the sea surface temperature as low as 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) , the flares were not sustained . Vince continued to weaken as it approached the Iberian Peninsula and became a tropical depression on October 11 , shortly before it made landfall near Huelva , Spain . The fast @-@ moving tropical depression quickly dissipated over land . Its remnants moved across southern Spain , dumping rain on the drought @-@ ridden region , and moved into the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante in the early hours of October 12 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 The Spanish Center for Emergency Coordination declared a rain pre @-@ emergency for the province of Castellón in the anticipation that Hurricane Vince would bring rains capable of flooding . The Instituto Nacional de Meteorología ( <unk> ) issued a bulletin that warned of a 40 % chance of flooding . Four Spanish autonomous communities ( Asturias , Catalonia , Castile and León , and Galicia ) issued flood warnings , and Canarias issued a wind warning . Spanish fishing fleets off the Andalusian coast returned to port and weathered the storm on their moorings rather than in the open ocean . 
 Spain 's population , which had been battling fires after a record breaking summer drought , welcomed the rains brought by Vince 's remnants . In two days the storm brought more rain to the province of A Coruña than had fallen all summer , easing the sinking water levels in provincial reservoirs , but also causing traffic jams and minor floods . In Córdoba province , the A @-@ 303 , A @-@ 306 and OC @-@ 293 roads were partially flooded but " passable with caution " . Municipal roadworks on la Ronda de <unk> , a major traffic artery connecting the city to nearby highways , were flooded and partially destroyed . The entrance of the University of A Coruña was temporarily blocked by flood waters on October 11 , and a nearby roundabout was submerged . These damages were minor , and no fatalities were reported . The highest winds reported on land were 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) at Jerez , Spain , although some ships recorded stronger . Vince was comparable to normal rain events from temperate systems , with only 1 to 2 inches ( 25 to 50 mm ) of rain falling . Through a play on words of a song in the musical My Fair Lady , National Hurricane Center forecaster James Franklin in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Vince wrote , " the rain in Spain was mainly less than 2 inches , although 3 @.@ 30 inches ( 84 mm ) fell in the plain at Córdoba . " 
 = = Records and naming = = 
 Although Hurricane Vince developed in an unusual location in the northeastern Atlantic , well away from where tropical cyclones are usually found , it is neither the most northerly @-@ forming nor the most easterly @-@ forming Atlantic tropical storm ; these records are held by Alberto of the 1988 season at 41 @.@ 5 ° N , and Ginger of the 1967 season at 18 @.@ 1 ° W , respectively . 
 Hurricane Vince developed into a hurricane farther east than any other known storm , at 18 @.@ 9 ° W. The National Hurricane Center declared that Vince was the first tropical cyclone on record to have made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula . Historical documents , however , suggest that a possibly stronger tropical storm , the 1842 Spain hurricane , struck the Iberian Peninsula on October 29 , 1842 . Vince 's record north was broken by Tropical Storm Grace in 2009 . 
 When Subtropical Storm Vince formed on October 8 , it was the earliest in the season that the twenty @-@ first tropical or subtropical storm had ever developed , 38 days ahead of the previous record held by Tropical Storm Twenty @-@ one of the 1933 season . Hurricane Vince was also the first named " V " storm in the Atlantic since naming began in 1950 . Because the storm did not cause significant damage , the name Vince was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization . 
 = Hurricane Arlene ( 1987 ) = 
 Hurricane Arlene was the first named storm and longest @-@ lived tropical cyclone of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season . Forming out of an area of low pressure associated with a decaying frontal system along the North Carolina coastline , Arlene tracked in a general eastward direction across the Atlantic Ocean , taking an erratic track with several curves . On August 13 , the storm brushed Bermuda as a weak tropical storm before continuing out to sea . On August 20 , the storm briefly stalled before becoming a hurricane two days later . Early on August 24 , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the far north Atlantic before curving southeast and dissipating near the Iberian Peninsula on August 26 . 
 In Bermuda , Arlene produced winds up to 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) and waves up to 12 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) ; however , little damage resulted from the storm . Offshore , a blind man was undertaking a challenge to become the first blind man to cross the Atlantic alone ; he encountered rough seas and high winds from the storm , causing US $ 8 @,@ 000 in damages to his ship over a two @-@ day span . Between August 26 and 27 , the remnants of the system produced heavy rains over portions of Western Europe . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Arlene originated out of an area of low pressure associated with a decaying frontal system along the North Carolina coastline on August 8 . Tracking towards the southeast in a gradual anticyclonic loop , the system slowly increased in organization and intensity . By August 10 , the low neared the Bahamas but remained disorganized . The following day , while located over Andros Island , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) upgraded the system to a tropical depression , the third of the season , based on its appearance on satellite imagery . 
 Upon becoming a depression on August 10 , the forward movement of the storm shifted to the northwest in response to an approaching trough off the Eastern United States and an elongated subtropical ridge to the south . The depression intensified into a tropical storm at 1800 UTC on August 11 ; however , operationally it was not upgraded until a reconnaissance mission by the hurricane hunters found flight @-@ level winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . The storm tracked towards Bermuda along a trough of low pressure in the Atlantic Ocean . 
 Throughout August 13 , the proximity of Arlene to the trough prevented significant development . Around 1500 UTC , the center of Arlene tracked about 55 mi ( 89 km ) north of Bermuda . Several hours later , a ship near the center of the storm reported 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) winds ; however , due to the disorganized presentation of the storm , these winds were not considered to be representative of Arlene 's true intensity . Over the following several days , the storm tracked around several low pressure systems . By August 15 , Arlene traveled southeast before re @-@ curving to the northeast on August 18 . The intensity of the storm also continuously fluctuated during this period peaking at 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) and was as low as 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) . 
 The northeast movement followed a passing short @-@ wave trough on August 18 ; the forward motion of the storm also increased due to the trough . On August 20 , the steering currents around Arlene collapsed , leading to the storm nearly stalling for 24 hours . During this period , the storm developed excellent outflow and intensified . Operationally , Arlene was upgraded to a hurricane at 2200 UTC on August 20 based on the appearance of an eye @-@ feature on satellite imagery ; however , post @-@ storm analysis indicated that the storm did not attain hurricane @-@ status until 0600 UTC on August 22 . This occurred 14 @.@ 5 days after its formation . 
 Upon attaining hurricane @-@ status , Arlene rapidly tracked northward due to a strengthening area of high pressure near the Azores . Shortly after , the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 987 mbar ( hPa ) . Continuing rapidly northward , the hurricane began to interact with a baroclinic zone over the cold waters of the north Atlantic . This resulted in the storm undergoing an extratropical transition which it completed by 0000 UTC on August 24 . The extratropical remnants of the storm continued to track around the periphery of the high pressure system , turning towards the southeast the following day . By August 26 , the storm became increasingly disorganized and hard to pinpoint on satellite imagery . The storm finally dissipated at 1800 UTC off the coast of Portugal that day .

 As Tropical Storm Arlene tracked towards Bermuda , residents on the island were advised to take precautions and board up their homes . This followed the issuance of a tropical storm advisory for the island . On August 12 , Arlene produced squally weather throughout Bermuda as the outer bands impacted the region .

 = Great northern tilefish = 
 The great northern tilefish ( Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps ) , or golden tile , is the largest species in the family Malacanthidae ( <unk> ) , which grows to an average length between 38 and 44 inches ( 970 and 1 @,@ 120 mm ) . The great northern tilefish is a slow @-@ growing and long @-@ lived species , which has four stages of life . After hatching from eggs , the larvae will be found in plankton . As they grow into juveniles , the individuals will seek shelter until finding or making their own burrows . As adults , the tilefish will continue to expand its burrow in the sediment throughout its life . The diet of the larvae is unknown , but presumed to consist of zooplankton ; juveniles and adults feed upon various benthic invertebrates , crustaceans and fish . After reaching sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years of age , females will lay eggs throughout the mating season for the male to fertilize , with each female laying an average of 2 @.@ 3 million eggs . 
 The great northern tilefish has been subject to regulation to prevent overfishing . Regulations include catch limits and gear restrictions to prevent damage to the species ' habitat and population . The result of these regulations has seen a rebounding of the population , which led to an increase in the 2012 catch limit in the southern part of the Atlantic seaboard . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The species was first discovered in 1879 , when a cod trawler caught some by chance while working off of the coast of Massachusetts . The species was named Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps by George Brown Goode and Tarleton Hoffman Bean in 1896 in their seminal work Oceanic Ichthyology , A Treatise on the Deep @-@ Sea and Pelagic Fishes of the World , from a sample collected 80 miles ( 130 km ) south east of <unk> Land , Massachusetts . Its genus is Lopholatilus , which itself is in the family Malacanthidae , commonly known as tilefish . The Malacanthidae are part of the <unk> , a suborder of the order Perciformes . L. chamaeleonticeps gained its moniker " great northern tilefish " from its prodigious size and its discovery at relatively high latitudes for a member of Malacanthidae . When used in cooking , the species is generally referred to as the " golden tile " , for the large yellow spots across its blue @-@ green back and lighter @-@ yellow or pink sides . The species is distinguished from other members of their large family by a prominent crest on their head . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The great northern tilefish is the largest species of the family Malacanthidae ; male specimens can grow up to 112 centimetres ( 44 in ) FL ( fork length ) and females to 100 centimetres ( 39 in ) FL . During their first four years of life , they grow at a rate of typically <unk> / yr after which their rate of growth slows down . They grow reach sexual maturity once they are between 50 and 70 centimetres ( 20 and 28 in ) in length Various studies have shown that the life expectancy of fish that survive into adulthood is in the range 25 – 35 years . 
 The back of the fish is iridescent and blue @-@ green in color , with many yellow and gold spots . The belly is white . The head color changes from a light blue to a pinkish mix during spawning season . Specimens have a tone of blue under their eyes . Their pectoral fins are a light tone of sepia , and the margin of the anal fin is a purplish @-@ blue color . 
 Lengths at age suggest that males grow faster than females , but the observed ages showed that females live longer . The largest male specimen was 44 @.@ 1 in ( 1 @,@ 120 mm ) long and approximately 20 years old , the largest female specimen was 39 years old and reached a total length of 40 @.@ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 020 mm ) . The oldest tilefish recorded to date was a 46 @-@ year @-@ old female specimen that reached lengths of 33 @.@ 5 in ( 850 mm ) , while the oldest recorded male specimen was 41 @.@ 3 in ( 1 @,@ 050 mm ) and 29 years . This study shows that the Female specimens may be smaller than the males , but their lifespan is longer than the males . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The great northern tilefish has a unique burrowing behavior and habitat preference . In addition to their unique habitat choice , golden tilefish display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over their female counterparts . The great northern tilefish is not a migratory fish ; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round . It is theorized that seasonal migration may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring , but this theory has no definitive evidence . A competing theory suggests that the tilefish may instead reduce its activity or hibernate within its burrows during times of cold temperatures . 
 The life cycle of the great northern tilefish begins as an egg , which is non @-@ adhesive and buoyant . Eggs that are artificially fertilized and kept in an environment between 71 ° F ( 22 ° C ) to 76 ° F ( 24 ° C ) hatch after 40 hours . The hatching larvae are around .1 inches ( 2 @.@ 5 mm ) in length . The larvae are found in plankton from July to September in the Middle Atlantic Bight . The transitional phase between larvae to juveniles is unknown , but juveniles either find or excavate a burrow or place of shelter to inhabit . After they grow in size and become sexually active the adults will spawn throughout the mating season to propagate the species . 
 The tilefish 's construction and expansion of burrows are the subject of ongoing research to better understand the behavior of the species . It is unknown if the tilefish begins the construction a burrow or if it expands an existing one . The burrow is presumed to be lengthened and widened by the tilefish as it continues to grow and age . Tilefish typically are found in their own burrows , with sharing have been exhibited with male and female pairs . Tilefish tend to congregate in their habitat , with their burrows in relative proximity to each other , the species does not form schools . The grouping of tilefish can be as dense as 13 @,@ 000 burrows per square kilometer off the southern U.S. Atlantic coast , but 1 @,@ 600 burrows per square kilometer were reported in inhabited areas of the Gulf of Mexico and 2 @,@ 500 burrows per square kilometer near the Hudson Canyon . Tilefish burrows also provide a home for various different species that live in the area , such as mollusks and other crustaceans . 
 = = = Predation = = = 
 The predators of the tilefish are poorly understood . Juveniles can be preyed upon by dogfish or conger eels , which are prey for adult tilefish . Sharks have been presumed be predators of the tilefish , but there is no evidence of free @-@ swimming tilefish being attacked by dusky sharks or sandbar sharks . The one listed predator for the tilefish is the <unk> . Two studies in the 1980s concluded that the function of the tilefish 's burrows were predator avoidance , but this has been disputed because chased tilefish try to out @-@ swim its predators rather than entering its burrow to seek shelter . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The diet of tilefish larvae is unknown , but it is believed to be zooplankton . Juvenile and adults are omnivorous with a preference for small benthic invertebrates , with a staple being crabs and lobster . Great northern tilefish also consume bivalve molluscs , salps , squid , Atlantic dogfish , <unk> , hagfish and herring . Human trash is also eaten , including potato peels and meat bones have also been noted . It will also eat other tilefish in a display of cannibalistic characteristics . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 The fish spawn during the early spring to the late fall , from March to November . Peak spawning occurs during May to September in Mid @-@ Atlantic Bight regions , differences in temperatures affect the breeding time . In U.S waters further south the spawning season occurs from April to June . Males grow faster and reach larger size than females . Fishing pressure may cause males to spawn at smaller sizes , and at a younger age . 
 The spawning behavior of the species is unknown , but it is presumed to be polygamous with the female choosing the male . Pair bonding has been exhibited which is assumed to be a behavior that serves to insure fertilization of the eggs during the season . It was estimated that females can spawn approximately every four days for a total of 34 times per season . Depending on the size , the average female may lay up to 195 @,@ 000 – 8 million eggs during spawning season , with the average female laying 2 @.@ 3 million eggs . 
 In response to the over fishing , the tilefish 's age of sexual maturity has been dramatically affected . From 1978 to 1982 the median age of sexual maturity in males declined by 2 @.@ 5 years from 7 @.@ 1 to 4 @.@ 6 years . This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females . In 2008 , the median age of sexual maturity in males had risen to 5 @.@ 9 years . Females of the species also exhibit low reproducibility after becoming sexually mature , instead increasing with age and their sexual maturity has varied to a lesser extent then the male population across the years . 
 A small percentage of Golden tilefish are known to be intersexual , having opposite non @-@ functional sex @-@ tissues . Male tilefish specimens also inhibited a cavity that came from ovarian tissue and sperm sinuses . A study by Lombardi @-@ Carlson in 2012 found that tilefish of both genders in the Gulf of Mexico exhibited a higher rate of intersex characteristics than other populations . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The species is abundant in the United States territorial waters of the Atlantic ocean extending north into Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank and moving down along the east coast of the United States and into the Gulf of Mexico along the continental shelf . Great northern tilefish are have been reported to be most abundant between 300 feet ( 91 m ) and 480 feet ( 150 m ) deep at 76 ° F ( 24 ° C ) . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report differs , stating that the species live at the bottom of the ocean where they burrow into the sediment , between 250 feet ( 76 m ) and 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) deep where the temperature ranges from 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) and 58 ° F ( 14 ° C ) . 
 The great northern tilefish is known to dig and occupy burrows along the outer continental shelf , and on the flanks of submarine canyons in malleable clay substrate . Due to their long life expectancy , slow growth , complex breeding system , and habitat specificity , they are vulnerable to over @-@ exploitation , and they are susceptible to mass mortality events due to cold water intrusion and over @-@ fishing . Their abundance is strongly correlated with presence of silt @-@ clay substrate , because the soft clay enables the fish to create the burrow itself by simply digging away the clay substrate . It had been documented that the minimum temperature threshold for golden tilefish is 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) . Temperature observations and measurements are obtained via interpolated observations . Temperature plots indicate that 9 ° C ( 48 ° F ) is the norm for the area around Florida and the Gulf of Mexico . 
 = = Population and conservation status = = 
 Decline in age , size during sexual maturity in great northern tilefish population is occurring throughout the continental shelf . In the mid @-@ Atlantic Bight , smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008 , compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population . The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s . There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico . Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment due to the fact that without tilefish , the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear , therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter . 
 Fishing regulations include catch limits and gear restrictions to prevent damage to the species habitat and population . There are different gear restrictions for commercial and recreational fishers . In 2007 , regulations were imposed to reduce the harvesting by one third , as a response to overfishing in the South Atlantic . The South Atlantic catch limit was later increased in October 2012 as a response to the increased population . The 2013 limits in the souther U.S. Atlantic waters for the species , measured in gutted weight , is currently 405 @,@ 971 pounds for longline and 135 @,@ 324 pounds for hook @-@ and @-@ line fishing .

 Beatrice Alice Hicks ( January 2 , 1919 – October 21 , 1979 ) was an American engineer , the first woman engineer to be hired by Western Electric , and both co @-@ founder and first president of the Society of Women Engineers . Despite entering the field at a time where engineering was seen as an inappropriate career for a woman , Hicks held a variety of leadership positions and eventually became the owner of an engineering firm . During her time there , Hicks developed a gas density switch that would be used in the U.S. space program , including the Apollo moon landing missions . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Beatrice Hicks was born in 1919 in Orange , New Jersey , to William Lux Hicks , a chemical engineer , and Florence Benedict . Hicks decided at an early age that she wished to be an engineer . While her parents neither supported nor opposed Hicks ' desired career path , some of her teachers and classmates tried to discourage her from becoming an engineer , viewing it as a socially unacceptable role for a woman . She graduated from Orange High School in 1935 and received a bachelor 's degree in chemical engineering from Newark College of Engineering ( now New Jersey Institute of Technology ) in 1939 , one of only two women in her class . During college , Hicks worked in the treasury office of an Abercrombie & Fitch store as a telephone operator , and in the university 's library . After receiving her undergraduate degree , Hicks stayed at Newark College of Engineering for three years as a research assistant , where she studied the history of Edward Weston 's inventions and took additional classes at night . 
 = = Career = = 
 In 1942 Hicks took a job at the Western Electric Company , designing and testing quartz crystal oscillators in Kearny , New Jersey . She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as an engineer , and she spent three years working there . Upon the death of her father , she joined the Bloomfield , New Jersey based Newark Controls Company , a metalworking firm that her father had founded . Hicks served as chief engineer and then as vice president in charge of engineering , before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955 . Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program , including the moon landing , and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching structural limits . Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch . While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master 's degree in physics , which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute . 
 In 1950 Hicks and other women based on the East coast of the United States began meeting in an organization , the goal of which was to advance female engineers and increase female participation in engineering . The organization was incorporated as the Society of Women Engineers two years later . Hicks served as the president of the organization for two consecutive terms , from 1950 to 1952 . In 1963 the Society of Women Engineers presented their highest honor , the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award , to Hicks . Hicks toured the United States , championing the cause of female engineers through outreach and speaking engagements . She believed that while female engineers would initially be closely watched , they would also be quickly accepted . 
 In 1948 Hicks married fellow engineer Rodney Duane Chipp , who held two director level engineering positions before starting a consulting firm . In 1960 the couple were selected by the National Society of Professional Engineers for a month @-@ long research and speaking tour of South America , which focused on international cooperation between American and South American engineers . When Chipp died in 1966 , Hicks sold off Newark Controls Company and took over her late husband 's consulting business . Hicks was also selected to serve on the Defense Advisory Committee for Women in Services between 1960 and 1963 , was the director of the First International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists , and represented the United States at four International Management Congresses . 
 Hicks died on October 21 , 1979 in Princeton , New Jersey .

 Because of her role in Newark Controls Company , Mademoiselle magazine named Hicks " Woman of the Year in Business " in 1952 . In 1978 Hicks was invited to join the National Academy of Engineering , the highest professional honor in engineering , and became the sixth woman to join the organization . In 2002 Hicks was inducted into the National Women 's Hall of Fame . 
 Hicks received honorary doctorates from Hobart and William Smith College , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , Stevens Institute of Technology , and Worcester Polytechnic Institute . She was the first female recipient of an honorary doctorate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute . She was a member of both the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers . 
 = Chudleigh , Tasmania = 
 Chudleigh is a small rural village 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) west of Launceston in northern Tasmania , Australia . The town is in the Chudleigh Valley , between the Gog range and the Great Western Tiers . The area is primarily used for farming , though timber and lime production have been significant industries . The fertile flats of the valley are of alluvial origin , from the Permian era . The Chudleigh show , run by the Agricultural and Horticultural society , is an agricultural show held each February . Since 1889 the show has been held 125 times , and it is one of the state 's oldest such events . 
 The area had been the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal Tasmanians for thousands of years . European settlement and disease drove them from the lands and decimated their population . Chudleigh was first settled by Europeans in the 1830s for agriculture and lime production . The town was laid out , probably prior to 1835 , to have up to 5000 residents though the population never became large . An early resident , John Badcock Gardiner , named Chudleigh , probably after Chudleigh in Devon , England . During the 19th century a town hall , four churches , a school , an inn , post office , police station and telegraph office were built . Over time the churches , school , inn and post office have closed . A rail line from Deloraine to Mole Creek served the town from 1890 till its closure in 1985 . 
 Chudleigh has a population , as measured by the 2011 census , of 335 . The town has a privately run wildlife park , a shop selling and making honey products , and a few other stores . As part of a beautification drive in 2001 , the main street was planted with roses , and the town is now promoted as a " village of roses " . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Chudleigh lies 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) west of Launceston and 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) east of Mole Creek in northern Tasmania , Australia . The town is in the fertile Chudleigh Valley that is bounded by the Gog and Magog ranges , to the north , and the Great Western Tiers , to the south @-@ west . The town itself is just south of the Lobster rivulet , a tributary of the Mersey river which also runs near the town to the north . The land around the town is mostly suited to grazing , intensive grazing in some areas , though some is marginal cropping land that requires careful crop rotation interspersed with seasons where the land is left fallow . The hills of the area have prominent basalt , limestone and dolerite depending on location . The fertile flats are of alluvial origin with Permian era sediments that have formed mudstone and sandstone . Some areas are notably frosty in winter and experience occasional snowfall . 
 = = History = = 
 Aboriginal Tasmanians have lived on the island of Tasmania for thousands of years . The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River , 35 @,@ 000 years before the present . Prior to European settlement , Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe . Their range included Deloraine , east of Chudleigh , and the Gog mountain range to the north @-@ west where they mined ochre in the <unk> ochre pits . The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have a camping ground , where the Church of England cemetery was established later . Land clearing , road construction , disease and conflicts with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population . Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827 @-@ 30 . At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area was covered with bogs and wild bush . 
 During the early 1820s the Van Diemen 's Land Company created a track or stock route from Deloraine to Emu Bay ( now Burnie ) that ran via Chudleigh and Mole Creek . The route enabled them to move grazing livestock from the higher rainfall areas in the west of Tasmania , to the population centres further east . The company built facilities , including a store , in Chudleigh . Europeans settled the area west of Deloraine from the early 1800s , and cattle were being grazed — illegally — in the Chudleigh area from as early as 1823 . John Badcock Gardiner , who probably named Chudleigh after the village with the same name in Devon , England , was granted 850 acres ( 340 ha ) in the area after arriving in Tasmania in 1829 with his family . The town 's area was first granted to Lieutenant Travers Hartley Vaughan in 1830 . Vaughan sold the land in 1837 to Henry Reid , who was later briefly a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council . 
 An early industry in the area was limestone mining and lime production . By 1831 a lime burning industry had been established . The lime was sent to Launceston for use in construction . The town of Chudleigh was surveyed and marked into town blocks , many of them 10 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) . The date of this survey is not recorded but it was likely done by John Batman , founder of Melbourne , prior to 1835 . The town was laid out to hold a population of 5 @,@ 000 , as it was intended to be a railway junction on a line from Launceston to North West Tasmania . Later road and transport developments caused the idea of such a large settlement at Chudleigh to be abandoned . Dan Picket , an ex @-@ convict who has been granted a ticket of leave , built the first hotel , the two @-@ storey Chudleigh Inn , around 1850 . The building was later reduced to a single storey . This hotel or inn was noted as being used by 1851 . A police watch house was completed <unk> By 1862 an extensive system of caves had been discovered in the area , attracting visitors . 
 In the 1860s a 30 @-@ by @-@ 11 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 by 3 @.@ 4 m ) single @-@ room school building was constructed . The school opened 1 July 1864 with 14 pupils and a single teacher , though it apparently closed sometime after and reopened 28 January 1883 with a larger class of 34 pupils . In 1884 a new building , and teacher 's residence , was completed at a cost of 1531 pounds . The new school was on the road to Mole Creek near the bridge over Lobster Rivulet , and had around 26 – 27 students . The school suffered regular flooding of the building , access roads and paths . Due to this flooding it was moved , in the 1930s , to next to the Methodist chapel in Sorrell street . The school was extended in 1936 and remained in operation until closed , by the Tasmanian education department due to low student numbers , on 30 September 1965 . From then students had to travel to the school at Mole Creek . The township of Chudleigh was formally declared in 1866 . It continued to expand and by 1883 also had a post and telegraph office , two stores , two churches , and over a dozen houses . An agricultural and horticultural show was first held in 1889 . The Chudleigh Agricultural and Horticultural Society has run the show annually since , except for breaks from 1914 – 28 and 1939 – 45 due to the two World Wars . The show has been run on various grounds , but the present one has been used since it was purchased in 1932 . 
 Chudleigh 's town hall was completed in 1895 , and opened during a public event on 11 April that year . It was funded by public subscription and built local builder Davis Brothers on donated land . It was built as a 46 by 26 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 by 7 @.@ 9 m ) weather board building set on stone foundations , with a corrugated iron roof . There was a near tragedy in the hall in late 1922 when a generator caught fire while the hall was being used by 300 people . The inwards opening doors and lack of a fire door were cited as significant problems . Chudleigh had a post office from 1865 . Around 1899 it was moved to a new building though it has since been closed and the building sold as a private home . Chudleigh had a registered maternity hospital in the early 20th century . For some time the town had an Australian rules football club . It closed in the 1930s , reformed in 1939 , then finally closed in the 1980s . Telegraph communication followed construction of the railway line in the late 19th century . The first telephones were installed in Chudleigh homes in the 1930s , and mains electricity in the 1940s . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Chudleigh has had churches for four different Christian denominations , though none remain . 
 An Anglican cemetery was opened in 1864 .. Construction of an Anglican ( then the Church of England ) church began in 1866 and the building was completed in 1868 . This church , the Church of the Good Shepard , was in the parish of Deloraine . It was replaced with a new building , built by local carpenter Hugh Miles , in 1880 . The new building was consecrated in 1895 . It held services until 1976 , was later sold , and is now a private residence . A Presbyterian cemetery was established in 1860 . By 1877 a Presbyterian church had been built in what is now Burnett street , though it was later destroyed by fire . A small Salvation Army citadel , comprising a number of buildings , was established in Jones street in 1878 . It was closed in 1938 and one of the buildings transported to Invermay , Tasmania where it was used as a Salvation Army band room . A Wesleyan chapel was built prior to 1877 , around 4 to 5 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 to 8 @.@ 0 km ) from Chudleigh , next to Lobster Rivulet . Methodist services began in the town in 1874 , but ceased in 1876 when the pulpit was taken over by a Presbyterian minister . Land for a church was purchased in the town in April 1885 . The building , and adjacent stables , were completed soon after and the opening service held 19 July 1885 . To allow for an extension the building was later moved , and the stables removed . In 1977 the church became , along with most Methodist churches in Australia , part of the Uniting Church in Australia . It was closed in 1984 due to a lack of parishioners , and sold to become a private home .

 A rail line was built from Mole Creek to Deloraine , through Chudleigh . It ran 20 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 12 @.@ 7 mi ) from a junction on the western line and opened on 5 April 1890 . The rail line was used for mail , freight and passengers ; occasional passenger services went as far as Devonport . Passenger services mostly ceased when they were replaced with a bus service in 1960 . The line continued to be used for transporting logs for some time after this . Throughout its existence , the line was primarily used to carry timber to the paper mill at Burnie and , in later days , woodchips to Bell Bay . Passenger services had been mostly self @-@ propelled railcars after the 1920s . The line was closed in 1985 , and the tracks lifted in 1992 .

 Chudleigh serves as a service centre for the surrounding area , whose main industries involve farming and timber . The town has few services . There is a shop producing and selling honey related products , a service station , general store , second @-@ hand book store and a shop selling gifts and home wares related to roses . There are a large number of roses planted in the main street as part of a beautification drive , begun in 2001 , to make the town a " village of roses " . 
 There are some historic buildings , with connection to the town 's early history . Bentley house 's landscape is on the Tasmanian Heritage Register and the house itself is registered by the Tasmanian Heritage Council . Cattle were farmed on the land from at least 1827 and the house was finished in 1879 , at which time the property was owned by Donald Norman Cameron , later member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly . At the south @-@ east corner of the town , on the main road , is a restored building that was made for the Van Diemen 's Land company in 1827 – 8 as a grain store . A sign commemorates acrimony around its restoration or remodelling , stating " Building restored November 2003 . Despite the best efforts of The National Trust and Mrs Patrica Woods . " . Patrica Woods was as the time president of the National Trust of Australia ( Tasmania ) . The main street has a surveyor 's cottage that was built around 1840 
 The Chudleigh show , run by the Agricultural and Horticultural society , is held each February . It is one of the state 's oldest agricultural shows ; in 2015 the 126th show was held . Melita honey farm runs a shop on the main street that sells a wide variety of honey related products . Mole Creek Karst National Park is nearby . Caves in the park thread through the limestone that underlies the area around Chudleigh . Nearby the town is the 130 @-@ hectare ( 320 @-@ acre ) Lobster Rivulet Forest Reserve , which contains a series of scenic waterfalls . <unk> Wildlife Park is a 65 @-@ acre ( 26 ha ) private sanctuary a short distance on the main road towards Mole Creek . The park contains native Australian animals both in enclosures and free @-@ ranging . It works as part of the effort to preserve Tasmanian devils by keeping a population that are free of facial tumour disease , and runs as a training centre for animal handling and animal keeping . 
 Chudleigh is in the Meander Valley Council local government area , the Division of Lyons — for the state house of assembly and the federal house of representatives — and the state legislative council electoral division of Western Tiers .
