 The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc . The devices are part of the iPhone series and were announced on September 9 , 2014 , and released on September 19 , 2014 . The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly serve as successors to the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s . 
 The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus include a number of changes over their predecessor , including models with larger 4 @.@ 7 and 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 120 and 140 mm ) displays , a faster processor , upgraded cameras , improved LTE and Wi @-@ Fi connectivity and support for a near field communications @-@ based mobile payments offering . 
 Pre @-@ orders of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded four million within its first 24 hours of availability — an Apple record . More than ten million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days , another Apple record . 
 = = History = = 
 Since the launch of the original iPhone , the majority of iPhone models have used 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch displays — which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors . The last change in size for the iPhone series came with the iPhone 5 ; the phone and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller , but the same width as prior models , measuring at 4 inches diagonally . Following Apple 's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays , reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger , 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch and 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch displays . Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near @-@ field communications — a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones , but has experienced a low adoption rate among users . 
 The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino , California on September 9 , 2014 . The event featured other previously rumored product announcements by Apple alongside the new iPhone models , including the Apple Pay mobile payment platform , and the company 's entry into the wearable computing market with the Apple Watch smart watch . 
 The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were unveiled on September 9 , 2014 and released on September 19 , 2014 ; pre @-@ orders began on September 12 , 2014 , with the iPhone 6 starting at US $ 649 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US $ 749 . In China , where the iPhone 5c and 5s were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch , Apple notified local wireless carriers that it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on the 19th because there were " details which are not ready " ; local media reported that the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology , and earlier in the year , a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged that iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7 's " frequent locations " function could expose " state secrets . " 
 In August 2015 Apple admitted that some iPhone 6 Plus may have faulty cameras that could be causing photos to look blurry and initiated a replacement program . 
 On September 9 , 2015 the 128 GB version of both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones , the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remain available for sale at a reduced price due to the release of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus flagship devices . 
 In June 2016 , Apple faced a potential sales ban in China , as Shenzhen <unk> , a Chinese device maker , alleged that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on its design patent . 
 Apple did not use Corning 's Gorilla Glass for the iPhone 6 screen .

 = = = Hardware = = = 
 The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display , and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna . Both models come in gold , silver , and " space gray " finishes . The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6 @.@ 9 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 27 in ) , while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7 @.@ 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) in thickness ; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s , with the iPhone 6 being Apple 's thinnest phone to date . The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays ; both branded as " Retina HD Display " and " ion @-@ strengthened " , the iPhone 6 display is 4 @.@ 7 inches in size with a 16 : 9 resolution of <unk> ( 326 ppi , minus one row of pixels ) , while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch 1920x1080 ( 1080p ) display ( 401 PPI ) . The displays use a multiple @-@ domain LCD panel , dubbed " dual @-@ domain pixels " ; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in pattern , so that every pixel is seen from a different angle . This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display . 
 To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus , the power button was moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility . The iPhone 6 features a 6 @.@ 91 Wh ( 1810 mAh ) battery , while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11 @.@ 1 Wh ( <unk> mAh ) battery . Unlike the previous model , the rear @-@ facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device , and has a slight " bulge " around the lens . It has a dual @-@ core 1 @.@ 4 GHz " Typhoon " processor ( ARM <unk> @-@ based ) and Imagination 's PowerVR <unk> quad @-@ core graphics processor . 
 Both models include an Apple A8 system @-@ on @-@ chip , and an M8 motion co @-@ processor — an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s . The main difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes . Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide , in comparison to the 5s , a 25 % increase in CPU performance , a 50 % increase in graphics performance , and less heat output . Early hands @-@ on reports suggested that the A8 's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release , scoring <unk> @.@ 26 in Base mark X compared to <unk> @.@ 80 , <unk> @.@ 36 and <unk> @.@ 75 on respectively the 5s , 5 and 4s . 
 The expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is improved to LTE Advanced , with support for over 20 LTE bands ( 7 more than the iPhone 5s ) , for up to 150 Mbit / s download speed , and VoLTE support . Wi @-@ Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications , providing speeds up to 433 @.@ <unk> Mbit / s — which is up to 3 times faster than 802.11n , along with Wi @-@ Fi Calling support where available . The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus add support for near @-@ field communications ( NFC ) , which is used exclusively for Apple Pay — a new mobile payments system which will allow users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC . NFC support is restricted to Apple Pay only , and cannot be used for any other purposes ( such as sharing content with other iPhone users ) . 
 While still 8 megapixels in size , the iPhone 6 's rear @-@ facing camera includes a new sensor which , like the camera in the iPhone 5s , has 1 @.@ 5 micron pixels , an f / 2 @.@ 2 aperture lens , and the ability to shoot 1080p video at either 30 or 60 frames per second . The camera also includes phase detection autofocus . It can also record slow @-@ motion video at either 120 or 240 frames per second . The iPhone 6 Plus camera is nearly identical , but also includes optical image stabilization . The front @-@ facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f / 2 @.@ 2 aperture , along with support for burst and HDR modes . 
 = = = Software = = = 
 When first released , the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus shipped pre @-@ loaded with iOS 8 , while the iPhone 5s shipped pre @-@ loaded with iOS 7 . Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on @-@ screen ; for example , the Mail app uses a dual @-@ pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus . As it uses an identical aspect ratio , apps designed for the iPhone 5 , iPhone 5c , and 5s can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus . To improve the usability of the devices ' larger screens , an additional " <unk> " gesture was added ; double @-@ tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen 's contents down to the bottom half of the screen . This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen , such as a " Back " button in the top @-@ left corner . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Both iPhone 6 models received generally positive reviews . Re / code called it " the best smartphone you can buy " . TechRadar praised the iPhone 6 's " brilliant " design , improved battery life over the 5s , iOS 8 for being " smarter and more intuitive than ever " , along with the quality of its camera . However , the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics , the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6 , such as the HTC One , and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone . The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be " simply and cleanly designed " in comparison to the 5s , noting that the phone still felt usable despite its larger size , but criticized the antenna plastic , the protruding camera lens ( which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case ) , and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen . Improvements such as performance , battery life , VoLTE support , and other tweaks were also noted . In conclusion , the iPhone 6 was considered " good , even great , but there ’ s little about it that ’ s truly ambitious or truly moving the needle . It ’ s just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package " . 
 In regards to the 6 Plus , Engadget panned the device 's design for feeling uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3 , but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6 .

 The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware @-@ related issues : 
 = = = Chassis bending = = = 
 Shortly after its public release , it was reported that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure , such as when carried tightly in a user 's pocket . While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus , the design flaw came to be known among social media users as " <unk> . " A study by Consumer Reports found the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were slightly more durable than the HTC One , but considerably less durable than the other phones tested . 
 Apple responded to the bending allegations , stating that they had only received nine complaints of bent devices , and that the damage occurring due to regular use is " extremely rare . " The company maintained that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use . The company offered to replace phones that were bent , if it is determined that the bending was unintentional . 
 On October 1 , 2014 , it was reported by Axel <unk> , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the German technology magazine Computer Bild , that following the posting of a video where a presenter was able to bend an iPhone 6 Plus , an Apple Germany representative informed the publication that it had been banned from future Apple events and that it would no longer receive devices directly from Apple for testing . <unk> responded by saying that " we congratulate you to your fine new generation of iPhones , even if one of them has a minor weakness with its casing . But we are deeply disappointed about the lack of respect of your company . " 
 = = = Hair ripping = = = 
 On October 3 , 2014 <unk> released a post claiming that certain iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users complained on social networking sites that the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making a call or taking a call . Twitter users claimed that the seam between the glass screen and aluminium back of the iPhone 6 is to blame , with hair becoming caught within it . 
 = = = Flash storage performance = = = 
 Some users reported that 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues , and that some 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus models would , in rare cases , randomly crash and reboot . Business Korea reported that the issues were connected to the triple @-@ layer cell NAND storage of the affected models . Triple @-@ layer cells can store three bits of data per cell of flash , and are cheaper than dual @-@ layer cell solutions , but at the cost of performance . It was reported that Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi @-@ layer cell flash , and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update . 
 = = = 6 Plus camera issues = = = 
 It was reported that the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty , failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still , leading to blurry photos and " wavy " -looking videos . The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets , such as third @-@ party lens attachments ; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers , warning that magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the <unk> to malfunction . 
 On August 21 , 2015 , Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models released between September 2014 and January 2015 , citing that faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures . 
 Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have an issue where the front facing camera is somehow " shifted " , or out of place . Apple has said that they will replace most iPhone 6 's with this issue , free of charge . Many people have complained of this issue , but it does not seem to actually affect the camera itself . It is said that the camera is not what has shifted , but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place . 
 = = = " Error 53 " = = = 
 If the iPhone 6 home button is repaired or modified by a third @-@ party , the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components had not been " re @-@ validated " for security reasons — a process which can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet . Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID . Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well . 
 It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into " Recovery Mode " if iOS is updated or restored , with attempts to restore the device via iTunes PC software resulting in an " error 53 " message . Beyond the explanation that this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components , Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error 53 or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device . 
 On February 18 , 2016 , Apple released an iOS 9 @.@ 2 @.@ 1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue , and admitted that error 53 was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories .

 = Raid on Grand Pré = 
 The Raid on Grand Pré was the major action of a raiding expedition conducted by New England militia Colonel Benjamin Church against French Acadia in June 1704 , during Queen Anne 's War . The expedition was in retaliation for a French and Indian raid against the Massachusetts frontier community of Deerfield earlier that year . 
 Departing Boston on 25 May 1704 with 500 provincial militia and some Indian allies , the expedition reached the Minas Basin on 24 June , after raiding smaller settlements at Penobscot Bay and Passamaquoddy Bay . Although he lost surprise due to the famously high tides of the Bay of Fundy , Church quickly gained control of Grand @-@ Pré , and spent three days destroying the town and attempting to destroy the dikes and levees that protected its croplands . The croplands were flooded by salt water , but the local Acadians quickly repaired the dikes after the raiders left , and the land was returned to production . Church continued his raiding expedition , striking at Beaubassin and other communities before finally returning to Boston in late July . 
 = = Context = = 
 When the War of the Spanish Succession ( also called Queen Anne 's War ) widened to include England in 1702 , it spawned conflict between the colonies of England and France in North America . Joseph Dudley , the governor of the English Province of Massachusetts Bay ( which then included present @-@ day Maine ) , sought in June 1703 to ensure the neutrality of the Abenakis who occupied the frontier between Massachusetts and New France . In this he was unsuccessful , because New France 's Governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil , knowing he would have to rely on Indian support for defense against the more numerous English , had already encouraged the Indians to take up the hatchet . Following the Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia military campaign against the New England frontier during the summer of 1703 , the English colonists embarked on largely unsuccessful retaliatory raids against Abenaki villages . This prompted the Abenakis to participate in a raid on Deerfield , Massachusetts under French leadership in February 1704 . The severity of this raid ( more than 50 villagers killed and more than 100 captured ) prompted calls for revenge , and the veteran Indian fighter Benjamin Church offered his services for an expedition against the French colony of Acadia ( roughly present @-@ day Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and eastern Maine ) . 
 Acadia was at the time dominated by a series of settlements dotting the shores of the Bay of Fundy and its adjacent bays . Its principal settlement and capital , Port Royal , was the only significantly fortified community , defended by a star fort with a modest garrison . The land at the top of the bay , on the shores of the Minas and Cumberland Basins was one of the major seats of food production in the colony , and Grand Pré was one of the largest and most successful communities on the Minas Basin , with a population of about 500 in 1701 . French settlers to the area had brought with them knowledge on the constructions of dikes and levees , which they used to drain marshlands for agriculture , and to protect those lands from the inflow of the exceptionally high tides ( over 6 meters , or 20 feet , in some places ) for which the Bay of Fundy is well known . The community of Beaubassin was the largest of several towns situated on the Isthmus of Chignecto and elsewhere on the shores of the Cumberland Basin . 
 = = Start of the expedition = = 
 Church had previously led expeditions against Acadia during King William 's War , and Governor Dudley issued him a colonel 's commission for the effort , giving him specific orders to obtain Acadian prisoners that could be exchanged for the English prisoners taken in the Deerfield raid . The expedition was also to be one of punishment : " Use all possible methods for the burning and destroying of the enemies houses and breaking the dams of their corn grounds , and make what other spoil you can upon them " . Dudley , however , specifically denied Church permission to attack Port Royal , the Acadian capital , citing the need to get permission from London before taking such a step . 
 The force Church raised consisted of about 500 volunteers from coastal areas of Massachusetts , including some Indians . He left Boston on 15 / 26 May with fourteen transports and three warships . The warships include the Royal Navy vessels HMS Adventure , HMS Jersey ( 42 guns ) and HMS Gosport ( 32 ) , which were also accompanied by the Massachusetts Province Galley of Cyprian Southack . ( Church took a former prisoner of the Maliseet , John Gyles as his translator . ) 
 The expedition first sailed for Mount Desert Island , near the entrance to Penobscot Bay . Church sent a force to raid <unk> ( present @-@ day Castine , Maine ) , where the Frenchman Baron Saint @-@ Castin had a fortified trading post . Saint @-@ Castin was absent , but Church took prisoner his daughter and her children . He also learned that a new French settlement was being built at Passamaquoddy Bay , so the expedition next sailed for that destination . Church sent a small force ashore near present @-@ day St. Stephen , New Brunswick , where they destroyed a house and raided a nearby Maliseet encampment , killing one Indian . Church then separated the warships , sending them to blockade the Digby Gut in the hopes of capturing a French supply ship , while the bulk of the expedition sailed for Grand Pré . The three ship captains on 24 June demanded the surrender of the garrison at Port Royal , threatening a frontal assault with 1 @,@ 700 New Englanders and " Sauvages " . Governor Jacques @-@ François de Monbeton de Brouillan , despite defenses in poor conditions and a garrison of only 150 able men , saw through the bluff and refused . Historian George <unk> speculates that Governor Dudley may have intentionally asked them to make this bluff without Church 's involvement . 
 = = Grand Pré = = 
 The principal detailed account of these events was provided by Colonel Church in his memoirs , first published in 1716 . French military officers later summarized the damage caused by the raiders . 
 = = = Day 1 : Arrival = = = 
 On 24 June / 3 July 1704 , Church arrived at Grand Pré on the frigate Adventure . Hoping to take advantage of the element of surprise , Church secretly approached the village from behind the heavily wooded Boot Island . His men unloaded the whaleboats to go ashore late in the day and started to move quickly toward the village . Church sent Lieut . Giles ahead with a flag of truce and a written notice demanding the village 's complete surrender . 
 We do also declare , that we have already made some beginnings of killing and scalping some Canada men , which we have not been wont to do or allow , and are now come with a great number of English and Indians , all volunteers , with resolutions to subdue you , and make you sensible of your cruelties to us , by treating you after the same manner . 
 Church stipulated the Acadians and Mi 'kmaq had one hour to surrender . Although he expected to reach the village by the time the hour had past , Church 's force became delayed by stream crossings made more difficult by the receding tide : " But meeting with several creeks near twenty or thirty feet deep , which were very muddy and dirty , so that the army could not get over them , were obliged to return to their boats again . " 
 Because Church 's forces were stuck in the mud exposed by the retreating tide , they lost any element of surprise , and the Acadians took the opportunity to evacuate Grand Pré with some of their cattle and the " best of their goods " . Church 's forces waited in their boats for the tide to rise . Church expected the high stream banks to provide some cover , but when tide rose that night , it was so high that the boats were exposed to gunfire from the local militia , who had gathered in the woods along the banks . According to Church , the Acadians and Mi 'kmaq " fired smartly at our forces " . Church had a small cannon on his boat , which he used to fire grape shot at the attackers on the shore , who withdrew , suffering one Mi 'kmaq killed and several wounded . Church 's forces then waited out the rest of the night . 
 = = = Day 2 : Inhabitants driven off = = = 
 Having withdrawn from the village , the next morning the Acadian and Mi 'kmaq militia waited in the woods for Church and his men to arrive . At the break of day , the New Englanders again set off toward the village , under orders from Church to drive any resistance before them . The largest body of defenders fired on the raiders ' right flank from behind trees and logs , but their fire was ineffective and they were driven off . The raiders then entered the village and began plundering . Some of the men broke into the liquor stores they found and began drinking , but Colonel Church quickly put a stop to that activity . They spent the rest of the day destroying much of the village . According to one of Church 's dispatches , they destroyed 60 houses , 6 mills , and many barns , along with about 70 cattle . 
 At one point some of the men noticed that some of the Acadians were nearby , driving off some of their cattle . Church detached Lieutenant Barker and some men to give chase , warning them to advance with care . However , Barker was somewhat rash in pursuing the chase , and he and another man were killed before the raiders retreated back to the village . 
 That evening the raiders built a fortification out of logs while burning the church and the rest of the village . Church reported that " the whole town seemed to be on fire all at once . " All but one home was burned . 
 = = = Day 3 : Destruction of the harvest = = = 
 On the morning of the third day , Church gave the orders to destroy the dykes and , in turn , all of the crops . Seven dykes were broken , destroying most of the harvest and ruining over 200 hogsheads of stored wheat . 
 To give the impression to the Acadians and Mi 'kmaq that his forces were leaving , Church had his soldiers burn the fortifications they had built the day before . He also had them load themselves and the whale boats back onto their transport vessels . Some of the Acadians returned in the night and immediately began to mend the broken dykes . However , Church had anticipated this , and sent men back to the town to drive the Acadians off . 
 = = End of the expedition = = 
 The next day Church left Grand Pré and went on to raid <unk> ( present day Windsor and Falmouth , Nova Scotia , not far from Grand Pré ) , where he took 45 prisoners . He then sailed for Port Royal to rejoin the fleet blockading Port Royal . According to uncorroborated French reports , the blockaders had made some landings in the vicinity of Port Royal , burning a few isolated houses and taking some prisoners . Governor Brouillan organized defenses that successfully prevented further landings . 
 After rejoining the warships Church held a council to discuss whether or not to launch a large @-@ scale attack against Port Royal . The council decided that their force was " <unk> to the strength of the enemy " , and that they would " quit it [ Port Royal ] wholly and go about [ their ] other business " . The expedition then sailed back up the Bay of Fundy to Chignecto , where the village of Beaubassin was raided . Its inhabitants had by then been alerted to the English activities , and under the leadership of Father Claude <unk> had removed their possessions and as much livestock as possible from the village to <unk> ( <unk> , Nova Scotia ) . Church , after some ineffectual skirmishing with villagers hiding in the woods , burned the village 's houses and barns and slaughtered 100 head of cattle , before sailing for Boston . Church reported that six of his men were killed over the course of the expedition . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The prisoners that Church took were brought to Boston , where they were at first given relatively free access to the town . The town selectman complained , and the Acadians were then confined to Castle William . They were exchanged in 1705 and 1706 for prisoners taken in the Deerfield raid , although the negotiations were complicated by Dudley 's initial refusal to release the noted French privateer Pierre <unk> dit Baptiste , who was ultimately exchanged , along with Noel Doiron and other captives , for Deerfield 's minister John Williams . 
 The direct effects of the raid were fairly short @-@ lived . Because of the destruction of the crop and stored grain , the colony suffered a flour shortage that winter , although it was not severe enough to cause significant hardship . Grand Pré was rebuilt , the dykes were repaired , and there was a successful harvest in 1706 . The memory of the raid however , lasted in the population . As late as the 1740s ( after Acadia had become British Nova Scotia ) Grand Pré 's inhabitants worried about a return of English raiders , and were cautious in their dealing with British authorities . 
 Dudley 's decision to deny Church permission to attack Port Royal had political ramifications : his opponents in Massachusetts accused him of protecting Port Royal because he was benefiting from illicit trade with Acadia . These allegations continued for several years , and Dudley eventually chose to deal with them by launching the failed attacks on Port Royal in 1707 .

 My French Coach and My Spanish Coach are educational games developed by Sensory Sweep Studios and published by Ubisoft for the Nintendo DS , iOS , PlayStation Portable , and Wii . They are part of Ubisoft 's My Coach series , and were released for the Nintendo DS on November 6 , 2007 in North America , for the Wii on November 23 , 2007 in the European Union ( North American release date to be announced ) , and My Spanish Coach was released for the PlayStation Portable on October 7 , 2008 , and the iOS on June 6 , 2009 For their releases in Europe and Australia , the games were renamed My French Coach Level 1 : Beginners and My Spanish Coach Level 1 : Beginners . 
 French and Spanish language teachers assisted with development of the gameplay for both games , which concentrates on teaching French or Spanish using lessons and minigames . As the player progresses the lessons , the gameplay uses increasingly complex words and phrases . The games received praise and criticism from various video game publications ; they praised the games ' effectiveness in teaching the language , but lamented their repetitive nature . The next installments in the series , titled My French Coach Level 2 : Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2 : Intermediate , also developed and published by Ubisoft , were released in Europe on November 23 , 2007 alongside their Level 1 counterparts . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach consists of the player completing lessons that introduce new vocabulary and then focus on mastering the words through several puzzle games . As the player progresses through the game , the words increase in difficulty . When first starting the game , the player takes an introductory test that gauges their initial comprehension level of the French or Spanish language . The player is then placed into a level reflective of the score they received on the test . A player who scores highly will be able to skip many of the initial levels and more basic concepts . When starting a lesson , the player is shown ten new words , which include nouns , verbs , adjectives , or adverbs , as well as their meanings and proper enunciation . 
 Following this , the player is offered a choice of eight minigames to test their knowledge of the words given in the lesson . These minigames are Multiple Choice , Hit @-@ A @-@ Word , Word Find , Flash Cards , Fill in the Blank , Memory , Bridge Builder , and <unk> . In Multiple Choice , the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame . Hit @-@ A @-@ Word is a Whac @-@ A @-@ Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time . Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases . In Flash Cards , the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation . In Memory , the player must select from a set of face @-@ down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation . Bridge Builder tests sentence structure ; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words . In <unk> , the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time . For Fill @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Blank , the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence . 
 Whenever a player correctly answers a question or solves a puzzle in a minigame , they gain " mastery points " on the word they successfully answered . The minigames can be increased in difficulty ; on higher difficulty levels , players will acquire more mastery points when successfully completing a minigame . For instance , in Multiple Choice , the player has 50 seconds to select an answer for a question on the " Easy " difficulty , and will receive two mastery points for each correct answer . On the " Medium " difficulty , the player has 40 seconds to select an answer and receives three mastery points for each correct answer . The process continues until the player scores fifteen mastery points for every word , allowing the player to proceed to the next lesson . Following the completion of all fifty lessons , the player can continue to learn new words through " open lessons " that contain ten new vocabulary words apiece ; the dictionaries of both games each hold nearly 10 @,@ 000 words . The player can freely access the reference section , which contains a dictionary and phrasebook , at any time . Both the dictionary and phrasebook hold all of the words and phrases in each game , as well as meanings and audio files for both ; the player can look through different categories of words and phrases , use a search function , and bookmark chosen phrases .

 My French Coach and My Spanish Coach were two of the first three games Ubisoft released for the My Coach series ; the other game was My Word Coach . During the course of their development by Sensory Sweep Studios , the lessons and minigames were created with the help of French and Spanish language teachers . Ubisoft announced the creation of a new division to create the My Coach series on May 21 , 2007 , and that Pauline <unk> , the producer of the Tom Clancy 's Ghost Recon and Rayman series , would lead the division . When commenting on the direction of the My Coach series , <unk> said that she was " developing projects that make people feel that playing games is worth their while , allowing them to spend quality time with family and friends , learn a new skill , or improve their daily lives " . Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented that , “ The timing is right for us to leverage our creativity and to open up the video games market to new consumers who will be attracted by content that can help them learn , grow and feel better in an entertaining way " . All three games were released on November 6 , 2007 in North America . Ubisoft followed with a PlayStation Portable version of My Spanish Coach , releasing it in North America on October 7 , 2008 ; Wii versions of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach were released in Europe on November 30 , 2007 . The European releases for My French Coach , titled My French Coach Level 1 : Beginners , and My Spanish Coach , renamed My Spanish Coach Level 1 : Beginners , were accompanied by My French Coach Level 2 : Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2 : Intermediate , the next games in the series .

 My French Coach and My Spanish Coach have received generally favorable reviews from several video game publications . On Metacritic , a website that compiles scores from various video game reviews , My Spanish Coach received a 73 / 100 , based on seven reviews . In a review of the DS versions of both games , IGN called them a " great learning experience " and a more entertaining alternative to traditional methods of learning French and Spanish such as " [ h ] ours of boring exercises and outdated videos " . Eurogamer claimed the games were not substitutes for proper language lessons , but admitted that " as tools for improving your language skills , whether you 're starting from scratch or have some basic knowledge , they 're great " . In a review of the DS version of My French Coach , Nintendo World Report called the game " not be the hottest game to ever sit in your DS , but it is an unusually polished product that achieves the edutainment holy grail – it makes learning easy and fun " . During the 2007 Christmas holiday season , video game retailer GameStop recommended My Spanish Coach for " The Academic Gamer " . My Spanish Coach led all Nintendo DS games in sales during the week of August 15 , 2008 to August 21 , 2008 . 
 The gameplay received mixed reviews from critics . In a review of the PSP version of My Spanish Coach , IGN noted that acquiring mastery points in the minigames lead to " quite a bit of grinding " due to the game 's repetitive structure . Nevertheless , IGN accepted that the repetition was an effective way to learn the vocabulary , and noted that " [ p ] <unk> up on things like gender and age , emphasis and the breakdowns of the actual language itself and proper / casual ways of conversing are made fairly clear and reinforced regularly " . IGN 's review of the DS versions of both games commented that neither game taught the future or past tense , calling it one of the " most disappointing " aspects of the game , but praised the effective incorporation of the DS stylus into the minigames . Eurogamer noted that the minigames were " only really good for practicing reading " due to a lack of games for practicing proper speaking , but GameZone disagreed , noting that the player was able to hear their attempt to speak the French or Spanish words alongside the correct pronunciation during lessons , and praised this aspect as the " most interesting and intriguing feature of [ My French Coach and My Spanish Coach ] " . In a review of the DS version of My Spanish Coach , Nintendo World Report lamented that many of the minigames " exhibit the same type of unimaginative <unk> " and that " it takes ages to unlock new lessons and mini @-@ games " ; however , it noted that the minigames were " extremely effective " and " constructed extremely well " in terms of teaching the language . Nintendo World Report 's review of the DS version of My French Coach called the game 's reference section " a very handy travel dictionary " , noting that having a dictionary list and a phrasebook with audio files that could bookmark chosen phrases was " an absurd value " . 
 The games ' graphics and audio also received praise and criticism from reviewers . IGN 's review of the PSP version of My Spanish Coach noted that the fact that the game appeared on multiple platforms contributed to its " sparse look and feel " because the games ' graphics and audio were made for the Nintendo DS . Eurogamer praised the games ' " clean , crisp visuals " and " jolly accordion music and jolly fiesta music " . In contrast , IGN 's review of the DS versions of both games called the music " catchy but repetitive " and the graphics " cute but nothing to write home about " . GameZone noted that " [ t ] he visual concept was obviously not a front runner in [ the games ' ] conception " , and that the audio of neither game " [ does ] anything remotely special " . Nintendo World Report made note of the games ' narrator during the lessons , praising its " clear and coherent glory " in terms of pronouncing the words correctly . 
 = The Serpentine = 
 The Serpentine ( also known as the Serpentine River ) is a 40 @-@ acre ( 16 ha ) recreational lake in Hyde Park , London , England , created in 1730 at the behest of Queen Caroline . Although it is common to refer to the entire body of water as the Serpentine , strictly the name refers only to the eastern half of the lake . Serpentine Bridge , which marks the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens , also marks the Serpentine 's western boundary ; the long and narrow western half of the lake is known as the Long Water . The Serpentine takes its name from its snakelike , curving shape , although it only has one bend . 
 Originally fed by the River Westbourne and Tyburn Brook in the 1730s , the lake 's water was then pumped from the Thames in the 1830s . The water is now pumped from three boreholes within Hyde Park , the most recent being installed in May 2012 as part of the 2011 – 2012 restoration of the Lake . The Serpentine provided a focal point for The Great Exhibition of 1851 , and more recently was a venue for the men 's and women 's triathlon and marathon swimming events in the London 2012 Olympics . Since 1864 the Serpentine Swimming Club has organised a 100 @-@ yard race every Christmas morning for the Peter Pan Cup , inaugurated by J. M. Barrie , the creator of the fictional character Peter Pan . 
 There are many recreational facilities around the Serpentine , as well as boating on the lake itself . In 1860 the Serpentine was to be modified into a skating pond with formal edges . This scheme was not implemented . Among the landmarks near the lake is the Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain . 
 = = Geography of the lake = = 
 Originally the lake was fed by the River Westbourne entering at the Italian Garden at the north @-@ western end of the Long Water . The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834 , as the river had become polluted , and so water was then pumped from the Thames . The water is now supplied by three boreholes drilled into the Upper Chalk . The first borehole is located at the Italian Gardens , the second at the Diana Memorial and the third , drilled in 2012 to a depth of <unk> , is within 50m of the Diana Memorial . The Long Water runs south @-@ east from this point to Serpentine Bridge , where the lake curves to the east , following the natural contours of the land . At the eastern end , water flows out of the lake via a sluice in the dam , forming a small ornamental waterfall at the Dell . The outflow has not historically maintained the waterfall , and re @-@ circulation pumps were installed in the Dell , below the dam , to sustain this feature . The restoration work in 2012 restored the flows into the Serpentine and this waterfall is now restored as originally designed . Historically the river flowed due south from this point , marking the boundary between Westminster and Kensington , but since 1850 it has been diverted into a culvert , running underground to reach the Thames near Chelsea Bridge . 
 The lake has a maximum depth of 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 3 m ) . The lake is often reported to be deeper , but bathymetric surveys by the Royal Park in 2010 revealed the design of the lake . 
 There are two lakeside restaurants and various recreational facilities on the lake shore . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1730 Queen Caroline , wife of George II , ordered the damming of the River Westbourne in Hyde Park as part of a general redevelopment of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens . Original monastic ponds may have existing in the location and these were modified as part of the 1730 – 1732 scheme to create a single lake . At that time , the Westbourne formed eleven natural ponds in the park . During the 1730s , the lake filled to its current size and shape . The redevelopment was carried out by Royal Gardener Charles Bridgeman , who dammed the Westbourne to create the artificial lake , and dug a large pond in the centre of Kensington Gardens ( The Round Pond ) to be a focal point for pathways in the park . 
 At the time of construction , artificial lakes were typically long and straight . The Serpentine was one of the earliest artificial lakes designed to appear natural , and was widely imitated in parks and gardens nationwide . 
 The lake achieved notoriety in December 1816 when Harriet Westbrook , the pregnant wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley , was found drowned in the Serpentine having left a suicide note addressed to her father , sister and husband . Shelley married Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin less than two weeks later . 
 The lake formed a focal point of the 1814 celebrations which marked a century of Hanoverian rule and re @-@ enacted the British victory at Trafalgar nine years previously , and of the 1851 Great Exhibition , with the Crystal Palace standing on its southern shore . Following the introduction of more stringent regulations to protect the environment in the park , the relocation of the Crystal Palace , and the construction of the nearby Albertopolis complex of museums and exhibitions , large @-@ scale events ceased to take place on the banks of the Serpentine . However , it was the location for the 1977 Silver Jubilee celebrations , and a venue for the 2012 Olympics . 
 In the 1820s , the park was extensively redesigned by Decimus Burton . At the same time , John Rennie built the Serpentine Bridge to carry the newly built West Carriage Drive along the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens , dividing the lake into the Serpentine ( east ) and the Long Water ( west ) . 
 In 2011 , The Royal Park embarked on the restoration of the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water and the quality of the aquatic environment . The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake , which had a turnover time of 10 years , and is now reduced to 4 – 5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake . The three boreholes , drilled into the Upper Chalk , now supply the lake with up to 900 @,@ 000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate . In addition , the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised . Thirdly , the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base of the lake . These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress . Finally , the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake . These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012 . The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012 .

 A rectangular swimming area on the southern bank was opened in 1930 . Known as Lansbury 's Lido , it is partitioned off from the rest of the lake by a perimeter of buoys . There is a fee for entering the lido , and changing rooms are available . It is normally open only in the summer , typically between 10 : 00 and 17 : 30 , although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 06 : 00 to 09 : 30 . The Peter Pan Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants in the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter . 
 The Serpentine was used as the venue for the swimming portion of the triathlon and for the marathon swimming events at the 2012 Olympic Games .

 Since 1864 , the Serpentine has hosted a 100 @-@ yard ( 91 @.@ 4 m ) swimming competition every Christmas morning at 9 am . In 1904 , author J. M.

 The United Kingdom 's Holocaust Memorial is situated at the eastern end of the Serpentine , immediately beyond the dam . A memorial on the northern shore of the lake was erected by Norwegian seamen in 1978 in thanks for the safe haven they were given in Britain after their country surrendered to the Germans in 1940 , during the Second World War . 
 The Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is sited on the southern shore of the Serpentine near West Carriage Drive . Although it was beset by early problems and had to be closed for a month three weeks after it opened , it has become one of the UK 's most popular attractions , with 800 @,@ 000 visitors a year . The Serpentine Gallery nearby is also on the south bank and the Serpentine Sackler Gallery opened in 2013 is located in a former 1805 gunpowder store , five minutes walk from the Serpentine Gallery across the bridge . 
 On the northern side of the lake , opposite The Lido , are two self contained boat houses . The East Boat House , 1903 , erected by the Royal Humane Society and West Boat House , 1952 , for the new chlorination launch , to replace a former boat house bombed in 1940 . Nearby is a grass amphitheatre known as the Cockpit . A disused gravel pit , was the scene of The Rolling Stones ' " Stones in the Park " concert in 1969 . Concerts here from 1968 , were initially organised by Blackhill Enterprises . This area can also be seen in the 1953 film Genevieve , as the starting point for the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run .

 = Phoenix ( fireboat ) = 
 Phoenix is a fireboat owned by State of California and operated by the city of San Francisco in the San Francisco Bay since 1955 . Phoenix is known for helping to save Marina District buildings from further destruction by fire following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . Her worthy assistance resulted in a second vintage fireboat obtained for the city . Both Guardian and Phoenix are based at Firehouse No. 35 at Pier 22 ½ of the Port of San Francisco . Phoenix often leads parades of ships , and takes part in welcoming ceremonies . 
 = = History = = 
 The city of San Francisco operated two fireboats in the 1900s : Governor Irwin and Governor Markham . Both were capable of pumping about 1 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 3 @,@ 800 L ) per minute . These two , assisted by tugboats and military fireboats , tried but failed to stop the horrific fires which swept the city after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . In 1909 , two new fireboats were placed in service — David Scannell and Dennis T. Sullivan — steam @-@ powered boats each rated for 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 34 @,@ 000 – 38 @,@ 000 L ) per minute . A firehouse was built for them at the edge of the Panama – Pacific International Exposition in 1915 . This firehouse was moved by barge to Pier 22 ½ near the intersection of Harrison Street and Embarcadero following the Exposition , when the old fair buildings were being torn down and the Marina District was being built in its place . The two fireboats served the city for 45 years and were scrapped in 1954 . 
 To fill the anticipated lack of a fireboat , Phoenix was built in 1954 in Alameda by Hugh F. Munroe of Plant Shipyard , paid for by the State of California . Her name came from a contest publicized by the Port Authority ; the winning suggestion was submitted by a member of the Phoenix Society , a group of San Francisco citizens interested in civil fire protection . Phoenix , the mythical firebird which rose anew from ashes , seemed appropriate because the city of San Francisco had risen seven times from great fires . 
 Phoenix is 89 feet ( 27 m ) long with a 19 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 9 m ) beam and a 7 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) draft . Phoenix can pump up to 6 @,@ 400 US gallons ( 24 @,@ 000 L ) at a pressure of 150 pounds per square inch ( 1 @,@ 000 kPa ) , or at the rate of 3 @,@ 200 US gallons ( 12 @,@ 000 L ) per minute at twice the pressure . She can make 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . When put into service in 1955 , Phoenix was the only fireboat based in San Francisco . Like her predecessors , she docked at Pier 22 ½ ; one of only two remaining 1915 Exposition buildings , the other being the Palace of Fine Arts . 
 Two decades later , Phoenix was the subject of discussions about the city budget . In the late 1970s , the fireboat 's annual operating expenses were about $ 1 @.@ 2 million . Mayor George Moscone met with the San Francisco Port Commission in 1977 to determine whether Phoenix would be refurbished , replaced , or scrapped with no replacement . An improvement bond was passed in November 1977 to build a new fireboat . Local naval architects Morris Guralnick Associates submitted a design in 1980 to replace Phoenix , but the estimated construction costs far exceeded the bond . Instead , Mayor Dianne Feinstein redirected the funds to refurbish Phoenix in 1981 – 1982 . 
 = = Firefighting = = 
 Phoenix 's first call to action came on April 2 , 1955 . A four @-@ alarm blaze at the Ferry Building greatly damaged the north end of the building ; losses came to $ 750 @,@ 000 . Other notable fires that Phoenix fought include Pier 70 burning in 1980 , and a lengthy battle at Piers 30 – 32 throughout the night of May 9 – 10 , 1984 — a five @-@ alarm explosive conflagration which destroyed the piers and caused an estimated $ 2 @.@ 5 million in damage . 
 Local shipping accidents are among the responsibilities of the Phoenix . In September 1965 , the Norwegian freighter MS <unk> collided with the tanker Independent , resulting in fires aboard the ships . Phoenix responded along with U.S. Coast Guard fireboats to quickly put out the freighter 's blaze , but the tanker took longer to extinguish . A year later , a gasoline barge collided with rocks near the shore . While Phoenix and the Coast Guard were investigating , the barge exploded killing two Coast Guardsmen and one nearby workman . Phoenix rescued a third Coast Guardsman with severe injuries , and fought to snuff the blaze . Flaming , floating gasoline proved difficult to subdue . In December 2011 , a tourist DUKW boat suffered an engine fire while in McCovey Cove , and Phoenix doused the flames while the Coast Guard rescued the passengers and crew . 
 = = = 1989 Marina District fires = = = 
 Phoenix played a notable role in the response to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . At 5 : 04 pm on October 17 , 1989 , a major earthquake rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area . One of the hardest @-@ hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco ; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble , sand and debris dumped at the edge of the bay following the 1906 earthquake . A number of buildings collapsed , and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents . Subsequent to a sharp aftershock , a fire broke out in a three @-@ story building at <unk> and Jefferson , threatening nearby buildings . Fire engines connected their hoses to the city 's seawater @-@ based Auxiliary Water Supply System ( AWSS ) and began to quench the fire , but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant . Fire crews were forced back , and with the assistance of off @-@ duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources . Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses . At about the same time , other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system . The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20 % loss in stored water volume — both from earthquake damage — and from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses . At 6 : 16 pm Phoenix was called to assist . 
 At 6 : 49 pm fire crews waiting to connect to Phoenix reported she was having difficulty getting close enough because of low tide conditions . Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid <unk> to perform an extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure , at 7 : 00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon , two blocks away from the first fire . By this time the whole neighborhood was threatened with destruction by fire . Fire crews were manning hoses laid in anticipation ; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold their ground , that they would soon have more water . 
 Phoenix connected hoses to an engine company and to two ladder trucks and commenced pumping seawater from the bay . Fire crews renewed their efforts , making a frontal attack on burning structures . Soon , one of the Fire Department 's Hose Tenders arrived in the lagoon carrying 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) of 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) hose , followed shortly by another hose tender — they connected to Phoenix to relay water to more distant engine companies . In a parallel effort , the AWSS lines were inspected by city workers , temporary repairs made , and two high @-@ pressure pump stations were brought back into operation at about 8 pm , supplying 10 @,@ 000 U.S. gallons per minute . Phoenix worked until all the Marina fires were under control , pumping seawater continuously for 15 hours at the rate of 6 @,@ 400 gallons per minute , a total of 5 @.@ 5 million gallons ( 20 @.@ 8 ML ) . 
 Phoenix is credited with saving the area from further destruction . One of Feinstein 's last mayoral acts was to save the city 's only fireboat from suggested budget cuts . Some 21 months later the earthquake struck . Feinstein wrote that the boat " unquestionably saved the Marina from a greater catastrophe " . The fireboat 's role in the earthquake is the subject of a children 's book , Frankie & The Phoenix . Senator Feinstein read the book to students at the opening of a new San Francisco elementary school dedicated in her name in August 2006 . 
 Subsequent to the 1989 earthquake , $ 50 @,@ 000 from grateful Marina property owners , and $ 300 @,@ 000 from an anonymous donor were used to provide Phoenix with a colleague . Guardian , an older fireboat built in 1951 , was purchased from the City of Vancouver , British Columbia , and refurbished . She was piloted down the Pacific Coast to dock alongside Phoenix at Pier 22 ½ . In 1999 , the shared fireboat house was declared San Francisco 's 225th Historic Landmark . 
 A planned monument to the 1989 earthquake , the Marina Earthquake Memorial , focuses on the role of Phoenix in the Marina firefighting effort and will incorporate the original 16 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 5 m ) tower monitor from Phoenix as a centerpiece of the memorial design . 
 = = Ceremonial appearances = = 
 Phoenix has taken a lead role in many spectacles on the San Francisco Bay . The fireboat regularly leads parades on the bay , escorts famous ships entering the bay , and participates in tall ship events and Fleet Week in San Francisco . Phoenix threw out plumes of water to celebrate the reopening of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge on November 16 , 1989 following its closure due to earthquake damage . Phoenix welcomed the historic cruise <unk> SS Independence to San Francisco in November 2001 . In July 2005 , Phoenix led the " Parade of Sail " from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge . Famous tall ships in the parade included the 270 @-@ foot ( 82 m ) barque ARM Cuauhtémoc from Mexico and the 356 @-@ foot ( 109 m ) Pallada from Russia . Other ships included the Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O 'Brien and the presidential yacht USS Potomac — both based in San Francisco Bay . In 2008 , Phoenix led a similar parade including Californian ( California 's official tall ship , based in San Diego ) and the Coast Guard barque the Eagle . The Jeremiah O 'Brien took part as did the U.S. Navy submarine <unk> . 
 = = Crew and maintenance = = 
 Phoenix is normally operated with a crew of one vessel command <unk> officer , one engineer who operates the pumps and engines , one pilot who steers / navigates the boat , one fire Engine company officer , and three to five firefighters to handle hoses and nozzles . Firehouse 35 on Pier 22 ½ has seven men on duty at all times : four to serve Engine # 35 , and three dedicated to the two fireboats . All seven are able to man the fireboats in an emergency . As many as ten men can work Phoenix , but in October 1989 after Engine # 35 was called to duty , only three were available : Pilot Arvid <unk> , Engineer Nate Hardy , and Lieutenant Bob <unk> . Both fireboat pilot and engineer are licensed by the US Coast Guard . 
 In the early 2000s , San Francisco spent $ 1 @.@ 7 million each year to operate its two fireboats . Maintenance problems on the historic vessels increased to the point that Phoenix needed to be lifted into dry dock for extensive repairs to the hull . The fireboat was thoroughly renovated in 2004 at Bayside <unk> in Sausalito , California . 
 = Verdeja = 
 Verdeja was the name of a series of light tanks developed in Spain between 1938 and 1954 in an attempt to replace German Panzer I and Soviet T @-@ 26 tanks in Spanish service . 
 The program was headed by major Félix Verdeja <unk> and led to the development of four prototype vehicles , including a self @-@ propelled howitzer armed with a 75 millimeter ( 3 in ) gun . It was designed as an advanced light tank and was one of the first development programs which took into account survivability of the crew as opposed to the protection of the tank itself . The tank was influenced by several of the light tanks which it was intended to replace , including the Panzer I and T @-@ 26 , both of which were originally used during the Spanish Civil War . The Verdeja was considered a superior tank to the T @-@ 26 after a lengthy testing period , yet was never put into mass production . 
 Three light tank prototypes were manufactured between 1938 and 1942 , including the Verdeja 1 and the Verdeja 2 . Interest in the vehicle 's development waned after the end of the Second World War . Despite attempts to fit a new engine in the Verdeja 2 and convert the Verdeja 1 into a self @-@ propelled artillery piece , ultimately the program was unofficially canceled in favor of adopting the U.S. M47 Patton Tank in 1954 . A prototype of the 75 millimetre self @-@ propelled howitzer and of the Verdeja 2 were put on display in the early 1990s . 
 = = Development = = 
 Spain received its first tank in mid @-@ 1919 , a French Renault FT , for testing purposes , and later received ten more tanks on 18 December 1921 . The use of these tanks during the Rif War , including the first amphibious landing with tanks , offered valuable experience for Spain 's first indigenous armor program , the Trubia A4 . The Trubia tank program , based on the FT , led to the development of four prototypes , but ultimately the program failed due to lack of interest from the national government . These prototypes influenced a subsequent indigenous attempt to produce a tank , named the Trubia @-@ Naval . This design also failed to get past the prototype type stage . Due to the failure of Spanish efforts to produce a tank , and the ineffective attempts to procure foreign designs such as the Italian Fiat 3000 , by the start of the Spanish Civil War there were only ten working FT light tanks available in the country . 
 The lack of armor prompted the Soviet Union to supply the Popular Front and Nazi Germany and Italy to supply the Nationalist Front with light tanks . Between 1936 and 1939 , the Germans provided the Nationalists with 122 Panzer Is and the Italians provided 155 L @-@ 3 @-@ 35s . Meanwhile , the Soviets issued Republican Spain 281 T @-@ 26s and 50 BT @-@ 5s . The Nationalists quickly found out the light machine guns on their tanks could not penetrate the T @-@ 26 's armor at over 150 metres ( 160 yd ) , and Republican tankers could routinely knock out Panzer Is and L @-@ 3 @-@ 35s at ranges of up to 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) . In order to re @-@ equip Nationalist armored forces with the T @-@ 26 , German Major Ritter von Thoma offered Spanish troops 500 pesetas for each tank captured . There were also attempts to up @-@ gun the Panzer I with an Italian Breda 20 millimetre Model 1935 anti @-@ aircraft gun , due to its high Muzzle velocity and low recoil . Despite four successfully converted vehicles , designated Panzer I Breda , there was no widespread program to retrofit the gun into the Panzer I. Instead , the Nationalists began to press captured T @-@ 26s into service against their previous owners , with the first Nationalist T @-@ 26 unit formed in June 1937 . 
 On 6 September 1937 , Captain Félix Verdeja , commanding the maintenance company of the Nationalist Batallón de Carros de Combate ( " Tank Battalion " ) , began to privately develop a new light tank . His position , with direct access to Panzer Is and T @-@ 26s , gave Verdeja direct evidence of the shortcomings of current tank models in terms of combat ability and maintenance issues . Verdeja established a future tank requiring the 45 millimetre ( 1 @.@ 77 in ) gun fitted in the T @-@ 26 ; two coaxial light machine guns ; a low profile , all @-@ around armor greater than 15 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) , with a turret mantlet plate of at least 30 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) ; road speed of 70 kilometres per hour ( 43 mph ) , combat range of 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) , and a capable suspension and new track system . This latter requirement was based on experiences with existing light tanks , which frequently lost their tracks in combat . These requirements and solutions were presented in October 1938 to Colonel Díaz de la Lastra , commanding officer of the Agrupación de Carros de Combate . Although the project was approved , the program had to use scrap to build the first prototype due to a lack of resources and money . Despite early obstacles , including criticism from von Thoma , the program continued and Verdeja was awarded a warehouse in Zaragoza to continue with the construction of the prototype . 
 The prototype was manufactured from spare parts and equipment scavenged from other light tanks , and featured a rectangular turret with 16 millimetre ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) basic armor . The chassis was divided into four quarters , with the forward right half occupied by the engine , gear box , clutch and final drive , beside the driver . The rear half of the vehicle was taken up mostly by the turret basket and forty @-@ six 45 millimetre rounds , as well as two 60 liter ( 13 Imp gal ) fuel tanks . Turret space was used by the tank commander @-@ gunner and the loader , as well as the 45 millimetre model 1932 anti @-@ tank gun and two MG @-@ 13 machine guns . The main gun was originally commissioned as the Soviet 45 millimetre <unk> anti @-@ tank gun in March 1932 , and featured heavier ammunition and a faster rate of fire than older anti @-@ tank guns . Starting in 1934 , a newer model began to be fitted into newly assembled T @-@ 26s . Apart from the gun , the tank commander 's model 1932 panoramic periscope was also scavenged from a T @-@ 26 . The vehicle was powered by a Ford Model 48 engine taken from a civilian automobile , displacing 3 @,@ 622 cc ( 221 in3 ) and producing 85 hp ( 63 kW ) at 2 @,@ 000 rpm . The engine was paired with a brand @-@ new radiator and exhaust system . The Verdeja prototype used the Panzer I 's <unk> PG @-@ 31 gearbox , although this worked at excessive revolutions for the engine , offering less torque which made slopes greater than 40 ° difficult . Possibly the most unusual features of the Verdeja were the suspension and tracks . To prevent the tank 's tracks slipping off the roadwheels , two track pieces were fitted together to create a central groove for the roadwheel to travel in . With a weight of under 5 tonnes ( 5 @.@ 5 short tons ) the Verdeja had a maximum speed of 70 kilometres per hour ( 43 mph ) and a combat radius of 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) . Following the prototype 's success in testing between 10 January and 20 January 1939 , Captain Verdeja was ordered to begin construction of the definitive model of the light tank . 
 = = = Verdeja 1 = = = 
 The appearance of the resulting Verdeja 1 prototype was close to that originally envisioned in Captain Verdeja 's first designs . The vehicle 's hull was elongated and the rear plate sloped , while the fuel capacity — and thus combat range — was increased , as was the ammunition capacity and the thickness of the armor . The vehicle was fabricated in Bilbao , the only city in Spain with a heavy vehicle assembly line . Due to the end of the Spanish Civil War and a shortage of funds , construction was postponed until May 1940 . The prototype was completed three months later and delivered to the proving grounds in Carabanchel , Madrid , powered with basically the same Ford flathead V8 engine also used as the motive power of the three @-@ tonne weight British Universal Carrier . A major external difference between the previous model and this prototype was the new , low @-@ profile turret which allowed the 45 millimetre gun to depress and elevate from 8 ° to 70 ° . The original 45 millimetre model 1932 gun was exchanged with a new 45 millimetre Mark I tank gun fabricated by S.A. Placencia de las Armas , in Spain . However , the new prototype adopted the suspension and tracks from the original prototype . In essence , the main advantages of the new prototype were its low @-@ profile , high elevation of the main gun and the increased sloping of the armor from 12 ° to 45 ° . It should be noted that the Verdeja 1 retained the original configuration by placing the engine in the front , to increase crew survivability . 
 On arrival at Carabanchel , the vehicle was tested against the T @-@ 26 in mobility over different terrain types and in firepower . The vehicles were graded based upon a five @-@ point scale for each test , which would be multiplied by a coefficient of importance for each test . During the testing the Verdeja traveled for some 500 kilometres ( 300 mi ) without any maintenance problems , the only issue being the large consumption of water by the gasoline engine , due to the lack of an efficient radiator , and the loss of a rubber liner of one of the roadwheels . It was found that the maximum velocity of the Verdeja was either on par with similar vehicles in foreign service or superior , while the Verdeja proved itself capable of going over trenches almost 2 m wide and climbing slopes of 40 ° . In terms of armament , it was proved that the vehicle could withstand the recoil of the 45 millimetre high @-@ velocity tank gun . One of the vehicle 's disadvantages was that the tank commander 's aiming device was designed for a 37 millimetre anti @-@ tank cannon , adapted into the Verdeja due to the lack of time to manufacture one for the 45 millimetre Mark I. Testing concluded with the Verdeja receiving a total of 243 points , compared to the 205 points awarded to the T @-@ 26B . Testing completed , the prototype was returned and several problems were fixed , including engine deficiencies , the elevation of the sprocket and an increase to 10 millimetre of armor on all areas that had less . These changes made , the Verdeja returned to testing , this time scoring 261 @.@ 98 points . 
 Plans to produce one thousand Verdeja tanks were approved on 2 December 1940 , divided into ten batches of one hundred tanks each . The Verdeja production prototype was to adopt the 120 horsepower ( 89 kW ) Lincoln @-@ Zephyr gasoline V12 engine , requiring a contract between the Spanish government and Ford Motor <unk> , Ford 's Spanish subsidiary . Simultaneously , in case of failure of talks between Ford and Spain , the government also began to contact a number of German companies , including Maybach . In order to begin production , the Tank Workshop in Zaragoza was to be expanded to allow final assembly of at least five tanks per month . Despite funding and two years of construction allotted , the factory construction and expansion was never completed . Other problems arose , including the failure to reach an agreement with Ford or Maybach . These factors , the poor economic situation in Spain , the lack of clients other than the Spanish Army and the lack of incentives for Spanish companies to partake in the construction program , led to the abandonment of the attempt to fabricate the Verdeja 1 . Another attempt was undertaken at contracting the <unk> ( <unk> de Aviación , S.A. ) company , to manufacture two Verdeja light tanks for experimental purposes . Despite the failure to procure an engine , <unk> offered to construct 300 units , but these attempts failed and the program was abandoned by 1941 . 
 = = = Verdeja 2 = = = 
 As the Verdeja 1 program dissolved , Captain Verdeja began to design a successor taking into consideration lessons learned during the opening campaigns of the Second World War . The new design featured a redesigned engine bay at the rear of the chassis , which meant moving the drive sprocket to the rear as well . The movement of the engine 's location allowed for better cooling of the vehicle 's motor and the fighting compartment , as well as allowing the turret to be moved forward . The vehicle 's armor was also increased substantially by between five and ten millimetres . This new tank was not approved for production or further development due to continued postponement of the production of the Verdeja 1 for reasons which included offers by the German government to supply the Panzer IV 's engine for the Verdeja 1 . Although production of the new vehicle finally began in 1942 , it was not until August 1944 that the Verdeja 2 prototype was delivered . The program was delayed by the incorporation of twenty Panzer IV Ausf . H 's and ten Sturmgeschütz IIIs into the Spanish Army in late 1943 , as well as failed attempts to procure one hundred more Panzer IVs and even Panthers and Tigers during 1944 . With these new vehicles integrated into the army and the fiscal problems which plagued the Verdeja 1 , the Verdeja 2 remained unimproved until 1950 , when there was an attempt to fit a Pegaso Z @-@ 202 engine . Despite this , the Verdeja remained on factory grounds until 1973 , when it was transferred to the Infantry Academy of Toledo .

 = = Self @-@ propelled howitzer = = 
 Between the late 1940s and early 1950s there were a number of programs in Spain to develop a self @-@ propelled howitzer based on an existing chassis . For example , during the early 1950s , Spanish engineers attempted to retrofit a R @-@ 43 105 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L / 26 howitzer into a StuG III . This required reconstruction of the turret 's casemate , in a fashion similar to the Verdeja 75 @-@ millimeter self @-@ propelled howitzer . Although one vehicle began conversion , the program was never finalized . There were similar programs to fit an 88 @-@ millimeter L / 56 and a 122 @-@ millimeter L / 46 howitzer thereafter , but these did not advance beyond the planning stage , either . One of the most successful programs was the attempt to produce a 75 @-@ millimeter self @-@ propelled howitzer based on the chassis of the Verdeja 1 prototype . Beginning in 1945 , now @-@ Major Verdeja was ordered to begin designing this piece using a rapid @-@ firing 75 @-@ millimeter L / 40 howitzer designed by Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval . The availability of the required parts and the lack of complicated changes meant that the vehicle was quickly prepared and tested extensively . The fate of the self @-@ propelled piece was much the same as that of the Verdeja 2 , and the vehicle was left untouched at the proving grounds in Carabanchel until 1973 , when it was moved to the Spanish base Alfonso XIII , housing the then Mechanized Infantry Regiment Wad Rass nº 55 . It was soon moved to another base , and finally delivered to the base of El <unk> , outside of Madrid , as a part of an armored vehicles museum . 
 Major changes to the original Verdeja 1 included removing the turret and replacing it with a gun shield with 10 millimetre thick steel armor . This meant that much of the chassis ' roof and rear wall was eliminated . The howitzer was designed as a <unk> steel tube , using a double @-@ baffle muzzle brake , with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers . As mounted , the howitzer could fire between 0 @.@ 5 ° and 25 ° , and move 4 @.@ 5 ° either left or right . The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready @-@ round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield on each side of the breech , allowing easy access to projectiles . Otherwise , the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage . The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti @-@ tank gun . A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler @-@ wheel to the rear of the chassis , guaranteeing the vehicle 's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission . 
 = = Conclusions = = 
 Ultimately the Verdeja program 's end came with the arrival of military equipment from the United States , beginning in 1953 . From 1954 , the Spanish Army received 389 M47 Patton Tanks , replacing the T @-@ 26s , Panzer Is and Panzer IVs then in service . The Verdeja had become completely obsolete when compared to larger , more potent tanks such as the German Panther , the Soviet T @-@ 54 and the US M47 . The T @-@ 54 had 200 millimetre of steel armor on the turret mantlet , far greater than the Verdeja 2 's maximum armor thickness of 40 <unk> . The Soviet 45 millimetre model 1932 gun was replaced by the T @-@ 34 's 76 @.@ 2 millimetre gun , while the Germans adopted the 75 millimetre L / 70 tank gun on the Panther . By 1950 , Soviet tanks such as the T @-@ 54 were armed with the D @-@ <unk> 100 millimetre tank gun , and American tanks adopted the 90 millimetre main gun . Although the Verdeja was Spain 's most successful indigenous design , it was outclassed as foreign countries produced superior products . Furthermore , the need for self @-@ propelled artillery was soon eliminated as the United States offered Spain M37 and <unk> self @-@ propelled howitzers . As a result , interest in the Verdeja dried up after 1954 . Spain would not attempt another indigenous tank until the advent of the Lince main battle tank in the late 1980s . 
 = H @-@ class battleship proposals = 
 The H class was a series of battleship designs for Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine , intended to fulfill the requirements of Plan Z in the late 1930s and early 1940s . The first variation , " H @-@ 39 , " called for six ships to be built , essentially as enlarged Bismarck @-@ class battleships with 40 @.@ 6 cm ( 16 @.@ 0 in ) guns . The " H @-@ 41 " design improved the " H @-@ 39 " ship with still larger main guns , with eight 42 cm ( 16 @.@ 5 in ) weapons . Two subsequent plans , " H @-@ 42 " and " H @-@ 43 " , increased the main battery yet again , with 48 cm ( 19 in ) pieces , and the enormous " H @-@ 44 " design ultimately resulted with 50 @.@ 8 cm ( 20 @.@ 0 in ) guns . The ships ranged in size from the " H @-@ 39 " , which was 277 @.@ 8 m ( 911 ft 5 in ) long on a displacement of 56 @,@ 444 t ( 55 @,@ 553 long tons ) , to the " H @-@ 44 " , at 345 m ( 1 @,@ 131 ft 11 in ) on a displacement of 131 @,@ 000 t ( 129 @,@ 000 long tons ) . Most of the designs had a top speed in excess of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) . 
 Due to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , none of the ships were ever built ; only the first two of the " H @-@ 39 " ships were laid down . What work that had been accomplished was halted ; the assembled steel remained on the slipway until November 1941 , when the Oberkommando der Marine ordered it be scrapped for other purposes . Contracts for the other four " H @-@ 39 " type ships had been awarded , but no work was begun on any of them before they were canceled . None of the subsequent designs progressed further than planning stages . 
 = = Initial design = = 
 The earliest design studies for " Schlachtschiff H " ( " Battleship H " ) date to 1935 , and were near repeats of the early designs for the Bismarck @-@ class ships , armed with 35 @-@ centimeter ( 14 in ) guns . Intelligence indicating that the Soviet Navy was planning the Sovetsky Soyuz class with 38 cm ( 15 in ) guns prompted the Germans to increase the caliber of the ship 's armament to 38 cm as well on 5 October 1936 . The Oberkommando der Marine ( OKM ) issued staff requirements at the end of October for a ship of 35 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 000 t ) armed with eight 38 cm guns with a speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . The ship 's radius of action was to be at least equal that of the Deutschland @-@ class cruisers . 
 Design work on the ship that came to be designated H @-@ 39 began in 1937 . The design staff was instructed to improve upon the design for the preceding Bismarck class ; one of the requirements was a larger @-@ caliber main battery to match any battleship built by a potential adversary . It appeared that Japan would not ratify the Second London Naval Treaty , which would bring an escalator clause that permitted signatories to arm battleships with guns of up to 40 @.@ 6 cm ( 16 @.@ 0 in ) caliber . By virtue of the Anglo @-@ German Naval Agreement , signed in 1935 , Germany was considered to be a party to the other international naval arms limitation treaties . In April , Japan refused to sign the treaty ; shortly thereafter , the United States Navy announced it would arm the new North Carolina @-@ class battleships with 40 @.@ 6 cm guns . 
 Admiral Werner Fuchs , responsible for the staff section in the OKM that determined the operating requirements for the ship , discussed the vessel 's design with Adolf Hitler , the leader of Germany . Hitler demanded guns larger than any possible adversary , but guns of the caliber demanded by Hitler would have required displacements of over 80 @,@ 000 long tons ( 81 @,@ 000 t ) and drafts so deep as to prevent the use of Germany 's ports without significant dredging . Fuchs eventually convinced Hitler that the 40 @.@ 6 cm gun was the optimal choice for the H @-@ 39 design . In 1938 , the OKM developed Plan Z , the projected construction program for the German navy . A force of six H @-@ 39 class battleships was the centerpiece of the fleet . Plan Z was finalized by January 1939 , when Admiral Erich Raeder , the commander of the Kriegsmarine , presented it to Hitler . He approved the plan on 18 January and granted the Kriegsmarine unlimited power to bring the construction program to fruition . 
 Only four shipyards in Germany had slipways large enough to build the six new battleships . The OKM issued orders for construction of the first two ships , " H " and " J " , on 14 April 1939 . The contracts for the other four ships , " K " , " L " , " M " , and " N " , followed on 25 May . The keels for the first two ships were laid at the Blohm & Voss dockyard in Hamburg and the Deschimag shipyard in Bremen on 15 July and 1 September 1939 , respectively . The outbreak of war in September 1939 interrupted the construction of the ships . Work on the first two was suspended and the other four were not laid down , as it was believed they would not be finished before the war was over . The keel for " H " had 800 t ( 790 long tons ; 880 short tons ) of steel installed , 3 @,@ 500 t ( 3 @,@ 400 long tons ; 3 @,@ 900 short tons ) of steel had been machined , out of 5 @,@ 800 t ( 5 @,@ 700 long tons ; 6 @,@ 400 short tons ) of steel supplied to Blohm & Voss by that point . Only 40 t ( 39 long tons ; 44 short tons ) of steel had been worked into the keel for " J " , out of 3 @,@ 531 t ( 3 @,@ 475 long tons ; 3 @,@ 892 short tons ) of steel delivered . Steel for the other four ships had been ordered and partially machined for installation , though no assembly work had begun . It was expected to resume work on the ships after a German victory in the war . 
 The ships neither received names nor were official name proposals published . The names , which appear in several publications ( Hindenburg , Friedrich der Große , Großdeutschland ) are pure speculation . Especially the often mentioned Großdeutschland ( = " Greater Germany " ) is highly unlikely , as Hitler always feared the loss of a vessel with name of Germany ( compare the renaming of Deutschland to Lützow ) . The only hint on the names of the units were given by Hitler himself , who mentioned during documented unofficial talks , that he would propose the names Ulrich von Hutten and Götz von Berlichingen for the ships , as these names are not connected with persons of the third Reich or the country itself , so the loss would not have a significant negative psychological and propaganda effect on the German people . 
 = = = H @-@ 39 specifications = = = 
 Characteristics and machinery 
 As finalized , the H @-@ 39 design called for a ship 266 m ( 873 ft ) long at the waterline and 277 @.@ 8 m ( 911 ft ) long overall . The beam was to have been 37 m ( 121 ft ) with a designed draft of 10 m ( 33 ft ) . At standard displacement , which was 52 @,@ 600 long tons ( 53 @,@ 400 t ) , the draft was slightly under the limit , at 9 @.@ 6 m ( 31 ft ) . With the ship fully loaded , at 62 @,@ 600 long tons ( 63 @,@ 600 t ) , draft rose significantly , to 11 @.@ 2 m ( 37 ft ) . The hull was constructed from transverse and longitudinal steel frames and featured over 90 percent welding . The hull contained twenty @-@ one large watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 89 percent of the length of the keel . Four bilge keels were fitted to improve stability . The ships had an estimated complement of 2 @,@ 600 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ships were to be powered by twelve MAN 9 @-@ cylinder double acting 2 @-@ stroke diesel engines . The engines were arranged in groups of four , on three shafts , and drove three @-@ bladed screws 4 @.@ 8 m ( 16 ft ) in diameter . Four auxiliary boilers were installed to provide backup power ; two were oil @-@ fired and were located between the central transmission rooms . The other two , a pair of exhaust gas boilers , were placed above them . The power @-@ plant was rated at 165 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 123 @,@ 000 kW ) and 260 rpm ; it provided a top speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) as designed . The vessels could have carried up to 8 @,@ 700 t ( 8 @,@ 600 long tons ; 9 @,@ 600 short tons ) of diesel oil , which enabled a range of 7 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 000 km ; 8 @,@ 100 mi ) at 28 kn ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) , or 19 @,@ 200 nmi ( 35 @,@ 600 km ; 22 @,@ 100 mi ) at a cruising speed of 19 kn ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . 
 Armament 
 The main armament was to consist of eight 40 @.@ 6 cm SK C / 34 guns in four twin gun turrets . The 40 @.@ 6 cm ( 16 in ) gun was 50 calibers long and fired at a muzzle velocity of 810 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 657 ft / s ) . The guns were supplied with a total of 960 rounds of ammunition or 120 shells per gun ; each shell weighed 1 @,@ 030 kg ( 2 @,@ 270 lb ) . The guns used a sliding breech block , as was typical for German naval guns of the period ; the breech was fully sealed with a 91 kg ( 201 lb ) brass cartridge that contained the 128 kg ( 282 lb ) main propellant charge . A fore charge weighing 134 kg ( 295 lb ) supplemented the main charge . The turrets allowed for elevation to 30 degrees , which provided a maximum range of approximately 36 @,@ 400 m ( 119 @,@ 400 ft ) . Rate of fire was expected to be two rounds per minute per gun . Fire control radar was unspecified , but the ships , which were to have been completed by 1944 , presumably would have been equipped with an arrangement similar to that of Tirpitz as she was outfitted in 1943 – 44 . Several of the 40 @.@ 6 cm guns were constructed before work on the ships was halted ; these were later employed as coastal guns , including at Battery Lindemann in France . 
 Twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 55 <unk> guns mounted in six twin turrets comprised the ships ' secondary battery . These were the same secondaries employed on the Scharnhorst and Bismarck classes . The turrets allowed 40 degrees of elevation and had a maximum range of 23 @,@ 000 m ( 75 @,@ 000 ft ) . They fired a 45 @.@ 3 kg ( 100 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 875 m / s ( 2 @,@ 871 ft / s ) , and were primarily intended for defense against surface threats . The ships were also to be armed with six 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , all submerged . They were all mounted in the bow , diverging from the centerline by 10 degrees . 
 Sixteen dual @-@ mounted 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L / 65 C33 Flak guns provided long @-@ range defense against aircraft . Unlike those mounted on the Scharnhorst and Bismarck classes , these guns were armored to protect their crews from shrapnel , debris , and strafing attacks . The new turrets also provided faster rates of training and elevation as compared to the earlier open mounts . Close @-@ range air defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) L / 83 C33 and twenty @-@ four 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) <unk> guns . The 3 @.@ 7 cm guns were placed in eight twin mounts while the 2 cm guns were arrayed in six Flakvierling quadruple mountings . The 3 @.@ 7 cm guns were closely grouped amidships and had a single , common ammunition hoist . Historians William Dulin and Robert Garzke note that the anti @-@ aircraft battery as designed was too weak to effectively defend against the high @-@ performance aircraft that came into service in the late 1930s and 1940s , and speculate that " it would have been augmented before the ships were completed . " 
 Armor 
 The design team envisioned the H @-@ class ships fighting at relatively close range , and therefore selected the armor system that had been used by German battleship constructors since the Nassau class of 1907 . The side belt was vertical and was attached directly to the side of the hull , in contrast with the inclined armor belt placed inboard of the side wall used by American and French designers . The side belt , which consisted of Krupp cemented steel armor ( KCA ) , was 300 mm ( 12 in ) thick in the central section that covered the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces . The belt was reduced to 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) on either end of the main section ; the stern and bow were unprotected by the main belt . The upper side belt was 145 mm ( 5 @.@ 7 in ) thick . The German navy did not preserve official estimates for the immunity zone , though Garzke and Dulin created an estimate based on the performance of the US 16 in ( 41 cm ) 45 caliber gun firing a 1 @,@ 016 kg ( 2 @,@ 240 lb ) shell . The ships ' main armor would have rendered them proof against the 16 in shell at ranges between 11 @,@ 000 to 21 @,@ 000 m ( 36 @,@ 000 to 69 @,@ 000 ft ) . The 16 in shell could penetrate the upper side belt at any range , however , which left the ships exposed above the waterline . 
 The underwater protection system was broadly similar to the system employed on the Bismarck class . A 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) thick torpedo bulkhead composed of Wotan Weich steel backed the side armor and provided defense against underwater weapons . The bulkhead was placed 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) from the side of the hull , though abreast of the turrets and further in the bow and stern , this distance could not be maintained . The distance between the bulkhead and the side of the ship was reduced to 3 @.@ 25 m ( 10 @.@ 7 ft ) in these areas ; the designers compensated for the reduced space by increasing the thickness of the bulkhead to 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) in these areas . 
 Two armored decks composed of Wotan Hart steel protected the ships from plunging fire and aerial weapons . The upper deck was 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick above the magazines and 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) over the machinery spaces . The main armored deck was 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) and 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick , respectively , though on the outboard sloped sections , thickness was increased to augment the protection over the ships ' vitals . Over the magazines , the sloped armor was 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick ; over the machinery spaces it was 120 mm thick . Concerned with the fate of the battlecruiser Lützow at the Battle of Jutland , the designers opted to provide relatively heavy bow armor for the H @-@ class ships . A 60 to 150 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick splinter belt protected the bow from shell fragments . It was reasoned that direct shell hits would cause localized damage that could be better isolated than damage from splinters , which could cause extensive flooding . 
 The main battery gun turrets were armored with 385 mm ( 15 @.@ 2 in ) thick faces , 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) thick sides , and 130 mm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) roofs . The rear side of the turret was 325 mm ( 12 @.@ 8 in ) thick ; in addition to the protection offered by the greater thickness , it also moved the center of gravity of the mounting to the rear , which helped balance the turret and improve its operation . The barbettes upon which the turrets sat were armored with 365 mm ( 14 @.@ 4 in ) face @-@ hardened steel above the upper armor deck and 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) non @-@ cemented steel below the deck . The 15 cm gun turrets had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick faces , 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick sides , and 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) thick roofs . Their barbettes had 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick armor protection . The 10 @.@ 5 cm mounts were protected by 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick gun shields . The forward conning tower had 350 mm ( 14 in ) thick sides composed of KCA and 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick roof composed of non @-@ cemented steel . The rear conning tower had 100 mm thick sides and roof , KCA and non @-@ cemented steel , respectively .

 In early July 1940 , Hitler ordered the navy to examine new battleship designs and how wartime experience might be incorporated . A study was completed on 15 July , and contained several recommendations for the H @-@ class ships , including increasing the freeboard and strengthening the horizontal protection . In order to maintain displacement and speed and accommodate the increased weight of the additional armor protection , the design staff drew up an informal design , known as " Scheme A. " The design removed one of the main battery turrets to save weight ; the propulsion system was also increased in power to keep the same speed as the original design . The original diesel @-@ only system was replaced by a hybrid diesel and steam turbine arrangement . The staff also prepared a second design , " Scheme B " , which retained the fourth turret and accepted a much higher displacement . This design also incorporated the mixed propulsion system . These studies were abandoned in 1941 after Hitler decided to halt further battleship construction until after the end of the war . The design staff therefore attempted to improve the armor protection for the H @-@ class . The 1940 designs did not form part of the design chain that resulted in the H @-@ 41 through H @-@ 44 designs . 
 = = = H @-@ 41 = = = 
 Bomb damage sustained by Scharnhorst in July 1941 provided the impetus for the effort to increase the horizontal protection for the H @-@ class . The designers were confronted with a significant problem : any increase in armor could correspondingly increase the displacement and more importantly , the draft . It was necessary to maintain the full @-@ load draft of 11 @.@ 5 m of the H @-@ 39 design for operations in the relatively shallow North Sea . The only option that allowed the displacement to be maintained while armor thicknesses to be increased was to reduce the ships ' fuel supplies . A 25 percent cut in range was required , which was deemed unacceptable by the OKM . It was eventually determined that since deep @-@ water anchorages on the Atlantic coast were available , it would be permissible to allow the draft to increase . The initial redesign called for an increase of only 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) , 40 percent of which was additional deck armor , the remainder being used for a larger @-@ caliber main battery . 
 One of the most significant changes was the decision to bore out the over @-@ sized 40 @.@ 6 cm guns to 42 cm caliber for the H @-@ 41 design . The design staff determined that modifications to the ammunition hoists and loading equipment would be easily effected and that the original turrets could be retained . The OKM was aware that the British had settled on a 40 @.@ 6 cm gun for the proposed Lion class ; the 42 cm gun would grant the H @-@ 41 design a significant advantage over these new adversaries . The ships ' armament was otherwise unchanged , apart from an increased number of 2 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns , of which there were now to be 34 . 
 The ships ' main armor decks were substantially strengthened : the deck was increased in thickness from 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) to 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) and the sloped armor at the edges was thickened from 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) to 175 mm ( 6 @.@ 9 in ) . Wartime experience with the Scharnhorst class indicated that the torpedo @-@ defense system was insufficiently strong to protect the H @-@ 39 design from underwater damage . Beam was therefore increased , with greater width added at the ends of the armored citadel to allow a greater distance between the side wall and the torpedo bulkhead . The stern section of the torpedo bulkhead was also strengthened structurally to allow it to better contain the force of an underwater explosion . A triple bottom was also included in the design , the first time a feature was used in a German warship design . The loss of Bismarck in May 1941 also influenced the design ; two large skegs were added to the outboard shafts to protect them and increase support for the stern while in drydock . The rudder system was also designed with an explosive charge to detach the rudders in the event they became jammed . 
 The finalized design was approved by Admiral Raeder on 15 November 1941 . The new design measured 282 m ( 925 ft ) long at the waterline , had a beam of 39 m ( 128 ft ) , and a draft of up to 12 @.@ 2 m ( 40 ft ) at full load . The increase in weight , while engine power remained constant , reduced speed to 28 @.@ 8 kn ( 53 @.@ 3 km / h ; 33 @.@ 1 mph ) . The OKM planned to begin construction six to nine months after demobilization , initially at Blohm & Voss and the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel . Deschimag , which had been awarded the contract for " J " , could no longer be used due to the increase in draft , which precluded travel through the shallow Weser . Following the completion of a new , larger dock at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven , work would also be done there . The increased size of the ships would have lengthened the building time from four to five years .

 On 8 February 1942 , Albert Speer became the Reichsminister for Armaments and Munitions and gained influence over the Navy 's construction programs . Speer reassigned some members of the H class design staff to work on new U @-@ boats and other tasks deemed critical to the war effort . The <unk> ( New Ships Construction Commission ) , intended to liaise with Speer and the OKM , was created and placed under the direction of Admiral Karl Topp . This group was responsible for the design work that resulted in the H @-@ 42 type , as well as the subsequent designs . The Construction Office of the OKM formally concluded their work on new battleships with the H @-@ 41 type and played no further role in battleship development . 
 After the completion of the H @-@ 41 design , Hitler issued a request for a larger battleship and placed no restrictions on gun caliber or displacement . The only requirements were a speed of 30 kn ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) , horizontal and underwater protection sufficiently strong enough to protect the vessel from all attacks , and a main battery properly balanced with the size of the ship . The results were purely study projects intended to determine the size of a ship with strong enough armor to counter the rapidly increasing power of bombs deployed by the Allies during the war . The Commission did not discuss its activities with Raeder or his successor , Admiral Karl Dönitz , or with other branches in the OKM . As the designs for the H @-@ 42 , H @-@ 43 , and H @-@ 44 battleships were purely conjectural , no actual work was begun . The German navy did not seriously consider construction on any of the designs , which were so large that they could not have been built in a traditional slipway . Indeed , the Construction Office of the OKM sought to disassociate itself from the projects , which they found to be of doubtful merit and unnecessary for German victory . 
 The first design , H @-@ 42 , was 305 m ( 1 @,@ 001 ft ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 42 @.@ 8 m ( 140 ft ) and a draft of 11 @.@ 8 m ( 39 ft ) designed and 12 @.@ 7 m ( 42 ft ) at full load . The designed displacement was 90 @,@ 000 t ( 89 @,@ 000 long tons ; 99 @,@ 000 short tons ) and at full load rose to 96 @,@ 555 long tons ( 98 @,@ 104 t ) . The dimensions for the second , H @-@ 43 , increased to 330 m ( 1 @,@ 080 ft ) between perpendiculars , a beam of 48 m ( 157 ft ) , and design and full load drafts of 12 m ( 39 ft ) and 12 @.@ 9 m ( 42 ft ) , respectively . Design displacement was 111 @,@ 000 t ( 109 @,@ 000 long tons ; 122 @,@ 000 short tons ) and estimated at 118 @,@ 110 long tons ( 120 @,@ 010 t ) at full load . For the final design , H @-@ 44 , the length rose to 345 m ( 1 @,@ 132 ft ) between perpendiculars , the beam increased to 51 @.@ 5 m ( 169 ft ) , and draft rose to 12 @.@ 7 m ( 42 ft ) as designed and 13 @.@ 5 m ( 44 ft ) at full load . The displacement for H @-@ 44 was 131 @,@ 000 t ( 129 @,@ 000 long tons ; 144 @,@ 000 short tons ) as designed and up to 139 @,@ 272 long tons ( 141 @,@ 507 t ) at full load . 
 Details on the propulsion systems for these designs are fragmentary and in some cases contradictory . Erich Gröner notes that " some [ had ] pure [ diesel ] engine propulsion , others [ had ] hybrid engine / turbine propulsion systems , " but does not record the type and performance for these propulsion systems . William Garzke and Robert Dulin state that all three designs featured hybrid diesel / steam turbine plants , each supplying 266 @,@ 000 shp ( 198 @,@ 000 kW ) for top speeds of 31 @.@ 9 kn ( 59 @.@ 1 km / h ; 36 @.@ 7 mph ) , 30 @.@ 9 kn ( 57 @.@ 2 km / h ; 35 @.@ 6 mph ) , and 29 @.@ 8 kn ( 55 @.@ 2 km / h ; 34 @.@ 3 mph ) for H @-@ 42 , H @-@ 43 , and H @-@ 44 , respectively . According to Garzke and Dulin , the designs had a speed of 24 kn ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) , 23 kn ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) , and 22 @.@ 5 kn ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) , respectively , on just diesel engine power . Both sources agree on a maximum range of 20 @,@ 000 nmi ( 37 @,@ 000 km ; 23 @,@ 000 mi ) at a cruising speed of 19 kn ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . 
 Information on the armament outfits for the designs is equally contradictory . Both sources agree on the armament for H @-@ 44 , which was to have been eight 50 @.@ 8 cm ( 20 @.@ 0 in ) guns . Gröner indicates that H @-@ 42 and H @-@ 43 were to be armed with eight 48 cm guns , while Garzke and Dulin state that the H @-@ 42 design was to have retained the 42 cm guns from the H @-@ 41 design and H @-@ 43 would have also been armed with 50 @.@ 8 cm pieces . Both works agree that the secondary armament was to have consisted of twelve 15 cm L / 55 guns and sixteen 10 @.@ 5 cm L / 65 guns as in the previous designs , though the lighter weapons are disputed . Gröner states that all three designs were to be equipped with twenty @-@ eight 3 @.@ 7 cm and forty 2 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns , while Garzke and Dulin report only sixteen 3 @.@ 7 cm guns and forty 2 cm guns for H @-@ 43 and H @-@ 44 only ; H @-@ 42 was to have twenty @-@ four 2 cm guns . Both sources concur that six submerged 53 @.@ 3 cm torpedo tubes were included in each design .

 The Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District is the public school district of Briarcliff Manor , New York . The district is an independent public entity , and is governed by the district Board of Education , whose members are elected in non @-@ partisan elections for staggered , three @-@ year terms . The board selects a superintendent , who is the district 's chief administrative official . The district 's offices are located in Todd Elementary School . 
 The district has three schools , Todd Elementary School , Briarcliff Middle School and Briarcliff High School . It has about 1 @,@ 600 students , and spends an average of $ 24 @,@ 858 per pupil and has a student – teacher ratio of 13 : 1 ( the national averages are $ 12 @,@ 435 and 15 @.@ 3 : 1 respectively ) .

 = = History = = 
 In 1865 , a one @-@ room schoolhouse was built on land donated by John Whitson on the south side of Pleasantville Road , between the Pocantico River and the New York & Putnam Railroad ( now NY Route 9A / 100 ) . The building ( Whitson 's School , District No. 6 ) became the first schoolhouse in the area . George A. Todd , Jr. was the first teacher and superintendent of the school . In 1867 , the school was moved to the White School , named thus due to its exterior paint . 
 Its replacement building , Briarcliff Public School , was built in 1898 on the site of the White School . The building failed to meet requirements set by New York 's commissioner of education , and thus in 1910 , it became the Briarcliff Community Center , a social organization established by the village . Around the same time , in 1908 , $ 50 @,@ 000 ( $ 1 @.@ 32 million in 2015 ) was voted for Briarcliff Manor to buy a plot by Law Memorial Park , and the school moved again , to the Spanish Renaissance @-@ style Grade School building , which was built there the following year . Students would attend that school from kindergarten to ninth grade and have the option to then attend the nearby Ossining High School . In 1918 , the Briarcliff school began educating students through high school ; in 1928 , a dedicated wing for high school students was built onto the Grade School building . The enlarged school accepted students from Croton , Hawthorne , North White Plains , Valhalla , and as far as Granite Springs . 
 In 1953 , Todd Elementary School opened to free space at the Law Park grade school for middle- and high @-@ school students . The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the Grade School building . The district under its current name was officially established in 1974 . 
 In 1980 , Pace University began leasing the middle school building , and the middle school was moved to a portion of the new high school building . The Grade School building was demolished in 1996 , and a retirement home was built on its site the following year . In the early 2000s , the current Briarcliff Middle School was constructed adjoining to the high school . The wing was completed in 2003 at a cost of $ 24 million ( $ 30 @.@ 9 million in 2015 ) in the same red @-@ brick @-@ and @-@ glass style as the high school wing . In 2008 , the school district won first place for the small district category of that year 's Digital School Districts Survey .

 = Battle of Triangle Hill = 
 The Battle of Triangle Hill , also known as Operation Showdown or the <unk> Campaign ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , was a protracted military engagement during the Korean War . The main combatants were two United Nations infantry divisions , with additional support from the United States Air Force , against elements of the 15th and 12th Corps of the People 's Republic of China . The battle was part of American attempts to gain control of " The Iron Triangle " , and took place from October 14 – November 25 , 1952 . 
 The immediate American objective was Triangle Hill ( 38 ° 19 ′ 17 ″ N 127 ° 27 ′ 52 ″ E ) , a forested ridge of high ground 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) north of Gimhwa @-@ eup near the Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) . The hill was occupied by the veterans of the People 's Volunteer Army 's 15th Corps . Over the course of nearly a month , substantial American and South Korean forces made repeated attempts to capture Triangle Hill and the adjacent Sniper Ridge . Despite clear superiority in artillery and aircraft , escalating American and South Korean casualties resulted in the attack being halted after 42 days of fighting , with Chinese forces regaining their original positions . 
 = = Background = = 
 By mid @-@ 1951 the Korean War had entered a period of relative stalemate . With the resignation of Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) in June 1952 , General Matthew Ridgway of the United Nations Command was transferred from Korea to Europe as Eisenhower 's replacement . The United States Army appointed General Mark Wayne Clark , commander of the US Fifth Army during World War II , to overall command on the Korean Peninsula as a replacement for Ridgway . 
 General James Van Fleet of the Eighth United States Army had hoped that the change of commanders would allow him to reengage the Chinese in a major campaign , but in an effort to limit UN losses during the peace talks in Panmunjom , Clark repeatedly overruled Van Fleet 's requests for an authorized offensive into North Korean territory . In September 1952 , Van Fleet submitted tentative offensive plans for Operation Showdown , a small @-@ scale offensive drafted by the US IX Corps as a ridge @-@ capturing operation . The goal of the submitted plans was to improve the defensive line of the US 7th Infantry Division north of Gimhwa near Triangle Hill , pushing the Chinese defensive line back 1 @,@ 250 yd ( 1 @,@ 140 m ) . 
 In September 1952 , the negotiations at Panmunjom began to fall apart , primarily due to Sino @-@ North Korean insistence that all prisoners of war be repatriated to their respective original countries , regardless of their personal preferences . As a significant number of Chinese and North Korean POWs had expressed their desire to defect permanently to South Korea or Taiwan , the demand was met with strong opposition from the United States and South Korea . Feeling that the negotiations would soon fail , military commanders on both sides authorized numerous tactical plans as means of applying pressure on their opponents . In late September , the High Command of the Chinese People 's Volunteer Army ( PVA ) authorized the tactical plans which led to the Battle of White Horse . On October 8 , 1952 , truce negotiations officially ceased . Clark gave his consent to Operation Showdown the same day .

 Triangle Hill , as it was named by the American command , is a forested hill that appears as a V shape when seen from the air or on a map . Hill 598 sits at the tip of the V and overlooks the Gimhwa valley less than 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) to the south . From this apex , two ridges extend to the northeast and northwest . The ridge to the northwest is dominated by a hill nicknamed " Pike 's Peak " . The other connects to a pair of hills that had been dubbed " Jane Russell " . A less @-@ prominent ridge , named Sandy , slopes down to the east . Across the valley from Sandy stands Sniper Ridge , located at 38 ° 19 ′ 44 ″ N 127 ° 29 ′ 7 ″ E. 
 = = = Forces and strategies = = = 
 The original plan for Operation Showdown called for simultaneous attacks on both Triangle Hill and Sniper Ridge . One battalion from the 31st Infantry Regiment of the US 7th Infantry Division would take Triangle Hill from Gimhwa @-@ eup , while one battalion from the 32nd Regiment of the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) 2nd Infantry Division would attack Sniper Ridge along a parallel northbound route . UN planners expected the operation to last no more than five days with 200 casualties on the UN side , based on the assumption that maximum artillery and air support would be available . Before the plan could be carried out , however , the artillery and air assets for this operation were diverted to the fighting at White Horse . Upon reviewing the situation , Colonel Lloyd R. Moses , commander of the US 31st Infantry Regiment , doubled the American strength just before the offensive . 
 On the Chinese side , Triangle Hill was defended by the 8th and 9th Companies , and Sniper Ridge by the 1st Company of the 15th Corps ' 135th Regiment , 45th Division . Qin Jiwei , commander of the 15th Corps , predicted that any major American attack would be one of mechanized infantry and armor directed at the Pyonggang Valley 20 km ( 12 mi ) to the west of Triangle Hill . As a result , the primary formations of the 15th Corps , including the 44th Division , the 29th Division , one armored regiment and most of the corps artillery , were positioned near Pyonggang . In an effort to compensate its inferior firepower , the 15th Corps constructed an intricate series of defensive networks , which were composed of 9 @,@ 000 meters ( 9 @,@ 800 yd ) of tunnels , 50 @,@ 000 m ( 55 @,@ 000 yd ) of trenches and 5 @,@ 000 m ( 5 @,@ 500 yd ) of obstacles and minefields . On October 5 , 1952 , a staff officer of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division defected to Chinese forces , bringing with him a complete battle plan of Operation Showdown , but the information was not taken seriously by the Chinese .

 On October 14 , 1952 at 4 am , following two days of preliminary air strikes , the ROK @-@ American bombardment intensified across the 30 km ( 19 mi ) front held by the Chinese 15th Corps . At 5 am , the 280 guns and howitzers of the IX Corps extended their firing range to allow for the ROK @-@ American infantry to advance behind a rolling barrage . The concentrated bombardment succeeded in clearing the foliage on Triangle Hill and Sniper Ridge , destroying most of the above @-@ ground fortifications on the two positions . The intense shelling also disrupted Chinese communication lines , eliminating all wired and wireless communications in the area . 
 As the American and South Korean forces approached the Chinese defenses , they were met with grenades , Bangalore torpedoes , shaped charges and rocks . Unable to safely advance , American and South Korean troops were forced to rely on close @-@ support artillery to subdue Chinese resistance , but a complex network of bunkers and tunnels allowed the Chinese to bring up reinforcements as the above @-@ ground troops were depleted . Although the 31st Infantry Regiment was equipped with ballistic vests in the first mass military deployment of modern personal armor ; its 1st and 3rd battalions nevertheless suffered 96 fatalities , with an additional 337 men wounded in the first attack – the heaviest casualties the 31st Infantry Regiment had suffered in a single day during the war . 
 The Chinese managed to inflict heavy casualties on the attackers , but their defenses were starting to give way under devastating UN firepower . The defending company of Sniper Ridge was forced to withdraw into the tunnels after it was reduced to 20 survivors , and the ROK 2nd Battalion captured the ridge by 3 : 20 pm . Despite the acquisition of Sniper Ridge , the attack on Triangle Hill stalled in front of the dominant Hill 598 as both American battalions suffered heavy casualties to Chinese grenades . When only partial progress could be claimed by the late afternoon , US and ROK attacks subsided and preparation of defensive positions to face a Chinese counterattack began . 
 To recover lost ground , the PVA 45th Division commander Cui <unk> attempted a sneak attack with three infantry companies by 7 pm . When flares broke the night cover , the attackers launched bayonet charges and hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting ensued . The UN forces responded with heavy artillery fire , but the determined Chinese assault troops marched through both Chinese and UN artillery screens to reach the UN positions – a strange sight that made some American observers believe that the attackers were under the influence of drugs . The intense fighting prevented UN forces from receiving any resupply , and the UN defenders were forced to give up all captured ground after running out of ammunition . 
 = = = Taking the surface = = = 
 Both Major General Wayne C. Smith and Lieutenant General Chung Il @-@ kwon , commanders of the US 7th Infantry Division and the ROK 2nd Infantry Division respectively , relieved exhausted battalions daily to maintain troops ' morale . On October 15 , Smith ordered the 1st Battalion of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the US 31st Infantry Regiment to be placed under the command of Colonel Moses to resume the attack on Triangle Hill . Similarly , Chung Il @-@ kwon replaced the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment with the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment . Later that day both US battalions captured Hill 598 and Sandy Ridge after meeting only light resistance , but the Chinese tunnels and a counterattack by the PVA 135th Regiment prevented the Americans from advancing towards Pike 's Peak and Jane Russell Hill . The South Koreans , on the other hand , were thrown back by a Chinese counterattack after recapturing Sniper Ridge . 
 On October 16 , Colonel Joseph R. Russ of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment took over the operational command from Moses . He was also given the 2nd Battalion of the US 17th Infantry Regiment to reinforce his right wing . After arriving on the battlefield , the US 2nd Battalion managed to wrestle Jane Russell Hill away from the Chinese on October 16 , but the Americans soon came under heavy fire from Chinese machine guns in the valley below , and were forced to withdraw to the slope behind the hill on October 18 . The Chinese continued to harass the American positions with small raiding parties and grenade barrages throughout that night . The Koreans fared somewhat better . A joint attack by 2nd Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment captured Sniper Ridge and held it against subsequent Chinese counterattacks . For the first time since the combat began , UN forces had gained firm control of the surface , with the exception of Pike 's Peak . On the afternoon of October 17 , the 3rd Battalion of the US 17th Infantry Regiment relieved the 2nd Battalion of the US 31st Infantry Regiment on the left wing , while the 1st Battalion of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment was withdrawn from the pacified center . 
 For Qin Jiwei , the lack of functioning communication networks and accurate intelligence prevented him from responding to the UN assaults . Because of his indecision , the 45th Division also received no artillery support against the UN attacks . In the face of devastating UN firepower , the Chinese defenders suffered 500 casualties per day during the initial UN onslaught . On October 17 , after learning that more than 10 Chinese infantry companies were rendered combat ineffective , Cui <unk> committed the remaining six infantry companies to a last @-@ ditch counterattack . Aided by 44 large @-@ caliber guns and a regiment of BM @-@ 13 rocket launchers , the elite 8th Company of the 134th Regiment attacked from the tunnels under Hill 598 while the other five infantry companies attacked across open ground at dusk on October 19 . Their left wing drove the South Koreans off Sniper Ridge , but the US defenders on Triangle Hill held firm . At daybreak on October 20 , UN firepower regained the upper hand and the Chinese were forced back into the tunnels after suffering heavy casualties . By the time Smith replaced the US 17th Infantry Regiment with the US 32nd Infantry Regiment on the afternoon of October 20 , Qin Jiwei received reports that the 45th Division was completely decimated . The Chinese attacked Hill 598 again on the night of October 23 with two infantry companies , but the well entrenched US troops beat back the attack with little difficulty . 
 After suffering over 4 @,@ 000 casualties in ten days , the failure of the last attack ended the 45th Division 's role as the only combatant on the Chinese side . The UN forces had gained strong control over most of the area , with the remaining Chinese defenders trapped in tunnels under the UN positions . Despite the initial setbacks , Deng Hua , acting commander of the PVA , considered the situation a golden opportunity to bleed the US military white . In the strategy meeting held on the evening of October 25 , the 15th Corps was ordered to retake the two hills regardless of the cost . 
 = = = Interlude = = = 
 Van Fleet decided to rest the US 7th Infantry Division on October 25 , thus sidestepping the Chinese intention of inflicting additional casualties on the Americans . The 31st Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division would take over the Triangle Hill area while the 17th Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division maintained control over Sniper Ridge . On the same day , fresh Chinese reinforcements were converging on the <unk> front . The PVA High Command ordered the 12th Corps to be placed under the command of the 15th Corps and Qin Jiwei ordered the 86th and 87th Regiments of the 29th Division to link up with the 45th Division for a new counterattack . The 45th Division also received 1 @,@ 200 new recruits to reconstitute 13 of its infantry companies . About 67 heavy guns and one regiment of anti @-@ aircraft artillery were made available to support the upcoming counterattack . All Chinese reinforcements were focused on Triangle Hill , with Sniper Ridge considered secondary . 
 Over the next five days , the ROK 31st Regiment was involved in a bitter struggle with the Chinese defenders underground . The PVA 45th Division had also infiltrated small units into UN positions every night to resupply the trapped units and to evacuate the wounded , causing heavy casualties among the Chinese logistics and medical units . As there was no battalion level combat between October 20 and October 29 , the Chinese were able to gather their strength for a decisive blow . 
 = = = Escalation = = = 
 Before the start of the battle , Qin Jiwei had worried that Van Fleet would try to lure the Chinese forces around Triangle Hill , with the real blow directed towards the Pyonggang Valley . To counter this possibility , the 44th Division and the 85th Regiment of the 29th Division had been conducting preemptive attacks on Jackson Heights since early October . From mid October , the 44th Division increased the strength of its attacks in an effort to relieve pressure from Triangle Hill , and the battle of attrition that was witnessed over Triangle Hill had also developed at Jackson Heights . 
 At noon on October 30 , the 15th Corps bombarded the Koreans with 133 large @-@ caliber guns , 22 rocket launchers and 30 120 mm heavy mortars in the largest Chinese artillery operation of the Korean War . When the bombardment ended at midnight , 10 infantry companies from the 45th and the 29th Divisions swarmed over the ROK 31st Regiment 's positions and pushed the South Koreans off the summit . In the aftermath of the fighting , only 175 South Koreans survived the onslaught out of the three defending infantry companies . With the PVA 91st Regiment of the 31st Division , 12th Corps , arriving as reinforcement on November 1 , the Chinese forces chased the remaining South Korean defenders off Jane Russell Hill and beat off the subsequent counterattack . Responding to the losses , the US IX Corps ordered the ROK 30th Regiment of the ROK 9th Infantry Division to take back Triangle Hill on October 31 . The South Koreans launched continuous attacks for the next five days to no avail . Although the South Koreans failed to recapture the hill , the resulting heavy casualties forced the Chinese to call in the 93rd Regiment of the 31st Division as reinforcement on November 5 . On the same day , Lieutenant General Reuben E. Jenkins , commander of the US IX Corps , suspended further attacks on Triangle Hill to prevent more casualties and to protect Sniper Ridge . 
 As the IX Corps gave up on Triangle Hill , the PVA 31st Division of the 12th Corps was in position to take back Sniper Ridge . Under the cover of inclement weather , an assault was launched by the 92nd Regiment at 4 pm on November 11 . The Chinese soon drove off the defending 1st Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment , but Chung Il @-@ kwon immediately replied with a counterattack by the ROK 17th Regiment of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the dawn of November 12 . After two hours of fighting , the 1st Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment recaptured two @-@ thirds of Sniper Ridge and inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA 92nd Regiment . The 31st Division relieved the 92nd Regiment with its 93rd Regiment to launch another assault on November 14 , but the ROK 17th Regiment responded by committing all units to blunt the attack . By November 17 , with the help of the ROK 1st Field Artillery Group , the ROK 2nd Battalion returned to the 1st Battalion 's original position after a two @-@ hour battle . Undeterred by heavy casualties , the PVA 106th Regiment of the 34th Division , 12th Corps relieved the weakened 93rd Regiment during the night of November 18 . For the next six days , ' seesaw ' fighting continued on Sniper Ridge . By November 25 , the ROK 2nd Infantry Division was relieved by the ROK 9th Infantry Division on Sniper Ridge and the fighting finally died down . 
 = = = Conclusion = = = 
 Given the high numbers of UN casualties and under pressure from Clark , Van Fleet broke off Operation Showdown on November 28 , thus ending the Battle of Triangle Hill . A few days later , the PVA 34th Division and the ROK 9th Infantry Division were engaged in a seesaw battle on Sniper Ridge on December 2 and 3 but it failed to produce any territorial gains for either side . On December 15 , with the PVA 29th Division taking over the control of the battlefield from the 34th Division , the 12th Corps withdrew from the area and the 15th Corps settled back to the status quo prior to October 14 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Battle of Triangle Hill was the biggest and bloodiest contest of 1952 . After 42 days of heavy fighting , the Eighth Army had failed to gain the two hill masses that were its original goal . For the Chinese , on the other hand , not only did the 15th Corps stop the UN attacks at Triangle Hill , the assaults conducted by the 44th Division on the Pyonggang front also resulted in Jackson Heights ' capture on November 30 . Although the Chinese had suffered 11 @,@ 500 casualties with many units decimated during the battle , its ability to sustain such losses had slowly exhausted the US Eighth Army over two months of attrition . The PVA High Command viewed the victory as vindication that attrition was an effective strategy against the UN forces , while the Chinese became more aggressive in the armistice negotiations and on the battlefield . Meanwhile , the high UN casualties forced Clark to suspend any upcoming offensive operations involving more than one battalion , effectively preventing any major UN offensives for the rest of the war . Clark and US President Harry S. Truman later confided that the battle was a serious blow to the UN morale . As for the South Koreans , the modest UN gain on Sniper Ridge had convinced them that the South Korean armed forces were now capable of conducting independent offensive operations , even though the American advisers were less than impressed with their performance during the course of the battle . 
 Despite its impact and scale , the Battle of Triangle Hill is one of the least known episodes of the Korean War within the Western media . For the Chinese , this costly victory presented an opportunity to promote the value of endurance and sacrifice . The courage demonstrated by the Chinese soldiers at Triangle Hill was repeatedly glorified in various forms of media , including several major motion pictures . Qin Jiwei was also celebrated as the hero of <unk> and eventually rose to become the Minister of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the National People 's Congress . The 15th Corps became one of the most prestigious units within the PLA , and the PLAAF selected the 15th Corps to become China 's first airborne corps in 1961 . It remains the most elite corps @-@ size unit in China today . 
 = Wildrose Party = 
 The Wildrose Party ( legally Wildrose Political Association , formerly the Wildrose Alliance Political Association ) is a conservative provincial political party in Alberta , Canada . The party was formed by the merger in early 2008 of the Alberta Alliance Party and the unregistered Wildrose Party of Alberta . The wild rose is Alberta 's provincial flower . 
 It contested the 2008 provincial election under the Wildrose Alliance banner , and was able to capture seven percent of the popular vote but failed to hold its single seat in the Legislative Assembly . Support for the party rose sharply in 2009 as voters grew increasingly frustrated with the Progressive Conservative ( PC ) government , resulting in a surprise win by outgoing leader Paul Hinman in an October by @-@ election . In the fall of 2009 Danielle Smith was elected as leader and by December the Wildrose was leading provincial opinion polls ahead of both the governing PCs and the opposition Liberals . Wildrose 's caucus grew to four members in 2010 , after two former PC members of the Legislative Assembly defected in January and an independent MLA joined the party in June of that year . 
 In the 2012 election , while the party failed to have the breakthrough predicted by most media pundits ( many predicted it would become the government ) , it did increase its vote and seat totals and become the official opposition . 
 In December 2014 , nine Wildrose MLAs including leader Danielle Smith left the party to join the Progressive Conservative caucus under its recently elected leader Jim Prentice . All of the defectors to the PCs who sought re @-@ election in the 2015 general election lost their seats , through either losing the nomination process in their riding , or losing the general election to the Wildrose challenger . 
 Effective February 3 , 2015 the party 's registered name was changed from Wildrose Alliance Party to Wildrose Party . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding and 2008 general election = = = 
 The Alberta Alliance Party voted to change its registered name on January 19 , 2008 to the Wildrose Alliance after it merged with the unregistered Wildrose Party of Alberta . The name officially changed to Wildrose Alliance Party of Alberta after being approved by Elections Alberta on January 31 , 2008 . 
 The two parties had similar policies and the Wildrose had key personnel previously involved with the Alberta Alliance . They hoped that a union would allow the new party to present a stronger front for an anticipated election in the spring of 2008 . Paul Hinman , the party 's only sitting Member of the Legislative Assembly ( MLA ) remained leader after the merger . During the 27th Alberta general election , the Wildrose Alliance attempted to position itself as a conservative alternative to the governing PC party , and released a platform that promised fixed election dates , increasing personal tax exemptions , elimination of health care premiums , the creation of an Alberta Pension Plan , and a reworking of the controversial changes the PC government made to the oil and gas royalty regime . 
 An anticipated backlash against the governing PCs failed to materialize , as Premier Ed Stelmach extended his party 's seat total to 72 from 60 . While the Alliance finished second in eight ridings across the province , they failed to win any seats as Hinman lost his Cardston @-@ Taber @-@ Warner riding by just 39 votes . Running candidates in 61 of the province 's 83 ridings , the Alliance took 6 @.@ 78 % of the vote , fourth behind the PCs , Liberals and New Democrats . 
 = = = 2009 leadership election = = = 
 Hinman announced on April 20 , 2009 his intention to step down as leader . He remained the party 's leader in an interim capacity until the leadership convention . Former Canadian Federation of Independent Business provincial director Danielle Smith and Mark <unk> , a chiropractor in Calgary , announced their candidacy at the June convention . The party viewed the leadership campaign with optimism , announcing that its membership was growing rapidly as Albertans grew increasingly frustrated with the Stelmach government 's performance . 
 Growing opposition to the government 's oil and gas royalty program , a record $ 4 @.@ 7 billion deficit in 2009 , and the PC 's " liberal spending " facilitated the growth of the party . The party began to attract former Reform Party of Canada supporters along with high profile former members of the provincial Progressive Conservatives , including former premier Ralph Klein 's father . Using the slogan " Send Ed a message " as a rallying cry , Paul Hinman sought to take advantage of public discontent as he ran in a September by @-@ election in the Calgary @-@ Glenmore riding . He surprised political observers by capturing 37 percent of the vote , narrowly defeating Liberal opponent Avalon Roberts to win the election and gain the Wildrose Alliance its first seat in the legislature . The Tories , who had held the riding uninterrupted since 1969 , fell to third place . Political observers argued the result was more a protest against the Stelmach government than firm support for the Alliance , though it gave the party momentum as it prepared to vote for a leader . 
 Smith and <unk> both attempted to capitalize on the party 's election win , proclaiming that Albertans wanted change and that each of them would lead the Wildrose Alliance to a victory in the next general election . The party experienced a considerable growth heading into the leadership election , announcing it had 11 @,@ 670 members at the beginning of October , compared to 1 @,@ 800 in June . Smith was elected the new leader at the convention held in Edmonton on October 17 . 
 = = = Danielle Smith leadership = = = 
 Upon her election , Smith sought to continue the party 's growth , focusing her efforts on fundraising and a search for strong candidates . The Wildrose Alliance 's growth was evident in the polls . Shortly before Smith 's election , a Return on Insight poll found that the Alliance had the support of 22 percent of respondents . By early November , the party had improved to 28 percent according to an <unk> poll , firmly in second place and six points behind the Conservatives . By December , they topped the Tories , leading with 39 percent support according to an Angus Reid poll , while the Conservatives had fallen into a second place tie with the Liberals at 25 percent . The party revealed at the same time that it had grown to over 13 @,@ 000 members . 
 Amidst this wave of popularity , Smith announced on January 4 , 2010 that two former Conservative MLAs had crossed the floor . Rob Anderson and former cabinet minister Heather Forsyth announced that they had joined the Wildrose Alliance after growing frustrated with Ed Stelmach 's leadership , accusing the Conservative government of being undemocratic . The defections moved the Wildrose Party past the New Democrats to become the third largest party in the Legislature , Guy Boutilier joined the Wildrose Alliance on June 24 , 2010 . The fourth Wildrose MLA , Boutilier took the party over the threshold for recognition as an official party in the Assembly . He was unveiled at the party 's annual conference , which was attended by 700 people : up from 175 the previous year . 
 In late July 2010 , a controversy developed between Edmonton mayor Stephen Mandel and Smith over the future of the city @-@ centre airport . Smith argued that a vote on closure of the airport should be added to the October civic elections ballot . Alberta Liberal and NDP politicians also opposed the closure . 
 For much of the run @-@ up to the 2012 provincial election , it looked like the Wildrose would defeat the Tories in a landslide . Polling immediately before the election suggested that the gap had narrowed somewhat , but that the Wildrose was still poised to end the PCs ' 41 @-@ year tenure in government . In the general election , however , the Wildrose took 17 seats out of 87 , well behind the Tories . This was mainly because its support was confined to rural areas . The Wildrose only won two seats in Calgary ( while losing the two seats it held there at dissolution ) and were completely shut out of Edmonton . Nonetheless , it tallied 34 @.@ 3 percent of the popular vote , a healthy increase from 2008 . This was , however , enough to make the Wildrose the Official Opposition for the first time . 
 In 2014 , Allison Redford stepped down as PC leader following numerous scandals , and polls began to show a resurgence in Wildrose support . Jim Prentice then won the PC leadership and called four by @-@ elections to get his new cabinet , which included former Edmonton Mayor Stephen Mandel , seats in the Legislature . The Wildrose was expected to win two out of the four seats ; however the PCs retained all four . The by @-@ elections were seen as a test of both the PC Party under its new leader and Wildrose . As a result of the by @-@ election losses , Smith asked the party to conduct a leadership review . On November 2 , 2014 , after Rimbey @-@ Rocky Mountain House @-@ Sundre MLA Joe Anglin left the Wildrose caucus to sit as an independent due to the party 's " turmoil " and after making criticisms of Smith 's leadership team internally . , the remaining members of caucus unanimously pass a resolution asking Smith to withdraw her request for a leadership review ; Smith agreed . At the party 's Annual General Meeting on November 15 , 2014 , Smith pledged to resign as Wildrose leader if the party did not win government in the next provincial election . Also at the AGM , members voted 148 @-@ 109 against a resolution supporting equal rights for all minority groups , regardless of race , religious belief , sexual orientation or other differences . This vote reversed a party policy supported by Smith which had been adopted the previous year and signified a shift by the party towards social conservatism resulting in resignations by more moderate party members . 
 = = = = Defections = = = = 
 On November 3 , 2014 , Joe Anglin ( Rimbey @-@ Rocky Mountain House @-@ Sundre ) quit the caucus to sit as an Independent MLA stating that he had found out he was out to be expelled due to his public criticisms of Smith 's advisers . Anglin had previously lost his bid to be renominated in his riding as Wildrose 's candidate for the next provincial election . 
 On November 24 , 2014 Kerry Towle , ( Innisfail @-@ Sylvan Lake ) , and Ian Donovan , ( Little Bow ) crossed the floor to join the ruling PC Party 's caucus giving the turmoil within the Wildrose Party , uncertainty about Smith 's leadership and confidence in Prentice as reasons for their move . 
 On December 17 , 2014 , Smith confirmed she and eight other Wildrose members — Rob Anderson , Gary <unk> , Rod Fox , Jason Hale , Bruce McAllister , Blake Pedersen , Bruce Rowe and Jeff Wilson — would cross the floor to the Progressive Conservative caucus , with Smith saying " Under Premier Prentice ’ s strong leadership , I believe we can work together to lead Alberta with a renewed focus on the values and principles that we share . " The action followed several days of rumours and a PC caucus meeting in which that party agreed to accept the Wildrose members on terms which have not been officially disclosed . This leaves five MLAs still affiliated with the Wildrose Party . In a letter to the party executive , Smith asked that all party members vote on a " reunification resolution " to merge the Wildrose and PC parties ; a request which the party executive rejected . This development angered many party members and provoked widespread controversy . Wildrose has stated that " At no time has the Wildrose Party been approached by any representative of the <unk> regarding a merger , combination , partnership or alliance . Yesterday ’ s events are confined to nine former Wildrose MLAs who opted to cross the floor without consulting the Wildrose Party . " 
 The defections placed Wildrose in a tie with the Liberals for the second most seats but the Speaker ruled that Wildrose would continue as the Official Opposition based on prior precedent . Official Opposition status comes with additional funding and privileges .

 Brian Jean was elected Wildrose leader on March 28 , 2015 . Days later , Premier Jim Prentice called a provincial election for May 5 , 2015 which resulted in an upset victory by the Alberta New Democratic Party under Rachel <unk> , returning an NDP majority government . Despite its lack of preparedness , due to the caucus defections and having to organize an election campaign on the heels of a leadership election , Wildrose was able to rally and win 21 seats , 16 more than the five seats it had at the dissolution of the legislature , and four more than it had won in 2012 , allowing the party to remain the Official Opposition . Prentice 's Progressive Conservatives , however , collapsed and lost 60 of the 70 seats it had at dissolution , returning only 10 MLAs , finding itself out of power for the first time since 1971 and coming in third behind the NDP and Wildrose . Wildrose 's popular vote fell by one @-@ third , however , from 34 % of the vote in 2012 to 24 % in 2015 .

 Following the Wildrose Party 's jump to official opposition status in 2012 , undergraduate students Chris Bell , Braden <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Samantha Hossack , and Alex <unk> founded the first campus branch of the Party 's youth wing on November 12 , 2013 . Often abbreviated " <unk> " , the youth branch does not enjoy official status under the party constitution , although they have worked in an unofficial capacity passing party policy , hosting debates , and engaging campus communities . The only Alberta campus to currently have a branch of the campus club is the University of Calgary , the current president is Jenn <unk> . The branch is run by an elected board consisting of a President , Vice @-@ President Internal @-@ Affairs , Vice @-@ President External @-@ Affairs , Vice @-@ President Events , Vice @-@ President Membership , and Vice @-@ President Operations and Finance .

 Election reform is a focus of the Wildrose Alliance . The party proposes to set fixed election dates rather than the current format which allows the Premier to call an election at any time . It would allow more free votes in the legislature and would seek to elect the province 's Senators rather than have them appointed by the Prime Minister . The party also plans to introduce a bill giving voters the right to recall their MLA . The Wildrose Party proposes numerous changes to how the province delivers health care , which it claims will remain compliant with the Canada Health Act , as well as controls on government spending . Smith is also critical of international climate change treaties , believing climate change science remains inconclusive . 
 Smith stated that controversial social issues would not play a part in the party 's election platform . 
 Polling indicated that the party retained the support of a quarter of the electorate throughout 2010 as the party further attempted to define itself as not just a protest party but a party capable of forming government . By July 2011 , the Wildrose 's support had fallen to 16 percent , while PC support had risen to 51 percent . 
 However , by March 2012 , the Wildrose was polling the support of four @-@ in @-@ ten Albertans , showing significant improvement and a credible challenger to the PCs . 
 In the wake of the mass floor crossing , new leader Brian Jean stated that each candidate must sign a contract , under which they would need to pay a $ 100 @,@ 000 fine if they intend to cross the floor to another party .

 Girl Pat was a small fishing trawler , based at the Lincolnshire port of Grimsby , that in 1936 was the subject of a media sensation when its captain took it on an unauthorised transatlantic voyage . The escapade ended in Georgetown , British Guiana , with the arrest of the captain , George " Dod " Orsborne , and his brother . The pair were later imprisoned for the theft of the vessel . 
 Built in 1935 , Girl Pat was the property of the Marstrand Fishing Company of Grimsby . On 1 April 1936 , Orsborne , with a crew of four and his brother James as a supernumerary , took the vessel out on what the owners authorised as a routine North Sea fishing trip of two to three weeks ' duration . After leaving port , Orsborne informed the crew that they were going on an extended cruise in more southerly waters . Nothing more was heard of them until mid @-@ May , when the owners , who had by then assumed the vessel lost , received invoices relating to its repair and reprovisioning in the northern Spanish port of Corcubión . Subsequent sightings placed her in the Savage Islands , at Dakar in Senegal , and Îles du Salut off the coast of French Guiana in South America . The captain 's main means of navigation during a voyage of more than 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) was a sixpenny school atlas and a compass . At one point Girl Pat was reported wrecked in the Bahamas , with all hands lost . After the vessel 's capture and detention following a chase outside Georgetown on 19 June , Orsborne and his crew were hailed as heroes in the world 's press . 
 Charged with the theft of the vessel in October 1936 , Orsborne maintained in court that the owners had instructed him to get rid of the ship , as part of a scheme to obtain its insurance value . This claim was dismissed by the court . Years later , in his memoirs , Orsborne told a different , uncorroborated story : in absconding with Girl Pat he had been carrying out a mission on behalf of British Naval Intelligence , connected with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 . 
 After his release from prison , Orsborne took part in further maritime adventures and served in the navy in the Second World War . He died in 1957 . In Georgetown Girl Pat was acquired by new owners who returned her to Britain , where she was displayed as a tourist attraction in several resorts . In 1939 she was sold to the Port of London Authority for use as a wreck @-@ marking vessel and , after being requisitioned by the Royal Navy during the war , was returned to the authority in 1945 . There is no public record of her subsequent career . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Orsborne = = = 
 George Black Orsborne was born George Black on 4 July 1902 , in the small north Scottish coastal town of Buckie . He assumed the Orsborne name when his widowed mother remarried and moved the family to Aberdeen , where George , nicknamed " Dod " , spent his formative years . When he was 14 , Orsborne lied about his age and enlisted as a Boy Seaman in the Royal Navy ; in his memoirs he wrote : " I never did have an adolescence " . He served in the Dover Patrol , and was wounded during the 1918 Zeebrugge Raid . After leaving the Navy in December 1919 and working ashore for a brief period , he was persuaded by a former captain of the Cutty Sark , Captain Wilkins , to go back to sea . He joined the merchant navy , sailing mainly in small ships based in Liverpool . 
 At 21 he passed his master 's ticket examinations and took over his first command , a Grimsby trawler . During the following ten years , Orsborne said his career included " a bit of everything — rum @-@ running , whaling , deep @-@ sea trawling in the Arctic " . In November 1935 , back in Grimsby , he became skipper of the former seine fishing boat Gipsy Love , which its owners , the Marstrand Fishing Company , had converted into a trawler . 
 = = = Crew and vessel = = = 
 In March 1936 , for his second voyage in Gipsy Love , Orsborne attempted to engage the services of an experienced seaman , Alexander MacLean , to whom he confided that the trip might go further afield — perhaps to Bermuda or South America — but MacLean declined the opportunity . Orsborne offered the mate 's berth to Harry Stone , a local seaman who did not possess a mate 's ticket but was told by Orsborne that he could use MacLean 's number . The other crew members were a Yorkshireman , Hector Harris , and a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Scottish cook , Howard Stephens . The formal crew was joined by Orsborne 's younger brother James , a grocer , who had no formal status on board and was later classified as a stowaway . Gipsy Love left Grimsby late in March 1936 , supposedly to fish in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea , but within hours had returned to port with engine trouble . With the consent of the owners , Orsborne transferred stores and crew to another Marstrand vessel , the small trawler Girl Pat ; James Orsborne again joined them . 
 Built in 1935 in Oulton Broad , Suffolk , Girl Pat was a vessel of 55 gross registered tons ( GRT ) , 19 NRT . She was 66 feet ( 20 m ) long , with a beam of 18 @.@ 7 feet ( 5 @.@ 7 m ) , a hold depth of 8 @.@ 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) , and accommodation for six . Some sources refer to her as a " seine netter , " suggesting that like the Gipsy Love she had been converted to trawling . She was insured with underwriters for £ 3 @,@ 000 . Her regular engineer , George Jefferson , was added to Orsborne 's picked crew for the forthcoming voyage . 
 = = Voyage = = 
 = = = First phase : Grimsby to Corcubión = = = 
 Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936 . According to Stone 's later account , when they entered the open sea , Orsborne assembled the crew — except for Jefferson — in the wheelhouse and told them that this would not be a normal fishing trip . Instead , he proposed to take the boat south , first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson , who was not included in his further plans . At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer @-@ term intentions , but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls . 
 On 3 April the craft reached Dover , where Jefferson was taken ashore and given food and drink . When he returned to the harbour , Girl Pat had departed ; the engineer returned in some confusion to Grimsby . As Girl Pat sailed into the English Channel , Orsborne revealed to his crew that the vessel contained no charts , and that future navigation would be dependent on a cheap school atlas that he showed them . He changed details in the boat 's log book , entering himself as " G. Black , " Stone as " H. Clark , " and James Orsborne as " A. Black " . After anchoring off Jersey in the Channel Islands to await calmer weather , Girl Pat proceeded southwards through the Bay of Biscay . Orsborne ordered changes to the boat 's appearance : the bowsprit was altered , and the fishing registration number on the side of the hull was blacked out . According to Stone , Orsborne indicated an itinerary that included Madeira , the Canary Islands , the African coast and , eventually , Cape Town . They might then sell the boat and share the proceeds . Severe weather in the Bay of Biscay hampered progress and battered the small vessel , and on 12 April they took shelter in the small northern Spanish port of Corcubión , where they stayed for around 14 days . Necessary repairs were carried out , and the boat was reprovisioned . Orsborne instructed that the accounts for these services , totalling £ 235 , be sent to Marstrand 's in Grimsby , as their punishment , he later said , for letting the boat be taken out with inadequate stores and equipment . 
 Following Jefferson 's return to Grimsby , Marstrand 's were puzzled by Orsborne 's actions , but initially thought that he had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing , perhaps in new grounds . There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere . As weeks passed with no definite news , the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost , either through foundering or barratry , and claimed insurance . They had already received sums totalling £ 2 @,@ 400 from the underwriters , when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión , together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April , her destination unknown . 
 = = = Second phase : Corcubión to Dakar = = = 
 After Girl Pat left Corcubión , there was speculation in the port that Orsborne intended to fish in the waters around Gibraltar , but there was no sighting of the vessel in that vicinity . Stone later recalled that after sailing for some time , they arrived at some uninhabited islands — this is consistent with a probable sighting by the British liner SS <unk> , which on 17 May reported seeing a vessel closely matching the trawler 's description , anchored in the Savage Islands . This small uninhabited archipelago , roughly 170 nautical miles ( 310 km ) south of Madeira and roughly the same distance north of the Canary Islands , had long been associated with stories of pirates ' buried treasure , and news that Girl Pat had been seen there gave rise to press speculation that she was engaged on a hunt for treasure . Lloyd 's of London sent a representative to Las Palmas , to investigate the sighting ; meanwhile Girl Pat made an unobserved call at Tenerife in the Canary Islands , where she was repainted . 
 Leaving Tenerife , Girl Pat continued her journey southward , following the African coast . According to Stone 's account , the crew went ashore at Port Etienne in French West Africa ( now <unk> , in Mauritania ) , leaving the boat unguarded . While they were away , marauders stole gear and provisions , leaving the crew almost destitute : " All we had left to eat and drink were four bottles of water , a tin of corned beef , a bottle of lime juice and a tin of condensed milk " . Leaving Port Etienne , they ran aground on a sandbank and were stranded for three days . Eventually they managed to refloat the vessel , and on 23 May were picked up by a pilot boat which brought them into the harbour at Dakar , starving and exhausted . 
 Stone had fallen ill with appendicitis during the previous leg of the voyage ; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure . Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water , but Girl Pat 's arrival attracted the attention of the local Lloyd 's agent , who had been on the lookout for the vessel . On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book , where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies . Orsborne was asked to present the ship 's papers at the British consulate but , on the pretext that he needed to test the engines , he rapidly put to sea . The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar — the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat — was widely reported . Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead . 
 = = = Third phase : Dakar to Georgetown = = = 
 The level of public interest in the Girl Pat affair was enough for Gaumont British to consider making it the subject of a feature film . In the House of Commons on 29 May , the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade stated that no requests had been made for the detention of the vessel in foreign ports ; two weeks later , Walter Runciman , the President of the Board of Trade , confirmed that , on behalf of the underwriters , the Foreign Office had asked that Girl Pat be refused credit and detained on entering any port . 
 On 2 June the French liner <unk> reported a small boat , flying the British flag and steaming southwards , near the <unk> Islands 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ) south of Dakar . Although this was at first assumed to be Girl Pat , the next reported sighting , on 9 June , was more than 2 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 700 km ) to the west , on the other side of the Atlantic . Captain Jones of the Lorraine Cross , an American ship , cabled Lloyds ' agents in Georgetown , British Guiana ( now Guyana ) with an account of a small ship flying a distress signal off the South American coast , 47 nautical miles ( 87 km ) north @-@ east of Cayenne . There were apparently four men on board . The boat 's name and markings had been painted out , but she claimed to be the " Margaret Harold " bound for Trinidad from London . Jones thought the crew 's behaviour suspicious , and when he asked to see the ship 's papers , the ship lowered the distress signal and sped away . Jones said the vessel was " undoubtedly a British fisherman " , and thought it was Girl Pat . In Grimsby , a Marstrand spokesman expressed little surprise at this new location , and confirmed that the ship had sufficient speed to have crossed the ocean in the time since her last confirmed sighting . A check with Lloyd 's indicated that there was no registered ship named Margaret Harold . 
 A report from the Îles du Salut , a few miles off the coast of French Guiana , indicated that a vessel similar in appearance to Girl Pat had watered there on 10 June . An air search , by a Pan @-@ American aircraft , covered over 1 @,@ 000 miles ( 1 @,@ 600 km ) of coastline around Georgetown , without sighting the craft . On 17 June several newspapers carried reports of the discovery of the wreck of a small boat , and three bodies , at Atwood Cay , a small island in the Bahamas . Much of the press assumed this to be Girl Pat ; one headline read " Did School Atlas Course Lead Crew to Death ? " . The reports proved false when , early in the morning of 19 June , a police launch towed Girl Pat into Georgetown harbour .

 On the evening of 18 June the British steamer <unk> had spotted a small ship a few miles outside Georgetown , and radioed this information to the shore . An unarmed police launch left Georgetown to investigate ; as they approached , the crew of the as yet unidentified vessel became hostile . They denied that she was Girl Pat and threatened violence should officers attempt to board her . The launch retreated to Georgetown , where the police armed themselves and obtained authority to seize the suspect vessel . They returned early the following morning to find that their quarry was departing . A two @-@ hour chase ensued , which The Hull Daily Mail glamorised as a sporting contest : " Like some coursing greyhound the faster Government ship stuck to the tail of the fleeing suspect which , <unk> , doubled back on her course to dodge her pursuer " . According to the British Daily Worker , the chase " [ outdid ] the most spectacular efforts of film directors " . Finally , while manoeuvring at close quarters , the vessels collided . The stern of the suspect boat was severely damaged , whereupon she surrendered and was taken in tow . The name displayed on the vessel 's hull was " Kia @-@ ora " , but Stephens quickly admitted to their captors that the ship was Girl Pat . 
 With Girl Pat secured and under guard in Georgetown harbour , the Orsborne brothers , Harris , and Stephens were taken to police headquarters in the City Hall . The police issued a statement that the four were there " at their own request . They are under no form of detention " . In London , officials struggled to establish the exact legal position , and issued confusing statements . Meanwhile , Orsborne and his companions were widely hailed as heroes . The German newspaper Hamburger <unk> asked : " Is this not a bit of British tradition , to do the unconventional out of love for adventure , if great personal risks , audacity and romance are connected therewith ? " . A man from the town of Hull thought the adventure demonstrated " the spirit of Drake " , and called for a public subscription to meet the crew 's debts and expenses . An alternative view , expressed in the Hull Daily Mail , was to question whether the men should be regarded so favourably , or merely as " men who have run away with someone else 's property " . 
 Once released by the police , Harris and Stephens returned immediately to England , where they arrived on 13 July . The Orsborne brothers waited in Georgetown for their position to be clarified ; George Orsborne told the press he was anxious to return home where , he insisted , many job offers were open to him . On 27 June , following further discussions in London , the brothers were arrested on a warrant issued under the Fugitive Offenders Act , and brought before the Georgetown magistrates , where they were charged with the theft of Girl Pat .

 = = = In Georgetown = = = 
 The brothers were held in custody , awaiting a deportation hearing . On 4 July they were remanded for a further week , and bail was again refused . Although the brothers declared their willingness to waive the deportation process and accept immediate transfer to England , they continued to be detained . On 22 July the hearings in the Georgetown magistrates ' court finally began , with the formal identification of Girl Pat . On 24 July the magistrates ordered that the brothers be sent to England to face trial , once the formal approval of the colonial governor , Sir <unk> Northcote , had been given . The governor was in no hurry to act ; the Orsbornes finally left Georgetown on 13 August , when they boarded the cargo liner Inanda . 
 While the Orsbornes were in Georgetown , Harold Stone , Girl Pat 's erstwhile mate , made his way home from Dakar and arrived in Liverpool on 20 July . After interviews with the police , Stone spoke to the press of the hardships suffered during the Girl Pat voyage , especially the shortages of food and water : " I would not want to go through the experience again " . He confirmed that they had navigated using a school atlas , but added that they had possessed a compass . 
 = = = Bow Street , London = = = 
 Early on 2 September Inanda docked at Gravesend , Kent . The brothers were immediately driven to London for a formal appearance at Bow Street Magistrates ' Court , where they were charged with theft and conspiracy . Against police opposition — because , they said , " certain developments " might arise — the magistrate bailed each defendant in the sum of £ 500 , and required them to surrender their passports . 
 When the hearing resumed on 10 September , the court heard from <unk> ' managing director that George Orsborne had not been given authority to operate Girl Pat outside the North Sea . Stone testified that Orsborne had made plain his intentions to take the boat south from the outset , and also gave evidence concerning the changes to the ship 's log . The court heard from Jefferson and other Dover witnesses , from Alexander MacLean , and from the Lloyd 's agent in Dakar . The defence counsel did not answer the detailed aspects of the prosecution 's case , but stated that at the forthcoming trial , " very serious allegations " would be made against certain of the prosecution witnesses . The brothers pleaded not guilty , and were remanded on continuing bail for trial at the Old Bailey . In the interval between the Bow Street hearings and the trial , which was set to begin in October , Girl Pat was sold . 
 = = = Old Bailey = = = 
 The Old Bailey trial began on 19 October 1936 . The prosecution opened by stating that this should not be considered as " a cheerful buccaneering adventure , " but as a breach of trust on the part of George Orsborne , to whom the owners had entrusted their ship . The objective of the voyage had not been to benefit the owners , but to make money for the defendants . 
 MacLean testified that in his discussions with George Orsborne , he had formed the impression that the captain was part @-@ owner of the vessel . Orsborne had mentioned to him the possibility of engaging in profitable activities such as gun @-@ running and smuggling . John Moore , the managing director of Marstrand 's , stated that he had expected Orsborne to take Girl Pat fishing in an area of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was fishing successfully . When Moore was cross @-@ examined , the defence 's " serious allegations " were revealed . It was put to Moore that he had instructed George Orsborne not to go fishing , but to get rid of the vessel so that the company could claim its insurance value , of which Orsborne would be rewarded with a share . The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape , and that its ships were heavily mortgaged . Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne . The company , he insisted , was financially sound , the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low , and he had never discussed insured values with Orsborne . The defence further alleged that when taken out Girl Pat had been in an unseaworthy condition , inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage . This suggestion was also denied by Moore . 
 After Stone and Jefferson reprised the evidence they had given in Bow Street , George Orsborne took the stand . He said he had not agreed to Moore 's proposal to " lose " the vessel , and after departing with Girl Pat had still been undecided about what he would do . He had left Jefferson in Dover because he was a poor mechanic and a drunk . Moore , he asserted , was mistaken in claiming that the boat 's provisions and equipment were adequate . Orsborne said that while the boat was sheltering in Jersey , he had suggested to the crew that they " may as well make a holiday of it " , and then proposed that they make a circle of the Atlantic Ocean before returning to Grimsby . There was no intention to fall in with Moore 's scheme or to steal the vessel ; they would " thank the owners for the loan of the ship " and return it . Orsborne added that while they were in port at Corcubión , he was offered money for Girl Pat , but turned it down . Orsborne denied that he had tried to conceal his or the boat 's true identity in Dakar , or had left the port to avoid enquiries — the sudden departure was due , he said , to troubles with the natives . Nor had he attempted to evade the authorities in Georgetown ; his movements there had arisen from concern for the safety of his vessel , which was being jeopardised by the manoeuvres of the police launch . 
 James Orsborne , giving evidence , said that he had learned from his brother about Moore 's proposal to get rid of the boat , and had told George that he would be " a darned fool " even to consider the suggestion . He had stayed with his brother because " I thought that if he was going to do anything crazy I might manage to prevent him " . Recalled to the witness box , Moore said that he had refused to employ James Orsborne because he considered him dishonest . 
 In his closing speech , defence counsel said that the key to the case was whether the Orsborne brothers intended to deprive the owners permanently of their vessel . The evidence , he said , was more suggestive of a " joy @-@ ride half @-@ way round the world " , than of theft or anything more sinister . Prosecuting counsel argued that if the month 's joy @-@ ride was the innocent explanation , why had it been necessary to introduce into the case the unfounded allegations of proposed insurance fraud " against men whose reputations were above suspicion ? " . In his summing up , the judge condemned the arrangements whereby the Orsbornes were receiving money from the press for the rights to their story . This was unwarranted and undesirable : " Whether the two prisoners be guilty or innocent [ of theft ] , the property of someone else was being used by them without permission ... George Orsborne clearly knew that he was acting directly against his employer 's interests " . The jury was out for only 35 minutes before returning guilty verdicts against both defendants . On 22 October George Orsborne was sentenced to 18 months ' imprisonment , and James to 12 months . 
 = = = Orsborne 's alternative account = = = 
 Thirteen years after the trial , in a memoir entitled Master of the Girl Pat published by Doubleday , George Orsborne provided a new context for the Girl Pat voyage . According to this narrative , he had been recruited in 1935 to work for British Naval Intelligence . The Girl Pat venture was a secret assignment , connected with the imminent Spanish Civil War . Between the stops at Corcubión and Dakar , Orsborne claims , he carried out a mission to blow up a railway bridge in Spanish Morocco . The stops at Port Etienne , Dakar and elsewhere had been to receive further instructions from Naval Intelligence . In this later account Orsborne changes crew names and other details : Stone becomes " Fletcher " , and his leaving the voyage in Dakar is recorded by Orsborne as a " desertion " . Some of Orsborne 's dates are inconsistent with the boat 's known movements — he gives 26 June as the date of arrival in Dakar , and the account he gives of his Old Bailey trial bears no relation to the published record . Orsborne describes his stay in Wormwood Scrubs prison as " a wonderful experience . I wouldn 't have missed it for anything " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the trial , the press and public remained broadly sympathetic to the Orsborne brothers . During the committal stages The Spectator had commented that the adventure " had given romantic satisfaction to the whole world " and that her captain had become a national hero . On the day after the sentencing , The Times leading article noted the public 's sustained pleasure in the escapade . Nearly 30 years later , in his social history of the between @-@ the @-@ wars years , Ronald Blythe portrayed the affair as an anti @-@ establishment gesture , " a colourful snook cocked in the face of some of the most soul @-@ crippling officialdom ever experienced by ordinary men and women " . 
 While in prison , George Orsborne lent his name to a ghost @-@ written account of the Girl Pat adventure , which repeated the claim that the vessel had been sent out inadequately equipped and provisioned . Marstrand 's successfully sued the publishers , Hutchinsons , and two newspapers which had repeated the details . On his release , Orsborne planned to make a single @-@ handed transatlantic crossing in an open boat , but the trip was delayed , and finally cancelled when war began in September 1939 . Likewise , nothing came of an announcement in 1938 that Orsborne would lead an expedition to the Caribbean and up the Amazon . 
 During the war , Orsborne worked as mate on a trawler which formed part of Britain 's anti @-@ invasion force , before rejoining the Royal Navy . His wartime exploits included service as a beachmaster during the Normandy landings of June 1944 , a spell as a commando in Combined Operations , and service in the Far East , where he records being captured and imprisoned by the Japanese . In September 1947 Orsborne was one of two men rescued in mid @-@ Atlantic from the abandoned ketch Lovely Lady ; the other was a stowaway , a Spanish greengrocer . 
 In his 1949 memoir Master of the Girl Pat , George Orsborne records briefly that Stephens went straight back to sea after the adventure , that Harris drank up his share of the crew 's newspaper money , and that " Fletcher " ( Stone ) emigrated to Australia . James Orsborne worked for a while in the Mediterranean , assisting refugees from the Spanish Civil War . Later he went to Canada . He was in Singapore when it fell to the Japanese in February 1942 , and was not heard from again . George Orsborne died on 23 December 1957 , at Belle Île off the Brittany coast , while delivering a motor @-@ cruiser from Nice to England . 
 = = = Later years of ship = = = 
 Girl Pat was repaired and refitted in Georgetown by her new owners , the Grimsby @-@ based firm Girl Pat Ltd , and was brought back to England , arriving at Portsmouth on 9 May 1937 She remained there for two weeks as a tourist attraction , before moving to London on 28 May . Her new owners declared that they were still undecided as to the ship 's longer @-@ term future , but for the time being she would be displayed at Blackpool and other holiday resorts . On 17 February 1939 The Times reported that Girl Pat had been sold to the Port of London Authority ( PLA ) , to be used as a wreck @-@ marking vessel . After the outbreak of war in September 1939 , she was requisitioned by the Admiralty for naval use , and is listed as one of the " minor war vessels " in service in July 1940 . By 1945 she had been returned to the PLA ; there is no public record of her subsequent history . The name Girl Pat was adopted by at least one later registered vessel ; in August 1966 a 60 @-@ ton yacht of that name was arrested by Greek <unk> in the Gulf of Corinth and its occupants charged with the theft of antiquities .

 = United States v. Jones ( 2012 ) = 
 United States v. Jones , 132 S. Ct . 945 , 565 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2012 ) , was a United States Supreme Court case which held that installing a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) tracking device on a vehicle and using the device to monitor the vehicle 's movements constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment . 
 In 2004 defendant Jones was suspected of drug trafficking . Police investigators asked for and received a warrant to attach a GPS tracking device to the underside of the defendant 's car but then exceeded the warrant 's scope in both geography and length of time . The Supreme Court justices voted unanimously that this was a " search " under the Fourth Amendment , although they were split 5 @-@ 4 as to the fundamental reasons behind that conclusion . The majority held that by physically installing the GPS device on the defendants car , the police had committed a trespass against Jones ' " personal effects " – this trespass , in an attempt to obtain information , constituted a search per se . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Police investigation and criminal trial = = = 
 Antoine Jones owned a nightclub in the District of Columbia ; Lawrence Maynard managed the club . In 2004 , a joint Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and Metropolitan Police Department task force began investigating Jones and Maynard for narcotics violations . During the course of the investigation , a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) device was installed on Jones 's Jeep Grand Cherokee without a valid warrant . This device tracked the vehicle 's movements 24 hours a day for four weeks . The FBI arrested Jones in late 2005 , at which time Jones was represented by criminal defense attorney A. Eduardo <unk> of Washington , D.C. <unk> filed multiple motions on Jones ' behalf , including the motion to suppress the GPS data . This motion formed the basis for Jones ' appeals . The government tried Jones for the first time in late 2006 , and after a trial lasting over a month , a federal jury deadlocked on the conspiracy charge and acquitted him of multiple other counts . The government retried Jones in late 2007 , and in January 2008 the jury returned a guilty verdict on one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine and 50 or more grams of cocaine base . He was sentenced to life in prison . 
 = = = Appeal = = = 
 Jones argued that his conviction should be overturned because the use of the GPS tracker violated the Fourth Amendment 's protection against unreasonable search and seizure . In August 2010 , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned Jones 's conviction , holding that the police action was a search because it violated Jones 's " reasonable expectation of privacy " . The court 's decision was the subject of significant legal debate . In June 2011 , the Supreme Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve two questions . The first question , briefed by the parties in their initial petition for certiorari was " Whether the warrantless use of a tracking device on respondent 's vehicle to monitor its movements on public streets violated the Fourth Amendment . " The second question , which the Court directed the parties to brief in addition to the initial question , was " Whether the government violated respondent 's Fourth Amendment rights by installing the GPS tracking device on his vehicle without a valid warrant and without his consent " 
 = = Oral argument = = 
 Deputy Solicitor General Michael R. Dreeben began his argument for the United States by noting that information revealed to the world ( i.e. movement on a public road ) is not protected by the Fourth Amendment . Dreeben cited United States v. Knotts as an example where police were allowed to use a device known as a " beeper " that allows the tracking of a car from a short distance away . Chief Justice Roberts distinguished the current case from Knotts , saying that using a beeper still took " a lot of work " whereas a GPS device allows the police to " sit back in the station ... and push a button whenever they want to find out where the car is . " 
 Justice Scalia then directed the discussion to whether installing the device was an unreasonable search . Scalia argued that " when that device is installed against the will of the owner of the car on the car , that is unquestionably a trespass and thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his effects ... against an unreasonable search and seizure . " Dreeben argued that it was a trespass , but in United States v. Karo there was also a trespass and , according to Dreeben , Karo held that it " made no difference because the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful interference [ with possessions ] , not to cover all technical trespasses . " 
 During oral argument , Justice Alito stated that people 's use of technology is changing what the expectation of privacy is for the courts . " You know , I don 't know what society expects and I think it 's changing . Technology is changing people 's expectations of privacy . Suppose we look forward 10 years , and maybe 10 years from now 90 percent of the population will be using social networking sites and they will have on average 500 friends and they will have allowed their friends to monitor their location 24 hours a day , 365 days a year , through the use of their cell phones . Then — what would the expectation of privacy be then ? " 
 Justice Sonia Sotomayor reminded the government , " What motivated the Fourth Amendment historically was the disapproval , the outrage , that our Founding Fathers experienced with general warrants that permitted police indiscriminately to investigate just on the basis of suspicion , not probable cause , and to invade every possession that the individual had in search of a crime . " She then asked , " How is this different ? " 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 On January 23 , 2012 , the Supreme Court held that " the Government 's installation of a GPS device on a target 's vehicle , and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle 's movements , constitutes a ' search ' " under the Fourth Amendment . Some news sources have misinterpreted the Court as holding that all GPS data surveillance requires a search warrant , but this ruling was much narrower than that 
 On the one hand , it can be said that all nine justices unanimously considered the police 's actions in Jones to be unconstitutional . Importantly , however , although they reached the same result in the end , they were split 5 @-@ 4 , with the two groups in disagreement as to the fundamental reasons for their conclusion . Further , the justices were of three different opinions with respect to the breadth of the judgment . 
 = = = Majority opinion = = = 
 Justice Antonin Scalia authored the majority opinion . He cited a line of cases dating back as far as 1886 to argue that a physical intrusion , or trespass , into a constitutionally @-@ protected area – in an attempt to find something or to obtain information – was the basis , historically , for determining whether a " search " had occurred under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment . Scalia conceded that in the years following Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) – in which electronic eavesdropping on a public telephone booth was held to be a search – the vast majority of search and seizure case law has shifted away from that approach founded on property rights , and towards an approach based on a person 's " expectation of privacy " . However , he cited a number of post @-@ Katz cases including Alderman v. United States and <unk> v. Cook County to argue that the trespassory approach had not been abandoned by the Court . In response to criticisms within Alito 's concurrence , Scalia emphasized that the Fourth Amendment must provide , at a minimum , the level of protection as it did when it was adopted . Furthermore , a trespassory test need not exclude a test of the expectation of privacy , which may be appropriate to consider in situations where there was no governmental trespass . 
 In the instant case , the Court concluded , since the Government 's installation of a GPS device onto the defendant 's car ( his " personal effects " ) was a trespass that was purposed to obtain information , then it was a search under the Fourth Amendment . 
 Having reached the conclusion that this was a search under the Fourth Amendment , the Court declined to examine whether any exception exists that would render the search " reasonable " , because the Government had failed to advance that alternate theory in the lower courts . Also left unanswered was the broader question surrounding the privacy implications of a warrantless use of GPS data absent a physical intrusion – as might occur , for example , with the electronic collection of GPS data from wireless service providers or factory @-@ installed vehicle tracking and navigation services . The Court left this to be decided in some future case , saying , " It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means , without an accompanying trespass , is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy , but the present case does not require us to answer that question . " 
 = = = Concurring opinions = = = 
 = = = = Justice Sotomayor = = = = 
 Justice Sonia Sotomayor was alone in her concurring opinion . She was the fifth justice to concur with Scalia 's opinion , making hers the decisive vote . " As the majority 's opinion makes clear " , she noted , " Katz 's reasonable @-@ expectation @-@ of @-@ privacy test augmented , but did not displace or diminish , the common @-@ law trespassory test that preceded it " . She agreed with Alito 's expectation of privacy reasoning with respect to long @-@ term surveillance , but she went a step further , by also disputing the constitutionality of warrantless short @-@ term GPS surveillance as well . Even during short @-@ term monitoring , she reasoned , GPS surveillance can precisely record an individual 's every movement , and hence can reveal completely private destinations , like " trips to the psychiatrist , the plastic surgeon , the abortion clinic , the AIDS treatment center , the strip club , the criminal defense attorney , the by @-@ the @-@ hour motel , the union meeting , the mosque , synagogue or church , the gay bar and on and on . " Sotomayor added : 
 " People disclose the phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellular providers , the <unk> that they visit and the e @-@ mail addresses with which they correspond to their Internet service providers , and the books , groceries and medications they purchase to online retailers . . . I would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a limited purpose is , for that reason alone , <unk> to Fourth Amendment protection . " 
 She distinguished Knotts , reminding that Knotts suggested that a different principle might apply to situations in which every movement was completely monitored for 24 hours . 
 = = = = Justice Alito = = = = 
 In his concurring opinion , Justice Alito wrote with respect to privacy : " Short @-@ term monitoring of a person ’ s movements on public streets accords with expectations of privacy " but " the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy . " Alito argued against the majority 's reliance on trespass under modern circumstances . Specifically , he argued that the common @-@ law property @-@ based analysis of a " search " under the Fourth Amendment did not apply to such electronic situations as the one that occurred in this case . He further argued that following the doctrinal changes in Katz , a technical trespass leading to the gathering of evidence was " neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation " . In his concurring opinion Alito outlined that long @-@ term surveillance can reveal everything about a person : 
 " Prolonged surveillance reveals types of information not revealed by short @-@ term surveillance , such as what a person does repeatedly , what he does not do , and what he does ensemble . These types of information can each reveal more about a person than does any individual trip viewed in isolation . Repeated visits to a church , a gym , a bar , or a bookie tell a story not told by any single visit , as does one 's not visiting any of these places over the course of a month . The sequence of a person 's movements can reveal still more ; a single trip to a gynecologist 's office tells little about a woman , but that trip followed a few weeks later by a visit to a baby supply store tells a different story . * A person who knows all of another 's travels can deduce whether he is a weekly church goer , a heavy drinker , a regular at the gym , an unfaithful husband , an outpatient receiving medical treatment , an associate of particular individuals or political groups – and not just one such fact about a person , but all such facts . " 
 Following the privacy @-@ based approach most commonly used post @-@ Katz , the four @-@ justice minority are instead of the opinion that the continuous monitoring of every single movement of an individual 's car for 28 days violated a " reasonable expectation of privacy " , and thus constituted a search . Alito explained that before GPS and similar electronic technology , month @-@ long surveillance of an individual 's every move would have been exceptionally demanding and costly , requiring a tremendous amount of resources and people . As a result , society 's expectations were , and still are , that such complete and long @-@ term surveillance would not be undertaken , and that an individual would not think it could occur to him or her . 
 With regard to continuous monitoring for a short period , the minority would rely on United States v. Knotts ( 1983 ) and decline to find a violation of the expectation of privacy . In Knotts , a short @-@ distance signal beeper in the defendant 's car was tracked during a single trip for less than a day . The Knotts Court held that a person traveling on public roads has no expectation of privacy in his movements , because the vehicle 's starting point , direction , stops , or final destination could be seen by anyone else on the road . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Walter E. Dellinger III , the former U.S. Solicitor General and the attorney who represented the defendant , said the decision was " a signal event in Fourth Amendment history . " He also said the decision made it more risky for law enforcement to use a GPS tracking device without a warrant . FBI director Robert Mueller testified in March 2013 that the Jones decision had limited the Bureau 's surveillance capabilities . 
 Criminal defense attorneys and civil libertarians such as Virginia Sloan of the Constitution Project praised the ruling for protecting Fourth Amendment rights against government intrusion through modern technology . The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which filed an amicus brief arguing that warrantless GPS tracking violates reasonable expectations of privacy , praised Sotomayor 's concurrence for raising concerns that Fourth Amendment caselaw does not reflect the realities of modern technology . 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court . During the investigation , the government obtained cell site location data with a <unk> ( d ) order under the Stored Communications Act . In light of the Supreme Court 's decision , the government sought to use this data instead of the GPS data it had collected . Judge Ellen Segal <unk> ruled in December 2012 that the government could use the cell site data against Jones . A new trial began in January 2013 after Mr Jones rejected 2 plea offers of 15 to 22 years with credit for time served . In March 2013 , a mistrial was declared with the jury evenly split . Mr. Jones had represented himself at trial . The Government planned for a fourth trial but in May 2013 Jones accepted a plea bargain of 15 years with credit for time served . 
 In October 2013 , the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit addressed the unanswered question of " whether warrantless use of GPS devices would be ' reasonable — and thus lawful — under the Fourth Amendment [ where ] officers ha [ ve ] reasonable suspicion , and indeed probable cause ' to execute such searches . " United States v. <unk> was the first relevant appeals court ruling in the wake of Jones to address this topic . The appeals court in <unk> held that a warrant was indeed required to deploy GPS tracking devices , and further , that none of the narrow exceptions to the Fourth Amendment 's warrant requirement ( e.g. exigent circumstances , the " automobile exception " , etc . ) were applicable . 
 = Ferugliotheriidae = 
 Ferugliotheriidae is one of three known families in the order Gondwanatheria , an enigmatic group of extinct mammals . Gondwanatheres have been classified as a group of uncertain affinities or as members of Multituberculata , a major extinct mammalian order . The best @-@ known representative of Ferugliotheriidae is the genus Ferugliotherium from the Late Cretaceous epoch in Argentina . A second genus , Trapalcotherium , is known from a single tooth , a first lower molariform ( molar @-@ like tooth ) , from a different Late Cretaceous Argentinean locality . Another genus known from a single tooth ( in this case , a fourth lower premolar ) , Argentodites , was first described as an unrelated multituberculate , but later identified as possibly related to Ferugliotherium . Finally , a single tooth from the Paleogene of Peru , LACM 149371 , perhaps a last upper molariform , and a recent specimen from Mexico , may represent related animals . 
 Ferugliotheriids are known from isolated , low @-@ crowned ( brachydont ) teeth and possibly a fragment of a lower jaw . Ferugliotherium is estimated to have weighed 70 g ( 2 @.@ 5 oz ) . The incisors are long and procumbent and contain a band of enamel on only part of the tooth . The jaw fragment contains a long tooth socket for the incisor and bears a bladelike fourth lower premolar , resembling those of multituberculates . The premolar of Argentodites is similar . Two upper premolars also resemble multituberculate teeth , but whether these premolars are referable to Ferugliotheriidae is controversial . <unk> are rectangular and brachydont and consist of longitudinal rows of cusps , connected by transverse crests and separated by transverse furrows . Lower molariforms have two cusp rows , and the single known putative upper molariform has three . Low @-@ crowned and bladelike teeth as seen in ferugliotheriids may have been evolutionary precursors of the high @-@ crowned ( hypsodont ) teeth of the other gondwanathere family , Sudamericidae . 
 Most ferugliotheriids come from the Late Cretaceous epoch ( Campanian – Maastrichtian ages , 84 – 66 million years ago , or mya ) of Argentina , where they may have lived in a marshy or seashore environment . They coexisted with mammals such as dryolestoids and a variety of other animals , including dinosaurs . Ferugliotheriids may have been herbivores or omnivores . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first member of the family Ferugliotheriidae to be discovered , Ferugliotherium windhauseni , was named in 1986 by Argentinean paleontologist José F. Bonaparte on the basis of a tooth from the Late Cretaceous Los Alamitos Formation of Argentina . Bonaparte placed Ferugliotherium as the only member of the new family Ferugliotheriidae , which he tentatively assigned to the order Multituberculata , a large group of extinct mammals ( distinct from both monotremes and <unk> , the two major groups of living mammals ) that was particularly widespread in the northern continents ( Laurasia ) , but had never previously been found in the south ( Gondwana ) . In 1990 , Bonaparte named another species , Vucetichia gracilis , from Los Alamitos . He placed it in the family <unk> , together with Gondwanatherium , another Los Alamitos mammal , within the order Gondwanatheria , which also contained the family Sudamericidae , then with the single genus Sudamerica . Bonaparte considered the gondwanatheres to be probably most closely related to the xenarthrans ( sloths , armadillos , and anteaters ) within a group called Paratheria . 
 Also in 1990 , Bonaparte merged the family <unk> into Sudamericidae and , together with David Krause , redefined Gondwanatheria as a multituberculate suborder that included both Ferugliotheriidae and Sudamericidae , thus rejecting a relationship between gondwanatheres and xenarthrans . Krause , Bonaparte , and Zofia Kielan @-@ Jaworowska redescribed Ferugliotherium in 1992 and suggested that the teeth that Vucetichia was based on may have been worn specimens of Ferugliotherium . They placed Ferugliotherium among multituberculates and suggested that it may be part of the suborder Plagiaulacoidea . The following year , Krause confirmed that Vucetichia gracilis is a synonym of Ferugliotherium windhauseni . Together with Bonaparte , he also proposed to classify gondwanatheres as a superfamily ( <unk> ) within Plagiaulacoidea , including the families Ferugliotheriidae and Sudamericidae . In 1996 , Kielan @-@ Jaworowska and Bonaparte tentatively identified a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate @-@ like fourth lower premolar ( p4 ) from Los Alamitos as Ferugliotherium . On the basis of the morphological features of the jaw fragment , they argued that gondwanatheres are not closely related to any other multituberculate group , and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own , Gondwanatheria . 
 In 1999 , Rosendo Pascual and colleagues described a lower jaw of Sudamerica , which had previously only been known from isolated teeth . This jaw fragment showed that Sudamerica had four molariform ( molar @-@ like teeth ) on each side of the lower jaws , more than any multituberculate , and consequently they removed gondwanatheres from Multituberculata and regarded their affinities as uncertain . As a consequence , Kielan @-@ Jaworowska and colleagues excluded Gondwanatheria from multituberculates , but identified the jaw fragment and a few upper premolars of Ferugliotherium as indeterminate multituberculates in a 2001 paper and a 2004 book . However , in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck identified these fossils as Ferugliotherium and argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres ( including Ferugliotheriidae ) and multituberculates . 
 In the 2000s , additional members of Ferugliotheriidae were described . In 2004 , Francisco Goin and colleagues described a single enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Peru , LACM 149371 ; their best estimate was that it represented a member of Ferugliotheriidae . On the basis of a single p4 , Kielan @-@ Jaworowska and colleagues named Argentodites coloniensis , from the Late Cretaceous La Colonia Formation of Argentina , in 2007 as a multituberculate , possibly referable to the suborder Cimolodonta . However , Gurovich and Beck argued that the p4 of Argentodites did not differ materially from that in the jaw they allocated to Ferugliotherium , and that Argentodites was based on a specimen of either Ferugliotherium or a closely related animal . Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described mammals from the Allen Formation , a third Argentinean formation of similar age , in 2009 , including a new ferugliotheriid , Trapalcotherium matuastensis . They also regarded Argentodites as a likely relative of Ferugliotherium and suggested that Ferugliotheriidae are either multituberculates or closely related to them . 
 = = Description = = 
 Ferugliotheriids are known from a few dozen isolated teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment . Most fossils are referred to Ferugliotherium ; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each described on the basis of a single tooth . Their precise dental formula is unknown , but incisors , premolars , and molariform teeth have been identified . Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor ( possibly two in the upper jaw ) , no canines , one or two premolars , and two molars on each side of the lower and upper jaws . 
 Unlike the very high @-@ crowned ( hypsodont ) sudamericids , ferugliotheriid teeth were low @-@ crowned ( brachydont ) . Furthermore , sudamericid molariforms tend to be larger and are supported by one large root , but the smaller ferugliotheriids have at least two roots under their molariforms . Ferugliotherium is estimated to have weighed 70 g ( 2 @.@ 5 oz ) . 
 The incisors , known only from Ferugliotherium , are procumbent and long . Three lower and four upper incisors are known . As is usual in mammals with similarly shaped ( <unk> ) incisors , the lower incisors are more laterally compressed , are less curved , form a greater angle between the front side and the wear facet at the tip , and are less elliptical in shape than the uppers . The enamel band is restricted to the side that faces the lips in both the lower and upper incisors ( the lower side in the lowers and the upper side in the uppers ) . 
 The specimen MACN Pv @-@ RN 975 , first described by Kielan @-@ Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996 , may be a jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium , although it has also been identified as an unrelated multituberculate . The fossil preserves a bladelike premolar , identified as the fourth premolar , and the piece of the jawbone below it . A diastema ( gap ) is present between the premolar and the incisor that would have been located in front of it . The alveolus ( socket ) of the lower incisor extends all the way through the fossil . The p4 bears eight ridges on both sides of the longitudinal crest and is supported by two roots at the front and back . The p4 assigned to Argentodites also has eight ridges on both sides , which descend from cusps on the upper margin , and roots at the front and back . According to Kielan @-@ Jaworowska and colleagues , it differs from that of MACN Pv @-@ RN 975 in its rounded , as opposed to angular shape . However , Gurovich and Beck attribute this difference to the fact that the latter has undergone much more wear . 
 Two fossils have been interpreted as isolated lower premolars of Ferugliotherium ; however , neither is still regarded as such . Two other teeth have been identified as upper premolars of Ferugliotherium ; as with the jaw fragment , they may also represent an indeterminate multituberculate . One of the two preserves two longitudinal rows of cusps , of which one contains four and the other at least two cusps . The other is more poorly preserved , but may represent the same tooth position . These teeth resemble multituberculate upper premolars . 
 Four putative first lower molariforms ( mf1s ) of Ferugliotherium are known , and the only known tooth of Trapalcotherium is also thought to be an mf1 . Ferugliotherium mf1s are roughly rectangular , with rounded corners , and bear two longitudinal rows of cusps . There are four cusps in the lingual row ( on the side of the tongue ) and three in the labial row ( the side of the lips ) . The cusps are connected to cusps in the other row by transverse ridges and separated from cusps in their own rows by three transverse furrows . Two heavily worn Ferugliotherium mf1s were originally identified as upper molars of Vucetichia gracilis by Bonaparte in 1990 . One of the two preserves the roots ; at the front and back , there were two roots , fused at their bases . The mf1 of Trapalcotherium differs only in some details ; among others , the cusps are less distinct from the crests . The sole mf2 of Ferugliotherium is the holotype . It bears two rows of two cusps . The cusps in the front and back pairs are connected by a broad ridge and the two pairs are separated by a deep furrow . Transverse ridges between the cusps similar to those seen in ferugliotheriids are not known in any multituberculate . On the other hand , overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among Ferugliotherium , Gondwanatherium , and Sudamerica , indicating that the three are closely related . 
 One Ferugliotherium tooth is thought to be a first upper molariform ( MF1 ) . It is almost rectangular and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps . There are five cusps in the middle row , which is oriented obliquely , four cusps in one of the rows on the side of the tooth , and two or three in the other row on the side . As in the lower molariforms , the cusps are connected by transverse ridges and separated by furrows . LACM 149371 , the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru , is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps , which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae ( basins ) and a third shallower fossa . 
 = = Range , ecology , and evolution = = 
 With its low @-@ crowned teeth , Ferugliotherium may have been an insectivore or omnivore , like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma , which is thought to have eaten insects , other arthropods , seeds , and / or nuts . The wear on Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material . The high @-@ crowned sudamericids are thought to have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation , although their precise diet is not known . In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres , hypsodont teeth are thought to have evolved from brachydont precursors . Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium . 
 Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids come from the Los Alamitos ( Ferugliotherium ) , La Colonia ( Ferugliotherium and Argentodites ) , and Allen Formations ( Trapalcotherium ) . All three are approximately the same age , dating to the Campanian ( 84 – 71 mya ) or more likely the Maastrichtian ( 71 – 66 mya ) , but the La Colonia Formation is perhaps a little younger . The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments , and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations may have been an estuary , tidal flat , or coastal plain . 
 In each of the three formations , the mammalian fauna is dominated by the archaic group <unk> ; the Los Alamitos Formation has also produced the sudamericid Gondwanatherium . However , only seven mammalian teeth have been found in the Allen Formation . All three also contain remains of numerous other animals , including dinosaurs , amphibians , and fish . 
 The Santa Rosa fossil site , where LACM 149371 was found , is in the Ucayali Region of Peru . The Santa Rosa fauna also contains fossils of various unique species of marsupials and hystricognath rodents , a possible bat , and some <unk> ( a unique extinct group of South American ungulates ) . The age of this fauna is unclear , and estimates range from near the Eocene – Oligocene boundary ( ~ 35 mya ) to the late Oligocene ( ~ 25 mya ) . The Santa Rosa mammals may have lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers . 
 More recently , a specimen has been found in the Cerro del Pueblo Formation of Mexico , bearing several similarities to Ferugliotherium . If a ferugliotheriid , this would extend the clade 's range into the Maastrichtian of North America . 
 The range of the Ferugliotheriidae is overall narrower , both spatio and temporally , than that of Sudamericidae ; sudamericids have been recorded from the Late Cretaceous to Miocene of Argentina , the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar and India , the Middle Eocene of Antarctica , and perhaps the Cretaceous of Tanzania ( TNM 02067 , tentatively referred to Sudamericidae ) . Nevertheless , ferugliotheriids may be the only gondwanatheres to have had a presence in the northern hemisphere .

 In November 2009 , it was announced that actor James Franco would guest star on 30 Rock as himself , and would carry on a fake romance with Jenna Maroney ( Krakowski ) , in a scheme concocted by their respective agents . Two months earlier , series creator , executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey revealed Jenna 's plot to Entertainment Weekly , but did not divulged Franco 's name . In an April 2010 interview with Zap2it , Carlock revealed that " one of the things " the staff looked forward to in the fourth season was Jenna 's storyline here , and said her " emotional realization " that she wants more than a fake relationship with Franco was " a cool turn for that character after three years of thinking that all she wants is to have her picture in the paper and have her hair look good .

 = Sasuke Uchiha = 
 Sasuke Uchiha ( <unk> <unk> , Uchiha Sasuke ) is a fictional character from the manga and anime franchise Naruto , created by Masashi Kishimoto . Sasuke is one of the several surviving members of the Uchiha clan , an infamous and powerful extended family of ninjas who were allied to the village of Konohagakure , before being massacred by Sasuke 's older brother , Itachi Uchiha , before the series ' start . At the series ' beginning , Sasuke 's entire purpose for living is to avenge the destruction of his clan by killing his brother , causing him to become cold and uncaring towards human connection . As the series progresses , Sasuke becomes more empathetic towards his teammates , notably Naruto Uzumaki , whom he comes to consider a rival . Sasuke has appeared in several of the series ' featured movies , as well as other media , including several video games and OVAs . 
 Sasuke was conceived as a rival and foil to the series ' title character , Naruto Uzumaki . Sasuke 's design caused difficulties for Kishimoto as he drew the manga scenes , but he has grown to enjoy drawing him . In the animated adaptations from the manga Sasuke has been voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in the English dub . 
 Several anime and manga publications have provided acclaim and criticism of Sasuke 's character . While many reviewers have noted his cold and detached attitude and abilities , he has been viewed as a stereotypical " rival " in the mold of several similar characters in other shōnen manga . The character 's development has been praised with reviewers praising his rivalry with other appearing characters and the impact he makes in the plot overall . Moreover , Sasuke has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base , placing high in several popularity polls . Merchandise based on Sasuke has also been released , including action figures and plush dolls .

 Sasuke is the prodigious sole survivor of the once powerful Uchiha clan of Konoha . He witnessed the massacre of his entire clan at the hands of his brother , Itachi Uchiha , when he was seven years old , his life only being spared because his brother deemed him unworthy to kill . When first assigned to Team 7 , Sasuke is portrayed as antisocial and superior and is initially unwilling to cooperate with his team members , Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno , but eventually concedes they are useful . Sasuke awakens his Sharingan , the genetic ability of the Uchiha clan to see through Genjutsu , which allows him to see imperceptible movements and learn , prevent them via imitation at a super @-@ human rate . As time passes , Sasuke begins to seek stronger and stronger opponents in order to convince himself he is growing stronger . 
 During the Chunin exams , Team 7 encounters Konoha deserter Orochimaru , who infects Sasuke with a curse mark . When active , mark increases Sasuke 's physical abilities but makes him cruel and sadistic , as the mark contains a fragment of Orochimaru 's consciousness . Soon after , Kakashi teaches Sasuke his powerful Chidori technique to appease his desire for power . Sasuke is beaten by Gaara during the siege of Konoha , and is rescued by Naruto . Not long after , Itachi returns to the area and Sasuke attempts to kill him , only to be beaten and tortured . Sasuke decides he needs to leave Team 7 in order to become stronger . Believing Orochimaru 's tutelage will make him more powerful , Sasuke defects from Konoha and becomes an outlaw . Naruto follows him and the two fight . Sasuke wins , but leaves Naruto to live , and continues on to Orochimaru 's hideout . 
 After two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years of training , Sasuke attempts to kill a weakened Orochimaru before Orochimaru can possess Sasuke 's body . Orochimaru attempts to force the body switch , but Sasuke is able to reverse the process , absorbing Orochimaru . Believing he is strong enough to kill Itachi , Sasuke forms team " Hebi " , and tracks Itachi down . They fight , and Itachi appears to win but dies before he can deal the final blow , ostensibly from a preexisting illness . After the battle , Sasuke passes out and is collected by Tobi , who reveals that Itachi killed the Uchiha under the orders of Konohagakure command , and spared Sasuke out of love . Responding to Sasuke 's emotional turmoil , his Sharingan evolves into a Mangekyo Sharingan , giving Sasuke all of Itachi 's borderline invincible techniques . 
 Sasuke reunites with the members of Hebi , renaming them " Taka , " and declares his intention to destroy the Hidden Leaf in retribution , agreeing to temporarily work for Akatsuki . On Tobi 's orders , he attempts to capture the Eight @-@ Tails Jinchuriki , Killer Bee , who manages to escape . Sasuke and Taka then set out to kill one of the masterminds behind the Uchiha Massacre , Danzo Shimura , who was serving as acting Hokage . Sasuke confronts Danzo and kills him in combat . Moments after he finds Sakura , Kakashi , and Naruto , and Naruto challenges him to a final fight sometime in the future . Due to the often use of the <unk> <unk> Sasuke goes blind . Sasuke asks Tobi to transplant Itachi 's eyes which gave him his own eternal <unk> <unk> . 
 Following his recovery , Sasuke aids the reanimated Itachi in capturing Kabuto Yakushi who is controlling the reanimated soldiers aiding Tobi . Disillusioned by his brother 's resolve to protect the village , Sasuke decides to investigate more about his clan through the first four <unk> reanimated by the revived Orochimaru . After hearing the First Hokage 's story of the past of Madara , himself , the foundation of Konoha and what it means to be a shinobi , Sasuke , not wanting his brother 's sacrifice to be for nothing , makes his decision to protect his village and heads to the area of the battlefield . There , Team 7 reunites and fights both the Ten Tails and Obito Uchiha alongside Naruto and their allies . Upon suffering major wounds at the hands of Madara , Sasuke is saved by a reformed Kabuto . In his subconscious , Sasuke meets the Sage of the Six Paths , Hagoromo Otsutsuki . Sasuke inherits the Sage 's Rinnegan fused with Ten @-@ Tails ' power so he and Naruto can defeat Madara together while undoing the Infinite Tsukiyomi , only to end up facing Kaguya . However , it was only after Kaguya 's defeat that Sasuke explains his decision is to also start a revolution to destroy the status quo and create a new order from the chaos . After losing his left arm in their final battle , Sasuke eventually accepts defeat and reconciles with Naruto . After being healed by Sakura so he can help Naruto end the Infinite Tsukiyomi , Sasuke is pardoned for his crimes by Kakashi after he became the Sixth Hokage .

 However , Sasuke decides to travel the world to find his own redemption , telling Sakura not to follow him as he promises to return to her soon and shows signs that he reciprocates her feelings , parting ways with Naruto on amiable terms . Later , Sasuke returns to the village and marries Sakura , and they have a daughter named Sarada Uchiha . However , he continued with his traveling when Sarada was still an infant , leaving her in Sakura 's care , due to him discovering a new threat greater than Kaguya approaching . During the events of Naruto Gaiden , Sasuke meets Sarada for the first time in years while he and Naruto reunite against a former test subject of Orochimaru 's who wanted to revive the Akatsuki and avenge Itachi . After fighting Orochimaru 's test subjects , Sasuke shows his daughter how much he loves both her and her mother and promises to come home soon before he resumes his mission . 
 In Boruto : Naruto the Movie , Sasuke returns to Konoha to warn Naruto of an imminent threat , Momoshiki and Kinshiki . He reunites with his family and meets Naruto 's son , Boruto , who asks Sasuke to take him as his apprentice in order to surpass his father . Sasuke agrees to take Boruto under his wing on the condition that Boruto learns the Rasengan and prepares him for the Chunin Exams . When Momoshiki and Kinshiki attack the village during the exam with the intent to kidnap Naruto , Sasuke saves Sarada and protects her and Boruto as Naruto allowed himself to be taken to another dimension to protect them . Sasuke then allies with Boruto and the four other Kage to rescue Naruto before Boruto uses a giant Rasengan to destroy the enemy , effectively ending Sasuke 's mission and allowing him to return home . 
 = = = Appearances in other media = = = 
 Sasuke has made several appearances outside of the Naruto anime and manga . He appears in all four of the original video animations produced for the series , helping Naruto and Konohamaru Sarutobi to find a four leaf clover in the first original video animation , joining his team in escorting a ninja named Shibuki to his village and helping him fight the missing @-@ nin that stole the village 's " Hero 's Water " in the second , and participating in a tournament in the third and working with Team 7 in the fourth one . Sasuke also makes an appearance in the first two Naruto featured films , although he is only briefly present in a memory segment in the second . He also makes his first Part II appearance in a film in the second Naruto : Shippuden movie . In the sixth Naruto : Shippuden movie , an alternate reality version of Sasuke is introduced who is a flirting <unk> . Sasuke is also set to debut as the protagonist of a Naruto spin @-@ off manga named Sasuke Uchiha 's Sharingan Legend by Kenji Taira . 
 Sasuke is a common playable character in Naruto video games , including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series . In some games , it is possible to unlock and play as a version of him with the cursed seal active . Due to his lack of appearances in early Naruto Shippūden chapters and episodes , he does not appear in any games based on Naruto Shippuden until Gekitou Ninja Taisen EX 2 . In addition to games focusing on Naruto games exclusively , Sasuke has appeared in the crossover games such as Battle Stadium <unk> and J @-@ Stars Victory Vs . 
 = = Creation and conception = = 
 When developing the original Naruto manga , Masashi Kishimoto had not initially intended to create Sasuke . After speaking with his editor about the future of the series , he was advised to create a rival character for the series ' protagonist , Naruto Uzumaki , resulting in Sasuke 's creation . To learn more about creating an effective rivalry , Kishimoto read a variety of manga to gather ideas on what constituted such a rivalry , and he coalesced these ideal elements into one relationship . Because Sasuke is intended to be Naruto 's opposite , Kishimoto is always careful to make sure Sasuke is never too emotional . With Sasuke 's character being that of a " cool genius , " Kishimoto feels he has created the ideal rivalry . By the time Sasuke suffered a drastic change in the plot which made him become one of the series ' antagonists , Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to the yin and yang as a result of their notable differences . As a result , he mentions that whenever one of the two progresses , he makes sure the other does it too . In early 2014 , he referred to Sasuke as a " very pure person " when asked whether he was good or evil , adding that while some of his actions such as following his clan 's ideals are positive , he tends to bring problems to others due to his self @-@ centered nature . Since the series started serialization , Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters . 
 When first introducing Sasuke , Kishimoto had made a chapter which was set before the creation of Team 7 , and Naruto had just become a ninja . However , this idea was later cancelled and Sasuke was introduced alongside Team 7 , yet keeping the same traits and his rivalry with Naruto . Sasuke 's first name comes from the manga Sasuke by Sanpei <unk> , a series which Kishimoto likes , as well as from Sarutobi Sasuke , a fictional ninja featured in Japanese children 's stories . Kishimoto remarks that Sasuke 's character was influenced by Hiei from <unk> Hakusho , stating that he referenced Hiei when making his character and his Sharingan . 
 Sasuke 's design gave Kishimoto a number of problems , making him the most difficult character he had to create . Because he lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke 's face should look like , initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character the same age as Naruto . Once settling on a proper face , Kishimoto worked on Sasuke 's attire . Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs , a result of Kishimoto 's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible . Realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis , Kishimoto simplified the design to a basic contrast of Naruto 's costume . 
 For Kishimoto , Sasuke remains the most difficult character for him to draw . While drawing , errors and mishaps commonly result in Sasuke 's youthful appearance being lost , a result of Kishimoto 's inexperience in drawing characters mature beyond their years . Sasuke 's hair , originally kept short to save Kishimoto time , has slowly gotten longer as the series has progressed , increasing the amount of time needed to draw Sasuke . Midway through Part I of the series Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke that featured a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs . Because of the time needed to draw a costume of this design , Kishimoto returned Sasuke to his original costume . Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke , Sasuke has become his favorite character to draw . 
 When designing Sasuke in his Part II appearance , Kishimoto 's main objective was to make him look cool . For this , he tried giving him several outfits such as <unk> around him to preserve Orochimaru 's style of clothing as by the moment in the series he was his apprentice . He also tried other clothes such as a turtleneck and a military uniform to show " cleanliness " . However , he ended up choosing Japanese @-@ style clothes with a <unk> @-@ style sword .

 In every official Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity poll of the series , Sasuke has ranked within the top five characters . Though Sasuke 's rank initially alternated between the third and fourth spot , he has ranked first twice . Noriaki Sugiyama noted in the Behind the Scenes of Uchiha that he got emotional during sixth season of the Naruto Shippuden anime when Sasuke learned the truth about his brother 's role . In an interview , Yuri Lowenthal , who does the voice acting for Sasuke in the English dub , states that he is honored to be playing that role due to the large retinue of voice actors auditioning for the role , and also noted the stress associated with his job due to fans being highly critical of any deviation or mistake made while dubbing . He has also commented that his first impression of the character was that of " a serious guy dedicated to his training " , but he later appreciated the pain Sasuke suffered and where it came from . Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Sasuke 's likeness , including plush of his Part I and Part II appearance , key chains , and numerous figurines . NTT customers voted him as their fifth favorite black haired male anime character . 
 Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Sasuke 's character . GameSpot 's Joe <unk> extolled Sasuke 's abilities as " badass , " although echoing IGN 's comments concerning his personality . T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews noted that Sasuke fell into the stereotypical " rival " mold of several other shōnen manga , and found him , along with several of the other characters , to not be likable . On the other hand , Mania Entertainment 's Dani Moure praised the fact that Naruto and Sasuke are forced to work together despite their rivalry . The relation between both characters was liked by Moure due to the fact they always compete but the same time it was noted that " the group [ Naruto and Sasuke ] come together when they need to " . Although Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network found Sasuke 's fight in the Chunin Exams were " pure action " , he noted that Orochimaru 's influence over him kept the tension high . In another review , although Kimlinger commented that Sasuke was in need of development when he was escaping from Konoha , he criticized that it was not necessary to have long flashbacks about his life before his fight against Naruto . The following fight between the two characters has been noted to be one of the most entertaining from the series not only because of the tactics the two used , but also as how it helped to show their rivalry 's growth giving sentimental scenes to the fans . In the book New Media <unk> and Participatory Popular Culture Across Borders , Amy A. Zenger notes Sasuke and Sakura 's relationship to be popular within fan of the series even though the former does not reciprocate to the latter 's feelings . 
 Sasuke 's appearances in Part II from the Naruto manga have received major praise . This included Manga Life 's Park Cooper with the most remarked scenes from his review being Sasuke 's new abilities and his fight against Orochimaru which was noted to " change the nature of things " suddenly . His re @-@ introduction in the second story arc was found so important that the animated adaptation Naruto Shippuden started with a sneak peek to this scene . The character 's personality , while found not entirely different from the original series , was found to make his scenes interesting thanks to his calmer and angrier attitude as well as his conversation with the nine @-@ tailed demon fox which foreshadowed future events . Sasuke 's final fight against Itachi was commented by Casey Brienza from Anime News Network to be " epic " as how the latter 's death and revelations about his life made notable impact in the former 's personality and point of view . Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN listed Sasuke and Naruto as one of the " Anime 's Fiercest Frenemies " considering their similarities and how they turn into friends after a mortal battle . 
 = Tropical Storm Don ( 2011 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Don was the fourth named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season and the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in the United States during the 2011 season . Forming from an area of low pressure along a tropical wave , Don was operationally upgraded straight to tropical storm intensity on July 27 , after a reconnaissance aircraft noted the presence of tropical @-@ storm @-@ force winds . It tracked across the Gulf of Mexico and reached a peak intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) before moving ashore in Texas on July 30 as a tropical depression . Initially , Don was a possible catalyst for relief to the drought @-@ stricken state , but the system dissipated rapidly after making landfall , providing very little in the way of help to the state . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The genesis of Tropical Storm Don was from a tropical wave first identified off the west coast of Africa on July 16 . It tracked westward over the open Atlantic for several days , with minimal convection confined to the monsoon trough . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) first mentioned the potential for gradual tropical cyclogenesis on July 21 , when it was positioned about 750 mi ( 1200 km ) to the east of the Windward Islands . As the system moved through the Lesser Antilles on July 23 , it produced tropical @-@ storm @-@ force winds in Puerto Rico . The combination of vertical wind shear and the wave 's proximity to land impeded further development . Convection increased along the northern portion of the wave on July 24 , although by the following day the NHC expected no significant redevelopment . 
 Early on July 26 , the thunderstorms along the tropical wave became more concentrated to the south of Cuba , in association with a low @-@ pressure area . The system continued to organize , and by 0600 UTC on July 27 , the surface circulation became defined enough for it to be classified as a tropical depression about 60 mi ( 95 km ) northeast of Cancún , Mexico . Within twelve hours , the depression intensified into a tropical storm . Operationally , the system was not known to be a tropical cyclone until 2100 UTC on July 27 , after a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system confirmed the presence of a closed , albeit elongated , circulation center . At that point , the NHC classified it as Tropical Storm Don . Upon forming , the storm moved to the west @-@ northwest along the southern periphery of a low- to mid @-@ level ridge over the northern Gulf of Mexico . Due to generally favorable conditions , including warm waters and light to moderate wind shear , the NHC predicted steady intensification to winds of at least 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . However , none of the tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated much strengthening . 
 Initially , Don failed to intensify significantly due to a misalignment between the lower and mid @-@ level circulations . The wind shear in the region further exposed the circulation from the convection late on July 28 , although the winds increased slightly . Early on July 29 , Don attained peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) as reported by the Hurricane Hunters , and the storm maintained that intensity while moving across the Gulf of Mexico . As Don approached the Texas coast early on July 30 , the thunderstorms rapidly diminished due to the combination of wind shear , drier air , and cooler water temperatures just offshore . The winds decreased as the convection dissipated , and Don made landfall on Padre Island National Seashore as a tropical depression at 0230 UTC on July 30 . About three and a half hours later , Don degenerated into a remnant low , and the circulation dissipated six hours after that . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 The state civil protection agency in Quintana Roo warned that the tropical wave from which Don formed was capable of dropping 80 to 150 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) of rainfall over the state , while producing sustained winds of 35 to 45 km / h ( 22 to 28 mph ) and gusts up to 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . After Don was designated as a tropical storm , the Yucatán state government issued a green @-@ level alert . The alert indicated that although the tropical storm was located close to the state , it was only considered to be slightly dangerous . Late on July 27 , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass in Texas . Six hours later , the tropical storm watch was extended southwards to the international border . 
 After the storm was named , officials in Texas began making preparations for Don . The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston issued a level one alert for Don , and city officials began preparing for a possible evacuation . On July 27 , oil companies throughout the western Gulf of Mexico began removing non @-@ essential personnel from their rigs and platforms in preparation for Don . The next day , BP , Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko and Apache announced the evacuations of some of the oil facilities in the area , while Exxon @-@ Mobil began preparing the Baytown Refinery for a possible storm strike . Several oil companies stopped oil production as a result of Don ; by midday on July 28 , 6 @.@ 8 % of oil production and 2 @.@ 8 % of natural gas production in the Gulf had been shut in ahead of the storm . 
 Due to its abrupt weakening prior to landfall , Don produced minimal rainfall , with totals of less than 1 in ( 25 mm ) . However , Bay City , Texas , located well northeast of where the storm made landfall , reported 2 @.@ 56 in ( 65 mm ) . In southern Texas , the rains resulted in slippery roads and some ponding . Cotton farmers benefited from what rains that did fall as they harvested their crop . Winds during Don 's passage were minimal , with a peak wind gust of 41 mph ( 66 km / h ) at Waldron Field . In addition , Don moved ashore with a storm surge that peaked at about 1 @.@ 89 ft ( 0 @.@ 58 m ) at Bob Hall Pier . There were no reports of damage .

 " Give It Up to Me " was written by Shakira , Amanda Ghost , Lil Wayne , and Timbaland , and was produced by the latter . Timbaland , who produced " Give It Up to Me " , initially planned to include the song on his third studio album Shock Value II ( 2009 ) . He originally served as the featured vocalist , though his verse was replaced by Flo Rida , who himself was later substituted by Lil Wayne . Amanda Ghost , the president of Epic Records , noted that " everyone 's breath was blown away " when Lil Wayne expressed interest in appearing on the track . The last @-@ minute collaboration resulted in the delayed release of its parent album She Wolf in the United States . The decision resulted in the creation of a deluxe version of the album available exclusively in the country . 
 After the respective releases of " She Wolf " and " Did It Again " as the first and second singles from She Wolf , Shakira launched " Give It Up to Me " as the third single from the album . The track incorporates synthpop and hip hop influences with " hand claps " and a " pounding bass " .

 Upon its release , " Give It Up to Me " received generally favorable reviews from music critics . A reviewer from Billboard complimented the track for displaying Shakira 's " signature beat " and her " quirky yet sensual " vocals . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted her collaborations with Lil Wayne and Timbaland as an " increasingly cliché but not yet altogether ineffective move " , but identified the song as being among the " best moments " showcased on the project . Similarly , Mario Tarradell from The Dallas Morning News recognized the recording as an " insanely catchy , robotic corker " , elaborating that it and " She Wolf " were the most radio @-@ friendly songs on the album . However , an editor from The New York Times provided an underwhelming review of the track , suggesting it would disappoint customers who had listened to the previous recording " Loba " . In the United States , " Give It Up to Me " peaked at number twenty @-@ nine on the Billboard Hot 100 . It additionally reached number twenty @-@ three on the Pop Songs component chart .

 = Oba Chandler = 
 Oba Chandler ( October 11 , 1946 – November 15 , 2011 ) was an American man convicted and executed for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers and her two daughters , whose bodies were found , with their hands and feet bound , floating in Tampa Bay , Florida . Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive . The case became high @-@ profile in 1992 when local police posted enlargements of samples of a then unknown suspect 's handwriting , found on a pamphlet in the victims ' car , on billboards . Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting . This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S. ; billboards became useful tools in later searches for missing people . 
 Prior to his arrest , Chandler worked as an unlicensed aluminum @-@ siding contractor . He testified in his own defense , against the advice of his attorneys , saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions , but that he never saw them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities . Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders , but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested . Following his conviction , Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution , and , during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution , he was notable for not having had a single visitor . 
 Chandler was executed on November 15 , 2011 . He wrote a last statement to prison officials which said , " You are killing a [ sic ] innocent man today " . The statement was read at a post @-@ execution news conference . In February 2014 , DNA evidence identified Chandler as the murderer of Ivelisse Berrios @-@ <unk> , who was found dead in Coral Springs on November 27 , 1990 .

 Chandler was the fourth of five children born to Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson , and was raised in Cincinnati , Ohio . When he was 10 years old in June 1957 , his father hanged himself in the basement of the family 's apartment . Chandler reportedly jumped into his father 's open grave at the funeral as the gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt . Chandler fathered eight children , reportedly by seven women ; his youngest child was born in February 1989 . Between May and September 1991 ‍ — ‌ concurrent with the police investigation of the Rogers family triple murder ‍ — ‌ Chandler was an informant for the U.S. Customs Bureau 's Tampa office . 
 = = = Crimes and incidents = = = 
 When Chandler was 14 , he began stealing cars and was arrested 20 times as a juvenile . As an adult , he was charged with a variety of crimes , including possession of counterfeit money , loitering and prowling , burglary , kidnapping , and armed robbery . He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman 's window . In one incident , Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple 's home , held them at gunpoint , and robbed them . Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom , where he made her strip to her underwear , tied her up , and rubbed the barrel of his revolver across her stomach .

 On May 26 , 1989 , Joan " Jo " Rogers , 36 , and her daughters ‍ — ‌ Michelle , 17 , and Christe , 14 ‍ — ‌ left their family dairy farm in Willshire , Ohio , for a vacation in Florida . They had never before left their home state . Authorities believe that the women became lost on June 1 , during the return drive from Orlando to Willshire , and had decided to take an extra vacation day in Tampa . While looking for their hotel they encountered Chandler , who gave them directions , and offered to meet them again later to take them on a sunset cruise of Tampa Bay . The Rogers women had left Orlando around 9 : 00 a.m. and checked into the Days Inn on Route 60 at 12 : 30 p.m. Photographs , developed from a roll of film in a camera found in Rogers ' hotel room , showed Michelle sitting on the floor ; the last photo was a shot taken from the hotel balcony showing the sunset beginning over Tampa Bay , confirming the women were alive , and had not left their hotel room as the sunset began . They were last seen alive at the hotel restaurant around 7 : 30 p.m. It is believed they boarded Chandler 's boat by the dock on the Courtney Campbell Causeway ( part of Route 60 ) between 8 : 30 p.m. and 9 : 00 p.m. , and that they were dead by 3 a.m. Chandler may have used the fact that he was born in Ohio to lure them into feeling a connection to him . Chandler knew the women were not from Florida because he saw the Ohio license plates on their car . 
 The women 's bodies were found floating in Tampa Bay on June 4 , 1989 . The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat , crossing under the Sunshine Skyway , saw an object in the water . The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg , two miles north from the first . While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body , a call came in about a third , which was seen floating 200 yards to the east . All three female bodies were found face down , bound with a rope around the neck , and naked below the waist . 
 Autopsies showed all three women had water in their lungs , proving they had been thrown into the water while still alive . Michelle ‍ — ‌ identified as the second body found ‍ — ‌ had freed one hand from her bonds before she drowned . The partially dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault . Concrete blocks were tied around their necks to ensure they died from either suffocation or drowning , and that their bodies were never found . However , the bodies bloated as a result of decomposition , and floated to the surface . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The women were not positively identified until a week after their bodies ' discovery , by which time they had been reported missing in Ohio by husband and father , Hal Rogers . On June 8 , a housekeeper at the Days Inn said that the women 's room had not been disturbed , and the beds had not been slept in . The hotel manager contacted the police . Fingerprints found in the room were matched to the bodies ; final confirmation of their identification came from dental records . Marine researchers at the University of South Florida estimated from currents and patterns that the women were thrown from a boat ‍ — ‌ and not from a bridge or dry land ‍ — ‌ between two and five days before they were found . The Rogers car , a 1984 Oldsmobile Calais with Ohio license plates , was found at the boat dock by the Courtney Campbell Causeway . 
 = = = Facts and arrest = = = 
 The case remained unsolved for over three years , partly due to the volume of tips received by police investigators . The biggest tip was from a Madeira Beach police bulletin describing a similar rape of a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Canadian tourist some two weeks before the murders ( See below under " Witnesses " ) . Chandler was arrested for the murders on September 24 , 1992 . His handwritten directions on a brochure found in the Rogers ' vehicle , and a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure , were the primary clues that led to him being named a suspect . Local police posted images of Chandler 's handwriting on the brochure on billboards in the Tampa Bay area , leading to a call from a former neighbor who provided a copy of a work order that he had written . This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S. and billboards became useful tools in later searches for missing people . Through handwriting analysis , the two samples were matched conclusively . Another of Chandler 's neighbors , and one of the secretaries on the investigative task force , thought that Chandler resembled the composite sketch of the suspect in the seemingly related rape case . A palm print from the brochure was also matched to Chandler . He had sold his boat and left town with his family soon after the billboards appeared . In 1990 , when the television show Unsolved Mysteries was about to report on the deaths of the Rogers family , Chandler and his then @-@ wife moved from their home on Dalton Avenue in Tampa to Port Orange near Daytona Beach . 
 = = = Second suspect theory = = = 
 Investigators originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders of the Rogers women and this was reenacted in a 1990 episode of Unsolved Mysteries . This theory was dismissed when Chandler was arrested . No evidence of a second man ‍ — ‌ other than a former prison cellmate 's claim that Chandler said another man , whose identity the cellmate claimed to know but would not reveal ‍ — ‌ has ever surfaced . The second @-@ suspect theory was belied by Chandler 's approach of the two Canadian female tourists ‍ — ‌ that he was willing to approach more than one potential target by himself . 
 Hal Rogers 's brother John was also considered a suspect even though he was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer , at the time of the murders . Police , investigating the woman 's rape allegation , found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal 's daughter Michelle , although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify . The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents ' property near Tampa a month before the murders . However , as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer , did not have accomplices , and could not have known the timing of his sister @-@ in @-@ law 's and nieces ' trip , he was dismissed as a suspect . 
 Hal Rogers was also considered a suspect because he had posted bail for his brother , knowing he had abused Michelle . He later said that he had promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise . Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US $ 7 @,@ 000 from his bank at the time of the disappearance , which he was able to account for . He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths . Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period . The rape of Michelle Rogers , and gossip by local people , was one of the reasons for the Florida trip , so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident .

 = = = Chandler 's testimony = = = 
 At his trial in Clearwater , Florida , Chandler said that he met the Rogers women and gave them directions , but he never saw them again except in newspaper coverage and on billboards . He never told the authorities that he had seen the women again . He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that night ‍ — ‌ the police had evidence of three ship @-@ to @-@ shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murders ‍ — ‌ but Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone . He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start , which he attributed to a gas line leak . He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol , and had flagged down a patrol boat , but both were too busy to help . He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore . However , there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night , nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him . According to a boat mechanic , who testified for the prosecution , Chandler 's explanation of repairing the boat 's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boat ‍ — ‌ a Bayliner ‍ — ‌ were directed upward . A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat , and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak . Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor , Douglas Crow , Chandler then said he could not remember .

 A woman named Judy Blair testified that on May 15 , 1989 ‍ — ‌ two weeks prior to the Rogers murders ‍ — ‌ Chandler invited her onto his boat in nearby Madeira Beach for a boat trip on Tampa Bay , raped her , then returned her to shore . Blair had been with her friend Barbara Mottram , who refused Chandler 's offer to join them on the boat . After she was allegedly raped , Blair returned to her hotel room where Mottram was waiting . He was not charged or tried for this crime . Blair testified during Chandler 's murder trial to establish his pattern of attack and to show the similarities between the two crimes . Blair testified that on May 14 , Chandler gave his name as Dave Posner or Dave <unk> when the three first met at a convenience store in Tampa . He told Blair and Mottram he was in the aluminum siding contracting business , which subsequently helped lead investigators to him . It also inspired the name of the investigation to capture him : " Operation Tin Man " . The facial composite produced from Blair 's description was posted on the billboards along with the handwriting samples . 
 A former employee of Chandler 's testified that he bragged about dating three women on the bay that night , and that the next morning he arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again . In an attempt to establish Chandler 's whereabouts on the night of the murders , investigators found records of several ship @-@ to @-@ shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1 : 00 am and 5 : 00 am , which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife , and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders . Chandler 's daughter , Kristal May Sue , testified that her father had talked about killing three women , and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa . A maid , who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed , testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers ' room for room service . She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler 's arrest in 1992 ; the sighting has never been confirmed . Michelle 's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial . 
 = = = Sentence and aftermath = = = 
 Jo , Michelle and Christe Rogers were buried in their hometown on June 13 , 1989 , after a funeral service attended by about 300 family and friends . Numerous police officers were present to keep news media and TV crews out of the church during the service . 
 Chandler was found guilty of the murders , and was sentenced to death on November 4 , 1994 . He maintained his innocence , and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida 's Death Row . He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual , and that the victim changed her mind during the act . Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders , and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial , he was never prosecuted for Blair 's rape . 
 He served his sentence at the Union Correctional Institution . Shortly after the trial and conviction , his wife Debra filed for divorce and their marriage was formally dissolved a year later . Chandler was no longer allowed to see his daughter Whitney , and , in accordance with his ex @-@ wife 's wishes , he was not allowed to see later photographs of her . In July 2008 , Chandler was on Florida 's short list of executions . Profiling experts speculated that Chandler may have killed previously , based on the belief that a first @-@ time killer would not be experienced , or bold enough , to abduct and kill three women at once . Chandler remained a suspect in the 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island until 2011 , when the body was identified as 29 @-@ year @-@ old Amy Hurst and her husband was arrested and charged with her murder . Chandler was never charged with another murder . All of his appeals of his 1994 conviction were denied ; his last was in May 2007 . 
 After his conviction , Chandler was named by media as one of Florida 's most notorious criminals . He said that his last words before his execution would be : " Kiss my rosy red ass " . In May 2011 , comparisons were drawn between Chandler 's case and trial in 1994 , and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony . In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed . One of the jurors in Chandler 's 1994 trial , identified as <unk> Welton , said that : " He scared some of the jurors when he would sit there and stare at you and have that stupid grin on his face . He would make your skin crawl . " 
 The judge presiding over the 1994 trial and that ultimately sentenced Chandler , died of lung cancer in April 2016 at the age of 73 . In a 2011 interview the judge described Chandler as a man with no soul , and further commentated the trial , " It 's the worst case as far as factually , and as far as a defendant without saving grace , that I ever handled . And I represented plenty of people who were not necessarily good people . "

 On October 10 , 2011 ‍ — ‌ the day before Chandler 's 65th birthday ‍ — ‌ Florida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler 's death warrant . His execution was set for November 15 , 2011 , at 4 : 00 pm . His lawyer , <unk> Harrison , said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive . Harrison said : 
 He is not putting a lot of pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out . He is not going to make a scene . He 's not going to bemoan the legal system . What he has told me is this : if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed , he would like me to do what I reasonably can . 
 Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure , coronary artery disease , problems with his kidneys and arthritis . 
 On October 12 , 2011 , Harrison said that although he was preparing to file a motion regarding the violation of his client 's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights in the case , he was unsure that Chandler was willing to travel to Clearwater , Florida for the court hearing , or would agree to the filing of the motion . " He hates coming down to Clearwater . He doesn 't like the ride and he 's not well , " Harrison said . On October 18 , 2011 , Harrison filed a motion against the execution on the grounds that the way Florida imposes the death penalty is unconstitutional . A jury makes a recommendation on a life sentence or a death sentence , but under Florida law the judge makes the final decision . A hearing on Chandler 's motion was set for October 21 at 1 : 00 pm ; Chandler did not attend . On October 24 , Chandler 's appeal was rejected because he had already filed an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court prior to the decision . This appeal was heard in a court in Tallahassee at 9 : 00 am on November 9 , 2011 . The Florida Supreme Court had already upheld Chandler 's death sentence twice ; once in 1997 and again in 2003 . 
 On November 15 , Chandler chose a last meal consisting of two salami sandwiches on white bread , one peanut butter sandwich on white bread , and iced tea . The execution process started at 4 : 08 pm and at approximately 4 : 25 pm Chandler was pronounced dead after receiving a lethal injection at the Florida State Prison in Raiford . Chandler declined to make a last statement before being executed . Hal Rogers attended the execution . Former St. Petersburg homicide detective <unk> Leedy , who investigated the case , said in a press conference : " I 'm glad there 's finally an end to this . He doesn 't deserve to live , he needs to die . " 
 Chandler left a last statement with prison officials on a piece of paper , which was read aloud during a news conference after the execution . It said : " You are killing an innocent man today . " Shortly after signing Chandler 's death warrant Governor Rick Scott said : " [ Chandler ] killed three women , so I looked through different cases , and it made sense to do that one . There 's never one thing . It was the right case . " 
 Chandler 's daughter Valerie <unk> said in an interview after the execution that : " I believe they did execute an innocent man . I don 't think one person could have pulled off such a heinous crime . It would have to have been more than one person ... The forensic evidence was not there . The palm print would prove he did meet them and gave them directions , but it didn 't mean he killed them . I think the prosecution had a very weak case . " <unk> also said that she had sent a letter to Florida Governor Rick Scott asking him to commute Chandler 's sentence to life in prison . 
 Chandler 's son Jeff said : " I truly believe he was tried and convicted by the media long before he went to trial . The media can pretty much convict you . I don 't think he got a fair trial . " After his execution , Chandler was described as the " loneliest man in the loneliest place on earth , death row " ; he did not receive a single visitor during his years in Florida 's death row unit . 
 Another one of Chandler 's daughters , named " Suzette " , said her father was a monster who got what he deserved .

 On February 25 , 2014 , investigators revealed that DNA evidence identified Chandler as the murderer of Ivelisse Berrios @-@ <unk> , who was raped and strangled to death in Coral Springs on November 27 , 1990 . 
 The 20 @-@ year @-@ old newlywed was last seen at the Sawgrass Mills Mall where she worked at a sporting goods store . When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her car , a 1985 Ford Tempo , with the tires slashed . It is believed that Chandler , after scoping out the victim over a couple of days , slashed the tires and showed up in the guise of a good samaritan and offered to help . Three hours after she was reported missing , her body was found under a residential mailbox , in a local neighborhood , by two men returning from a fishing trip . 
 When found , Ivelisse 's body was nude , had ligature marks on both wrists and legs , and brown tape stuck to her hair . The case is considered solved and closed according to police . 
 Law enforcement agencies across Florida are looking into other unsolved homicides and other crimes in areas Chandler was known to have resided . At the time of the Berrios murder he and his family lived some two miles from the mall .

 The Discovery Channel devoted a one @-@ hour episode of its series Scene of the Crime titled " The Tin Man " to the murder of the Rogers family . In 1997 , a series of articles titled " Angels & Demons " written by Thomas French , which told the story of the murders , the capture and conviction of Chandler , and the impact of the crimes on the Rogers ' family and community in Ohio , was published in the newspaper St. Petersburg Times . The series won a 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing . The Rogers murders were featured in an episode of Unsolved Mysteries in 1990 , which speculated that there were two attackers . The 2000 book Bodies in the Bay , by Mason Ramsey , is a fictionalized adaptation of the Chandler case . Author Don Davis in 2007 published the book Death Cruise covering the murders . 
 The case was featured in a 1999 episode of Cold Case Files on A & E entitled " Bodies in the Bay , " which also focused on the evidence in the case . In 1995 , Oba Chandler , some members of his family , and Hal Rogers appeared in an episode of the Maury Povich Show featuring the case . Chandler appeared via satellite link . Chandler 's case was featured in a full @-@ hour episode of Crime Stories . The case was shown on an episode of Forensic Files entitled " Water <unk> " in December 2010 . In 2012 Investigation Discovery show On the Case with Paula Zahn aired two episodes called " Murder at Sunset " covering the case . In August 2014 , the ID series " Murder in Paradise " covered the case . 
 = University of Michigan = 
 The University of Michigan ( U @-@ M , UM , <unk> , or U of M ) , frequently referred to simply as Michigan , is a public research university in Ann Arbor , Michigan , United States . Founded in 1817 in Detroit as the <unk> , or University of <unk> , 20 years before the Michigan Territory became a state , the University of Michigan is the state 's oldest university . The university moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto 40 acres ( 16 ha ) of what is now known as Central Campus . Since its establishment in Ann Arbor , the university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 34 million gross square feet ( 781 acres or 3 @.@ 16 km ² ) spread out over a Central Campus and North Campus , has two satellite campuses in Flint and Dearborn , and a Center in Detroit . The University was a founding member of the Association of American Universities . 
 Considered one of the foremost research universities in the United States , the university has very high research activity and its comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities , social sciences , and STEM fields ( Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics ) as well as professional degrees in architecture , business , medicine , law , pharmacy , nursing , social work , public health , and dentistry . Michigan 's body of living alumni ( as of 2012 ) comprises more than 500 @,@ 000 . Besides academic life , Michigan 's athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the Wolverines . They are members of the Big Ten Conference . 
 = = History = = 
 The University of Michigan was established in Detroit on August 26 , 1817 as the <unk> , or University of <unk> , by the governor and judges of Michigan Territory . Judge Augustus B. Woodward specifically invited The Rev. John Monteith and Father Gabriel Richard , a Catholic priest , to establish the institution . Monteith became its first President and held seven of the professorships , and Richard was Vice President and held the other six professorships . Concurrently , Ann Arbor had set aside 40 acres ( 16 ha ) in the hopes of being selected as the state capital . But when Lansing was chosen as the state capital , the city offered the land for a university . What would become the university moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 thanks to Governor Stevens T. Mason . The original 40 acres ( 160 @,@ 000 m2 ) was the basis of the present Central Campus . The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841 , with six freshmen and a sophomore , taught by two professors . Eleven students graduated in the first commencement in 1845 . 
 By 1866 , enrollment increased to 1 @,@ 205 students , many of whom were Civil War veterans . Women were first admitted in 1870 . James Burrill Angell , who served as the university 's president from 1871 to 1909 , aggressively expanded U @-@ M 's curriculum to include professional studies in dentistry , architecture , engineering , government , and medicine . U @-@ M also became the first American university to use the seminar method of study . Among the early students in the School of Medicine was Jose Celso Barbosa , who in 1880 graduated as valedictorian and the first Puerto Rican to get a university degree in the United States . He returned to Puerto Rico to practice medicine and also served in high @-@ ranking posts in the government . 
 From 1900 to 1920 , the university constructed many new facilities , including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs , chemistry , natural sciences , Hill Auditorium , large hospital and library complexes , and two residence halls . In 1920 the university reorganized the College of Engineering and formed an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives . The university became a favored choice for bright Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s , when the Ivy League schools had quotas restricting the number of Jews to be admitted . Because of its high standards , U @-@ M gained the nickname " Harvard of the West . " During World War II , U @-@ M 's research supported military efforts , such as U.S. Navy projects in proximity fuzes , PT boats , and radar jamming . 
 After the war , enrollment expanded rapidly and by 1950 , it reached 21 @,@ 000 , of which more than one third ( or 7 @,@ 700 ) were veterans supported by the G.I. Bill . As the Cold War and the Space Race took hold , U @-@ M received numerous government grants for strategic research and helped to develop peacetime uses for nuclear energy . Much of that work , as well as research into alternative energy sources , is pursued via the Memorial Phoenix Project . 
 In the 1960 Presidential campaign , U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy <unk> referred to himself as " a graduate of the Michigan of the East , Harvard University " in his speech proposing the formation of the Peace Corps speaking to a crowd from the front steps of the Michigan Union . 
 Lyndon B. Johnson gave his speech outlining his Great Society program as the lead speaker during U @-@ M 's 1964 spring commencement ceremony . During the 1960s , the university campus was the site of numerous protests against the Vietnam War and university administration . On March 24 , 1965 , a group of U @-@ M faculty members and 3 @,@ 000 students held the nation 's first ever faculty @-@ led " teach @-@ in " to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia . In response to a series of sit @-@ ins in 1966 by Voice , the campus political party of Students for a Democratic Society , U @-@ M 's administration banned sit @-@ ins . In response , 1 @,@ 500 students participated in a one @-@ hour sit @-@ in inside the Administration Building , now known as the LSA Building . In April 1968 following on the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the University make public its 3 @-@ year @-@ old commitment as a federal contractor to Affirmative Action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students , faculty and staff . At that time there were no African American coaches , for instance , in the Intercollegiate Athletics Department . The occupation was ended by agreement after 7 hours . 
 Former U @-@ M student and noted architect Alden B. Dow designed the current Fleming Administration Building , which was completed in 1968 . The building 's plans were drawn in the early 1960s , before student activism prompted a concern for safety . But the Fleming Building 's fortress @-@ like narrow windows , all located above the first floor , and lack of exterior detail at ground level , led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot @-@ proof . Dow denied those rumors , claiming the small windows were designed to be energy efficient . 
 During the 1970s , severe budget constraints slowed the university 's physical development ; but in the 1980s , the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences . The university 's involvement in the anti @-@ missile Strategic Defense Initiative and investments in South Africa caused controversy on campus . During the 1980s and 1990s , the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus . In its 2011 annual financial report , the university announced that it had dedicated $ 497 million per year in each of the prior 10 years to renovate buildings and infrastructure around the campus . The university also emphasized the development of computer and information technology throughout the campus . 
 In the early 2000s , U @-@ M faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls . At the same time , the university attempted to maintain its high academic standing while keeping tuition costs affordable . There were disputes between U @-@ M 's administration and labor unions , notably with the Lecturers ' Employees Organization ( LEO ) and the Graduate Employees Organization ( GEO ) , the union representing graduate student employees . These conflicts led to a series of one @-@ day walkouts by the unions and their supporters . The university is engaged in a $ 2 @.@ 5 billion construction campaign . 
 In 2003 , two lawsuits involving U @-@ M 's affirmative action admissions policy reached the U.S. Supreme Court ( Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger ) . President George W. Bush publicly opposed the policy before the court issued a ruling . The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding . But , it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional . In the first case , the court upheld the Law School admissions policy , while in the second it ruled against the university 's undergraduate admissions policy . 
 The debate continued because in November 2006 , Michigan voters passed Proposal 2 , banning most affirmative action in university admissions . Under that law , race , gender , and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions . U @-@ M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the law soon after that referendum . This allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the initiative results . In April 2014 , the Supreme Court ruled in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action , upholding Proposal 2 under the U.S. Constitution . The admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors , such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school , and the level of education of the student 's parents . 
 On May 1 , 2014 , University of Michigan was named one of 55 higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights “ for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints . " President Barack Obama 's White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault was organized for such investigations . 
 The University of Michigan became more selective in the early 2010s . The acceptance rate declined from 50 @.@ 6 % in 2010 to 26 @.@ 2 % in 2015 . The rate of new freshman enrollment has been fairly stable since 2010 . 
 = = Campus = = 
 The Ann Arbor campus is divided into four main areas : the North , Central , Medical and South campuses . The physical infrastructure includes more than 500 major buildings , with a combined area of more than 34 million square feet or 781 acres ( 3 @.@ 16 km2 ) . The Central and South Campus areas are contiguous , while the North Campus area is separated from them , primarily by the Huron River . There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city , many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System . An East Medical Campus has recently been developed on Plymouth Road , with several university @-@ owned buildings for outpatient care , diagnostics and outpatient surgery . 
 In addition to the U @-@ M Golf Course on South Campus , the university operates a second golf course on Geddes Road called <unk> Farms Golf Course . The golf course is only open to faculty , staff and alumni . Another off @-@ campus facility is the Inglis House , which the university has owned since the 1950s . The Inglis House is a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 930 m2 ) mansion used to hold various social events , including meetings of the board of regents , and to host visiting dignitaries . The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near Briarwood Mall . Another major facility is the Matthaei Botanical Gardens , which is located on the eastern outskirts of Ann Arbor . 
 All four campus areas are connected by bus services , the majority of which connect the North and Central campuses . There is a shuttle service connecting the University Hospital , which lies between North and Central campuses , with other medical facilities throughout northeastern Ann Arbor . 
 = = = Central Campus = = = 
 Central Campus was the original location of U @-@ M when it moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 . It originally had a school and dormitory building ( where Mason Hall now stands ) and several houses for professors on forty acres of land bounded by North University Avenue , South University Avenue , East University Avenue , and State Street . The President 's House , located on South University Avenue , is the oldest building on campus as well as the only surviving building from the original forty acre campus . Because Ann Arbor and Central Campus developed simultaneously , there is no distinct boundary between the city and university , and some areas contain a mixture of private and university buildings . Residence halls located on Central Campus are split up into two groups : the Hill Neighborhood and Central Campus . 
 Central Campus is the location of the College of Literature , Science and the Arts , and is immediately adjacent to the medical campus . Most of the graduate and professional schools , including the Ross School of Business , the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy , the Law School and the School of Dentistry , are on Central Campus . Two prominent libraries , the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library and the Shapiro Undergraduate Library ( which are connected by a skywalk ) , are also on Central Campus , as well as museums housing collections in archaeology , anthropology , paleontology , zoology , dentistry and art . Ten of the buildings on Central Campus were designed by Detroit @-@ based architect Albert Kahn between 1904 and 1936 . The most notable of the Kahn @-@ designed buildings are the Burton Memorial Tower and nearby Hill Auditorium . 
 = = = North Campus = = = 
 North Campus is the most contiguous campus , built independently from the city on a large plot of farm land — approximately 800 acres ( 3 @.@ 2 km2 ) — that the university bought in 1952 . It is newer than Central Campus , and thus has more modern architecture , whereas most Central Campus buildings are classical or gothic in style . The architect Eero Saarinen , based in Birmingham , Michigan , created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s , including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building . North and Central Campuses each have unique bell towers that reflect the predominant architectural styles of their surroundings . Each of the bell towers houses a grand carillon . The North Campus tower is called Lurie Tower . The University of Michigan 's largest residence hall , <unk> Hall , is located on North Campus . 
 North Campus houses the College of Engineering , the School of Music , Theatre & Dance , the School of Art & Design , the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning , and an annex of the School of Information . The campus is served by the Duderstadt Center , which houses the Art , Architecture and Engineering Library . The Duderstadt Center also contains multiple computer labs , video editing studios , electronic music studios , an audio studio , a video studio , multimedia workspaces , and a 3D virtual reality room . Other libraries located on North Campus include the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and the Bentley Historical Library . 
 = = = South Campus = = = 
 South Campus is the site for the athletic programs , including major sports facilities such as Michigan Stadium , Crisler Center , and Yost Ice Arena . South Campus is also the site of the <unk> library storage facility , Revelli Hall , home of the Michigan Marching Band , the Institute for Continuing Legal Education , and the Student Theatre Arts Complex , which provides shop and rehearsal space for student theatre groups . The university 's departments of public safety and transportation services offices are located on South Campus . 
 U @-@ M 's golf course is located south of Michigan Stadium and Crisler Arena . It was designed in the late 1920s by Alister MacKenzie , the designer of Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta , Georgia ( home of The Masters Tournament ) . The course opened to the public in the spring of 1931 . The University of Michigan Golf Course was included in a listing of top holes designed by what Sports Illustrated calls " golf 's greatest course architect . " The U @-@ M Golf Course 's signature No. 6 hole — a 310 @-@ yard ( 280 m ) par 4 , which plays from an elevated tee to a two @-@ tiered , kidney @-@ shaped green protected by four bunkers — is the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five @-@ person panel that includes three @-@ time Masters champion Nick Faldo and golf course architect Tom Doak . The listing of " the best holes ever designed by Augusta National architect Alister MacKenzie " is featured in SI 's Golf Plus special edition previewing the Masters on April 4 , 2006 . 
 = = Organization and administration = = 
 The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor , with two regional campuses in Dearborn and Flint . The Board of Regents , which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18 , 1837 , consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections for overlapping eight @-@ year terms . Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850 , the Board of Regents ran the university directly ; although they were , by law , supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university , they never did . Instead a rotating roster of professors carried out the day @-@ to @-@ day administration duties . 
 The President of the University of Michigan is the principal executive officer of the university . The office was created by the Michigan Constitution of 1850 , which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings , but without a vote . Today , the president 's office is at the Ann Arbor campus , and the president has the privilege of living in the President 's House , the university 's oldest building located on Central Campus in Ann Arbor . Mark <unk> is the 14th and current president of the university and has served since July 2014 . 
 There are thirteen undergraduate schools and colleges . By enrollment , the three largest undergraduate units are the College of Literature , Science , and the Arts , the College of Engineering , and the Ross School of Business . At the graduate level , the Rackham Graduate School serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university . There are 18 graduate schools and colleges , the largest of which are the College of Literature , Science , and the Arts , the College of Engineering , the Law School , and the Ross School of Business . Professional degrees are conferred by the Schools of Public Health , Dentistry , Law , Medicine , and Pharmacy . The Medical School is partnered with the University of Michigan Health System , which comprises the university 's three hospitals , dozens of outpatient clinics , and many centers for medical care , research , and education . 
 = = = Endowment = = = 
 As of June 30 , 2015 , U @-@ M 's financial endowment ( the " University Endowment Fund " ) was valued at $ 10 @.@ 26 billion . The endowment is primarily used according to the donors ' wishes , which include the support of teaching and research . In mid @-@ 2000 , U @-@ M embarked on a massive fund @-@ raising campaign called " The Michigan Difference , " which aimed to raise $ 2 @.@ 5 billion , with $ 800 million designated for the permanent endowment . Slated to run through December 2008 , the university announced that the campaign had reached its target 19 months early in May 2007 . Ultimately , the campaign raised $ 3 @.@ 2 billion over 8 years . Over the course of the capital campaign , 191 additional professorships were endowed , bringing the university total to 471 as of 2009 . Like nearly all colleges and universities , U @-@ M suffered significant realized and unrealized losses in its endowment during the second half of 2008 . In February 2009 , a university spokesperson estimated losses of between 20 and 30 percent . 
 In November 2013 , the university launched the " Victors for Michigan " campaign , which with a $ 4 billion goal , is its largest fundraising campaign to date .
